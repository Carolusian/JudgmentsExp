Since, so theappellants maintain, the respondents' claims face inevitable defeat because of protracted and inexcusable delay. I will refer tothe three deceased persons as "Yang", "Chang" and "Tung" respectively and the respondent as the "China Company".</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The Statement of Claim details a sequence of events which at first sight indicates a marked reluctance on the part of the China Companyto approach the Courts of the Colony. It is set out in full in the judgment of Power, J. and what follows below is a precis of thefacts as alleged in it and in the affidavits filed, with indications of some omissions which seem to me to call for mention. Thesefacts I accept for the purposes of this appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The China Company is a corporation incorporated in the People's Republic of China. It was so incorporated some time before 1948.At an undisclosed date it became and still is entirely owned by the People's Republic of China. There is no information availableas to the businesses it carries or has carried on nor where, save. that it carried on a textile business in Hankow, Wuhan in Pupeiup to 18th May 1948, nor where its head of office is or was. Mr. Fan Tao Tsai who appears to reside at either 1A Des Voeux Central,Hong Kong or at Unit 6, No. 3, Block 20, San Li Ho, District 2, Beijung and also to have some connection with both Shanghai and ChungKingavers that he is its "principal representative". He is also the Deputy Director of Commerce in the People's Republic of China. Itwould appear that he is not an employee of the China Company nor one of its directors. The China Company is described in the writas "having a place of business at 1A Des Voeux Road, Central, Prince's Building, Ground floor, Hong Kong," but precisely what businessit carries on there is undisclosed. It began to use that premises as its office after 23rd October 1980. It would also appear thaton the 13th October 1956 it was carrying on business in Chungking.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> In May 1948 the China Company decided to transfer its textile business from Wuhan to Hong Kong and to that end sent Yang here fromShanghai in June 1948. At that time Mr. Fan was apparently the manager of Pao Yuen Tung Trading Co. Ltd. which is referred to inthe writ as "the plaintiffs' Hong Kong branch". Of this organisation we know little. Thus we do not know where it had its registeredoffice. It cannot have had its head office at Prince's Building at 1A Des Voeux Road. Central since Prince's Building was not thenbuilt. We do not know the nature of the business it carried on, nor whether it was ever "entirely owned by the People's Republicof China". It may, indeed, well be that the People's Republic of China did not acquire its interest in the plaintiff until afterthe winding up of the âHong Kong branch" which was contemplated on the 7th April 1950 but did not occur until 1957.  We do notknow. Apparently the Hong Kong branch had in 1950 "residual funds" premises at 153, Wing Lok Street, a staff dormitory at GloucesterRoad, Wanchai and land at Tsuen Wan. In paragraph 3(d) of the Statement of Claim Mr. Fan is described as its manager as at June 1948but in paragraph 6 Mr. Chow Shu Yuen is so described as at 28th May 1948.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> On Yang's arrival here he took steps to establish the 1st defendant ("the Hong Kong Company") in conjunction with one Hwang LiangChen who is described as "the general manager of plaintiffs' head office in the People's Republic of Chinaâ (we have no more preciseaddress) and Mr. Fan. The name of the Hong Kong Company was decided upon, its authorised capital of $5,000,000, that there shouldbe 21 shareholders-representatives of the China Company and 7 directors. In 1948 and 1949 Chang and Tung and 8 others were sent herefrom China to work with Yang and on 14th August 1948 the Hong Kong Company was incorporated here with a paid up capital of $3,500,000entirely contributed by the China Company part (the Tsuen Wan land and $100,000) which came from the Hong Kong branch. The Hong Kongbranch also resolved (in 1950) that the Wing Lok Street property and the staff dormitory be made available to the Hong Kong Company.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Yang, Chang and Tung had been employees of the China company since the early 1940s and on the Hong Kong Company's incorporation in1948 they became shareholders in it with Mr. Hwang Liang Chen, Mr. Fan Tao Tsai and 16 others, Hwang being allotted 4,000 shares;Fan 2,000 shares; Yang 2,000 shares and Tung and Chang 1,500 shares each. The other shareholders held parcels varying, between 4,000and 1,000 each. The shares had a nominal value of $100 each of which $70 was regarded as paid up but none of the shareholders hadpersonally paid any sum for them all having been contributed by the China Company. All 21 shareholders held the shares vested inthem as nominees and trustees of the China Company which was the beneficial owner of the entirety of the shareholding. When the HongKong Company was incorporated Hwang, Fan and Yang were together with four others, appointed its directors with Hwang as presidentof the Board, Yang as its manager, Chang as submanager and Tung assistant manger. Most, if not all, of the other 21 persons wereat all material times resident in China apparently in Chungking, Yang, Chang and Tung were left in defacto control here. It is implicitin the Statement of Claim that Hwang (the President of the Board of. Directors), and Fan (a director) did not concern themselves.with the affairs of the China Company except in minor capacities with which I will deal later although it would appear that bothwere managers of the Hong Kong branch.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> In the two years following its incorporation the Hong Kong Company failed to prosper. At the end of 1950 it had an accumulated lossof over $900,000 and in 1951 a loss of over $125,000. By the 31st December 1951 Yang was the only director in the Colony and whilethe affairs of the Hong Kong Company had, improved they were still critical. Although its affairs looked up in 1952 and thereafterit appears in the minutes of the ordinary general meeting held on the 31st December 1951 that a call had been made on shares duringthat year but no payment had been made. Apparently the call was irregularly made. The meeting of the 31st December 1951 concerned.itself with the election of new directors the old directors being deemed to have retired by virtue of Article 36 of its Articlesof Association; it was thought that 2 directors should be elected from the shareholders in Hong Kong and "the other three from theretiring directors in Chungking so as to give them a chance to come to Hong Kong and look after their interest" (sic). In the resultYang and Chang were elected directors with three others, Sung (who held 4,000 of the shares originally allotted), Cheng  (who held3,000) and Hsiao Yun Chang (who held 2,000). It would appear that these three gentlemen were then in Chungking.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On the 27th October 1952 a resolution to make a call on shares was passed. This read -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Requests having been made both verbally and in writing to the members since September 1950 to pay the $30 not yet paid up on eachshare held by them which requests have met with no response and Messrs. Lo &amp; Lo Solicitors having advised that such requestswere not calls validly made it is resolved that a call of $25.00 per share be hereby made on the members and that such call be madepayable on the 15th Day of November 1952 to the Company at its registered office Room 119, China Building, Queen's Road Central,Hong Kong."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">It is signed by Yang &amp; Chang.</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> It was followed on the 15th November 1952 by a resolution that notices requiring payment on the call by the 2nd December 1952 besent to the shareholders alleged to be in default.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> It has been suggested firstly that this call realised only $150,000 and secondly that having regard to the fact that by 1952 theHong Kong Company was prosperous it was unnecessary. How necessary it may have been is now unlikely ever to be ascertained becauseof the deaths before action brought of Yang, Chang and Tung who alone could speak of the needs of the Hong Kong Company in 1952.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Notices of the call and of the letters requiring payment under it must for the purposes of this application be regarded as havingbeen received by the shareholders in China, and through them by the China Company. By a resolution dated 22nd December 1952 the 1stdefendant forfeited the shares registered in the names of the shareholders who were in China relying on their failure to pay up thesecalls. The Hong Kong Company advertised the defaults in the Hong Kong press.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> No objection to this course of action was made by the Hong Kong branch of the China Company. Notification of it was sent to the shareholdersin China and must be regarded as having been received by them in the ordinary course of post. Certainly there is no suggestion tothe contrary in the Statement of Claim or the evidence. Therefore the 18 shareholders, among whom was Mr. Fan must have had noticethat they had been "wrongfully deprived" of the shares which they held as nominees and trustees of the China Company by the end of1952. A further fact allege, which again must be accepted for the purposes of this application since the China Company pleads it,is that Yang attempted "wrongfully to deprive the China Company of its control over the 1st defendant by <u>unilaterally and wrongfully</u> removing the plaintiffs' nominees from the 1st defendant's Board of Directors". <i>[</i>It may perhaps not be inappropriate to note, that to say that Yang was acting wrongfully and unilaterally is inconsistent with sayingthat he took that course for the benefit of the Hong Kong Company and indirectly for the benefit of the China Company.  If the actwas, as is pleaded, wrongful and unilateral, it amounted to a breach of the trust imposed on Yang by the China Company i.e. the dutyof safeguarding the interests of the Hong Kong Company for the benefit of the China Company. Safeguarding the interests of the HongKong Company, for the benefit of the China Company by pretending that the Hong Kong Company wa independent of the China Company whilein fact the connection was preserved would not have been "wrongful" or "unilateral".<i>]</i> He wrongfully, the pleading alleges and I must accept, asked them to resign in 1950 because they were working for the People's RepublicsHe, in 1950, wrongfully removed three of them, Mr. Fan included, without the consent of the China Company. He wrongfully removedthree on the 22nd. December 1952 and on 15th July 1953 replaced them with Tung Y. C. Hu and Ku Han San.  All these acts were bothwrongful and fraudulent and Chang and Tung participated with Yang in a conspiracy to accomplish them. Only Tung, Chang and Yang paidup on the calls. As a result the Hong Kong Company became in effect a family concern of Yang, Chang and Tung and the China Companywas wrongfully deprived of all its assets.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Notwithstanding hat the fact of the commission of these acts was communicated by post to the "principal representative" of the ChinaCompany, Mr. Fan, and the other China shareholders, no protest was, made. to Yang, Chang and Tung. In July 1953, 1,000 shares weretransferred to Hu Ying Choi and 1,000 to Ku Han Sun in consideration of HK$7,000 each. The shares transferred to Hu were stated tohave been held by him in trust for Yang. Mr Hu Ying Choi explains the reason behind this. transaction in, his affidavit of the 26thMay 1981 -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"7 (a) In the early 1950's I was told by Yang that by reason of U. S. A.'s hostile measures towards China including its embargo imposedon China during and after the Korean War, factries in HOng Kong which were thought to be related to and/or had dealings with thePeople's Republic of China encountered difficulties. in buy raw materials from, and in exporting their finished products to the U.S A.</p>            <p align="left" class="quote">(b) I remember that in about July 1953 Yang came to see me. He told me that the 1st defendant experienced difficulties arising outof the said hostile measures imposed on China including the embargo. He discussed with me the possible solutions to those difficulties.He told me that he had earlier in December the previous year reorganised the lst defendant and had advertised in newspapers aboutthe forfeiture of the shareholdings of the plaintiff's shareholders then residing in China.</p>            <p align="left" class="quote">(c) Yang requested me to subscribe, in my name but at Yang's expense, for 1,000 shares of the 1st defendant. He further requestedme to become director of the 1st defendant so that they might better deal with the then difficult situation. He thought that I, beingeducated in the U. S. A., a long resident in Hong Kong and purely a merchant, would be in a very goad position to help.</p>            <p align="left" class="quote">(d) Believing that Yang was acting in the interest of the 1st defendant, I agreed to his proposals."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>Otherwise the shareholdings remained constant thereafter for 15 years during which period the Hong Kong Company was run by Yang, Chang,Tung for the benefit of themselves and their families.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> I consider that I must take judicial notice of the fact that in the year 1951 and subsequent years certainly up to the year 1969the Bank of China was closely connected and concerned with affairs in Hong Kong in which the interests of the Government of the People'sRepublic of China were involved. This was a fact of notoriety. In December 1951 the Hong Kong Company was a customer of the Bankof China from which it had obtained a substantial overdraft and was in correspondence with it concerning this overdraft. In October1953 it repaid its overdraft and the Bank of Chin reassigned to it property subject to the mortgage. The validity of Madam Yang'scomment on affidavit that "Had the People's Republic of China been interested in any way in the 1st defendant one would have expectedthat its State Bank in Hong Kong would have taken steps to protect its rights and to refuse reassignment ........" may be lessenedby an explanation given by the Bank of China to Mr. Fan to the effect that because of the embargo imposed on the People's Republicof China by the United States (of which embargo I must also take judicial notice) textile factories here were anxious to avoid theappearance of connection with companies on the mainland. To this end Yang "could only draw a clear dividing line between" the ChinaCompany and the Hong Kong Company. He therefore changed his account to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Other factoriesdid the same thing. It was "an unavoidable method". (As I trust I have already made clear this explanation does not strengthen theplaintiffs' case. For that case is that throughout Yang, Chang and Tung were conspiring from 1952 onwards to get control of the HongKong Company for themselves rather than to overcome the U. s. embargo). No mention is made on the papers of any communication fromthe China Company to the Hong Kong Company or to Yang Chang and Tung between 1953 and on the 13th October 1956 a telegram was sentfrom Chungking reading-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"To Tsuen Wan Pao Hsing Cotton Mi11's Manager Yang Son Hui and through him to all staff members and workers. Have learned from newspaperthat our factory is in difficulties. How are things now? We are extremely concerned. This is a special telegram to send you our consolations.</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"> </p>            <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">Pao yuen Tung"</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>[It is to be noted that while in this telegram Yang is described as "Manager" simpliciter, and the factory is referred to as "ourfactory", no indication of indignation or protest at'the removal of 6 directors and the forfeiture of the shares of 18 shareholdersis made nor apparently is the China Company averse to acknowledging a connection with the Hong Kong Company.<i>]</i>No other assertion of interest in the Hong Kong Company by the China Company or its Hong Kong branch up to the time the latter waswound up is mentioned. The winding up was finally effected by a special resolution of 7th October 1957. A similar resolution hadbeen passed on 7th April 1950 at a meeting at which Yang was present. This does not appear to have been implemented. The failureto implement the resolution of the 7th April 1950 may have been an oversight as proprties bought before the Hong Kong Company wasincorporated and apparently intended for its use which were vested initially in the Hong Kong branch were transferred to the HongKong Company on or about 7th April 1950. However the Hong Kong branch: was sufficiently alive in 1957 to resolve upon its own voluntarywinding up. Up to 7th October 1957 therefore the Hong Kong branch must have been in a position to know of the activities of the HongKong Company and of Tung, Chang and Yang in its management. The representatives of the China Company including Mr. Fan who were inChina knew of their removal because they had been informed by letter. They knew or must be regarded as having known of the forfeitureof their shares. That was advertised in the Hong Kong press so that the Hong Kong branch must also have known of it.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> We know of no reply to the telegram of the 13th October 1956. We know of no complaint having been made by the China Company beforeor after that date as to n on-receipt of information regarding the financial standing or affairs of the Hong Hong Kong Company.  We know of no enquiries made by it or any of its representatives as to these matters and although those representatives must haveknown of the forfeiture of shares and removal of the directors there is to be found in the Statement of Claim or the affidavits filedon behalf of the China Company no indication of any claim prior to late 1980. It is contended in paragraph 22 of the Statement ofClaim read together with paragraph 20 that as a result of Yang, Chang and Tung's wrongful and fraudulent acts the Hong Kong Companybecame in effect a Family concern of Yang, Chang and Tung as from at the latest 15th July 1953.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> It is claimed in paragraph 26 of the Statement of Claim that the China Company discovered the matters complained of when the HongKong Company suddenly ceased business in September 1980 and the People's Republic of China despatched its "Deputy Director of Commerce"(Mr. Fan) to Hong Kong. This paragraph Mr. Alexander challenges as utterly untenable. The Court he suggests is driven to the irresistibleconclusion that "the matters complained of" must necessarily have been known to the China Company at or about the time they occurredso that a claim of limitation as regards the claims at Common law and of laches as regards the equitable claims must necessarilysucceed.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> From affidavits filed by the widows of Chang, Tung and Yang, it appears that Chang died on 13th February 1963 intestate and on 13thFebraury 1966 letters of administration were granted to Chou Hui Sun his widow and to the attorney og his son Chang Pei Yee. Estateduty was assessed and paid on the basis that he was beneficially entitled to 7,500 shares in the Hong Kong Company valued at $30.00per share or $225,000. The net total value of his estate for estate duty purposes was $292,370.33. These shares do not appear tohave been registered in the names of his administrators but were registered in the name of his widow in 1972. Tung died on the 15thNovember 1966 intestate and on 25th November 1971, letters of administration to his estate were granted to his widow Tung Yu ChengTong. No estate duty was payable on his estate but exemption from estate duty was granted on the basis that at the time of his deathhe was beneficially entitled to 7,500 shares in the Hong Kong Company valued at $28.13 per share or $210,975.00. His assets werevalued at $251,668.74 from which $214,259.21 was deducted leaving a net principal value of $37,409.53. His shares were transferredto Tung Yu Cheng Tong in 1974. Yang died in Hong Kong on 25th September 1977. We do not know if he died testate or intestate northe number of shares in the Hong Kong Company he held as at the date of his death.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The trial judge appears (see page 16 of his judgment) to have accepted all the Facts I have recited although he expresses them withgreater brevity. There has been no appeal against that acceptance and I must proceed on the basis that these facts are uncontestedalthough Mr. Wilmers Q. C. would have me regard the continued immobility of Mr. Fan and the other Chinese directors in a more favourablelight than the trial judge was prepared to do even making "every possible, sensible allowance in favour of the plaintiff as to thepossibilities as to what might emerge on issues of fact." The only explanations for that immobility that I can find in the papersis in paragraphs 24,26, 27 and 28 of Mr. Fan's affidavit of the 26th May 1981.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> In paragraph 24(a) and (b) he complains that a letter to Mr. Hwang was wrongly addressed. The answer to this complaint is that similar.letters were addressed to the other shareholders. He does not say that those sent to him were not received. He says that Yang waspresent at the meeting in 1950 when it was decided that the Hong Kong branch should be wound up but in fact the Hong Kong branchwas not wound up until 1957. In paragraph 26 he refers to the letter of the 23rd May 1981 from the Bank of China but does not claimthat he or any other representative of the China Company was cognisant in the 1950s or 1960s of the explanation that Yang had beenacting in the interests of the Hong Kong Company much less of the China Company when sundering connection with China. In paragraph.27 he suggests that there was no reason for the China Company "to believe that there was anything wrong with such management untilSeptember 1980". On the facts recited in the Statement of Claim there was every such reason. He and the other nominees of the ChinaCompany had been wrongfully deprived of their shares, of their directorships, of dividends, balance sheets and other accounts. Hedenies actual knowledge of any acts of breach of trust or fiduciary duties but this denial is one which I find it impossible to regardas consistent with the facts I have recited. He seeks to find comfort in the wording of the telegram of October 1956 but omits allreference to any reply to it. Nor does he seek to explain the inactivity of himself, his fellow ex-directors and ex-shareholdersin China and the China Company between 1956 and 1980. He suggests that the "political situation in China at the material times didnot permit of any effective intervention by the plaintiff" and gives examples of political movements since the early 1950s withoutdeigning to indicate why these movements, cataclysmic as each may have been while it lasted, should have prevented intervention fora period of almost 30 years. The gratitude of this territory over the years for the supply to it by the People's Republic of Chinaof water and our constant importation of goodsnot to mention the continuous arrival daily of legal immigrants and visitors in thelate 50s and early 60s and the continued maintenance here of large shops are all matters of history and render this contention completelyunsustainable. All this the trial judge fully realised. He clearly examined the possibilities closely. He found one possible explanationfor the protracted delay in that it might not have been apparent to the China Company that the behaviour of Yang, Chang and Tungwas wrongful until 1980.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> This was not the case put forward in the Statement of Claim. The only places in which I can find a vestige of such a case is in thetelegram, the Bank of China letter of 23rd May 1981 and the affidavit of Mr. Hu Ying Choi. The telegram and the absence of any furtherreference to it I have already mentioned; there is no suggestion anywhere that the China Company was given the explanation the Bankwas given and the absence of any such suggestion from Mr. Fu Ying Choi's affidavit is conspicuous as is any suggestion that he (Hu)asked Yang if he had explained to the China Company's shareholders that the forfeiture of their shareholdings was a fiction. Indeedthe contrary is suggested by his execution of the deed of trust in favour of Yang rather than in favour of the China Company.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> On the objective facts, as distinct from the claim put forward by the Statement of Claim and the bald suggestion by Mr. Fan thatdue to political movements the China Company was held incommunicado there are a number of possible explanations for the inactivityof the China Company in face of behaviour now claimed to have amounted to breaches of trust and torts of fraud and conspiracy. Thefirst is that which found favour with the trial judge as a viable possible defence. A second arises from the failure of the HongKong Company to succeed during its early years which may well have caused the China Company to lose interest in it and to be anxiousitself to sever connection since the shares were not fully paid up. A third arises from the fact that the China Company is now entirelyowned by the People's Republic of China. The Statement of Claim does not say that it was so owned at all material times.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> All of these explanations are in the nature of speculation and in view of the deaths of Yang, Chang and Tung now most unlikely ofsatisfactory resolution. None is put forward in the Statement of Claim or the affidavits filed.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> It is with the Statement of Claim that the application is concerned. The ultimate question for decision is whether it can succeedas framed, for no application for its amendment was ever made.

Other than on the very important question of when the respondent first became aware of the fraudulent natureof the conduct of which it complains, there is no dispute as to the factual basis on which the Court should proceed for the purposeof the present appeal. Apart from the one exception of the respondent's knowledge already referred to, it is common ground that facts,as pleaded in the Statement of Claim, are to be presumed correct at this stage, but they can also be supplemented by the common-senseinferences of further fact set out in the judgment of the Court below. An outline of the facts which I regard as relevant can brieflybe stated as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The respondent was and is a corporation situated in and owned by the People's Republic of China, its business being textile manufacturing.Yang Sen Hui (hereafter referred to as "Mr. Yang"), Chant Jye An ("Mr. Chant") and Tung Teh Mei ("Mr. Tung") all became employeesof the respondent in the People's Republic of China in the early 1940s. It is the estates of those three men which are the appellantsin the present proceedings, Mr. Yang having died in 1977, Mr. Chang in 1963 and Mr. Tung in 1966.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In May 1948 the respondent decided to transfer its textile business from a cottom mill in Hankow to Hong Kong. To help implementthat decision, Mr. Yang was sent by the respondent to Hong Kong in June 1948.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Mr. Yang was instrumental in incorporating Pao Hsing Cotton Mill Ltd. (hereafter referred to as "Pao Hsing") as a private companyin Hong Kong on 14th August 1948 with an authorised capital of $50,000,000 divided into 50,000 shares of a nominal value of $100each, but at first paid up as to only $70 each. All the capital was provided by the respondent. The shares were to be held by twenty-onerepresentatives of the respondent and there were to be seven directors.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Between 1948 and 1949 the respondent including Mr. Chang and Mr. Tung from China to Hong Kong to help with the running of Pao Hsing.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Upon incorporation of Pao Hsing in 1948, Mr. Yang, Mr. Chang and Mr. Tung were amongst the twenty-one representatives 6f the respondentwho became its nominee shareholders in Pao Hsing. The number of shares in Mr. Yang's name was two thousand and Mr. Chang and Mr.Tung had fifteen hundred each.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> At the time of Pao Hsing's incorporation, Mr. Yang was appointed one of its seven directors.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The respondent appointed Mr. Yang as manager of Pao Hsing, Mr. Chang as submanager and Mr. Tung as assistant manager.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In 1952, Mr. Yang, Mr. Chang and Mr. Tung, who were by then in de facto control of Pao Hsing, wrongfully and fraudulently took stepswhich resulted in the other eighteen shareholders suffering forfeiture of the whole forty-five thousand shares they held. This wasbrought about by Mr, Yang, Mr. Chang and Mr. Tung causing a call of $25 to be made on each share. Proper notices of the call includinga warning of forfeiture were sent to and received by those eighteen shareholders who were all residing in the People's Republic ofChina at the time.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> There was no protest from any of those eighteen shareholders who simply failed to pay the call. As warned, their shares were forfeitedat the end of 1952 and they were all duly sent notice of the forfeiture.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> By contrast, Mr. Yang, Mr. Chang and Mr. Tung paid their calls, so that after the forfeitures they became the sole shareholders inPao Hsing. In time, the capital of Pao Hsing was increased to 100,000 shares of $100 each. By the end of 1978, which is the latestdate pleaded, well over 90% of the shares were still in the names of the families of Mr. Yang, Mr. Chang or Mr. Tung or their familycompanies.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> During 1951 and 1952 Mr. Yang, who was in de facto control of Pao Hsing, wrongfully and fraudulently removed the other six directorswhich the respondent had appointed, although those directors never agreed to resign and the respondent never consented to their removal.By 1953 Mr. Yang had appointed his own nominees to the Board including Mr. Chang and Mr. Tung.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> From that time onwards, apart from an isolated instance of a moral( boosting telegram to Pao Hsing on the occasion of some industrialunrest in 1956, the respondent did not communicate with Pao Hsing or the appellants until November 1980 when a solicitor's letterbefore action was sent. That letter contended that the respondent was still the beneficial owner of all the shares in Pao Hsing.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Pao Hsing had suddenly ceased business in September 1980. Upon hearing of this, the People's Republic of China sent Mr. Fan Tao Tsai("Mr. Fan"), its Deputy Director of Commerce, to Hong Kong to investigate. This was by no means the beginning of Mr. Fan's associationwith Pao Hsing for way back in 1948, when he was the manager of a branch the respondent then had in Hong Kong, he had co-operatedwith Mr. Yang in incorporating Pao. Hsing, and had been one of its original shareholders and directors. After Mr. Fan's investigation,the solicitor's letter just referred to was sent to the appellants.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Further facts illustrative of the lack of contact between the respondent and Pao Hsing over a great number of years are the following-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="75%">            <tr>                <td width="8%" valign="top">(a)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top">                    after 1952 none of the ex-directors or ex-shareholders received any notices or information from Pao Hsing.                   <p> </p>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="8%" valign="top">(b)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top">                    neither the ex-shareholders nor the respondent have ever received any dividends.                    <p> </p>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="8%" valign="top">(c)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top">                    from 1948 till November 1980 the respondent made no claim to any beneficial interest in Pao Hsing. or its shares.                    <p> </p>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="8%" valign="top">(d)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top">Mr. Yang, Mr. Chang and Mr. Tung acted after 1952 consistently with being beneficial owners of the shares.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Another fact found by the learned judge was that each of the three deceased made Pao Hsing his life-work and died while still workingfor it. Although there was no explicit finding, on this in the Court below, I am prepared to accept as factually correct on a common-sensebasis that the three deceased made provision for their families after their deaths on the basis of having been beneficially entitledto their shars in Pao Hsing, and, in their turn, the deceaseds' families (including what Mr. Alexander described as "the second generation")have arranged their affairs on the basis that the interests in Pao Hsing transmitted to them through the deceased were ones to whichthe deceased had been, beneficially entitled.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> The effect of the pleadings was to my mind correctly summarised by the learned judge below when he stated at page 23 of his judgment,"that the allegations set out that in 1950, 1951 and 1952, Yang, Chang and Tung were acting wrongfully and fraudulently when theyforfeited the 45,000 shares and removed the 6 directors from the Board."</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> In his next sentence he summarises - again correctly in my opinion - a further effect of the pleadings which is that by their paragraph26 they allege that the respondent "only discovered those matters, that is the wrongful and fraudulent actions of Yang, Chang andTung, in September 1980 when Mr. Fan came to Hong Kong."</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> According to the submissions made on behalf of the respondent, the state of its knowledge is a fact like any other, and if it pleadsas a fact that it did not know something, the Court has to accept that assertion for interlocutory purposes. I agree with that contention.With nothing but affidavits to go on, the Court is in no position to resolve a dispute about the state of a party's knowledge.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> While swallowing the camel of the rest of the respondent's pleaded facts, the appellants baulk at the gnat of its claim to absenceof knowledge. As the appellants would have the Court read the pleadings, the respondent must be taken to have been fixed with knowledgeof the wrongfulness and fraudulence of the forfeiture of shares and the removal of directors at the time of such forfeiture and removalbetween 1950 and 1952. 1 consider that the learned judge adopted the correct, common-sense approach to interpreting the pleadingswhen he proceeded on the basis that nowhere do they pinpoint 1951/1952 as the time when the respondent became aware of the qualityof wrongfulness or fraud in the deceaseds' acts. Certainly, there is no explicit reference to the respondent having known of thewrongfulness or fraud at that time; nor do I think an implicit reference is reasonably justified. To male sense of the pleadingsone has to say "Yes, the respondent knew of the forfeiture and the removal when they were done way back in 1950/1952, but it didnot know of the wrongfulness and fraud till September 1980."</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Besides the respondent's assertion of absence of knowledge of fraud or wrongdoing in paragraph 26 of the Statement of Claim, thereis also paragraph 27 of Mr. Fan's affirmation of the 26th May 1981 to the same effect. He there states plainly in sub-paragraph (b)"The (respondent) did not have any actual knowledge of any acts or breach of trust and/or fiduciary duties committed by Yang, Changand Tuns. In this connection I respectfully refer the Honourable Court to paragraph 26 of the Statement of Claim herein."</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> I do not regard it as proper for such an assertion simply to be ridden rough shod over and ignored at this stage. (Perhaps I shouldadd at this point that I regarded Mr. Fan as a competent individual to make an affirmation on the respondent's behalf. In due courseI will touch upon why I rejected a submission made by Mr. Chang on the 2nd appellant's behalf that the content of Mr. Fan's affirmationshould be disregarded because Mr. Fan was not qualified under the Rules of the Supreme Court to make it.)</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> The appellants urge the Court to go behind the respondent's dis- avowal of knowledge, and ask how could it have been that the respondentwas in the state of ignorance it claims for itself. Perhaps in an appropriate case a Court might feel entitled to ignore a claimof ignorance, whether embodied in a Statement of Claim or in an affirmation, and simply say, "You must have known," but I would notfeel justified in doing that here. Albeit in a somewhat elliptical way, an explanation was forthcoming in the affidavit materialfiled on the respondent's behalf as to why it might have failed to realise that the forfeiture of shares and removal of directorswere wrongful and fraudulent at the time they were done. Exhibit FTT 41 to Mr. Fan's affirmation, being a communication from theBank of. China dated 23rd May 1981, and the affirmation dated 26th May 1981 of Mr. Hui YIng Choi (Mr. Hui), a director of Pao Hsingbetween 1953 and 1971, disclosed that in the early 1950's it started to be inexpedient for any Hong Kong textile com-pany to appearto have any connection with the People's Republic of China, if it wished to avoid falling foul of the trade embargo which the UnitedStates of America was practising at that time. In the context of the present case, a reasonable implication in that communicationfrom the Bank of China and in Mr. Hui's affirmation is that Mr. Yang caused the forfeiture of the shares and the removal of the directorsas a means of deceiving the United States of America, but there was no reason for the respondent to suppose that it was being deceivedtoo. On this basis, Yang, Chang and Tung were not undermining the interests of the respondent in Pao Hsing but were seeking to promotethem in the unusual circumstances then existing.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> No doubt, the respondent's position would be strengthened if it were spelt out explicitly somewhere that the respondent had believedthat in forfeiting the shares and removing the directors Mr. Yang, Mr. Chang and Mr. Tung were really acting in the respondent'sinterests, but I think, on a commonsense basis, there is a sufficient implication to that effect. The impression I gather from thecommunication of the Bank of China and from the affirmation of Mr. Hui is that both the Bank of China and Mr. Hui had presumed thatMr. Yang was acting in the respondent's interests. If the Bank and Mr. Hui thought that way, then it is not unreasonable to supposethat the respondent thought that way too.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> It was suggested on behalf of the appellants that belief on the respondent's part that Mr. Yang; Mr. Chang and Mr. Tung were actingin its best interests in 1950/1952 in forfeiting the shares and removing the directors was inconsistent with the rest of the respondent'scase but the supposed inconsistency eluded me.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Having arrived at the conclusion that the respondent's absence of actual knowledge of the wrongdoing and fraud of Mr. Yang, Mr. Changand Mr. Tung must be acepted as a given fact for the purpose of the striking out application does not entirely dispose of the topicof knowledge it still remains to consider at a later stage in this judgment whether, despite the absence of actual knowledge, itwould be significant if the respondent, ought to have had such knowledge.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> Reference has already been made to the actions to which the respondent contends the facts give rise, namely actions for breach oftrust or other fiduciary duties and actions for fraud, and conspiracy. Needless to say, the actions for breach of trust or otherfiduciary duties are equitable in their nature, while, the others are common law.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> In respect of the equitable table actions, the respondent seeks a range of different types of relief such as declareations that Mr.Yang, Mr. Chang and Mr. Tung stood in a fiduciary position to the respondent in respect of the affairs and assets of Pao Hsing, declarationsthat they had been trustees for the respondent of all the shares and property of Pao Hsing, an inquiry to trace into whose handsthe trust property had passed, an account and payment of all profits generated from the trust properties, and an order for the appellantsto hand over to the respondent all assets and money subject to the trust, whereas the common law claims are for damages.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> Delay is bound to defeat all of the respondent's claims according to the appellants, the equitable claims being sure to fail by virtueof the doctrine of laches, and the common law claims being caught by the combined provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26</a> of the limitation Ordinance, the relevant parts of which are as follows -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"4(1) The following actions shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued,that is to say-</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(a) actions founded on simple contract or on tort.</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="quote">26. Where, in the case of an action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by the Ordinance, either -</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(a) the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant or his agent or, of any person through whom he claims or his agent; or</p>                <p class="quote">(b) the right of action is concealed by the fraud of any such person.</p>                <p class="quote">(c) the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake,</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <ol type="a"></ol>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud or the mistake, as the case may be, orcould with reasonable diligence have discovered it."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> It was common ground that, if on the facts as they at present stand before the Court, the appellants clearly have got unanswerabledefences based on laches or the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, any cause of action which could be met in this way could not be regarded as reasonable and hence should be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> I do not think the words spoken by Lord Justice Megaw in 1980 in the unreported case of <u>Merlyn Albery - Speyer and Fidel Budden</u> v. <u>B. P. Oil Limited and Shell U. K. Limited</u>, cited by the learned judge below, can be improved upon as a statement of the principles to be applied by the courts in decidingwhether to strike out -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Where a court is driven to the conclusion that the action has no real chance of success, after making every possible, sensible allowancein favour of the plaintiff as to the possibilities of what might emerge on issues of fact or as to submissions of law at the hearingof the action, then it is the duty of the court to put an end to the action."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> A not dissimilar sentiment was expressed by Fletcher Moulton L. J. in <u>Goodson</u> v. <u>Grierson</u> <sup>(1)</sup> at 764 when, in refusing an application to strike out a statement of claim, he said -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"All that I say is that, seeing that this action has not reached the stage at which the court can assume that it knows the whole ofthe facts, it is impossible to say that the plaintiff must necessarily fail to show that his forbearance would, under the decidedcases, constitute a good consideration to support the account stated. Having come to that conclusion, it is obvious that this actionought not to be stopped at this stage. It ought to go on until all the facts can be laid before the court, and when the court hascognizance of, those facts it can then decided whether there is a proper cause of action."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> An adequate working definition of lathes is to be found in Spry's Equitable Remedies (2nd Edition) at page 247 -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Lathes is established when two conditions are fulfilled. In the first place, there must be unreasonable delay in the commencementor prosecution of proceedings; in the second place, in all the circumstances the consequences of delay must render the grant of reliefunreasonable or unjust."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> Delay, while being a necessary condition for laches, will not by itself be a sufficient codition; there must also be the additionalelement of injustice to the defendant in all the circumstances. I do not agree with the judge below when he accepted the propositionthat where there is delay of inordinate length, from that delay alone the Court will be in a position to infer that the claimanthas abandoned his claim or that because of the inevitable changes which must occur with the passage of years, the party against whomthe claim is being enforced must be gravely disadvantaged if called upon to present his side of the matter to a court. As a typeof reductio ad absurdum some of the older cases ask hypothetical questions along the lines of, "What about if the claimant waitstill a century has passed before commencing his action? How can it then be fair to allow his claim to go ahead?" I do not think thatsort of approach is helpful. What one has to do is to look at the particular circumstances of the actual case in hand rather thancontemplate hypothetical situations.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> As on the view I take of the facts there is no scope at this stage for saying that the respondent actually knew of the fraudulentbreach of trust or breach of the other fiduciary duties prior to September 1980, the only way in which the condition of unreasonabledelay necessary for laches can be satisfied is if it can be said that the respondent has fallen short of some duty imposed on itto have made itself aware at some earlier stage of the alleged misconduct of which it now complains. The learned judge below proceededon the basis that the standard expected of a plaintiff in relation to the discovery of the existence of equitable claims was in effectthe same as that laid down by the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> for the discovery of common law claims, namely reasonable diligence. On that, I consider the learned judge was being unduly favourableto the appellants. Unlike the position with regard to common law claims, it is strongly arguable that for equitable claims delaywill not begin to run against a claimant merely because it can be said that he had the means of discovering fraud. What is requiredis proof that his suspicions were aroused and that he chose not to enquire: <u>Betjemann</u> v. <u>Betjemann</u>. <sup>(2)</sup> Equity appears to take the view that it ill behoves those in whom trust has been reposed to turn around and say that their fraudulentmisconduct should have aroused suspicion at an earlier stage.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Whether the respondents suspicions were aroused at an earlier stage than it cares to admit is a topic which can only be exploredat the trial and does not admit of solution at this interlocutory stage.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> Even if I were wrong in accepting as a fact at this stage that the respondent neither knew, nor ought to have known of the allegedfraudulent breaches of trust, I still do not think the Court would be justified in saying that the defence of lathes is bound tosucceed.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> In the words of Lord Loreburn in <u>Lindsay Petroleum Co</u>. v. <u>Hurd</u> <sup>(3)</sup> laches becomes operative where it would be "practically unjust" to give the claimant a remedy. To reach a conclusion on what is "practicallyunjust" entails a carefully carried. out balancing exercise. For the purpose of carrying out such a balancing exercise, the Courtwill generally need to be in possession of as much information as it can get in as refined a form as possible. Only then will theCourt be able to gauge the relative weights to be attributed to the material going into the scales.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> The type of factors which the Court should take into account were correctly identified at pages 20 and 21 of the judgment under appeal.Perhaps there could be a case where even at the interlocutory stage the facts were all so clear and the justice of the case so obviousthat the only conceivable answer was lathes.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> I do not regard the present as such a clear and obvious case. Even making the assumption most favourable to the appellants, as Iam at the moment, that the respondent knew of its claim some 28 years before making it, I am still far from convinced that the appellantswill be guaranteed success in a Court of Equity. According to the respondents, Mr. Yang, Mr. Chang and Mr. Tung have fraudulentlyappropriated trust property. Conduct more unconscionable and less likely to find favour in the eyes of equity is difficult to imagine.Equity is far less likely to have qualms about dismantling a family fortune founded on fraud than one having an honest origin. (Toavoid any misunderstandings I hasten to add that I have no views one way or the other whether the deceased committed the wrongs ofwhich they are accused. To determine whether there is any merit in the allegations is the province of a trial judge).</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> Whether there are countervailing equities which would outweigh the fraudulent appropriations alleged is to my mind a matter for thetrial judge. The sort of factor which the trial judge will need to take into account is whether the persons in whose names Pao Hsing'sshares now stand were volunteers, whether they did anything to benefit Pao Hsing and so forth.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> Mr. Wilmers indicated that the respondent was not seeking its full pound of flesh. For example, it was not seeking the return ofany trust monies applied in the education of the deceased's children. In making a concession of that sort, the respondent was perhapsdoing little more than bowing to the inevitable. Equity can be extremely flexible in the degree of relief it affords, and need notgrant any relief A I regards as unfair. For example. Equity can limit the number of year for which an account is to be taken, therebylimiting its award to a return of trust capital plus only such income, if any, as it regards as fair. Some might be ordered to returncapital; but such an award against others might be deemed unfair.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> This flexiility of remedies ties in with the approach that equity needs to carry out a balancing exercise to come up with a fairresult which, depending on the circumstances, might be a total refusal, a total granting, or a partial granting of relief. Some ofthe individuals into whose hands trust property has come might be more deserving than others but which, if any of them, should bedispossessed, requires the performing of delicate weighing exercise by a judge apprised of all the facts.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> Much has been made of the prejudice to the .appellants due to the inability of the deceased to give their version of events. Maybeat the trial this will prove a crucial factor in favour of the appellants; maybe it will not. I would like to know a lot more aboutthe evidence available for this trial before determining the significance of the absence of the deceased to talk for themselves.I regard it as premature to attempt such an . evaluation at this stage. A blanket assertion about prejudice to the appellants onthis score is too general to be helpful in a weighing exercise.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> Whether there were political factors which inhibited the respondent from pursuing its claim and whether Mr. Yang, Mr. Chang and Mr.Tung were aware of this will also need to be weighed by the trial judge. This aspect of the respondents' case was adverted to bythe judge below under his item no. 6 of the circumstances to which the Court should look in determining laches. That item no. 6 was"whether or not the explanation which is put forward is such that some weight must be given to when it is balanced against the delayand prejudice occasioned the person being sued."</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> In paragraph 16 of the Statement of Claim the respondents complain of Mr, Yang, Mr. Chang and Mr. Tung having taken advantage ofthe political situation in the People's Republic of China in the 1950s to begin their breaches of trusts. Mr. Fan elaborated on thattheme in paragraph 28 of his affirmation of 26th May 1981. Just because a reason for delay happened to be political would not meanthat it need necessarily be excluded by the judge from his deliberations when performing his balancing exercise, in my opinion.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> Not very much needs be said about the common law claims. Flowing from my view that the respondent must be taken not to have discoveredits claims till September 1980, it follows that the respondent is to be treated as having commenced the present action within thesix year limitation period allowed under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> unless it is clear that the respondent could with reasonable diligence have discovered the alleged fraud outside the limitation periodie. prior to 1974 the present case. Proof of absence of diligence will be an easier threshold for the appellants to pass than theone embodying the degree of awareness required of a claimant in equity, but all the same I cannot be satisfied on the material beforethe Court at present that the appellants can be assured of defeating even the respondent's common law claims.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> Finally, a word can be said about Mr. Chang's submission to the effect that the respondent should not be allowed to proceed withits action unless and until it clarifies its status as a legal persona, and his further submission that no reliance should be placedon Mr. Fan's affirmations" on account of non-compliance with 0.41 r.1(4) which reads -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Every affidavit must be expressed in the first person and must state the place of residence of the deponent, and his occupation,or if he has none, his description, and if he is, or is employed by, a party to the cause or matter in which the affidavit is sworn,the affidavit must state that fact."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> It might well be that in due course the respondent will be required to elaborate on its status but I do not think it can be askedto at this stage. That would infringe the principle of a plaintiff not normally being liable to supply particulars before defence.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> Mr. Chang's complaint concerning Mr. Fan's affirmations is that Mr. Fan has not defined his relationship to the respondent with sufficientprecision, a circumstance which, according to Mr. Chang, makes it difficult for a court to know what weight to attach to the informationMr. Fan purports to supply. If ,I understood Mr. Chang aright, there is a contravention of O. 41 r. 1(4) in that the affirmationsdo not even spell out clearly whether or not Mr. Fan is supposed to be an employee of the respondent.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> Mr. Fan's description of himself in one of the affirmations as "Deputy Director of Commerce and the principal representative of theplaintiff herein" sufficiently describes Mr. Fan to satisfy the provisions of the rule in my view. Someone holding the position Mr.Fan describes sounds well qualified to speak for the respondent, a corporation owned by the People's Republic of China. As Mr. Fanfails to refer to himself as an employee of the respondent, I regard it as   reasonable to assume simply that he is not. I do notthink the rule requires of him the negative averment "I am not an employee of the respondent."</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> In view of the foregoing, I conclude that the learned judge below reached the correct conclusion and I would dismiss the appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(J.

(hereafter called "the company") received letters in identical and peremptoryterms requiring them to signify their agreement, by the 4th of the same month, to the demand of the plaintiffs, Pao Yuen Tung HsingYieh Co. Ltd., to hand over the entire shareholding, undertaking and assets of the company to them. Failing compliance an actionfor an injunction and appointment of a receiver was threatened.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> None of the personal representatives acceded to the plaintiffs' demand. The plaintiffs issued proceedings, since discontinued, onthe 13th of November. The action now in question was begun by writ dated 3rd February 1981. In it the plaintiffs, who are allegedto be and for present purposes must be accepted as being, a corporation situate in and entirely owned by the People's Republic ofChina, claim against the estates of the three deceased (hereinafter called "the defendants") wide-ranging relief including declarationsthat they hold the shares and assets of the company in trust. for the plaintiffs; all such accounts, inquiries and orders as maybe necessary to secure the transfer of legal ownership to the plaintiffs and damages for fraud, for breach of trust and for conspiracy.Some of the claims sound in law and others inequity. The company was also joined as a defendant. No point has been taken on behalfof any defendant that the proceedings are improperly constituted by reason of Rule 6A of the Rules of the Supreme Court (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap. 4</a>).If this action goes to trial it will involve substantial discovery, exhaustive inquiries and great expense.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> The matters relied upon by the plaintiffs to establish both the relationship of trustees and cestuis que trust as between the threedeceased and themselves and breaches of such trusts have been set out in the judgment of the Vice-President. They are alleged tohave taken place between May 1948 and July 1953. It is said that the three deceased wrongfully appropriated the whole shareholdingin and appointed themselves the only directors, of the company. No further or subsequent overt act is alleged during the 28 or soyears which have since elapsed albeit the three deceased are alleged wittingly to have continued to act in breach of their fiduciaryobligations until their respective deaths and the defendants unwittingly thereafter. Chang died in 1963, Tung in 1966 and Yang in1977.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> Not surprisingly the defendants moved to dismiss these proceedings in limine on the grounds that the action was bound to fail; asregards the legal claims by reason of the period. of limitation provided by the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap. 347</a>) and as regards the equitable claims by reason of the doctrine of lathes. The company sought to dismiss on the groundsthat the Statement of Claim disclosed no cause of action. The applications were heard by Power, J. on 5 days during late May andearly June 1981. On the 16th of June he gave his decision; declining to dismiss the proceedings as against the defendants but accedingto the application made on behalf of the company. The defendants now appeal to this court against that decision. There is no crossappeal in relation to the company which, accordingly, is no longer a party to the proceedings.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> In coming to his carefully considered decision the learned judge was exercising his discretion and the conclusion that we might haveexercised our discretion in a different way would not entitle us to interfere. If, on the other hand, we were satisfied that thelearned judge over-rated or under-rated particular factors or, indeed, was wrong, then this court not only might but should interfere.<u>Metropolitan Bank</u> v. <u>Pooley</u><sup>(1)</sup> ; <u>Attorney General of Lancaster</u> v. <u>L &amp; NW Rly Co.</u> <sup>(2)</sup> <u>Ward</u> v.<u>James</u> <sup>(3)</sup>; <u>McKay</u> v. <u>Essex Area Health Authority &amp; Anor</u> 'The Times' February 20 1982.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a> The applications to dismiss were made pursuant to R. S. C. Order 18 rule 19 and to the inherent jurisdiction of the court to preventabuse of its process. Affirmations were made and filed in support of and in opposition to the applications. It is axiomatic not onlythat the court accedes to such applications if and only if it is plain and obvious that the action cannot succeed but also that whatis revealed as plain and obvious after reading evidence and hearing argument and citation of authority need not have been obviousat first blush. If issues of fact arise it is wrong to attempt trial by affidavit and without the cross-examination of witnesses.The action must proceed to a full hearing, The question arose before us, however, as to the validity of the plaintiffs attitude insaying, and the submission was not couched in these exact words "Now you know in part, you see in a mirror darkly, but at a trialall may well be revealed, so to trial the action must go. We are not obliged to disclose all the facts on which we shall then relyat this interlocutory stage.â Such a submission was highly relevant in the context of a situation in which the defendants' affirmationsshowed that the overt acts pleaded in the Statement of Claim as wrongful and giving rise to the plaintiffs' claims would have beenknown to the plaintiffs more or less contemporaneously with their occurrence, while the Statement of Claim still allege in paragraph26, that these acts only became known to the plaintiffs after September 1980. This paragraph Mr. Fan Tao Tsai, the Deputy Directorof Commerce therein mentioned, adopted in paragraphs 3 and 27 (b) of his principal affirmation. It has not been pleaded by the plaintiffsin the alternative or by way of amendment nor did Mr. Fan suggest in any of his affirmations that the plaintiffs instigated, adopted,approved or accepted the overt acts or that the three deceased subsequently broke faith; thereby giving rise to rather fresher causesof action. No more is it pleaded or alleged in any affirmation that the plaintiffs accepted that the actions of the three deceasedwere taken in good faith and were only disabused of this belief in 1980. Nowhere is it alleged that the three deceased or any ofthem ever represented to the plaintiffs that all was well. What was contended before us was that Mr. Fan had meant to depose to discoveringfraud when he came to Hong Kong; fraud which, retrospectively, he attributed to the overt acts. His principal affirmation none theless stands uncorrected by either of his two subsequent affirmations.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> The learned judge himself advanced a hypothesis, perhaps anticipating and certainly adopted by, counsel representing the plaintiffsbefore him which might permit the plaintiffs to resist the pleas of limitation and laches if the action went to trial. In so doinghe relied upon a passage in the so far unreported judgment of the Court of Appeal in <u>Merlyn Alerty-Speyer &amp;</u> <u>another</u> v. <u>BP Oil Co. &amp; another</u>. Giving the ,judgment of the court on 2nd May 1980, Megaw L. J. said at pages 6-7 of the official transcript:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="left" class="quote">"Where a court is driven to the conclusion that the action has no real chance of success after making every possible sensible allowancein favour of the plaintiff as to the possibilities of what might emerge on issues of fact or as to submissions of law at the hearingof the action, it is the duty of the court to put an end to the action."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>The possibility relied upon by the learned judge was that the plaintiffs might have considered that the three deceased were actingin their interests in ostensibly severing links with China at a time when, during the Korean War and an American trade embargo, thecompany's prosperity depended on such an initiative and also that the plaintiffs might have considered it impolitic to make any inquiry.The plaintiffs, he implicitly suggested, were entitled to rely on the good faith of their trustees. As a proposition of law thisis absolutely right. <u>Betjemann</u> v. <u>Betjemann</u> <sup>(4)</sup> Further, the transfer to the company as late as 1951 of Tsuen Wan Land by Pao Yuen Tung Trading Co. Ltd., described in paragraph3(d) of the Statement of Claim as the plaintiffs' Kong Kong Branch,</p>    <p>and the text of a telegram sent by the plaintiffs to the company in October 1956, following a strike at its premises, which was translatedat our request, lends support to the hypothesis as regards those early years. The telegram reads:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="left" class="quote">"To Tsuen Wan Pao Hsing Cotton Mills Manager Yang Sen Hui and through him to all staff members and workers. Have. learned from newsaperthat our factory factory is in difficulties. How are things now? We are extremely concerned. This is a special telegram to send.you our consolations. Pao Yuen Tung."</p>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>It cannot be overlooked, however, that this telegram, any reply to which</p>    <p>                we have not seen, was relied upon by hr. Fan as showing that the plaintiffs were unaware of the overt acts. In anyevent, the question is posed: "For how long could the plaintiffs or the shareholders and directors whom allegedly they had appointed,receiving neither dividends nor any other communication, in contrast with the thousand or more documents alleged in paragraph 5 ofthe Statement of Claim to have passed between the plaintiffs and the company or its agents during, 1948 and 1949, have continuedwithout inquiry to regard their trust as well-placed?" It is difficult to accept so, broad an answer as that contained in paragraph23 of Mr. Fan's first affirmation to explain over 20 years of silence and inactivity. The paragraph reads:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="left" class="quote">"In any event the political situation in China at the material times did not permit any effective intervention by the plaintiff. Examplesof political movements since the early 1950's include the '3-Antis and 5-Antis Movements', the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolutionand its aftermath ending by the fall of the Gang of Four."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> During this long period the plaintiffs were able, on 7th October 1957, to wind-up their other company in Hong Kong mentioned above.Apparently a similar, abortive, resolution had been passed as long before as the 7th April 1950. From the particulars filed pursuantto the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>) it appears that three of its directors were still resident in Canton in the People's Republic of China on July 26, 1957.The plaintiffs were also able to learn of the strike in 1956 and</p>    <p>                of the strike in 1956 and of the company's cessation of business in 1980. I express no view as to whether the plaintiffswere aware that the company established a subsidiar in Taiwan in 1974.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> I regard the extracts from affirmation filed on behalf of" the plaintiffs to which I shall now refer and upon which the learned judgerelied as, at best, equivocal. In paragraph 26 of his first affirmation Mr. Fan identified a letter written to him by the Bank ofChina on the 23rd of May 1981. It reads:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Today you talked to us about the termination of business relationship between Pao Hsing Cotton Mill Ltd. and us on 20th October 1953.We replied as follows -</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">1. Our bank began to advance money to Pao Hsing Cotton Mill Ltd. because on 21st June 1948 and 3rd November Pao Yuen Tung Hsing YiehCo. Ltd. Head Office requested. us for a loan of $1,600,000 to be responsible for Pao Yuen Tung Head Office and its branch organisation;we began to support Pao Hsing Cotton Mill's request for loans in order to  support the production development of the said factory.</p>            <p class="quote">2.From 1950 to 1953 as a result of the United States of America's embargo on our country, the textile factories in Hong Kong whichwere related to China were discriminated, not allowed to buy American cotton, textile products not allowed to be exported to theUnited States of America, the Philippines and South Korea, etc. Because of that and during that period, Pao Hsing Cotton Mill's ManagerMr. Yang Sen Hui called on us and explained. the factory's difficulties to us, in order to deal with the difficult situation he couldonly draw a clear dividing line between Pao Yuen Tung Filing Yieh Co. Ltd.'s representatives; and request to terminate its businessrelationship with the Bank of China, changed to Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp. as its main banker; that was an unavoidablemethod, begged for understanding. Our bank appreciate the said factory's difficulties, agreed to Yang's request. At that time otherfactories in Hong Kong also did the same.</p>            <p class="quote">3. Our bank and Pao Hsing Cotton Mill Ltd., was business relationship: the said factory. fully repaid all loans, of course our Bankhas to return the title deed of the mortgaged land, that was normal procedure."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>There is no suggestion anywhere in the evidence that there was communication between the bank and the plaintiffs at the material times.In paragraph 7(d) of his supporting affirmation Mr. Hu Ying Choi says that in July 1953 he believed that what the deceased Yang haddone to sever links with China was in the interests of the company. He does not say he believed they were in the interests of theplaintiffs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> A defendant is entitled in the first instance to look to his opponent's Statement of Claim to ascertain the nature of the case hehas to meet. If he believes that he has a defence which is bound to succeed he can apply to dismiss. It is then open to the plaintiff,by argument or even amendment if the case comes within R. S. C. Order 18 rule 19(1)(a) and also by evidence if within Order 18 rule19(1)(b), (c) or (d) or the inherent jurisdiction, to show if and where he joins issue. If he elects not to do so and, as a result,it appears plain and obvious that the defendant must succeed he can hardly complain. It is not for the Court to speculate on possiblefactural answers not asserted by the plaintiffs themselves in pleading or evidence. In <u>Riches</u> v. <u>DPP</u><sup>(5)</sup> Stephenson, L. J. observed -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"On the other point I am willing to assume that a cause of action which is statute barred as clearly as the plaintiffs' cause of action,nonetheless may be a reasonable cause of action within R. S. C. Order 18 . rule 19(1)(a). I say that on the authority of <u>Dismore</u> v. <u>Milton</u><sup>(6)</sup> to which Davies, L. J. has . referred. But I agree with his comments upon that case. It seems to me that that case is in no way adecision that the court cannot strike out a claim which is statute barred on the ground that it is an abuse of the process of thecourt where it is clear from the terms of the summons what statute is going to be relied upon and where, as  here, counsel has toldthe court that he has. express instructions to rely upon the statute. Even in such a case there may be a possibility of a defendant(plain tiff?) bringing himself within one of the exceptions which avoid the statute and make it inapplicable. Again, however, thisis not such a case. There is no material put before the court which could suggest that the statute will not be a complete answerto the plaintiffs' claim. I think that it would be absurd for. the court, faced with an application such as this to strike out, underits inherent jurisdiction or under the rules, a claim as an abuse of the process of the court, to shut its eyes to, the fact thatthere is going to be raised an apparently unanswerable plea of the Limitation Act 1939. That was the view of this court in <u>Wenlock</u> v. <u>Shimwell</u> to which Davies, L. J. has referred, and was clearly the view of Lord Denning M. R. in <u>Hanratty</u> v. <u>Butler</u> in the passage which Davies L. J. has also cited. Why should not the court exercise its inherent jurisdiction to stay or to dismissan action which must fail?</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">In my judgment, justice requires that no further time or money should be wasted by either party on litigation whic can only end withthe failure of the plaintiff's claim, I therefore agree that, both in justice and in mercy we ought to put an end to :it now by dismissingthis appeal."</p>        </blockquote>        <p>On p 1024 appeared a passage to the same effect in the judgment of Davies L.J.-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">"If there is any room for an escape from the statute well and good; it can be shown."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> I see no reason in principle why these words should not apply as well to laches as to limitation. This does not mean that the burdenever shifts from the defendants to show that the action cannot succeed. When in <u>Merlyn Alerty-Speyer &amp; another</u> v. <u>BP Oil Co. &amp; another</u> (supra) Megaw L. J. referred to "the action" and "on issue of fact", he did so in the context of the Statement of Claim or its equivalent.Further, at p 8 of the official transcript, he said: "For the plaintiffs, it is rightly submitted that it is not for them at thisstage, in respect of an application of this nature, to produce the evidence which they will hope to have available and to use whenthe actions come on for trial, if they were allowed to proceed. But' and I regard the following words as significant "they have indicatedin outline the nature of the evidence which they would be minded to produce." As already observed this is in marked contract to theattitude of the present plaintiffs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> I now turn to the defendants' submissions. in rather more detail. As regards the legal claims they rely upon sections 4(1)(a) and26 of the limitation Ordinance. They read:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"4(1) The following actions shall not be brought after the expiration of six years from the date. on. which the cause of action accrued,that is to say -</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(a) actions founded on - tort.</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="quote">26. Where in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by this Ordinance, either -</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(a) the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant or his agent or of any person through whom he claims or his agent; or</p>            </blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(b) the right of action is concealed by the fraud of any such person; or</p>                <p class="quote">(c) the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake,</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud or the mistake as the case may be orcould with reasonable diligence, have discovered it."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> Making every possible sensible allowance in their favour there is nothing before this court to suggest that, exercising due diligence,the plaintiffs could not have discovered the fraud and conspiracy, alleged before, say, 1974. That the plaintiffs did indeed keepan eye on the. company is apparent from the facts already canvassed. Although, being a private company, it did not file accountsit did file Annual Returns and to these Mr. Fan has referred in his affirmations.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a> As regards the equitable claims the defendants make the same submissions by way of analogy; but the law is not so precise. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 36</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> provides only that "Nothing in this Ordinance shall affect any equitable jurisdiction to refuse relief on the ground of acquiescenceor otherwise."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p93" class="pseudopara" id="p93">93.</a> It is common ground that delay, even great defy, does not of itself bar a claim; that for present purposes the nature of the trustsallegedly affecting the three deceased is immaterial and that the whole circumstances must be considered. The most helpful guide,in my. view, is to be found in the speech of Lord Blackburin in <u>Erlanger</u> v. <u>New Sombrero Phosphate Co.</u> <sup>(7)</sup>-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">"In Lindsay <u>Petroleum</u> v. <u>Hurd</u>(1), it is said -' the doctrine of lathes in Courts of Equity is not an arbitrary or a technical doctrine. Where it would be practivcallyunjust to give a remedy, either because the party has, by his conduct done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to awaiver of it, or where, by his conduct and neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving. that remedy yet put the other party in a situationin which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of these cases lapse oftime and delay are most material. But in every case if an argument against relief, which otherwise would be just, is founded uponmere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar by any statute of limitations, the validity of that defence must be triedupon principles substantially equitable. Two circumstances always important in such cases are the length of the delay and the natureof the acts done during the interval, which might affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the onecourse or the other, so far as relates to the remedy.' I have looked in vain for any authority which gives a more distinct and. definiterule than this; and I think, from the nature of the inquiry, it must always be a question of more or less, depending on the degreeof diligence which might reasonably be required, and the degree of change which has occurred, whether the balance of  justice orinjustice is in favour of granting the remedy or withholding it, The determination of such a question must t largely depend on theturn of mind of those who have to decide, and must therefore be subject to uncertainty; but that, I think, is inherent in the natureof the inquiry."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p94" class="pseudopara" id="p94">94.</a> Put in summary form by Lord Radcliffe when giving the Opinion of the Judicial Committee in <u>Anachuna Nwakobi</u> v. <u>Nzekwu</u><sup>(8)</sup>. "Lathes is an equitable defence, and to maintain it and obtain relief a defendant must have an equity which on balance outweighsthe plaintiff's rights." Each case depends very much on its own facts.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p95" class="pseudopara" id="p95">95.</a> I find on the admitted or uncontested facts that the plaintiffs knew sufficient about the business of the company throughout to beaware at least that the beneficial rights which they allege might be n jeopardy. In consequence it was in my view, inequitable forthem to stand-by; demonstrating no interest at all in the company after October 1956.  Public policy requires that the processesof law should be responsive rather to those who are alert as to their rights than to the slothful or inattentive. In part of theeloquent speech of Lord Simon in the <u>Ampthill Peerage</u><sup>(9)</sup> he said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Parliament has passed statutes (the latest only last year) limiting the time within which actions at law must be brought. Truth maybe thus shut out; but society considers that truth may be bought at too high a price, that truth bought at such expense is the negationof justice. The great American judge Story J. delivering the judgment of the Suprem Court of the United States in <u>Bell</u> v. <u>Morrison</u><sup>(10)</sup>, called the first of these Acts of Limitation 'a statute of repose'; and in England Best, C. J. called it 'an act of peace' (<u>A'Court</u> v. <u>Cross</u><sup>(11)</sup>). The Courts of Equity, originally set up to make good deficiencies in the common law, worked out for themselves a parallel doctrine.It went by the technical name of lathes. Courts of Equity would give relief only to those who pursued their remedies with promptitude."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p96" class="pseudopara" id="p96">96.</a> The plaintiffs would be in no stronger position were they to assert at trial that they had elected not to question the facts knownto them or to make any move until it suited their convenience. "Ignorance which is the result of deliberate choice is no groundsfor equitable relief; nor is it an answer to an equitable defence based on lathes and acquiescence." per Lindley L. J. in <u>Allcard</u> v. <u>Skinner</u><sup>(12)</sup>. Neither in their pleading nor in any of the evidence that they have seen fit to put before this Court have the plaintiffs allegedfacts which, if proved at trial, would suffice to defeat the strong plea of laches advanced.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a> There are further material considerations to be taken into account. On the basis of the allegations in the Statement of Claim, whichare to be accepted as correct for present purposes and which are probably now uncontestable due to the deaths of the three deceased,there was never any merit in the position of such deceased. The good faith of the respective widows and families, who in greateror lesser degree have been the legal owners of the shares since 1963, has not  been challenged before us. This is one of the considerationswhich distinguished this case from <u>Betjemann</u> v. <u>Betjemarn</u> (supra), But in accepting the bad faith of the three deceased for present purposes we may, in fact, be doing grave injustice to theirmemories in circumstances where a fair trial cannot take place in the absence of such witnesses. The words of Lord Campbell LC in<u>Bright</u> v. <u>Legerton</u> <sup>(13)</sup> are apt -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">"It has been beautifully remarked with respect to the emblem of Time, who is depicted as carrying a scythe and an hour-glass, thatwhile with the one he cuts down the evidence which might protect innocence, with the other he metes out the period when innocencecan no longer be assailed."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>To like effect the Earl of Halsbury LC observed in <u>Watt</u> v. <u>Assets Co.</u> <sup>(14)</sup>:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"(a) At this distance of time I shall make ever intendment in favour of that having been honestly done which purported to be done.I think I should expect some evidence to be produced contradicting that state of things rather than insist oh evidence in its supportat this distance of time, and with. the loss of evidence that undoubtedly has occurred from the delay that has taken place. .I shouldbe content to rest my judgment on the language of the Lord Ordinary himself in which, on both occasions, he has pointed out, I thinkwith great force and accuracy, the result that ought to follow from the absence of evidence which has been the feult of those whoare the pursuers here - that is to say, they have lain by upon their supposed rights all this time, during which time withesses havedied and the means of explanation have disappeared. also to an extent which, to my mind, renders it impossible, or at all evoideneeextremely inexpedient as a matter of law and administration, to allow these things to be ripped up at this distance of time, whenboth the opportunities of explaintion have gone by and when witnesses have passed away."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p98" class="pseudopara" id="p98">98.</a> Again making evety sensible allowance and despite the fact that the industry of counsel has failed to unearth a reported instancein which a claim has been dismissed at this stage on the ground of laches I do not believe we are bound to accede to the submissionthat the action should be allowed to go to trial in case the image in the glass should then become distinct to the plaintiffs' advantage.1 consider it plain and obvious that the plaintiffs' tardiness has barred their claim to equitable as well as to legal relief andthat we are entitled to and should interfere.
