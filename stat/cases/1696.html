The debt in the petition is a judgment debt in High Court Action No. 1886 of 2001 ("theHigh Court Action") in the sum of HK$3,671,250.00 and mesne profits at HK$226,000.00 per month from 1 May 2001 to the date of deliveryup of vacant possession of the property known as Yau Tong Marine Lots Nos. 2, 3 and 4 situate at No. 44 Ko Fai Road, Yau Tong Bay,Kowloon ("the Property"). The judgment was entered on 11 December 2001, upon Dockyard's failure to comply with the condition uponwhich leave was granted to Dockyard to defend by an order of a Master on 5 November 2001, on the basis of payment into court of allclaimed arrears of rent and further rent or mesne profits at the rate of HK$226,000.00 per month until trial. Dockyard appealed againstthe order of the Master and the appeal was dismissed by Deputy Judge To in a decision handed down on 25 January 2002. The petitionherein was presented on 21 June 2002.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Dockyard seeks dismissal of the petition, alternatively, an order for the stay or adjournment of the petition. The main ground ofopposition relied upon is that the judgment in the High Court Action would fall within a scheme of arrangement between the Companyand its creditors ("the Scheme") which was sanctioned by the court pursuant to an order made on 18 April 2000, by which the courtsanctioned the schemes of arrangement (collectively "the Schemes") relating to UDL Holdings Limited ("Holdings") and 24 of its subsidiaries,including Dockyard (see <strong>Re UDL Holdings Ltd (No. 3)</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%203%20HKC%20405" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 3 HKC 405).</a> The Schemes are in identical terms and form part of a global scheme and the terms are embodied in a composite scheme document. Theycame into effect on 28 April 2000 ("the Effective Date"). It is contended that by virtue of the provisions in the Scheme, the executionof and further proceedings on the judgment, including the winding up proceedings against Dockyard, should be stayed as the Schemeoperates as a bar to all proceedings in respect of the claims of creditors, save for pending arbitrations.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> I will first give the background matters leading to the petition.</p>    <p class="heading">The background</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Fonfair is the registered owner of the Property. Dockyard had occupied the Property for over 40 years. The Property was originallyacquired by Mr Leung Man Kwong, who was the father of Mr Leung Yuet Keung ("YK Leung") and Mr Leung Yat Tung ("YT Leung"). When MrLeung Man Kwong passed away, his personal representatives assigned the Property to Fonfair in 1980. Fonfair used to be a subsidiaryof Dockyard until 1991.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> When Holdings became a public company in 1991, Fonfair was spun off from Dockyard, in order that the Property should remain in theprivate hands of the Leung family. The Property was occupied by the companies in the UDL Group and was used as a shipyard and office.Dockyard remained as the tenant of the Property under successive tenancy agreements with Fonfair. On 10 September 1999, Fonfair enteredinto a tenancy agreement with Dockyard for a term of one year, which was to expire on 31 August 2000 with an option to renew forone year, and the rental payable was HK$226,000.00 a month. There is no dispute that since 1 December 1999, Dockyard had not paidrent to Fonfair but continued to occupy the Property, until vacant possession was recovered in late 2002 after the execution of awrit of possession in June 2002. The sum of HK$3,671,250.00 being part of the judgment sum in the High Court Action was rent forthe period from 1 January 2000 to 25 April 2001 at the rate of HK$226,000.00 per month. With mesne profits at the same rate fromMay 2001 up to the delivery of vacant possession in mid December 2002, the total judgment debt with interest calculated up to thehearing of this petition is in the region of HK$8.5 million.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> It is necessary to point out that as a result of the re-organisation of Fonfair in 1991, 32.96 % of its shares were and are heldby Harbour Front Limited ("Harbour Front"), which is a trustee company of a discretionary trust set up by YT Leung, the former chairmanof Holdings, for the benefit of his wife and children. 65.79% of the shares in Fonfair were and are held by Money Facts Limited ("MoneyFacts"), and Money Facts was and is owned by Harbour Front as to 50% and YK Leung as to the balance. Owing to disputes between YTLeung and YK Leung, Harbour Front has presented a petition to wind up Fonfair on the just and equitable ground in HCCW No. 246 of2002 and a similar petition to wind up Money Facts in HCCW No. 880 of 2001. These two petitions have not been heard and one of thegrounds of opposition advanced by Dockyard before me is that this petition should be stayed or adjourned until the determinationof the petitions to wind up Fonfair and Money Facts as these petitions, if successful, would have the effect of "changing the managementof [Fonfair] and thereby its stance as regards ... the present proceedings".</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Until YT Leung was made bankrupt on 1 March 2001, he was a director of Fonfair and had control over its affairs, as found by DeputyJudge To in paragraph 16 of his decision, as well as control over the management of the companies in the UDL Group, including Dockyard.It was also found by the Deputy Judge in paragraph 13 of his decision that for the period up to December 1999, almost all the rentalincome received by Fonfair from Dockyard was "misappropriated" by YT Leung into the account of YT Leung Trading Company Limited ("YTLTrading"), a company controlled by YT Leung. There was deadlock in the management of Fonfair until after YT Leung had lost his seaton the board of directors of Fonfair as a result of being made bankrupt. Thus, notwithstanding that it was stipulated in clause 1of the third schedule to the tenancy agreement made on 10 September 1999 that if Dockyard shall enter into an arrangement or compositionfor the benefit of its creditors, it shall be lawful for Fonfair to exercise its right of re-entry, Fonfair did not exercise thatright when the Scheme was sanctioned by the court in April 2000. It was only in June 2001 that the writ in the High Court Actionwas issued, claiming possession of the Property and arrears of rent.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The lines of defence raised by Dockyard before the Deputy Judge, which were all rejected by him, were as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) it was alleged that a new tenancy agreement was entered into between Fonfair and Dockyard on 31 August 2000 for a term of twoyears commencing 1 September 2000 at a reduced rental of HK$150,000.00 per month;</p>        <p>(2) the rent due under the alleged tenancy agreement in August 2000 had been paid in full by way of set off against a debt of HK$6,350,695.14allegedly owed by Fonfair to YTL Trading, which had assigned the debt to Dockyard in August 2000; and</p>        <p>(3) Fonfair was not authorised to bring the High Court Action.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> These defences, founded upon allegations of fact advanced on behalf of Dockyard, were rejected by the Deputy Judge in no uncertainterms. He found there was a "lack of credence" in the defence of new tenancy and came to the view that the document was a "recentcreation" and an "afterthought". He concluded that "not only that the defence of new tenancy agreement is blatantly incredible inthe light of the circumstances, it has no merit at all". The defence of assignment and set-off fared no better, notwithstanding Dockyardhad produced a series of documentation in support. The Deputy Judge found that this defence was "another recent creation", that itwas "unbelievable and could not be genuine", and was bound to fail as the alleged assignment and set-off would be in violation ofthe terms of a shareholders' agreement dated 5 June 1990 between YK Leung and YT Leung and, if brought into effect, would be a misappropriationof the rental proceeds. It was also held that the resolution passed by the board of directors of Fonfair to commence proceedingsagainst Dockyard, after YT Leung was disqualified to act as a director, was valid. The rights and obligations of the parties wereto be determined in accordance with the tenancy agreement made in September 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> As the above defences have been distinctly raised by Dockyard and decided against it by the Deputy Judge in a reasoned decision fromwhich there is no appeal, it is simply not open to Dockyard to raise these allegations again in the 1st affirmation of Li Kam Wafiled in these proceedings on 13 September 2002, as if those factual allegations had not been determined against Dockyard.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The main ground of opposition relied on by Dockyard to oppose this petition, that the Scheme has in effect imposed a bar or moratoriumupon claims during the period of operation of the Scheme, was not however raised as a defence by Dockyard in the High Court Action.</p>    <p class="heading">Res judicata in the wider sense</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> It was submitted by Mr Anthony Chan on behalf of Fonfair that Dockyard should not be allowed to raise this ground of opposition asthis is plainly a point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation in the High Court Action and it might have been broughtforward by Dockyard as part of its defence in those proceedings, as was done by another subsidiary of Holdings just a few monthsearlier in a personal injuries action before Suffiad J that I shall be referring to. Unless there are special circumstances, Dockyardshould be shut out from raising this new point which it had omitted to raise in the High Court Action (<strong>Yat Tung Investment Co. Ltd v. Dao Heng Bank Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20581" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 581).</a></p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> For Dockyard, Mr Kenneth Chan submitted that the new point sought to be raised was not <em>clearly</em> part of the litigation in the High Court Action and so clearly should have been raised in those proceedings, citing the dicta ofSomervell LJ in <strong>Greenhalgh v. Mallard</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1947%5d%202%20All%20ER%20255" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1947] 2 All ER 255</a> at 257. I do not accept this. If the Scheme should have the effect of imposing a bar or moratorium on the claims of creditors duringthe period it is in operation, this could have provided a defence to Dockyard in the High Court Action. If the argument on the newpoint were accepted by the court in the High Court Action, it would not even be necessary for Dockyard to rely on the defences whichwere raised and rejected.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Mr Kenneth Chan also submitted that there are special circumstances here for not applying <em>res judicata</em> in the wider sense. Once a scheme of arrangement is sanctioned by the court under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s166.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 166</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>, it would be binding on all creditors who are entitled to vote upon the scheme. Whether Dockyard is permitted to raise thisnew point in opposing the petition would not only affect the company itself but all its creditors who are bound by the Scheme, eventhough no creditor has given notice of intention to appear in these proceedings and the Scheme Administrator, who is aware of thepetition, has not taken any position. I am persuaded that special circumstances do exist in this situation. I will allow Dockyardto raise the new point in these proceedings.</p>    <p class="heading">The Scheme</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Before I consider the arguments raised on both sides on the effect and construction of the Scheme, it will be appropriate to givea brief account of the mechanism of the Scheme and set out the salient provisions.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Pursuant to the terms of the Scheme, a Scheme Administrator was appointed to deal with claims made against Holdings and the participatingsubsidiaries including Dockyard. The unencumbered assets of each of the participating companies in the Schemes will be pooled toform a fund for the payment of all external claims other than debts covered by security held by secured creditors. Pending completionof realisation of the assets and distributions, there is a moratorium on enforcement of claims by creditors although pending arbitrationswill be allowed to continue. A specified procedure is set out in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> of the Scheme for dealing with proof and determination of claims of creditors. Creditors are required to submit their claims withthe Scheme Administrator on or before the Cut-Off Date, which was 5 July 2000. Any creditor dissatisfied with the decision of theScheme Administrator could have the matter reviewed by the Adjudicators under the Scheme and the decision of the Adjudicators willbe final. Any claim not proved in accordance with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> of the Scheme or which are rejected, shall be treated for all purposes as wholly and irrevocably released.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Clause 1 of the Scheme is in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Save as provided in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> of this Scheme of Arrangement, during the period in which the Scheme of Arrangement is effective, <em>no Creditor shall be entitled to</em> make any demand or exercise any right of set-off against the Company [i.e. Holdings] or any of the Scheme Participating Subsidiaries[which include Dockyard] in respect of, or shall seek to recover from the Company or the Scheme Participating Subsidiaries by legalprocess or otherwise, or <em>take any step or proceedings against</em> the Company or <em>any of the Scheme Participating Subsidiaries</em> or their properties or aspects <em>for the purpose of enforcing or recovering by way of execution or otherwise, any Claim</em> or Secured Debt <em>or to commence</em> or join in <em>any proceedings to wind up</em> the Company or <em>any of the Scheme Participating Subsidiaries</em> provided that nothing in this Scheme of Arrangement shall prevent any Secured Creditor from realising its security or affect anyarbitration between the Company or any Scheme Participating Subsidiary and any claimant against the Company or such Scheme ParticipatingSubsidiary which has commenced and is continuing as at the Effective Date but so that the amount recoverable pursuant to any ordermade in such arbitration proceedings shall be limited in accordance with the provisions of this Scheme of Arrangement." (emphasissupplied)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> "Creditors" in the Scheme is defined to mean:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"the Creditors of the Company or any Subsidiary including, where the Company or any subsidiary has Secured and/or Preferential Creditors,such Secured and/or Preferential Creditors, being in each case Creditors <em>whose claims arose out of or had their origin in any matter occurring before the Effective Date and whether present, future or contingent</em>, whether sounding in equity, contract, tort or under statute and whether liquidated or yet to be ascertained." (emphasis supplied)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> "Claim" is defined in the Scheme to mean "the claims of Proving Creditors against the Company or any subsidiary". "Proving Creditors"is defined to mean "Preferential Creditors and Unsecured Creditors (other than the Company and the Scheme Participating Subsidiaries)".And "Unsecured Creditors" is defined to mean "Creditors of the Company or the Subsidiaries or any of them other than Secured Creditorsand Preferential Creditors ...".</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Fonfair was listed as an unsecured creditor of Dockyard in the composite scheme document, with a claim of HK$933,250.00. It is a"Proving Creditor". There is no explanation how this amount was arrived at, but looking at the particulars in the Notice of Claimthat was submitted by Fonfair dated 8 July 2000, it is clear that this amount could not have included rent due after the EffectiveDate.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> It is also pertinent to note clauses 32 and 37 in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> of the Scheme and they provide as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"32. <em>A Claim for which the Company or the Scheme Participating Subsidiary is liable at the Effective Date</em> shall be proved by any party claiming to be entitled thereto delivering to the Scheme Administrator at such party's own expenses:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) not later than the Cut-Off Date, a Notice of Claim in respect of his Claim completed in accordance with the instructions printedthereon; and</p>            <p class="quote">(b) such documents or other evidence as the Scheme Administrator shall reasonably require for the purpose of substantiating the wholeor any part of such Claim."

(emphasis supplied)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The Notice of Claim that Proving Creditors are required to submit by the Cut-Off Date must be in the form or substantially in theform set out in the Appendix to the Scheme. In the form for the Notice of Claim, item 3 provided as follows: "Total amount of claimas at the Effective Date".</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Having set out the salient provisions, and before I turn to the arguments, it is important to note a concession made by Fonfair.It is accepted by counsel for Fonfair that the bar to proceedings in clause 1 of the Scheme would apply to proceedings in respectof Dockyard's liability as at the Effective Date. However, it would have no application to proceedings in respect of Dockyard's liabilityincurred <em>after</em> the Effective Date. As regards the judgment debt upon which the petition is founded, the major part of it is in respect of Dockyard'sliability incurred after the Effective Date.</p>    <p class="heading">The contention of Dockyard</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> It is the contention of Dockyard that the old tenancy agreement in September 1999, being a contract entered into before the effectivedate of the Scheme, is subject to the effect of the Scheme and as for future rentals as from 28 April 2000, they would fall under"future or contingent" claims of the creditors as defined in the composite scheme document. Dockyard has prayed in aid another instancein which it was held by Suffiad J that the personal injury claims of a sub-contractor's employee which accrued prior to the EffectiveDate, and whose claims must have included damages continuing after the Effective Date, should be stayed against a particular subsidiaryof Holdings pursuant to the terms of the scheme relating to that subsidiary, but the plaintiff was free to proceed against the insurersdirectly (<strong>Lin Kai Hsuan v. Szeto Foon trading as Wah Cheuk Constructing Co. &amp; Ors</strong>, High Court Personal Injuries Action No. 480 of 2000, 21 June 2001, paragraphs 5, 18 to 26). It does not, however, appear from thejudgment that the parties had specifically raised the question of future or contingent claims and this was not expressly dealt within the judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Mr Kenneth Chan submitted that on a proper construction of the definition of "Creditors" in the Scheme, what is material is thatthe claims "arose out of or had their origin in any matter occurring before the Effective Date". So long as this requirement is satisfied,it does not matter when the claim is due, as this would have been caught by the words that follow "and whether present, future orcontingent". There is no basis for limiting future claim so as to stop at liabilities which were incurred as at the Effective Date.One should bear in mind that debts or claims due in future, in the sense that they have not become due and payable by the time windingup commences, are provable in a liquidation, under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s263.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 263</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>, and a landlord is entitled to prove in the liquidation in respect of future rent payable under a lease that the liquidatorhas failed to disclaim (<strong>McPherson's Law of Company Liquidation</strong> by Andrew R Keay, 1st ed., para. 12.19; cf. <strong>Re New Oriental Bank Corp. (No. 2)</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1895%5d%201%20Ch%20753" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1895] 1 Ch. 753).</a> As for a contingent claim, a "contingent creditor" in section 124(1) of the Insolvency Act 1986 (equivalent to section 179(1) of<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a> and provides that a contingent or prospective creditor may petition to wind up a company) has been held to denote "a persontowards whom, under an existing obligation, the company may or will become subject to a present liability on the happening of somefuture event or at some future date" (<strong>Re Williams Hockley Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%201%20WLR%20555" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] 1 WLR 555</a> at 558). So the expression of a contingent claim is of equally wide import.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> It was further pointed out that in the Notice of Claim submitted by Fonfair on 8 July 2000 (when Fonfair was still under the controlof YT Leung) for a total claim of HK$42,440.94, rentals for May and June 2000 were taken into account and apparently set off undersome kind of arrangement (there is no explanation in the evidence why rentals for these two months were deducted, this was not theset-off arrangement as alleged in the High Court Action, which was entered into in August 2000), so the claims put in by Fonfairdid not in fact stop at the Effective Date. The claim submitted by Fonfair was fully admitted by the Scheme Administrator, notwithstandingthat it was submitted after the Cut-Off Date. There is as yet no distribution under the Scheme. It was suggested that Fonfair couldhave put in a claim to the effect that Dockyard has remained in occupation of the Property based on the tenancy agreement made inSeptember 1999, and the claim is for arrears of rent and future rent until the date when Fonfair is to recover possession and thisclaim, if put in, is "not impossible for adjudication".</p>    <p class="heading">The Contention of Fonfair</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The argument of Fonfair runs as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Under Part 3 of the Scheme, Fonfair would only be entitled to submit a claim in respect of arrears of rent or other liabilities incurredup to the Effective Date. It could not have been the intention of the parties to the Scheme that Dockyard should be allowed to continuein occupation of the Property without any payment of rent and any proceedings commenced by Fonfair for recovery of rent would bestayed pursuant to the terms of the Scheme.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> It was submitted that on a proper construction of the Scheme, future claims would only cover claims payable in future but the liabilityfor which had been incurred as at the Effective Date. This would not cover rent which was not yet due as at the Effective Date.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> In support of this contention, Mr Anthony Chan referred me to the decision of Judge Roger Cooke in <strong>Burford Midland Properties Ltd v. Marley Extrusions Ltd &amp; Ors</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20BCLC%20102" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 BCLC 102.</a> At issue in that case was the rent accruing due <em>after</em> the critical date in the voluntary arrangement (equivalent to the Effective Date in our case) entered into by a company under PartI of the Insolvency Act 1986 (our equivalent is the procedure under section 166 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>). It was contended by the original tenantand by the company, to whom the lease was assigned, that the landlord's only rights are rights under the arrangement and those wouldhave the effect of inhibiting immediate and full recovery of rents and the landlord would only receive the rent partly in sharesand partly in rescheduled instalments. This argument was rejected by the Judge and it is necessary to set out his reasoning in somedetail.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Under the arrangement in <strong>Burford</strong>, "liabilities" was defined to mean "from time to time to the extent that they are still subsisting, any and all liabilities of [thecompany] <em>at [the arrangement date]</em> are creditors howsoever such liabilities arise and whether <em>at that date</em> they were liquidated or unliquidated, their value ascertained or otherwise, present or future, contingent or otherwise, but excludingpreferential debts" (emphasis supplied). "Creditors" was defined in the arrangement as "any creditor of [the company] <em>as at [the arrangement date]</em> bound by the voluntary arrangement by virtue of the provisions of [the Insolvency Act] whose claims were <em>at that date</em> liquidated or unliquidated, ascertained in value or otherwise present or future, contingent or otherwise ..." (emphasis supplied).Further, there was a provision in clause 4.1 which read as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The provisions of Clauses 5, 6 and 7 shall have effect in full and final settlement of all claims against and obligations of [theCompany] present and potential in relation to the liabilities including, without limitation, in respect of damages, interest, costsor any other matters relating to the liabilities whether such claims or obligations are liquidated or unliquidated, their value ascertainedor unascertained, future or present, contingent or otherwise".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The Judge went through the exercise of considering the authorities on the meanings given to future and contingent claims in the contextof the companies legislation, similar to what Mr Kenneth Chan had referred me to. He remarked that oddly enough, no authority hadbeen discovered by counsel, despite considerable industry, that relates directly to the position of rent under an existing leasein the context of these definitions. He came to the conclusion that as the authorities stand, the following is clear: "(1) A futureprospective debt cannot include a debt that arises out of a future transaction; (2) that it can and will include a debt that arisesout of an existing transaction as a result of which the basic liability is incurred which depends on the reaching of a future dateor the happening of a future event to make it payable if it is ever to be payable". What is less clear is whether a prospective futuredebt includes a liability under a subsisting series of obligations when the future event "goes to the whole root of the obligation".He took the view that even in the context of the companies legislation, this kind of case would fall outside the category of prospectivedebts, because "what one is really concerned with is what (time and contingency apart) the company is known to owe at the relevantdate as opposed to what the company will owe at a future date when it receives some benefit which at present it does not have - forexample, continued possession under a subsisting lease and the continued benefit of the landlord's covenant". He would construe theexpressions in the arrangement in conformity with what he regarded as the right way of construing the Companies Act approach, ratherthan as something that is radically different (at 109d to h).</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The judge then posed the question of what is a debt or liability and gave the answer as "an obligation to pay that is no longer dependenton executory matters on either side but where subject only either to date or to some uncertain inhibiting factor it is fully crystallised".Thus, if someone will be entitled to payment only when executory matters have been performed, he cannot properly be called a creditor.As for liability for future rent, "this is a right, essentially one of property tied into a bundle of rights and obligations, theenjoyment of the estate for a period by the tenant and also consideration of the landlord's covenants." This is no different fromthe executory contract scenario (at 110a to b).</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> He then turned to the principles of construction, which supported the approach he suggested of construing the relevant expressionsin a Companies Act context. As a matter of ordinary language, he found considerable difficulty in saying that as at the arrangementdate the company had a liability (defined as a liability at the arrangement date) to its landlord for rent, "when that rent has notbecome due in any sense at the arrangement date but is payable in the future in respect of a quarter's, a future quarter's, enjoymentof the estate created by the lease". Nor could he see why it obviously fits into a compromise of liabilities at the arrangement datewhen there is no suggestion of compromising the rights, including the covenant under the lease, which continues to be performablein consideration of, inter alia, the rent. Essentially compromise of debts is a concept whereby the only obligation is the debt itself.Therefore the ambit of the compromise relates to the way in which the debt may be paid or postponed, while compromise of a futurepayment which is in consideration of other executory obligations would involve compromise of those obligations which the arrangementdoes not. He concluded that the scheme of arrangement makes at best dubious sense, defining the liabilities as including future rent,and he did not think future rents, as opposed to past rents, would fit into either the definitions or the compromise with ease orconsistency (at 111d to h).</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The factual matrix of the arrangement was considered. The explanatory document made it clear that the object of the exercise wasto enable the company to trade for five years according to a business plan and secure that its existing debts would be dealt within a tightly structured way which would not unduly interfere with its ability to trade. The other side of the coin must inevitablymean that for the five-year period it would be business as usual, trade would take place, current trade debts would be paid as andwhen they fall due. Part of the trading business pattern of the post-arrangement would be the continued occupation of business premiseswith the landlord performing his covenants and the tenant paying the rent. In that factual matrix and given that objective of thescheme, it would be totally inconsistent with the concept and purpose of the scheme that the landlord should be made to give thetenant continuing credit, some of it in the form of shares, and continue to perform all his obligations under the lease and takethe risk that the company would be able to pay at the postponed date. The tenants' construction would not make commercial sense because"it forces giving continuing future credit for obligatory future services within what is meant to be a moratorium scheme with businessas usual and the landlord's construction makes commercial sense, i.e. it is consistent with drawing a line at the arrangement dateand thereafter trading normally" (at 112a to e).</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> It was submitted on behalf of Fonfair that the reasoning in <strong>Burford</strong> would apply equally to the present situation and the relevant expressions in the Scheme and the objective of the Scheme are not materiallydifferent from the arrangement there. For Dockyard, it was merely submitted that the relevant provisions in the Scheme are differentfrom the arrangement in <strong>Burford</strong>.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> From my own research, <strong>Burford</strong> was cited in a number of cases which were concerned with different issues for decision, including <strong>Mytre Investments Ltd v. Reynolds</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%203%20All%20ER%20588" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 3 All ER 588</a> (which relates to the liability of a lessee for past rent where the assignee of the lease had entered into an individual voluntaryarrangement ("IVA") and the IVA did not affect the obligations under the lease for rent due for the future); <strong>Doorbar v. Alltime Securities Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20BCLC%20316" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 BCLC 316</a> (which relates to whether the liability to pay future rent is capable of being included in an IVA and the proper construction ofrule 5.17(3) of the Insolvency Rules 1986); and <strong>Re Cancol Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20All%20ER%2037" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 All ER 37</a> (which relates to whether a company voluntary arrangement can as a matter of law bind persons entitled to the benefit of presentas opposed to future or contingent liabilities such as future payments of rent and the proper construction of rule 1.17(3) of the1986 Rules). There was no disapproval of <strong>Burford</strong> in subsequent cases.</p>    <p class="heading">Construction of the Scheme</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> It seems to me the logical approach would be to start with the question whether future rent under a lease is, as a matter of law,capable of being included in a scheme of arrangement under section 166. If it were legally impossible to include future paymentsof rent in a scheme of arrangement, the question of construction of the Scheme does not arise. Similar questions were consideredby Knox J in the contexts of an IVA and a company voluntary arrangement in <strong>Doorbar</strong> and <strong>Cancol</strong>. Knox J decided that a liability to future rent is capable of inclusion as a matter of law in an IVA and a company voluntary arrangement.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> In <strong>Cancol</strong>, reference was made to <strong>Re Midland Coal</strong>, <strong>Coke and Iron Co., Craig's Claim</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1895%5d%201%20Ch%20267" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1895] 1 Ch 267</a>, which was decided in relation to section 2 of the Joint Stock Companies Arrangement Act 1870 (the direct ancestor of section 425of the Companies Act 1985, our equivalent is section 166). It was held that the word of "creditor" in the Act is used in the widestsense, that it includes all persons having pecuniary claims against the company, whether actual or contingent.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Knox J cited with approval a note in <em>Buckley on the Companies Acts</em>, and the note in the current edition at [425.19] on section 425 reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Every person who has a pecuniary claim against the company, whether actual or contingent, is a creditor within the Act."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> I hold that claims to future rent are capable of being included as relevant claims in a scheme of arrangement under section 166.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> It is entirely possible for a scheme of arrangement to provide for the claim of the landlord for future payment of rent where thecompany remains in occupation, or the claim of the landlord for loss and damage for the unexpired term of the lease where the companyoffers to surrender the lease, as was done in the proposals considered in <strong>Cancol</strong>. In this way, the value of the landlord's claims could be determined for voting purposes when the scheme is put to a vote at thecreditors' meeting.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> No such provision was made in respect of the landlord's claims in the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> It would appear from the explanatory statement to the Scheme that the plan for restructuring and reorganization was that the UDLGroup would continue in business with trimmed down operations so as to preserve the Group's asset value so that the assets wouldeventually be made available to the creditors. It would concentrate on its core marine engineering business, which had a profitabletrack record. There was no mention in the explanatory statement that the Group would give up the business premises at the Propertyor of any plans that the Group would move to smaller premises with a trimmed down operation. One can only infer that it was envisaged,with the implementation of the Scheme, that the Group would continue to be in occupation of its business premises.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The factual matrix and purpose of the Scheme are similar to <strong>Burford</strong>. I do not find any material difference between the provisions in the arrangement in that case and the relevant provisions in ourcase. I agree with the reasoning in <strong>Burford</strong>. Applying that reasoning, I hold that as a matter of construction, rents which accrued due after the Effective Date are not includedin the claims affected by the Scheme. Further, the definition of "Creditors" in the Scheme must be read with other provisions inPart 3, such as clauses 32 and 37. In my view, having regard to other provisions and the regime under the Scheme, it is fairly clearthat a line is meant to be drawn at the Effective Date and liability that accrued after that date arising out of the continuationof the business of the Group on a trimmed down scale is not caught under the Scheme. I should also mention that I have attached nosignificance at all to the way in which Fonfair had made its claim in the Notice of Claim that was submitted. The main ground ofopposition to the petition fails.</p>    <p class="heading">Other grounds of opposition</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> I should also record that there were other grounds of opposition raised by Dockyard in the evidence filed and in the written submissionsof counsel, seeking a stay or adjournment of the petition on the grounds that there are pending proceedings to wind up Fonfair andMoney Facts and that Harbour Front has put up a proposal for investment in Dockyard to keep it as a going concern. In his oral submissions,Mr Kenneth Chan indicated that he would not rely on these other grounds. I do not propose to deal with them except to say that Iwould not have granted a stay or adjournment on any of the other grounds.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> I am mindful of the fact that in the event a winding-up order is made, this would upset the Scheme. Dockyard is clearly insolvent.According to the annual report of the UDL Group dated 29 November 2002, Dockyard has "at present no business nor net tangible assetsof substance". The unaudited balance sheet of one page put forward by Dockyard giving its financial position as at 31 December 2002,with "other receivable" of over HK$29 million under current assets, but containing no particulars of these receivables or their recoverability,does not show that the company is solvent or that it has a positive net worth. No viable proposal to salvage the company has beenplaced before the court. The proposal of Harbour Front, as contained in the letter of its solicitors to the Official Receiver dated4 February 2003, is completely lacking in details to merit any serious consideration.</p>    <p class="heading">Orders</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> For the above reasons, I make an order to wind up Dockyard. Fonfair's costs in the petition will be paid out of the assets of Dockyard.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(S Kwan)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Anthony Chan and Ms Sarah Sin, instructed by Messrs Ho &amp; Ip, for the Petitioner</p>        <p>Mr Kenneth Chan and Mr David Chum, instructed by Messrs Joseph C T Lee &amp; Co., for the Company</p>        <p>The Official Receiver, attendance excused</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2003/119.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
