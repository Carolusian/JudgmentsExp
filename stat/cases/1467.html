In March 2006, two of the defendantâsemployees surrendered themselves to the police for misappropriation of shares.  The two employees were named âMaâ and âLeungâ. Leung had been the person responsible for the plaintiffâs portfolio and trading. </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> In October 2008, both Ma and Leung pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge involving theft of shares.  The exact chargesto which they pleaded guilty was not made clear.  However Mr Jonathan Wong, counsel for the defendant, helpfully brought the matterup to date by informing the court that Leung had pleaded guilty to the misappropriation of shares which are the subject of the plaintiffclaim. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Over a number of years Leung and Ma had created false statements of clientsâ accounts and had interfered with the computer systemwithin the firm.  However, it is not suggested that the plaintiff has in any way claimed for the return of shares which he did notoriginally pay for or to which he was not entitled. </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Mr Wong, again helpfully, stated that the defendant was unable to ascertain, without further discovery from the plaintiff, the âextentâof the loss.  In short, the defendant is not in a position to concede the accuracy of the claim.  Their position is further complicatedby the fact that they are currently engaged in difficult discussions with their insurers. </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Mr Wong also makes a preliminary submission on a matter of law which, if correct, would mean that the plaintiffâs summons, in itspresent form was misconceived and should be dismissed. </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> He submits that the plaintiffâs claim is solely based on the tort of conversion.  The claim seeks the delivery up of the shares. He argues that the shares themselves are choses-in-action and as such cannot be converted.  The shares themselves were never withinthe defendantâs custody or possession.  Thus if, in truth, the claim is purely one of in conversion, it is totally flawed.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> However, I agree with Mr Andrew Mak, counsel for the plaintiff, who submits that the claim should not be construed so narrowly. It is true that the plaintiffâs primary claim is for the delivery up of shares which have been misappropriated.  However the statementrelies also on a contractual relationship between the parties, based on a âCash Clientâs Agreementâ.  It also pleads breachesof fiduciary duty. </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Further, the Order 14 summons seeks an inquiry into damages and an assessment of the loss suffered by the plaintiff in the eventthat delivery of the shares is impossible. </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> I am satisfied that the claim, as framed, is wider than as contended for by Mr Wong and accordingly I am satisfied that it is appropriateto consider the arguments within the parameters of an Order 14 application.  </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Returning then to the current factual situation, I consider that Leungâs guilty plea seals the defendantâs fate on liability. Beforehand the plaintiff had a strong case.  The addition of the guilty plea, in my judgment, has turned a strong case into an unanswerableone. </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Blocks of shares in six companies have been misappropriated.  Documentary evidence shows that two of those six have been in the plaintiffâsname since 1998.  There is evidence that the remaining four were purchased in 2000 and 2001.  Mr Mak has then been able to tracethe lives of those shares by reference to the monthly statements of the defendant.  In each case there is a history of them appearing,then disappearing, then re-appearing.  Ultimately, in each case, they have disappeared.  There is no suggestion that the plaintiffwas aware of any such activity in the movement of the shares until he learnt of Leungâs criminal activities in 2006.  </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Given the present state of affairs I am satisfied that this is a proper case for interlocutory judgment being entered at this stagewith damages to be assessed by a Master in due course.  Whatever uncertainty or confusion may be present at the moment, it is relevantonly to quantum and not liability. </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Accordingly I so order with costs reserved to the assessment. </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">  (M.P.
