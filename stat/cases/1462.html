It arises in the context of the sale of Thai commercial paper by the defendant bank to theplaintiff, its retail customer, and more particularly focuses upon the often fine distinction between the provision of financialinformation, and the provision of financial advice.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The plaintiff, Formosa Taffeta (âFormosaâ), is a Taiwanese company which is part of the Formosa Plastics Group, one of the largest,if not the largest, of the Taiwanese conglomerates.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The defendant, Banque Indosuez (âIndosuezâ), now under different post-merger ownership, and since renamed âCalyonâ, was atthe times material to this case a French bank with branches in the Far East, including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The subject matter of this litigation, which is of some age, and which throughout has been conducted not in the Commercial Courtbut in the High Court General List, focuses upon certain failed investments â specifically 10 bills of exchange drawn on a Thaipublicly listed company, One Holding Public Company Limited (âOne Holdingâ) â which were purchased by Formosa from the bankon two occasions in January 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> These bills were issued by One Holding to a cumulative value of US$10 million, which sum, together with interest, now is claimedby Formosa from Indosuez as representing the value of its consequential loss upon the dishonour by One Holding of these bills.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> It remains unclear why this dispute has taken so long to come to court, and each side appears to lay responsibility for the delayupon the other, with considerable time apparently having been spent upon various interlocutory matters.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> What is ironic, however, is that just as new crop of commercial litigation arising from the current worldwide financial contagionis beginning to seep into the Hong Kong judicial system, this case probably represents the last of those cases which originated duringthe period leading up to the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-1998.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> In substance, the facts are not complex; there is much that is undisputed, and at bottom the outcome of this case <i>solely</i> is dependent upon that which is found to have been said on the telephone between two people, a Miss Pamela Wu of Indosuez, the seller,and a Mr Teng Li-Fu of Formosa, the dissatisfied buyer.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> This however is to get ahead of the story, and at the outset it may be useful to sketch in a little of the relevant background.</p>    <p class="heading">The contracts of sale</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The two relevant contracts of sale between Indosuez and Formosa are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>  first</i>, a contract dated 8 January 1997 for the sale by the bank to Formosa of 5 One Holding bills of exchange with an aggregate face valueof US$5 million, for the price of US$4,909,932.74, payable on 10 January 1997, and with a maturity date of 9 April 1997 (âthe 1<sup>st</sup> contractâ); and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>  second</i>, a contract dated 28 January 1997 for the sale by the bank to Formosa of 5 bills with an aggregate value of US$5 million, for theprice of US$4,928,407.22 payable on 30 January 1997, and a maturity date of 10 April 1997 (âthe 2<sup>nd</sup> contractâ).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> It is common ground that the bills of exchange under each contract were sold by Indosuez to Formosa pursuant to the contracts, thatFormosa paid the contract prices stipulated therein, that pursuant to the contracts that Indosuez obtained from One Holding the 10bills drawn by One Holding on itself, each in the amount of US$1 million and payable to Indosuez Singapore Nominees Pte Ltd â anominee company of the bank acting as custodian of the bills â with the maturity dates as specified in the contracts, and thatthe bills eventually were dishonoured upon maturity by One Holding.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> It also is not in contention that the dealing resulting in these contracts for the sale of these bills of exchange took place betweenthe aforesaid Ms Wu and Mr Teng, and that, save for a number of relatively minor matters, the court principally is required factuallyto determine what was, or was not, said in the telephone conversations between these two persons which led to the formation of thesetwo contracts.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> These contractual dealings between Mr Teng and Ms Wu took place against a backdrop in which the plaintiff had been trading with thedefendant bank since 1991, initially in respect of loans and foreign exchange dealing, albeit in 1993 the defendant had began toinvest in debt instruments â bills of exchange, promissory notes and certificates of deposit â through the medium of the bank;in fact, up until early 1997 these parties had participated in some 55 such transactions.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Initially the contact person in the bank was a Mr Tsai, who was in the branch of the defendant in Singapore.  However, since 1996Ms Pamela Wu had taken over from Mr Tsai in handling the plaintiffâs account; Ms Wu then was an Assistant Vice President withinthe Asian Fixed Income Department of the defendant based in a branch of Indosuez in Taipei.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> No doubt this was viewed as logical, given that the plaintiffâs trading in fixed income paper was conducted by Mr Teng, himselfbased in the plaintiffâs office in Taipei.</p>    <p class="heading">The progress of this action</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Formosa commenced this action by writ on 15 May 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The claim as originally pleaded was on the basis of breach of contract, although this no longer features in the manner in which thecase has been conducted before this court.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The present cause of action, namely Formosaâs claim against the bank for the giving of negligent advice, was introduced by amendmentto the claim filed on 27 September 1999, well over two years after the issuance of proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Mr Jat SC, who appeared together with Mr Stock on behalf of the bank in this case, complained at the outset of this trial that, interms of Formosaâs claim, the goal posts appeared to have shifted yet again, because in the plaintiffâs opening argument, submittednine days prior to the trial, there had been, in Mr Jatâs terms, âa wholesale rewritingâ of the plaintiffâs case, and thatthe focus now appeared to have shifted to a complaint of negligence on the part of the bank in terms of the failure to provide Formosawith appropriate information, as opposed to the giving of advice â an alternative case which, he said, remained entirely unpleaded,and which represented a case the bank was wholly unprepared to meet some 12 years after the events in question.  This, opined MrJat, was the latest in the long history of the plaintiffâs attempts to re-formulate its complaint against the bank, and constitutedan issue which the court should not entertain.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> I agreed with, and accepted, this contention.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> When Mr Smith SC, appearing for Formosa together with his team of juniors, Mr William Wong and Mr Laurence Li, was taxed with thiscomplaint at the beginning of this case, he confirmed to the court that the crux of the case that he wished to present on behalfof his client focused upon the allegedly negligent advice which had been allegedly tendered by Ms Wu of the bank to Mr Teng of Formosa,and thus that the liability of the bank, were such were to be established, would be grounded upon the vicarious liability of itself,<i>qua</i> employer, as a result of the negligence of its employee, Ms Wu.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> It is probably correct to say that the alleged liability of the bank arising i<i>ndependently</i> of the actions of Ms Wu has had a tendency to creep back into the frame within parts of the bankâs written closing address, andI reiterate the view expressed by this court at trial to the effect that this case has been conducted, and indeed now has been judged,<i>solely</i> on the basis of the alleged negligent advice on the part of Ms Wu in her telephone conversations with Mr Teng.</p>    <p class="heading">The respective cases</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> In the plaintiffâs comprehensive and detailed closing written submission it is noted that there is only one âreal issueâ inthis case, and that is whether the defendant bank, in the person of Ms Wu, gave negligent advice to the plaintiff, in the personof Mr Teng, and thus caused the plaintiffâs loss arising from its purchase of the two sets of bills as issued by One Holding.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> In this connection, leading counsel has referred the court to paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Amended Statement of Claim, dated 27 September1999, which read thus:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>â18.  The Plaintiff entered into the first and/or second contracts in reliance upon advice given by Ms Pamela Wu of the Defendantâ¦tothe effect that the purchase of the bills of exchange was a sound investment.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i> 19.  Such advice was given negligently in that the Defendant knew or ought to have known that the financial position of One Holdingwas far from healthy.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Following on from this, Mr Smith asserted that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care under <i>Hedley Byrne</i> principles, taking into account the following factors:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">i.    the partiesâ past dealings;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ii.  the partiesâ disparity of knowledge and resources;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">iii.    the defendantâs awareness of the plaintiffâs reliance upon it for advice and information;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">iv.   the defendantâs willingness to provide the same.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> He said that Ms Wu, acting for the defendant, had given negligent advice in connection with the purchases of the two sets of billsissued by One Holding, and that the advice was negligent in that the defendant knew, or ought to have known, that the financial positionof One Holding was far from healthy; in fact, in the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter of 1996 it transpires that One Holding had made a loss.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Accordingly, he concluded, the defendantâs negligence had caused the plaintiffâs loss in the amount of approximately US$10 million,that is, the sum of US$5 million for each set of bills.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> For its part the defendant strongly disputes liability â upon whatever basis is asserted by the plaintiff â arising from thecommunications between Ms Wu and Mr Teng.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Mr Jat has made it clear that the primary position of the bank is that Formosa has failed to discharge its burden of showing thatMs Wu in fact said that which she is alleged to have said â which amounted to an assertion that the One Holding bills of exchangewere ârisk freeâ â or any comparable words of persuasion or inducement to buy the bills.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> It is further maintained that the bank did not owe the plaintiff any duty of care <i>qua</i> adviser because Ms Wu, who purely functioned as a salesperson, did not advise and had no advisory role, that by 1997 it is plainthat Formosa was an experienced investor in emerging market paper at higher yields than could be obtained on the money markets, andthat in any event Formosa, via its officers Mr Teng and Mr Lai, clearly had made their own independent risk assessments on any particulardeal, including the ones now under scrutiny.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Following on from this, Mr Jat also maintains that if, which is denied, Ms Wu said anything which could be construed as âadviceâ,she did not do so negligently, and that in any event Formosa did not reasonably rely upon such advice. </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Nor, he maintained, was there any basis to support a claim of conflict of interest, which is a matter which also is raised on thepleadings â and this notwithstanding the undisputed evidence that shortly <i>after</i> the 2<sup>nd </sup>contract for the sale to the plaintiff of the second tranche of bills of exchange, the Bank had bought for its own account furtherbills of One Holding in the sum of US$5 million, and had retained them to default, unwisely (as events transpired) having declinedto sell these bills prior to such default to another customer which had wished to purchase this paper.</p>    <p class="heading">The evidence</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The court cannot begin to grapple with the divers principles of law which have developed in the numerous âbanking adviceâ casesto which reference has been made without first looking hard at the evidence and making some significant findings of fact.  As LordGoff observed in the Privy Council <i>The Royal Bank Trust Co (Trinidad) Ltd v Joseph Norbert</i> <i>Pampellonne and another</i>, [1987] 1 Lloydâs LR 218, at 225:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦the question whether the furnishing of information is in any particular case to be treated as the equivalent to advice mustdepend on the facts of the case, and in particular upon the precise circumstances in which the relevant information has been givenâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> For the plaintiff two witnesses of fact were called, namely <b>Mr Teng Li-Fu</b> and his superior, <b>Mr Lai Wu-Lang,</b> both officers within Formosa, and for the defendant two factual witnesses also were called, namely <b>Ms Pamela Wu</b> and <b>Monsieur Didier Odin</b>, at the material time both officers within the defendant bank; I set out below a brief summary of their evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> As earlier noted, however, it is the telephone exchanges between Mr Teng of the plaintiff and Ms Wu of the defendant which lie atthe heart of this case.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Mr Teng Li-Fu</u></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> At the time of the events in question, Mr Teng was a âspecialistâ within the plaintiffâs Finance Division, to which positionhe had been promoted in 1990; he gave evidence to this court over the course of two days, the vast bulk of which was taken up withcross-examination.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Mr Teng has a Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Taiwan, and, whilst he gave evidence in Putonghua, he clearlyhas adequate grasp of English.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Mr Teng explained that the plaintiff did not engage in investment as a business it itself, and had limited resources to invest; infact, his main responsibility was to manage the plaintiffâs foreign exchange risks.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> He also said that the plaintiff had had a âcautiousâ approach to investing; on occasion it invested in well-known Taiwanese stocks,but also it invested in commercial debt instruments, including bills of exchange, according to certain criteria.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> In general, he said, the plaintiff would purchase only bills of exchange issued or guaranteed by a reputable third party bank orfinance house, a criterion, he maintained, which was known to the defendant bank.  In this connection he pointed to the fact thatof the 55 transactions thus conducted with the defendant, and excluding the two purchases of the One Holding bills upon which therewas default, the other 53 such transactions had thus been guaranteed.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> In addition, of the 29 transactions of similar nature as had been conducted with other banks, these were for commercial instrumentseither issued by banks, finance houses or government, or were guaranteed by the same.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Mr Teng also said that in instances in which the plaintiff was considering the purchase of instruments of a previously unknown issuer,the plaintiff habitually would ask other banks with which it dealt whether such issuer was considered reputable, although with regardto Thai companies, he had relied exclusively on the defendant bank for such information.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Prior to the purchase of the two tranches of bills of exchange from One Holding, Mr Teng recounted that some months earlier, in October1996, the plaintiff also had purchased bills issued by Securities One â which, like One Holdings, was a member of the âOne Groupâ,and a subsidiary of the holding company of that group, Finance One Public Holding Co Ltd.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> With regard to this latter purchase, Mr Teng said that it had come about because Ms Wu had called him to recommend these SecuritiesOne bills; she had said that Securities One was the largest securities company in Thailand, was a member of the One Group, and wasfinancially sound, and had faxed him a research report on Finance One, the holding company, authored by W I Carr, then a subsidiaryof the defendant bank.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> He said that sometime prior to the purchases of One Holding bills, the sale transactions the subject of this claim â which respectivelytook place on 8 and 28 January 1997 â Ms Wu of the defendant had faxed the plaintiff an introduction to One Holding, together withan extract of its 1<sup>st</sup> quarter 1996 accounts, information which had been filed by the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Thereafter, he said, Ms Wu had called him to suggest that the plaintiff should invest in some One Holding bills, and that duringfurther telephone conversations he asserted that Ms Wu had advised him that One Holding enjoyed a sound financial standing giventhat it was a company within the same group as Securities One, that this was a group which was financially strong, that there wouldbe no problems with such a big company, that it did not matter if there was a bank guarantee in place or not, and that the defendantbank itself had underwritten and had participated in a syndicated Floating Rate Note issue by One Holding.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Mr Teng also said that when he had requested up-to-date accounts for One Holding, Ms Wu had said that she did not have any, but thatwhen she was able to locate updated information, she would provide it to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Mr Teng said that he had relayed this information to his boss, Mr Lai, and that, in reliance upon Ms Wuâs advice, he had proposed,and Mr Lai then had approved, purchase of the first set of bills on 8 January 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> As to the second purchase of One Holding bills, which it is common ground took place on 28 January 1997, it was Mr Tengâs evidencethat shortly before that date Ms Wu had telephoned him to recommend the purchase of another US$5 million tranche of such bills, andthat she had repeated her earlier advice that One Holding was financially sound and that there would be no problems.  Ms Wu onceagain had said that she did not have available up-to-date accounts for One Holding, and again promised to provide such updated informationwhen she had it.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> As earlier, Mr Teng had relayed this advice to his superior, Mr Lai, and once again Mr Lai had approved the purchase of the secondset of bills.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The fact that subsequently One Holding had defaulted was a matter of history, and Mr Teng, and thus the plaintiff, now complainedthat, absent Ms Wuâs âadviceâ, these transactions would not have been entered into, and that the plaintiff thus would haveavoided the complete loss of the plaintiffâs approximately US$10 million investment.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> One factual matter â not rehearsed within the plaintiffâs witness statements â was Mr Tengâs revelation in cross-examinationthat, in buying commercial paper which attracted a higher yield than was available in the money markets, the plaintiff frequentlyhad borrowed the money to be thus invested at a lower rate than was to be gained in the instrument that was to be purchased withsuch borrowed funds, thus âarbitragingâ the interest rate differentials to the profit of the plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Mr Lai Wu-Lang</u></p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> Mr Lai was the second of the plaintiffâs witnesses of fact; he too gave his evidence in Putonghua.  At the material time he wasthe manager of the plaintiffâs Finance Division, and effectively was Mr Tengâs boss.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> However, Mr Lai had had no direct contact with Ms Wu of the defendant bank, and it was only through oral reports said to have beenreceived from Mr Teng that Mr Lai affected to have contemporaneous knowledge of the dealings which had ensued between them.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> In circumstances wherein at no stage did Mr Lai have contact with Ms Wu, there is no necessity focus at great length upon his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> His case ultimately appeared to be that whilst his subordinate, Mr Teng, was responsible for negotiating a transaction, that he wasthe person who was required to approve the terms as thus negotiated prior to that transaction being entered into by the defendant;thus, based on the information which he said had been relayed to him by Mr Teng, he had approved the purchase of the two sets ofOne Holding bills of exchange which subsequently were dishonoured, thereby causing his employer loss â a loss which, he said, hadresulted in hard questions consequently being asked by senior management of the plaintiff, and also at the plaintiffâs AGM, whereshareholders had been told that litigation was on foot to recover the monies thus lost as the result of these unfortunate purchases.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Mr Lai made it very plain to the court that in his mind it was the defendantâs fault for negligently advising the plaintiff topurchase these bills; he said that the plaintiff had asked for more up-to-date information, which had not been forthcoming, and hestrongly asserted that the plaintiff should not have acted in the way that it did.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Ms Pamela Wu Su Chiu</u></p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> The leading witness for the defendant was Ms Pamela Wu, who at the material time was an Assistant Vice-President of Banque Indosuez;currently she is Treasurer of a banking institution in Taipei, having left the defendant bank for personal reasons in May 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> During the period from March 1996 to May 1998 she had worked in the capacity of Sales Manager in the Asian Fixed Income Departmentwithin the Hong Kong branch of Indosuez; she said that in this position she was remunerated by fixed monthly salary and receivedno commission on the sale of investment products to customers of the bank, although she did receive an annual bonus.  It appearsto be common ground that the plaintiffâs dealings with Ms Wu did not fall within what is termed as a âprivate banking relationshipâ,with all that this variously may import.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> Ms Wu recounted the history, as she understood it, of the plaintiffâs trading relationship with the defendant, which relationshiphad commenced in about 1993-1994, and until 1996 the plaintiff had been dealing with a Mr Tsai, who worked in the Singapore branchof the bank; in fact, in the course of her duties with the bank Ms Wu had met Mr Lai Wu-Lang on several earlier occasions, and shesaid she had resumed prior professional contact with Mr Teng after she had joined the Asian Fixed Income Department of the defendant. Her understanding and experience was that the plaintiff had been a âsophisticated institutional investorâ in emerging marketpaper since 1994.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> By âemerging market paperâ she said that she intended to connote investment products like securities, debentures and fixed incomenotes issued by companies in less developed countries such as Thailand, Korea, Eastern Europe and Latin America, products which generallyhad a fixed yield, less liquidity, a wide bid/offer spread, and no âguaranteed buy-backâ.  Ms Wu produced copies of the plaintiffâstrading records with the defendant for the period from 1994 to early 1997, and on this basis suggested that the plaintiff had beena regular purchaser of such âhigher riskâ commercial paper from these markets.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Ms Wuâs firm stance was that never at any stage had she âadvisedâ Mr Teng of the plaintiff upon the credit-standing of theissuers of various instruments or of the credit risk involved, and that she always regarded the plaintiff as a sophisticated investorwith expertise in this type of trade; nor did she regard herself, in the position she then had held, of having had any duty to provideany financial or investment advice to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> As to the specific âOne Holding transactionsâ the subject of this litigation, Ms Wu said that the name of One Holding as a commercialpaper-issuing institution had been included on the defendantâs âquotation sheetsâ which routinely had been sent out to thedefendantâs clients, and she recalled that in the period September to December 1996, during one of her casual telephone conversationswith Mr Teng of the plaintiff, she had learnt from him that the plaintiff had wished to diversify its portfolio and was looking forsome new issuers in which to invest.  At that time she had mentioned One Holding Ltd to him as a possibility, and she had explainedthat it had a strong link with One Finance Group, one of the largest finance companies in Thailand.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Nothing had come of this early conversation, but subsequently she had mentioned to Mr Teng that, together with three Taiwanese banks,the defendant bank had underwritten a US dollar-denominated syndication issue for One Holding, and at that stage Mr Teng had requestedsome information on that company, which she then had provided with material which at that time she had to-hand: this background informationincluded some research in the form of a five page document on One Holding â a âfact sheetâ â provided by the defendantâsBangkok branch, and an extract from the Floating Rate Note Prospectus as was issued in August 1996.  Ms Wu recalled that Mr Tenghad said that the plaintiff had felt comfortable that three Taiwanese banks with good research teams also had invested in One Holding. Ms Wu also said that Mr Teng had asked for information on Finance One, so she had consulted a booklet on âAsian Corporatesâpublished by WI Carr which was available in her office, and in which she had found two pages on Finance One.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> Still later at the plaintiffâs request, she thought had had sent some further relevant information about the company, but her firmposition was that she never had advised as to its credit standing, nor did she recommend purchasing the paper of One Holding.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> This, therefore, was the background to the purchases by the plaintiff from the defendant of the two tranches of bills of exchangeon 8<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> January 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> On 8<sup>th</sup> January 1997 Ms Wu had faxed to her clients, including the plaintiff, her portfolio list which detailed the various investment productswhich the defendant currently had available, Mr Teng then had called her and had requested an improvement on the offer yield, andthereafter he had ordered the first tranche of One Holding bills.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> A like scenario had occurred on 28<sup>th</sup> January 1997 when Mr Teng, having received the relevant quotation sheets, had ordered the second tranche of One Holding bills.  Inthe event, both tranches which the plaintiff had purchased were retained by the defendant bank <i>qua</i> custodian.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Monsieur Didier Odin</u></p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Monsieur Odin was in no way involved in the particular transactions the subject of this dispute, and thus much of his evidence isconfined to his perception of the factual background as he understood it; as such his evidence is not directly relevant to the resolutionof this case.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> At the time of the matters in question, he was a senior executive within the defendant bank; since 1993 he had been in Asia in chargeof the Regional Management of Risk audit, and in 1998 until his retirement in November 2005 he was in charge of the Distressed AssetsGroup of the defendant bank.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> He gave evidence as to the internal structure and business lines of the bank at the relevant time, and noted that the Floating RateNote arrangement in respect of One Holding Ltd had been engineered and signed-off in Bangkok by the bankâs Bangkok Capital Marketsteam.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> He also pointed out that the defendant bank itself had become an unsecured creditor of One Holding when this instruction had beenplaced into liquidation because of its capital markets activities â the defendant having been left holding One Holding bills ofexchange, together with One Holding Floating Rate Notes which had remained on the bankâs books â and not as a consequence ofcommercial lending.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> He stated that he had been informed of the One Holding default in payment of its bills of exchange on 18<sup>th</sup> March 1997, the date of default, and he then was asked to participate, together with other senior bank officers, in the oversight/managementof the One Holding file.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> Whilst his review of the sale of the One Holding bills to the plaintiff had been obtained from his perusal of bank documents, ofthe content of which he had no direct knowledge, he was able to assist the court with his account of the extensive nature of thediscovery exercise with which he had been involved on behalf of the defendant bank, and in particular he told how he had been openingboxes of documents in a storeroom when he had come across one of the documents upon which the plaintiff has placed considerable reliancein this trial â an extract from an internal draft aide-memoire/discussion paper neither formalized nor distributed as an operationalpaper within the bank â which made passing reference, within the context of and under the heading of âPrivate Bankingâ, tothe possibility that âselling often includes some kind of advisoryâ.  He had discovered this document, Mr Odin said, becausehe had understood that it ought to be so discovered, but he maintained that it had no relevance to the activities which he understoodhad precipitated the present case, namely the retail sale to the plaintiff of the subsequently-dishonoured One Holding bills of exchange.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> Monsieur Odin also gave evidence as to the broad structure of the defendant bank, which was a single entity operating through branches,with certain areas (including private banking, stock-broking and asset management) being operated as subsidiaries.  He said thatthe stockbroker WI Carr was an equity subsidiary of the bank, but there was a âstrong Chinese wallâ in place in the sense thatthe activities, premises and staff were completely separate, and that there were no links between the two, and at the time of relevantevents he had not been aware (as Ms Wu also similarly had said she was unaware) of that brokerâs publication âThailand Weeklyâ.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> This gentleman also gave evidence as to the circumstances in which the defendant bank had given discovery of the Q2 1996 unauditedaccounts of One Holding, and explained that these were found in an unmarked box during a lengthy search for relevant documents inthe bankâs Bangkok office; the document as found had been a copy of a fax apparently sent twice, but it was unclear who was therecipient, there was no first page, and from this document it was impossible to tell whether the bank had received the document on5 November 1996, or subsequently had received a fax copy from the initial recipient.  As to this, however, Monsieur Odin took theview that it would have been unusual for the bank to have received unaudited accounts directly from One Holding since the bank normallywould check with the Stock Exchange of Thailand for the published financial information of listed companies.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> Monsieur Odin was but briefly cross-examined, and so far as it goes I unhesitatingly accept his evidence; I mean no disrespect whenI say that as such his evidence did not substantially assist in the resolution of this case.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Expert evidence</u></p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> In addition to the factual witnesses, I should record that, at the instigation of the plaintiff, the parties had produced reportsfrom banking experts on various aspects of this case.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> Leave had been given so to do on the basis, I am told, that the trial forum â which as matters transpired turned out to be theCommercial Court â would rule on the admissibility of such evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> Some inkling of the potential problems in this regard briefly had been adverted to Mr Jat SC in a pre-trial review which this courtspecifically requested, this not having been a case within the Commercial Court list â wherein, as generally is known, applicationfor the admission of expert evidence is strictly monitored at the interlocutory stage.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> In the event, after perusing the expert reports on both sides, and having considered the very extensive amendments as were proposedby Mr Smith SC to the existing plaintiffâs expert report, and further having heard argument, I declined to permit any expert evidencewhatever to be adduced.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> A formal ruling delivered in this regard is recorded within the trial transcript; suffice it to say, yet again within the judgmentsof this court, that an expertâs function is to <i>educate</i> and not to <i>advocate</i>, far less to purport to determine the ultimate question at issue in the case, which must be a matter for the court and the courtalone.</p>    <p class="heading">Credibility and Findings of fact</p>    <p class="heading">(i)  <u>Credibility generally</u></p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> Unsurprisingly given the factual circumstances, each side strongly canvassed the overall credibility of their prime witness: forthe plaintiff Mr Teng, and for the defendant, Ms Wu.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> Mr Jat SC observed that the attempt by Mr Teng to maintain that Formosa was <i>in</i>experienced as an investor simply was ânot credibleâ, and that the same could be said of Mr Laiâs insistence that Formosaâsmany trades in emerging market commercial paper were at âminimum riskâ; moreover he said that the plaintiffâs purported distinctionbetween âsovereign riskâ and âcountry riskâ was no more than a semantic contrivance, and did not alter the fact that in 1997the plaintiff was an experienced investor which at all times carefully evaluated its investments and was willing to assume a degreeof calculated risk so as to obtain a higher return thus otherwise would be available in the markets.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> Mr Jat submitted that when taken overall Ms Wuâs evidence was clearly to be preferred, and he asked the court to accept her evidencein cross-examination that while Formosa undoubtedly preferred investments guaranteed by third party institutions, this neither wasan inflexible rule nor its sole criterion for making an investment.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> He also spotlighted the apparently differing evidence given by Mr Lai, Mr Tengâs immediate boss, in terms of which of them hadmade the final decision to make any particular investment; this was a reference to the obvious change in Mr Laiâs evidence on thepoint between what was said in chief and in cross-examination, before his reversion to the original account in re-examination, whichwould appear to suggest that it was Mr Lai who had the final say on any particular investment.  Whilst it does not greatly matter,I am now inclined to the view, and so find, that this latter version probably represented the practical reality.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> As to Ms Wu, Mr Jat suggested that her evidence on her dealings with Mr Teng was âplainly to be preferredâ.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> For his part, Mr Smith SC and his team submitted strongly to be contrary, and suggested that it was the evidence of Mr Teng and ofMr Lai which should be accepted.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> He argued that Mr Teng had given a clear and consistent account of events, both in chief and under cross-examination, and that hisexplanation of the plaintiffâs âcautiousâ investment approach was borne out by the available records.  Moreover, Mr Tengâsdescription of the circumstances leading to the earlier purchase of bills issued by Securities One â another part of the Thai OneGroup â could be seen to accord with the plaintiffâs avowed investment approach.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> It is also said that in cross-examination Mr Teng frankly had admitted what he did not know, and readily had conceded that he fullyunderstood the maxim âthe greater the risk, the greater the yieldâ, and that he understood why debt instruments bearing the sovereignrisks of developing countries gave greater return by reason of the investor bearing those risks.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> Mr Smith submitted that Mr Teng had demonstrated that he was very clear as to why the defendant had been at fault in negligentlyadvising the plaintiff to purchase the One Holding bills â the plaintiff had asked for, and the defendant in fact had had moreup-to-date but unfavourable information about the financial situation of One Holding which was not made available to the plaintiff,and that the defendant, in the person of Ms Wu, thus should not have advised in the manner that it did.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> As for Mr Lai, said Mr Smith, he likewise was very clear in his own mind as to the fault of the defendant, namely in not producingupdated (and unfavourable) financial information relating to One Holding, and thereupon should not have advised as it did.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Conclusion on credibility</u></p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> It must be borne firmly in mind that any discussion as to overall âcredibilityâ â or indeed upon the specific findings of factwhich follow â must be made against the hard fact that the structure of the plaintiffâs entire case is premised upon the recollectionof respective staff members of the plaintiff client and the defendant bank as to that which passed between them in separate and whollyundocumented telephone conversations which took place well over a decade ago, in January 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> This feature of the case strikes me as highly significant, if not faintly absurd; given the literally thousands of telephone conversationswhich these two protagonists would have made in the course of their employment, both then and subsequently, any re-creation as towhat in fact had been said in these particular calls can only, in truth, represent a re-creation in the respective minds of the protagonistsas to that which <i>must</i> have been said â a scenario wherein frequently âthe wish is father to the thoughtâ. </p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> This intrusive element of âthat which must have been saidâ also must be viewed through the prism of this extremely hard-foughtadversarial litigation, wherein the plaintiff client seeks to hold the defendant bank responsible (and effectively to obtain an indemnity),well over a decade later, for the significant loss accruing to the plaintiff (and, it should not be forgotten, also suffered by thebank itself) by reason of the unanticipated demise of One Holding, and the consequent dishonour of its financial instruments.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> Against this unpromising backdrop, clearly the main âcredibility issueâ as has arisen lies in the evaluation of the evidenceof the two main witnesses in this case, Mr Teng of the plaintiff and Ms Wu of the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> Having had the opportunity to observe each give their version of events, and having now had the further opportunity to peruse thetranscript of their evidence, I confirm the view â which initially I had formed at the trial â that in this regard the evidenceof Ms Wu is to be preferred against that of Mr Teng, by whose evidence in material part I was not convinced.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> In my view Ms Wu gave her evidence strongly, clearly and honestly.  She is no longer employed by the defendant bank, and in factmade two visits to this jurisdiction during this trial in order first, to hear Mr Tengâs evidence, and subsequently, herself toproffer her own account of events from the witness box. </p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> She evinced what I perceived to be an understandable irritation that her integrity should have been impugned, and that, some tenyears later, she should be said to have done something that she felt strongly that clearly she had not done, namely, specificallyto <i>advise</i> the defendant upon a positive course of action as opposed merely to transmitting to Mr Teng certain objective factual informationâ which was available in the public domain â about the perceived corporate situation One Holding.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> In the circumstances I accept her evidence about the conversations she had had with Mr Teng, and her assertion that she had <i>not</i> advised or persuaded him to purchase One Holding bills absent a third party guarantee â a feature which she accepted, I think,that the plaintiff often had sought in the investments that hitherto it had made in emerging market commercial paper.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> The following exchange between Mr Smith and Ms Wu at the end of Ms Wuâs cross-examination neatly encapsulates the opposing positions,and I specifically accept Ms Wuâs responses as representing the truth [<i>vide</i> Transcript, Day 5, page 159-160]:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ. The gist of the case is, based on what is Mr Tengâs own account of the way in which the two sets of bills of exchange cameto be purchased, that they were recommended by you, that the plaintiff had always asked for and transacted on the basis of therebeing guarantees, which were not available in this case for One Holding, but you reassured the plaintiff that they were unnecessary,because One Holding was a strong company in a sound financial condition at the time.  Thatâs the gist of the plaintiffâs case. It was on the basis of that recommendation and information and advice that they decided to purchase these two sets of bills.  Doyou disagree with that?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.   I disagree.  From my perspective, I just gave all the informations that I know to the customers, so itâs up to them to judgewhether they want to buy or not.

Do you disagreewith that?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I disagree, because I had tried my best and I didnât know that WI Carr had updated information, because I didnât know thatthereâs the existence of Thailand Weekly and I didnât have any contact with WI Carr.  WI Carr was not our in-house analystâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> Accordingly, I accept Ms Wuâs evidence not only on the main issue, but on all significant issues I prefer her evidence to thatof Mr Teng, whom I thought had a fixed and wholly unrelenting mind-set in terms of his apparent ârecollectionâ in his conversationswith Ms Wu.  I also accept and give weight to Mr Jatâs submission that it was noteworthy that when questioned about the clear representationsalleged by Mr Teng in his witness statement to have been made by Mr Wu, Mr Teng became noticeably more tentative in cross-examination;he then referred to Mr Wu having given an âassuranceâ that the bank would have a prudent attitude in selecting and recommendinginvestments, and tellingly chose to emphasise the failure of Mr Wu to provide information as opposed to any firm reiteration of hiswitness statement to the effect that Mr Wu had said that the investment was ârisk freeâ. </p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> I also was relatively unimpressed with Mr Laiâs efforts in the witness box.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> Much of that which he had to say was of course received from that which Mr Teng had told him, since he had had no direct dealingswith Ms Wu, and whilst I do not wish to be unkind, I formed the impression that Mr Lai, together with his subordinate, Mr Teng, bothhad come to court with a clear and united agenda, which was by means of this litigation to attempt to rectify and to vindicate thesole investment default that had occurred on their âwatchâ when they were in charge of investing in commercial paper on behalfof the plaintiff â a default which, as earlier noted, Mr Lai told the court had caused difficulties within the plaintiff and hadincited questions at the plaintiffâs AGM when the loss was revealed in the company balance sheet.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> That this was the sole default suffered by the plaintiff is, I gather, not in dispute, nor are the plaintiffâs broad investmentstatistics: of the some 89 transactions (including the two purchases the subject of this case) in which the plaintiff had enteredinto in emerging market paper during the period from 1993 to 1997, 55 such trades were executed through the defendant bank and thebalance through Citibank, Bankers Trust, Banque Paribas and ABN Amro, with the plaintiff having âarbitragedâ in more than 50%of the some 89 transactions.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> Accordingly, given that this litigation clearly was viewed by Mr Teng and Mr Lai as potentially exculpatory for this not inconsiderableloss to the plaintiff company, I do not find it surprising that these officers clearly had formed adverse (and no doubt deeply-felt)views regarding the defendant, and had convinced themselves that fault, if fault there had been, did not lie with themselves forentering into the fated trades absent being in possession of the fullest and latest available information about One Holding, butinstead with Ms Wu and the defendant bank in allegedly âadvisingâ them so to do.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Findings of fact</u></p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> When the position is analysed, there is relatively little difference between much of the evidence led for the plaintiff and the defendant,and there is not a great deal of fundamental importance that is in dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> I now turn, however, to those factual findings which in my view it is essential for this court to make in order for the proper applicationof established legal principle which has arisen in the multitude of cases â many with widely differing fact situations â whichhave developed in the area of ânegligent adviceâ on the part of banks.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> Accordingly, I set out these specific findings in numbered form below. Such findings do not purport to cover every factual issue,but are confined to those matters which in my view are crucial to a determination of liability in this case.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> On this basis I so find:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i)    That, contrary to its protestations â which became increasingly faint as the case wore on and as the plaintiffâs investmentpattern/<i>modus operandi</i> was explored and elaborated under cross-examination â that in no sense could the plaintiff be characterized as an investment ingÃ©nue. To the contrary.  This office of ârisk managementâ within the plaintiffâs organization, in which were employed Mr Lai andMr Teng as its key operational personnel, clearly had become increasingly adept at sniffing out investments in emerging market commercialpaper offering attractive returns, the purchase of which often was facilitated by means of borrowing at a lower interest rate thanthe investment itself returned, thereby accruing a profit on this interest differential, which appears generally to have been inor around the region of 100 basis points.  This therefore most definitely was not a âwidows and orphansâ situation, nor anythingremotely analogous; in short, in my view the plaintiff well knew the particular investment game it was playing, and the defendantbank â and indeed other banks â were prepared to service these needs of the plaintiff at armâs length in normal commercialcourse;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(ii)  That very frequently, but not invariably, the plaintiff sought, and obtained, third party guarantors for its investments incommercial paper, and I further find that these two purchases of One Holding bills were transactions in which such third party protectionwas <i>not</i> insisted upon by Mr Teng or by his superior, Mr Lai;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(iii)    That Ms Wuâs dealings with the plaintiff, in the person of Mr Teng, were done solely in her capacity as Sales Manager ofthe Asian Fixed Income Department of the defendant, and that there was no element of âprivate bankingâ involved;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(iv)    That Ms Wu specifically had drawn the existence of One Holding, and its availability as a potential investment, to Mr Tengâsattention some months prior to the actual decision by the plaintiff to invest in that companyâs paper; further that it was at thisearlier stage that Ms Wu had sent to Mr Teng relevant information about One Holding, in particular the extract from the FRN Prospectus,which âfloating rate noteâ issue the defendant had been involved in underwriting, and certain research material which had beenprepared by the defendantâs Bangkok research department at or about the time of this FRN issue;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(v)  That as a salesperson Ms Wu was in the habit of faxing to the plaintiff/Mr Teng the daily âquotation sheetsâ of the defendant,upon which the quotation appeared for the One Holding bills, and that on 8<sup>th</sup> January 1997 Mr Teng had responded to the defendantâs daily portfolio list;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(vi)    That it was Mr Teng who had made the initial call to Ms Wu on 8<sup>th</sup> January 1997, and on that day had made the order to purchase the first tranche of US$5 million of such One Holding bills;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(vii)  That in that telephone exchange resulting in that first order from the plaintiff the structural and financial situation ofOne Holding had been discussed, but that in providing the opportunity so to purchase Ms Wu did not purport to âadviseâ the plaintiffto buy this initial tranche of First Holding paper, and this decision solely was that of the plaintiff based upon the factual datarelating to One Holding as then was communicated by Ms Wu;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(viii)    That on the probabilities â although perhaps it does not greatly matter â the purchase by the plaintiff of the secondUS$5 million tranche of One Holding paper was initiated by a telephone call from Ms Wu to Mr Teng of the plaintiff, and that thiscall was prompted by further One Holding paper becoming available in the market, and Ms Wuâs knowledge that the plaintiff earlierhad been a purchaser of this particular investment product;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(ix)    That during this telephone call Ms Wu directly had asked Mr Teng if the plaintiff would be interested in purchasing a furthertranche of One Holding bills of exchange, and that after consulting Mr Lai on the issue Mr Teng had called Ms Wu and asked her ifupdated financial information was available on the company, and that Ms Wu had said words to the effect that currently such informationwas not with her, but that she would try and obtain updated accounts over and above the unaudited accounts for 1996.  I further findthat during this (or indeed the earlier) telephone call Ms Wu did not attempt to persuade or otherwise to ârushâ Mr Teng to purchasethis second set of bills of exchange, and I do <i>not</i> find that Ms Wu persuaded Mr Teng to buy by saying that if the plaintiff did not do so it would âlose a good opportunityâ orwords to the effect that âthere was no need to worryâ about the financial strength of this company;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(x)  That as a consequence of that conversation Mr Teng consulted Mr Lai, and thereafter again he had telephoned Ms Wu and orderedthis second tranche of One Holding bills, and that this order was executed by Ms Wu on behalf of the defendant on the basis of thequotation in the defendantâs quotation sheet, and on the basis of the duration, interest rate and maturity date of the bills asthen advertised therein;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(xi)    That Ms Wu subsequently attempted to, and did exercise her best efforts to find, additional and updated material about thefinancial situation of One Holding to supplement that which the plaintiff already had been given, and that in this regard she hadtelephoned her Bangkok office, but that she was unsuccessful;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(xii)  That as at the date of the sale to the plaintiff of the second tranche of One Holding bills Ms Wu had had in her possessionno additional information about the updated financial situation of One Holding, that she already had given all the information asthen had been available to her to Mr Teng, and that she did <i>not</i> know, and had no reason to believe that, the financial performance of One Holding then was deteriorating, nor that there would beany difficulty in One Holding honouring its obligations in relation to the outstanding bills of exchange upon their maturity date.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Relevant principles: duty of care and/or assumption of responsibility</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> Having thus attempted to come to grips with the principal factual differences between these parties, I turn now to a brief considerationof the law as it has developed in this area.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> A substantial number of decisions in the area of âbank negligenceâ have been cited during the course of final submissions, andI mean no disrespect to leading counsel when I say that not all of these decisions have been of direct assistance in the resolutionof this case.  This is unsurprising, since legal submission obviously attempts to cover all potential factual bases, and to anticipatefindings of fact which ultimately may, or may not, be made by the tribunal seized with hearing the case.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> In terms of applicable principle, I would single out two specific areas which in practice tend to be interlinked: <i>first</i>, the concept of the relevant duty of care, which was much discussed in argument, and <i>second</i>, that of the âassumption of responsibilityâ.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> If I may say so, it is of no assistance whatever to invoke the legal mantra to the effect that the defendant bank, in the personof Ms Wu, âowed a duty of care to the plaintiff purchaserâ, in the person of Mr Teng, and through him, Mr Lai.  This is becausesuch invocation begs the fundamental question as to <i>what in fact</i> Ms Wu was doing, or purporting to do, in terms of her relationship with the plaintiff which had resulted in the purchase of the twosets of One Holding bills of exchange.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> <i>Prima facie</i>, the defendant bank cannot be said to be in breach of the duty of care properly to <i>advise</i> the plaintiff if and in so far (as now has been found to be the situation) as her role as effected was not that of âadviserâ,but was that of âsalesman/womanâ.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> Accordingly, any âduty of careâ upon Ms Wu/Indosuez is co-extensive with the particular role she played in these purchases; thus,in selling these products, Mr Wu had a duty of care <i>qua</i> seller to ensure that, for example, she did not knowingly purvey false or inaccurate information to the plaintiff in relation tothe products in question in a situation in which the plaintiff was unaware of any such falsity or inaccuracy.  But if she did notâadviseâ â in the sense, for example, that âthis was a must-buyâ situation, or that this was âa fail safe purchase evenwithout a guarantorâ or that it was âno riskâ (and it now has been found that she did not) â it follows that she cannot beaffixed with the duties that are co-extensive with any such alternative âadvisoryâ role.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> This appears to be that which Lord Bingham had in mind in <i>Commissioners of Customs &amp; Excise v Barclays Bank</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%201%20AC%20181" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 1 AC 181</a>, at 192E-F, when he observed:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦it seems to me that the outcomes (or majority of outcomes) of the leading cases â¦are in every or in almost every instancesensible and just, irrespective of the test applied to achieve that outcome.  This is not to disparage the value of and need fora test of liability in tortuous negligence, which any law of tort must propound if it is not to become a morass of single instances. <b>But it does in my opinion concentrate attention on the detailed circumstances of the particular case and the particular relationshipbetween the parties in the context of their legal and factual situation as a wholeâ¦â</b>(emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> Hence the signal importance of considering the entirety of circumstances of the case and necessity for specific findings of fact,which is the purview of the âseeing and hearingâ tribunal which, at trial, is in the position to evaluate the information thereinpropounded against the inherent probabilities, not merely in terms of the immediate dispute, but also in light of other relevantcircumstances; I bear in mind, for example, the manner in which the formulation of this particular claim has developed, in that theplea of negligent advice on the part of Ms Wu first saw the light of day no less than two years after the plaintiffâs institutionof these proceedings against the defendant bank.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> Given that liability in this case is dependent upon the specific telephonic exchanges between Mr Teng and Ms Wu in relation to thepurchases of the two sets of One Holding bills, equally of cardinal import is the characterization of the verbal exchanges that tookplace between them. </p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> As Lord Steyn expressed this aspect in <i>Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%20830" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 830</a>, at 835F:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe touchstone of liability is not the state of mind of the Defendant.

There is a tendency, which has been remarked upon by many judges, for phrases like âproximateâ, âfair, just and reasonableâand âassumption of responsibilityâ to be used as slogans rather than practical guides to whether a duty should exist or not. These phrases are often illuminating but discrimination is needed to identify the factual situations in which they provide usefulguidance.  For example, in a case in which A provides information to C which he knows will be relied upon by D, it is useful to askwhether A assumed responsibility to D: <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 465</a>; <i>Smith v Eric S Bush</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20AC%20831" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 AC 831.</a>  Likewise, in a case in which A provides information on behalf of B to C for the purpose of being relied upon by C, it is usefulto ask whether A assumed responsibility to C for the information or was only discharging his duty to B: <i>Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%20830" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 830.</a>  Or in a case in which A provided information to B for the purpose of enabling him to make one kind of decision, it may be usefulto ask whether he assumed responsibility for its use for a different kind of decision: <i>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20AC%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 AC 605.</a>  In these cases in which the loss has been caused by the claimantâs reliance on information provided by the defendant, it is criticalto decide whether the defendant (rather than someone else) assumed responsibility for the accuracy of the information to the Claimant(rather than to someone else) or for its use by the Claimant for one purpose (rather than another).  <b>The answer does not depend upon what the Defendant intended but, as in the case of contractual liability, upon what would reasonablybe inferred from his conduct against the background of all the circumstances of the case</b>.  The purpose of the inquiry is to establish whether there was, in relation to the loss in question, the necessary relationship (orâproximityâ) between the parties and, as Lord Goff of Chieveley pointed out in <i>Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 145</a>, 181, the existence of that relationship and the foreseeability of economic loss will make it unnecessary to undertake any furtherinquiry into whether it would be fair, just and reasonable to impose liability.

It is equally true to say that a sufficient relationship will be held to exist when it is fair, just and reasonable to do so. <b>Because the question of whether a defendant has assumed responsibility is a legal inference to be drawn from his conduct against thebackground of all the circumstances of the case, it is by no means a simple question of fact.  Questions of fairness and policy willenter into the decision and it may be more useful to try to identify these questions than simply to bandy terms like âassumptionof responsibilityâ and âfair, just and reasonableâ.</b>  In <i>Morgan Crucible Co plc v Hill Samuel &amp; Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%20Ch%20295" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] Ch 295</a>, 300-303 I tried to identify some of these considerations in order to encourage the evolution of lower-level principles which couldbe more useful than the high abstractions commonly used in such debates.â  (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> I respectfully agree with and adopt these views.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> In this context I should say, also, that I reject the plaintiffâs strong contention to the effect that âno distinction realisticallycan be madeâ between the provision of data, <i>qua</i> information provider, and advising thereon, <i>qua</i> financial adviser, and that for all practical purposes it is extremely difficult if not impossible to separate these two functions.</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> The plaintiff sought to justify this contention on the basis of certain authorities.  See, for example, <i>Shaddock (L) &amp; Associates</i> <i>Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%2036%20ALR%20385" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 36 ALR 385</a>, wherein Gibbs CJ said (at 390-391):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦the duty [of care], in my opinion, can exist in relation to the giving of information as well as advice.

The situation plainly is not thatno distinction ârealistically can be madeâ between the provision of information and the tendering of advice, but that, as theforegoing authorities recognize, <i>on occasion</i> there is an effective elision between the two concepts such that it is not possible adequately to distinguish between the two âand as such, therefore, the relevant analysis necessarily is wholly âfact-sensitiveâ in any given case.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> More recent reported authorities further address this point, and provide a degree of assistance.</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a> In <i>Bankers Trust International Plc v PT Dharmala Sakti Sejahtera</i> [1995] 4 Bank LR 381, for example, Mance J (as he then was) was faced with a case in which the plaintiff bank, which was suing formonies due and owing from the defendant, had marketed and sold to the Indonesian defendant company certain highly complex derivativeproducts devised by the plaintiff.  In its Defence the defendant complained, <i>inter alia</i>, that in its presentations to the defendant the plaintiff had breached a duty to explain the meaning and effect of the transactionswith reasonable care, and to advise with reasonable care on the risks and financial consequences for the defendant.  Mance J rejectedthis element of the defence, holding that in so far as the plaintiff had made any representations to the defendant regarding thenature and risks of the transaction, it was under a duty not carelessly to misstate facts, and that any proposal should be presentedin a balanced fashion, and should be full and fair.  He said (<i>op cit.</i>, at 394):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn short, a bank negotiating and contracting with another party owes in the first instance no duty to explain the nature or effectof the proposed arrangement to that other party.  However, if the bank does give an explanation or tender advice, then it owes aduty to give that explanation or tender that advice fully, accurately and properly.  <b>How far that duty goes must once again depend on the precise nature of the circumstances and of the explanation or advice which istendered.</b>â  (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> However, the learned judge further held (<i>op cit</i>., at 419) that on the facts before him the parties relationship essentially was commercial, and that the defendant knew that theplaintiff was soliciting custom for its products, and that âthe courts should not be too ready to read duties of an advisory natureinto this type of relationshipâ in a situation wherein the defendantâs officers were experienced in financial matters, and duringpre-contractual meetings had shown every sign of being able to look after the defendantâs interests, and to ask for informationwhen needed; accordingly, Mance J concluded, in this instance there was no broad duty of care of the advisory type for which thedefendant contended, in this context observing:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦before recognizing any such duty the court must consider the well-recognized, overlapping criteria of (a) foreseeability (b)proximity and (c) fairness, justice and reasonableness in the context of the particular relationship and situation and in light ofthe type of harm (here financial loss) against which protection is sought.  <b>The ultimate decision whether to recognize a duty of care, and if so of what scope, is pragmaticâ¦</b>â  (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> Similarly, in the earlier case of <i>The Royal Bank Trust Co</i> <i>(Trinidad) Ltd v Pampellone</i>, <i>op cit.,</i> an appeal to the Privy Council from the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and Tobago â wherein the Privy Council by a majority overturnedthe Trinidad Court of Appeal on the basis that it ought not to have interfered with the factual findings of Roopnarine J, the trialjudge â Lord Goff (whose dictum is quoted herein at paragraph 32) had emphasized the significance of the facts of the case as providingthe essential dividing line between the provision of information and the giving of advice; in that case the Privy Council upheldthe judgeâs decision at first instance dismissing the plaintiffâs action against the bank for losses suffered on two investmentson the basis that the bank simply had provided information rather than giving advice.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> Equally, in the far more recent decision of Gloster J in <i>JP Morgan Chase Bank &amp; ors v Springwell</i> <i>Navigation Corporation</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2008/1186.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] EWHC 1186 (Comm.)</a>, judgment dated 27 May 2008, her Ladyship was dealing with a lengthy and highly complex commercial trial involving a claim by a familyâsinvestment vehicle against a banking group for investment losses suffered on Russian debt instruments, which losses had arisen duringthe Russian debt crisis of 1998.  In an exhaustive judgment of some 742 paragraphs, in which reference is made to the leading authoritiesin this area, her Ladyship conducted an in-depth analysis of the history of the relationship between the parties, and concluded thatthe plaintiff owed the defendant no general duty to advise in the terms pleaded by the defendant, which essentially related to whatinvestments were appropriate for the defendant, and as to the balance and prudence of the defendantâs investment portfolio as awhole.  The learned judge concluded (<i>op cit.,</i> at paras 467-468) that after a full analysis of the evidence, there was nothing within the communications between the parties thatcould be characterized as an âassumptionâ by the private bank defendant of the responsibility to give the plaintiff, Springwell,wide-ranging investment advice as to the structure of its portfolio, the need for diversification or asset allocation.  She continued(at para 468):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âNor, in my judgment, does the evidence show that AP [Adamandios Polemis, a member of the family which beneficially owned the investingfamily companies] thought, or had any reasonable basis to believe, that he could rely or was entitled to be relying, upon the PrivateBank to be giving him wide ranging investment advice, let alone that he was in fact placing any such reliance on the Private Bank. <b>The reality was that Springwell had, of its own volition, with APâs increasing appetite for the substantial returns that investingin emerging markets afforded, adopted a strategy of concentration in emerging markets, and, in particular, in Russian debt instrumentsâ¦</b>â  (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> In addition to the distinct factual echo in that case of the present plaintiffâs âincreasing appetiteâ for the higher yieldto be obtained in emerging market paper, an interesting factual footnote to the <i>JP Morgan v Springwell</i> decision is that the Russian debt instruments with which Springwell there was concerned â the âGKO-Linked Notesâ â appearalso to have been among the emerging market paper which Formosa had purchased during the course of its investment activities in thisarea, although happily there is no evidence that in so doing it had suffered any consequential loss.</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> I also record that the court has been addressed in final submission upon a number of other legal principles, for example, whetherthe âadviserâ has a financial interest in the transaction to which his advice relates, or whether, in the sale as took place,there was a conflict of interest between the defendant bank, which itself held to maturity dishonoured One Holding bills, or whetherthe plaintiff in this instance was other than a sophisticated investor in this type of product.</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a> For my part on this evidence I do not consider that these principles are directly in play in this case, although for the avoidanceof doubt, if and in so far as I be wrong in this conclusion, in any event I should have concluded that the correct answer to thesefurther questions was âNoâ.</p>    <p class="heading">Decision</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> With the foregoing principles in mind, I have reflected at some length upon whether there was any duty of care <i>qua</i> adviser or any âassumption of riskâ by the defendant bank arising by reason of the verbal exchanges on the telephone which passedbetween Mr Teng and Ms Wu with regard to the sales of the two lots of One Holding bills.</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> However, on the evidence before me, and on the findings of fact I have made, I do <i>not</i> consider that the plaintiff successfully has established its case.  In my judgment there is resonance in Mr Jatâs opening salvoto the effect that Formosa is unable to discharge its burden of proof; in my view this is correct â the plaintiff indeed has failedto prove its case.</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> Factually this case most certainly is <i>not</i> the type of situation as occurred in <i>NMFM Property v Citibank (No 10)</i>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282002%29%20186%20ALR%20442" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2002) 186 ALR 442</a> â a decision upon which in final submission leading counsel for the plaintiff also placed strong reliance â wherein the FederalCourt of Australia dealt with a case in which investors in a negative gearing package (via the acquisition of units in a propertytrust) had borrowed 100% of the monies to so invest, and thereafter had got into difficulty in servicing the mortgage facility, andhad obtained compensation from the advisers, the agents of the main lender, who had placed them into this product, the nature ofwhich had been misrepresented by these advisers.  This situation thereafter resulted in the main lender, National Mutual, which hadlent 80% of the funds, pursuing Citibank, which had lent the balance of 20% of the monies so invested under a mortgage product securedon the investorâs/borrowersâ home, for contribution toward the damages so awarded on the basis that this ânegative gearingpackageâ had been promoted through agents acting for <i>both</i> lenders. </p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> Upon this application for contribution the Court held, <i>inter alia,</i> that as the advisers were aware of the investorâs relative inexperience and ought reasonably to have known that the investors wererelying on them and might suffer loss if the information and advice provided were inaccurate or unsound, that the advisers owed aduty of care to them, and that the advisers had breached their duty of care by representing that the package was ârisk freeâand by failing to give warnings, <b><i>but that</i></b> on the particular facts Citibank did not owe the investors a duty of care because the investors did not reasonably rely on Citibankto protect them from the risk of loss, that Citibank did <b>not</b> assume a responsibility to protect them from that risk, and that Citibank had not held out to prospective borrowers that the adviserswere its agents or representatives with authority to act for it in the mortgage transaction â hence the contribution claim in thissegment of this extended litigation was dismissed.  Nevertheless, in his submission Mr Smith SC strongly relied on a passage in thejudgment of the judge hearing the application, Lindgren J, who, in considering the submission by Citibank that the advisers had beenacting as âsalesmenâ, and thus that they were not liable in negligence for âsales representationsâ as distinct from advice,observed as follows (<i>op cit.,</i> at para 400-401):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhile the advisers were not qualified financial planners, they knew that the investors were making important investment decisions. In most cases these decisions were made on the recommendation of the adviser aloneâ¦the presentation involved the adviser obtainingdetailed financial information from an investor and showing how the package would work for him or her.  In those circumstances, Ithink the advisers held themselves out as having sufficient understanding and experience to be able to advise whether the packagewas suitable according to the investorâs circumstances.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><b>In sum, although the presentation was in part a âsales pitchâ, it went beyond that: it was in the nature of serious financial,taxation and investment planning and advice; the advisers intended the investors to receive and understand it in that way; and itwas obvious they were going to do soâ¦</b>â  (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> Whilst I can appreciate Mr Smithâs enthusiasm for this dictum, with which intrinsically it is difficult to disagree, in my viewthe situation in that case is light years away from the factual matrix in this case, and does not begin to persuade me on the instantfacts that the actions of Ms Wu, in interacting with Mr Teng, sufficed to justify the conclusion that by her actions she had becomeâtransmutedâ from âsalespersonâ to âadviserâ. </p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a> Even if this conclusion were incorrect (and I do not consider that it is), I would also have found it difficult to accept that thatin placing the orders which were placed that there was ârelianceâ in the true sense by Mr Teng and/or Mr Lai of the plaintiff,whom on the evidence in this case carefully marshalled and considered the objective data in their possession as had been passed tothem by Ms Wu, and thereafter independently had made the decisions to enter into the two contracts on the basis of the documentarymaterial as then was available to them. </p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> As to such material, it is Ms Wuâs unchallenged evidence, which I accept, was that at the time her <i>only</i> sources of information about One Holding were the Asian Fixed Income hub in Hong Kong, and her AFI contact in the bankâs Bangkokoffice, that she had had no more financial information other that which she already had sent to Mr Teng, and that when she had soughtmore up-to-date financial information as had been requested by Mr Teng, she had been told by her AFI contact in Bangkok that theunaudited Q1 1996 figures were the latest ones available because listed companies in Thailand published their <i>audited</i> financial statements one year late, and that she had had no idea whether Thai public companies were required to report to the StockExchange of Thailand <i>unaudited</i> quarterly results.</p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a> It is also Ms Wuâs evidence, which once again I accept and have no reason to doubt, that to the best of her recollection in termsof the documentary material which she had been able to send to Mr Teng, she merely had translated and discussed with him the descriptionalportions thereof, and in no sense had performed any numerical analysis; indeed, Mr Teng did not suggest that she had done otherwise.</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a> In terms of the plaintiffâs purchase of the One Holding bills, I bear in mind the additional fact, which again is undisputed, thatearlier in 1996 the plaintiff also had invested in, and thereafter successfully had redeemed, bills of exchange issued by SecuritiesOne, then the largest securities company in Thailand, and a sister company of One Holding within the One Group, Ms Wu stating inher evidence â which also was uncontradicted â that Formosa had made this purchase without seeking any information from her inrelation to Securities One or its Group.</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a> Of the myriad of evidential âtailsâ in this case, perhaps the one aspect which has caused some degree of reflection in termsof the overall resolution of this dispute is that Ms Wu has accepted that, when asked so to do by Mr Teng, ultimately she was unableto furnish to the plaintiff up-to-date financial information on the situation of One Holding, which, as part of the One Group wasby common consent at that time a significant group in Thaicommerce, and which prior to its demise I find was regarded within themarket as a strong and reputable institution possessing that which the market then perceived to be a firm and credit-worthy financialbase.</p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a> It seems to me that this element must be of potential significance as much in a purely âsellingâ situation as it obviously isin a purely âadvisoryâ context, and I have pondered on Ms Wuâs evidence that, in response to Mr Tengâs queries â whichappear to have emanated from Mr Lai primarily at the juncture when the plaintiff was considering the further US$5 million purchaseof the One Holding bills â that despite her efforts in this regard Ms Wu had been unable to come up with any additional or moreupdated documentation to supplement the One Holding materiel already in possession of both parties.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a> I have in mind particularly in this context the principle pressed on the Court by Mr Smith to the effect that the duty to ascertainand consider relevant information extends into a duty to supply relevant information when asked: see, for example, dicta of CookeJ in <i>Capital Motors Ltd v Beecham</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20NZLR%20576" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1 NZLR 576</a>, to which counsel also has drawn my attention, wherein the court held that the salesmen in that case had undertaken a duty of careto confirm certain information as to the use of a motor car, but had failed to do so.  In this context, the case of <i>Richardson v Norris Smith Real Estates Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%201%20NZLR%20152" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 1 NZLR 152</a> also was cited, wherein reliance was placed on the dictum of Beattie J (<i>op cit</i>, at 158) that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn <i>Capital Motors Ltd v Beecham</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20NZLR%20576" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1 NZLR 576</a> â¦ the comment was made that although the plaintiff could have obtained the information for himself without much trouble, the judgein the circumstances of the case, where a positive answer was given, did not find that fatal to the plaintiffâs claim.  Nor doI in this case bar the plaintiffâs claim because the search note and further inquiries could have revealed the true position asto the boundaries.  <b>The reason why the Richardsons did not make inquiries is, as I have found, that they got a positive response from Mr Smith.</b>â  (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a> However, these cases are not factually analogous, given that it is common ground that although Ms Wu had not yet made her inquiriesas to prospective updated information on One Holdingâs finance, Formosa nevertheless decided to proceed with its purchase of thesecond tranche of bills without waiting for such further information, and that it is established on the evidence, and indeed I haveso found, that Ms Wu did her best to address locating further information/updated accounts, but in fact was unable to do so.  I alsohave rejected the plaintiffâs case that in the telephone conversations with Mr Teng prior to the execution of the second contractMs Wu had advised that in making this purchase the plaintiff âdid not need to worryâ.</p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a> Accordingly, had it been the case â which I have held that it was not â that Ms Wu in fact did not make best efforts to obtainadditional data, I fail to see how any such failure to obtain such further information can be regarded as in any way causative ofthe plaintiffâs loss, given that it is not in dispute that Messrs Teng and Lai decided to proceed <i>irrespective</i> of such further inquiries, and that Mr Teng executed the order for the second tranche of One Holding bills (and indeed the firsttranche also, in that he apparently had some unanswered queries at the time of the initial sale) without waiting for the resultsof Ms Wuâs search for updated information, and since at the relevant times both parties fully were aware that entry into thesecontracts (and the 2<sup>nd</sup> contract in particular) had taken place on the basis of information which at that time was recognized by both as <i>not</i> to be up-to-date.  In short, the plaintiff, in the persons of Mr Lai and Mr Teng, had been prepared to take the risk in their desireto obtain a higher yield.</p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a> Mr Teng has made very clear in his evidence that since he and Mr Lai had believed Ms Wu would supply such further (and necessarilyupdated) information as soon as possible, the plaintiff had agreed to execute the buy order immediately on 8<sup>th</sup> January 1997, but no case has been made nor formally advanced by the plaintiff that <i>if</i> such additional information indeed had been obtained, and <i>if</i> such had not been to the plaintiffâs satisfaction, that as a consequence the bank then would have agreed to repurchase the billsat the plaintiffâs behest; perhaps the reason is that on the evidence adduced before this court any such conclusion would havebeen no more than mere speculation.  In fact, in cross-examination Mr Lai was unable to give a satisfactory explanation of the decisionto proceed with the purchases irrespective of the admitted lack of updated information; when asked what difference it would havemade had more information been provided after his 8<sup>th</sup> January 1997 sale was concluded, his answer was inconclusive and unconvincing; for example [<i>vide</i> Transcript, Day 3, page 84]:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  You then said that you nevertheless decided to proceed with the purchase and then wait for this information in the meantime. What, if after you bought these bill of exchange, two weeks later, more up-to-date information comes and it shows a disastrous picture,what then?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.    I donât know, because the other party did not provide me with any information â no information was indeed to me â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a> On the plaintiffâs case, therefore, this significant problem of causation could only be circumvented if I had accepted the plaintiffâsevidence, which I have <i>not</i>, to the effect that, although Ms Wu did not have available updated information, nevertheless that specifically she had advised orwarranted to Mr Teng that, as he put it, âOne Holding was in a big group of companies and that the plaintiff did not need to worryâ.</p>    <p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a> Since I have found that Ms Wu made no such assurance or warranty and gave no such âadviceâ, and that, as she herself said inevidence, she believed that she had confined her comments to asserting (as then was objectively known) that there was âa stronglinkageâ of One Holding with Finance One and Securities One, that the major management levels were almost the same, and that shehad heard no negative news about One Holding at the time, if indeed Mr Teng had raised the financial soundness of One Holding, aswas accepted by her that he might have done â âhe might have asked meâ â Ms Wuâs position was that she would have saidthat as far as she was concerned these factors represented the position of One Holding; I also bear in mind her evidence in her witnessstatement to the effect that she would have said: âI also told Mr Teng that Securities One and Finance One are financially strongaccording to the information shown to meâ.</p>    <p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a> It is true that in cross-examination [Transcript, Day 5, page 127] Mr Smith SC strongly taxed Ms Wu for, he asserted, falsely addingthe words âaccording to the information shown to meâ, and suggesting that these words in fact had not been said â âthey havean unnatural sound to themâ â but Ms Wu remained adamant that she had said words like âOn the information shown to me it lookslike itâs financially strongâ â âfinancially soundâ, and in this I am prepared to accept her evidence, since I also acceptwithout hesitation that she was <i>not</i> purveying information that at the time she knew or thought to be wrong or suspected to be in any way incorrect, not least since itis agreed that this conversation was taking place against the backdrop of the partiesâ mutual awareness that updated financialinformation on One Holding was not then available.  Moreover, <i>if</i> I be wrong in this conclusion, and <i>if</i> Ms Wu did not add these words, as the plaintiffâs counsel has suggested, it seems to me that in any event this would be the necessaryand obvious implication from what she had said about the circumstances of One Holding to Mr Teng, given that there is no questionof Ms Wu having concealed any relevant information from the plaintiff.  It is also worth bearing in mind that it was never suggestedby Formosa that One Holding did not look financially strong on the information available to Ms Wu and provided to Mr Teng, that is,information up to and including Q1 1996; this, no doubt, is because if this information had not looked strong, this then would havebeen apparent to both Mr Teng and Ms Lai.</p>    <p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a> It follows, therefore, that hard though Mr Smith SC may wish to bang this particular drum, I am unable to see how this aspect ofthe case suffices to get the plaintiff home â in which connection I repeat the observation that it strikes me as ambitious to runa case entirely on the basis of words which may or may not have been used in undocumented telephone conversations of over a decadeago, and that for all practical purposes the best that fairly can be achieved is to make a determination on the available evidenceof the probable gist of what was said in the relevant context at the relevant time.  In this context I also respectfully agree withthe sage observation of Mance J (quoted herein at paragraph 124) that the courts should not be âtoo readyâ to read duties ofan advisory nature into this type of relationship, a dictum which in my view serves to emphasise the forensic necessity in such casesfor clear and cogent evidence to demonstrate and to establish the vital transition from mere âsales pitchâ to that of âadvice/advisoryguidanceâ.</p>    <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a> Accordingly, at the end of the day I have taken the view, and specifically so find, that in her telephone exchanges with Mr Tengthat Ms Wu, in her capacity as a salesperson within the Asian Fixed Income division of the defendant bank, neither acted nor purportedto act as âadviserâ to the plaintiff, and that in substance she did no more than to reiterate certain objectively available informationthen in the marketplace relating to the perceived financial soundness of One Holding â a perception which, as earlier pointed out,apparently was then shared by the defendant bank itself, which after the sale of the second set of bills to the plaintiff itselfhad purchased a further US$5 million of this commercial paper for its proprietary account, upon the demise of One Holding itselfsuffering corresponding economic loss.</p>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a> Looking at this case in the round, it strikes me as odd that there could be thought to be liability for negligence when in fact thebank employee in this case did no more than provide to the purchaser, in the person of Mr Teng and at his request, such availablepublic information as was known to her at the time regarding a listed company on the Thai stock market.  At bottom, that which itseems to me the plaintiff is endeavouring to achieve in this case is to transform the position of the defendant bank from mere retailseller of Thai commercial paper in normal commercial course â in this instance the One Holding bills â to the wholly unanticipatedstatus of guarantor and/or indemnifier against potential default by One Holding, which is a role the defendant bank neither undertooknor conceived of when these bills of exchange were subject to normal commercial transactions effected between the plaintiff and thedefendant on the 8<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> January 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a> I am also inclined to the view that this litigation has the pronounced âfeelâ of litigation advanced as much to vindicate theactions of the then ârisk management teamâ of the plaintiffâs investment arm â in the persons of Mr Teng and Mr Lai â asto obtain financial redress for the loss that the plaintiff, together no doubt with countless other investors in this market, sufferedupon One Holdingâs commercial default.</p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a> In my judgment, and on the findings of that made by this court, I can see no analytical basis for attributing liability to the defendantin this action, which accordingly must fail, and I so order.</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a> Finally, and for the avoidance of doubt, I reiterate that I have declined to entertain, and certainly I have not purported to judge,any case against the defendant bank which allegedly arose other than through its vicarious liability consequent upon the allegedactions of Ms Wu. </p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a> Thus, for example, so far as I am concerned there is no question of any liability of the defendant being said to arise, for example,through the alleged deficiency of the bank in allegedly failing at the time to have within its possession updated information uponthe financial status and/or updated unaudited accounts of One Holding for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd </sup>quarters of 1996, which is an issue upon which the plaintiff trailed its coat at this trial and as to which allegation the defendantvigorously, and successfully, has objected</p>    <p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a> To the contrary, nor is there any question of liability in this case being said to arise by the bank having in its possession, butthen that to remit to the defendant, relevant updated financial information relating to One Holding.  Speculation apart, there isno evidence whatever â and I so find â that in January 1997 that either Ms Wu or the bank in fact had possession of the One HoldingQ2 financial statement, or the Q3 unaudited statement, audited or unaudited, or for that matter that Ms Wu, or any other bank employee,knew or ought to have known of the existence of such documents.</p>    <p class="heading">Order</p>    <p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a> It follows from the foregoing, therefore, that consequent upon the trial of this action the Order of this court is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i)  The plaintiffâs action against the defendant is dismissed;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(ii)  There is to be a costsâ order <i>nisi</i> that the costs of this action are to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant, such costs to be taxed if not agreed, and that thecostsâ order herein will become absolute unless within 21 days from the date of the judgment herein application is made to varysuch order.</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(William Stone)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr Clifford Smith SC, Mr William Wong and Mr Laurence Li, instructed by Messrs Richards Butler, for the plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr Jat Sew-Tong SC and Mr Alexander Stock, instructed by Messrs Clifford Chance, for the defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2009/25.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
