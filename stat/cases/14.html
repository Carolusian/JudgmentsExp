In other words, whether the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle has any application in the context of a claim under the FSRO;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)     If the correct interpretation of the FSRO is the one as contended by the Respondent, whether there is any infringement ofArticle 105 of the Basic Law;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)     If the correct interpretation of the FSRO is the one as contended by the Applicant and the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle is applicable, whether there is any infringement of Article 105 of the Basic Law.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  As the hearing progressed, it is apparent that on issue (1) the diffence between the parties is whether the compensation shouldbe assessed on the basis of a notional tort in respect of damage occasioned to the land of the Applicant by the <i>de jure</i> reclamation upon the gazette notice of the same (as contended by the Respondent) or a notional purchase of the rights and interestsof the Applicant extinguished by the said reclamation (as contended by the Applicant).  This is the common understanding of the partiesand arguments have been canvassed accordingly.  It may be more accurate to describe the approach contended for by the Applicant asone based on notional purchase instead of one by reference to the principles of contract.  In order to avoid confusion in the future,I shall refer to the two approaches as ânotional tortâ and ânotional purchaseâ respectively.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Hence, issue (2) should be read as: if the correct basis is a notional purchase, whether betterment arising from the scheme relatingto the 1995 Authorization can be taken into account.  In other words, whether the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle has any application in the context of a claim under the FSRO.</p>    <p class="heading">Facts relevant for the determination of the preliminary issues</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The relevant facts are basically those set out in the Statement of Agreed Facts.  There are some supplements in the course of thehearing.  I shall now set out those relevant facts below. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In 1970, the Applicant acquired Lot 22 in DD356, Pennyâs Bay, Lantau, Hong Kong [âLot 22â] by way of an Agreement and Conditionsof Exchange dated 2 January 1970 registered in Tsuen Wan Land Registry as New Grant No 4706 [âthe Grantâ].  Pursuant to the Grant,the Applicant was granted a Lease of Lot 22 for a term of 99 years less the last 3 days commencing 1 July 1898, the term of whichwas subsequently extended to 30 June 2047 by the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories Leases (Extension) Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150">Cap 150</a>). </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Lot 22 was about 2,010,000 sq ft (or 186,734 sq m) in area and is shown on Plan I annexed to the Grant [âPlan 1â].  The leasedarea was coloured red in Plan 1.  It extended beyond the existing coastline at the time of the grant.  In other words, the leaseholdinterest of the Applicant extended partly into areas which were foreshore and possibly seabed at the time of the grant.  However,after the reclamation works done pursuant to clause 6, the coastline had been changed and the only parts of the leased areas thatwere submerged under the water were the four elongated strips between points C and D used by the Applicant as slipways and launch-ways.  To that extent, the Applicant had a leasehold interest in the seabed at the time of the <i>de jure</i> reclamation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Under clause 3(a) of the Special Conditions of the Grant, the Lot was to be used for general industrial and/or godown purposes excludingany offensive trade, and no less than 285,000 sq ft of the Lot shall be used for shipbuilding purposes only.  There were also restrictionson the erection of any building on the Lot: clause 3(b) and (c).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Under clause 6 of the Special Conditions of the Grant, the Applicant shall form and reclaim certain areas as delineated on PlanI and shall construct and maintain, for the protection of the area after the reclamation work was completed, a seawall or rubblemound along the boundary of the new sea frontage at points A-B, B-C, C-D, and D-E as specified in Plan 1, and shall construct landingsteps between points E-F as delineated on Plan 1.  The Applicant shall be responsible for maintaining the seawall or rubble moundand the landing steps at its own expense and to the satisfaction of the District Commissioner, New Territories. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Pursuant to clause 6, the reclamation was done and a seawall was constructed along the new sea frontage.  Along points C-D of theforeshore a slipway and several launch-ways were constructed and these structures extended into the foreshore and sea-bed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Various landing steps were constructed along the seawall.  Mooring posts were erected along the seawall.  There is no specific provisionin the Grant for the mooring posts.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Applicant also built a jetty near point A.  The Grant did not have any express provision relating to this jetty.  However, thejetty was shown in the approved lay-out plan submitted pursuant to Special Condition 5.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Applicant enjoyed limited right of access to the sea from its land.  Clause 31 thereof provided that no access to or from thesea from or to Lot No. 22 shall be permitted except along that boundary marked A-B, B-C, C-D, D-E on Plan 1 annexed to the said SpecialConditions.  The approximate length of the boundary so marked was 3,150 feet.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  By a Tenancy Agreement dated 8 December 1975, the Lot was let to Cheoy Lee Shipyards Limited for the purpose of shipbuilding andrelated purposes at a monthly rental of $10,000, which was increased to $40,000 with effect from 1 April 1984. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Throughout the period of the Applicantâs ownership, Lot 22 was not accessible by vehicles but was accessible on foot.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On 11 March 1994, the Director of Lands, pursuant to section 5 of the Foreshore and Seabed (Reclamations) Ordinance [âFSROâ],published a Gazette Notice No GN 847 delineating and describing a proposed reclamation of foreshore and sea-bed situated at PennyâsBay to provide for, <i>inter alia</i>, land for the construction of Container Terminals 10 and 11 [CT 10 and CT 11], land for industry, back-up areas for container terminalsand associated infrastructure [âthe Container Terminal Schemeâ].</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  On 24 March 1995, a draft Outline Zoning Plan (OZP) No S/I-NELP/1 outlining the development plan for the Container Terminal Schemewas published.  The area to be reclaimed at Pennyâs Bay, including part of Lot 22, was zoned for industrial use, container terminals,container back-up area, a business park, etc.  The majority area of Lot 22 was zoned for industrial use, with the rest mainly forâGovernment/Institution/Communityâ, âOther Specified Use (Service Area)â and âRoadâ uses.  There would be a new accessroad linking the North Lantau Expressway with the container terminal sites.  This access road would run through Lot 22. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  On 25 April 1995, the Secretary for Transport, pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/370/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 8(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/370" class="autolink_findacts">Roads (Works, Use and Compensation) Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/370">Cap 370</a>), published in the Gazette Notice No GN 1450 a road scheme associated with the Container Terminal Scheme.  The notice provideddescription of the general nature of the proposed road works. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  On the same day, the then Governor in Council, pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/370/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 8(1)(c)</a> of the FSRO, authorized a proposal to reclaim about 1260 hectares of the foreshore and sea-bed at Pennyâs Bay at Lantau Islandfor the purpose of construction of CT10 and CT11 and associated infrastructure.  The authorization was published in Gazette NoticeNo GN 1574 dated 5 May 1995 [â1995 Authorizationâ] pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/370/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(1)(b)</a> of the FSRO. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In or about August 1999, the Government changed its plan and decided not to proceed with the Container Terminal Scheme.  The roadscheme, which was a necessary element of that project and which has never been implemented, was aborted.  Instead, the Governmentdecided to develop a theme park at the Pennyâs Bay area.  On 13 August 1999, an amended draft OZP (S/I-NEL/5) was published inwhich the Container Terminal Scheme was amended to a proposed Theme Park. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  By a Gazette Notice No GN 5917 dated 15 October 1999, the Government, pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/370/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5</a> of the FSRO, gave notice to delineate approximately 330 hectares of foreshore and sea-bed situated at Pennyâs Bay for reclamationin order to provide approximately 290 hectares of land for development and construction of a theme park, a water recreation centre,resort hotels, railways, ferry piers, road, facilities and other associated infrastructure and the construction of about 3,500 metresof seawall.  The reclamation covered a smaller area of the sea than that under the 1995 Authorization. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  On 28 March 2000, the Chief Executive in Council withdrew the authorization of the reclamation gazetted on 5 May 1995 under the1995 Authorization [â2000 Withdrawalâ].  This decision was published in Gazette Notice No GN 2230 dated 10 April 2000. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Also on 28 March 2000, the Chief Executive in Council authorized further reclamation as announced by the aforesaid Gazette NoticeNo GN 5917 under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/370/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 8</a> of the Ordinance [â2000 Authorizationâ].  This decision was published in Gazette Notice No GN 2231 dated 14 April 2000.  The2000 Authorization extinguished whatever right, if any, of the Applicant remained over the foreshore and sea-bed that was not extinguishedby the 1995 Authorization. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The Theme Park project envisaged the acquisition of Lot 22 from the Applicant.  On 26 March 2001, Cheoy Lee Shipyards Limited surrenderedits tenancy to the Applicant.  By a Deed made on 3 April 2001, the Applicant surrendered Lot 22 to the Hong Kong SAR Government. The surrender was made without prejudice to the Applicantâs claim for compensation under the FSRO.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  By a Deed of Surrender executed on 3 April 2001, Lot 22 was surrendered to the Government. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In 1995 and at all times thereafter until the surrender of the lease to the Government on 3 April 2001 Lot 22 was used by CheoyLee Shipyards Limited for shipyard purposes utilizing the marine access.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The only marine rights of the Applicant not extinguished by the 1995 reclamation, and so which remained to be extinguished by the2000 reclamation, were rights in respect of the area of sea-bed included in the later but not in the earlier reclamation.

Forreasons to be elaborated below, in a context where the use of the foreshore or sea-bed by the Applicant had always been in connectionwith his land adjacent to the foreshore, I do not think one can meaningfully assess the injurious affection to the foreshore or sea-bedwithout any consideration of the injurious affection of the land adjacent to it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Counsel have taken the Tribunal through several pieces of English as well as Hong Kong legislation embodying the concept of injuriousaffection and cases decided thereon.  I do not intend to conduct a comprehensive survey of the legislative history and the casesin this judgment.  However, Mr Chang urged the Tribunal to bear in mind the scope of compensation in the precursors of the FSRO sincethe latter was put in place to serve the same functions as those two earlier ordinances, viz. the Foreshores and Sea Bed Ordinance1950 and the Public Reclamations and Works Ordinance 1956.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Section 3(3) to (5) of the Foreshores and Sea Bed Ordinance 1950 provided for compensation to a person whose property may be <i>injuriously affected</i> by a Crown lease of the foreshore and sea bed âby reason of the access of such property to the sea being interfered withâ.  Hence,the affection that the legislature had in mind was very much tied in with the interference with the claimantâs right of accessfrom his land to the sea.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Section 5 of the Public Reclamations and Works Ordinance 1956 provided for the extinguishment of rights upon publication of authorizationof an undertaking involving reclamation over the foreshore and seabed.  The rights were described as âall public and private rightsof navigation or fishing and all public and private rights of access, user, possession or occupation, and all other public or privaterights (if any) in, upon or over the Crown foreshore, seabedâ.  Section 6(2) dealt with the submission of  âa claim for compensationin respect of the extinguishment of such private rightâ.  Further, Section 8 made it clear that the ordinance did not recognizeor create any greater right or claim to compensation than but for the ordinance would exist and enforceable by an action in the courtif the Government were a private person.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Whilst these earlier ordinances may shed some light in case of doubts as regards the meaning of a particular part of the FSRO, theprimary task of the Tribunal is to apply the FSRO and to determine the amount of compensation in respect of any interest, right oreasement of the claimant in or over any foreshore or sea-bed injuriously affected by the reclamation.  As I understand, Mr BarnesQC does not dispute that the interest, right or easement referred to in Section 13(4)(b) of the FSRO can encompass all the rightsand interests referred in Section 3 of the Foreshores and Sea Bed Ordinance 1950 and in Section 5 of the Public Reclamations andWorks Ordinance 1956.  Counsel also accepted that all those rights were extinguished under Section 10(1)(a) of the FSRO.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The contentious issue is what is the meaning of injurious affection and this is crucial to the resolution of the first preliminaryissue.</p>    <p class="heading">The meaning of injurious affection</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Mr Barnes put in the forefront of his submission the following dicta of Lord Hoffmann in <i>Wildtree Hotels Ltd v Harrow LBC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 AC 1</a> at p.16,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThis reasoning assumes that compensation under section 10 of the 1965 Act can only be assessed by considering the capital valueof the Claimantâs land at a given date and deducting that sum from an estimate of what its value would have been if it had notbeen injuriously affect.  But there is nothing in the section which says that compensation for damage to the land must be calculatedin this way.  The Claimant is simply entitled to compensation for the damage to his land.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  That case was decided under the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 and section 10 of the Act provides for compensation in respect of landwhich has been taken for or injuriously affected by the execution of some public works.  The land of the claimant in the case wasnot taken and the claim was based on injurious affection.  Lord Hoffmann alluded to some basic principles at p.7 of the report. After making the distinction between a case where land has been taken and where it has not, His Lordship made the following observationsregarding injurious affection at C to E,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe term âinjuriously affectedâ connotes âinjuriaâ, that is to say, damage which would have been wrongful but for the protectionafforded by statutory powers.  In <i>In re Penny and South Eastern Railway Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281857%29%207%20E%20%26%20B%20660" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1857) 7 E &amp; B 660</a>, 669 Lord Campbell said, âunless the particular injury would have been actionable before the company had acquired their statutorypowers, it is not an injury for which compensation can be claimed.â  In practice, this means that a claimant has to show that butfor the statute he would have had an action for damages for public or private nuisance.  But a public nuisance, such as an interferencewith the use of a public highway, is a wrong to the public as a whole and the ordinary common law remedy was a prosecution on indictment. To support an action for damages, the plaintiff has to prove that he suffered particular damage greater than that suffered by membersof the public in general.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Mr Barnes submitted the same principles should apply in the present instance.  There must be an actionable wrong but for the statutoryauthorization before a claimant can ask for compensation for the injurious affection.  The fair compensation to redress such affectionmust be the equivalence of what a claimant could have got by way of damages in respect of the notional actionable wrong.  This flowsfrom the principle of equivalence, see <i>Horn v Sunderland Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1941%5d%202%20KB%2026" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1941] 2 KB 26</a> at p.49 and <i>Director of Buildings and Lands v Shun Fung</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20111" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 111</a> at p.125.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Counsel contended that as the Applicantâs land was not taken under the 1995 Authorization, the pertinent question is what wasthe damage to the land occasioned by the same.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Mr Chang did not accept this is a case where there is no taking of property.  He submitted that marine rights enjoyed by the Applicantand the structures built on the foreshore and seabed were proprietary in nature and notwithstanding that land was not resumed underthe 1995 Authorization, there was a taking of proprietary interests and the compensation for such taking should not be measured byreference to the damage to the land.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  This seems to me to be the fundamental issue between the parties and I propose to deal with it in the next section.  Before I embarkon such discussion, it is however useful to remind ourselves briefly on some basic principles regarding statutory compensation. As Mr Chang emphasized repeatedly in the course of his submission, the FSRO should be interpreted, as far as possible, in line withArticle 105 of the Basic Law, viz. there must be a right to compensation for lawful deprivation of property of individuals and suchcompensation shall correspond to the real value of the property concerned at the time.  The FSRO does give the Applicant a rightto compensation for the extinguishment of its marine rights.  The question is whether a measure by reference to injurious affectionprovides compensation corresponds to the real value of the property concerned at the time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  In my judgment, there is no difference in substance between the real value test laid down in Article 105 and the fair compensationgenerated from the principle of equivalence succinctly set out by Lord Nicholls in <i>Director of Buildings and Lands v Shun Fung</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20111" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 111</a> at p.125,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe purpose of these provisions, in Hong Kong and England, is to provide fair compensation for a claimant whose land has been compulsorilytaken from him.  This is sometimes described as the principle of equivalence. â¦ a claimant is entitled to be compensated fairlyand fully for his loss.  Conversely, and built into the concept of fair compensation, is the corollary that a claimant is not entitledto receive more than fair compensation: a person is entitled to compensation for losses fairly attributable to the taking of hisland, but not to any greater amount.  It is ultimately by this touchstone, with its two facets, that all claims for compensationsucceed or fail.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  That was said in the context of the Crown <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124" class="autolink_findacts">Lands Resumption Ordinance</a>.  However, the ultimate touchstone with the two facets of fair compensation is equally applicable with regard to compensation forthe extinguishment of marine rights.  The real value of the marine rights is to be measured with reference to the real loss sufferedby the Applicant, not something more nor something less.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  At p.126, Lord Nicholls went on to refer to three conditions that must be satisfied in the assessment of a fair compensation.  Ithink they are equally applicable in the present context.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)     There must be a causal connection between the resumption or acquisition and the loss in question (p.126A);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)    To qualify for compensation the loss must not be too remote (p.126B to F);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)     Those who claim recompense is expected to behave reasonably to eliminate or reduce the loss and to avoid unreasonable expenditurebeing incurred (p.126F toH).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The principle of equivalence was applied by the Court of Final Appeal in <i>Director of Lands v Yin Shuen Enterprises Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%202%20HKLRD%20399" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 2 HKLRD 399.</a>  A couple of points discussed in that judgment are relevant for present purposes.  First, the ultimate purpose is to arrive at afair compensation in accordance with the principle of equivalence and there are cases where departure from a measure based on openmarket value is justified.  Second, as Lord Millett NPJ observed at p420I, Article 105 does not require compensation to be basedon the open market value but on its real value.  Further down at p.420J, compensation is only required to be paid for the interestacquired.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  This principle can be regarded as the golden thread in all legislations governing compensation.  Whether under the common law approachof statutory construction or Article 105 of the Basic Law, I am of the view that this must be applicable in the construction of theFSRO.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Hence, the concept of injurious affection should be interpreted in a way to arrive at a fair compensation in accordance with theprinciple of equivalence.  Unlike other statutes providing for compensation (e.g. the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/370" class="autolink_findacts">Roads (Works, Use and Compensation) Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/370">Cap.370</a>), the FSRO does not give much guidance on how the compensation would be measured.  It only says that it would be measuredby reference to the injurious affection.  I will discuss later what this means in the light of the authorities.  But whatever itmeans, it has to be consistent with the principle of equivalence.        </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The rights, interests and easement enjoyed by the Applicant in or over the foreshore and seabed prior to the 1995 Authorization</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Mr Chang fairly agreed that we are not dealing with any fishing rights in the present case.  There is no question of any profitin gross here.  Plainly, all the rights, interests and easement enjoyed by the Applicant are appurtenant to the land on which theApplicant, or more accurately its tenant, ran its shipyard business.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Mr Barnes identified those rights, interests and easement as follows,</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     the private right of access from the Applicantâs land to the sea;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)    the public right of navigation at the sea.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Mr Chang submitted the Applicant had other interests which were proprietary in nature.  Counsel identified the following,</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     the right over the landing steps;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)    the right over the jetty;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)     the right over the slipways;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d)    the right of mooring.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In my judgment, with the exception of the slipways, the other structures identified by Mr Chang do not amount to any proprietaryinterest in or over any foreshore or sea-bed.  There was no grant of proprietary interest in or over the foreshore or sea-bed inthe Grant pertaining to these structures.  They were simply incidental to and necessary for the exercise of the right of access thatstemmed from the grant of a piece of land adjoining the sea.  Mr Chang submitted that the Applicant could sue for trespass in respectof any damages done to these structures.  I am prepared to accept that the Applicant had a proprietary interest in the structures. However, it does not follow that the Applicant has acquired a proprietary interest <i>in or over the foreshore or sea-bed</i>.       </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Mr Chang submitted such rights are proprietary interest as if they were some kinds of incorporeal hereditaments.  But incorporealhereditament can only be conveyed by deed as it âlies in grantâ (see <i>Megarry &amp; Wade The Law of Real Property</i>, 6<sup>th</sup> Edn. Paras.18-002 and 18-051).  There was no specific grant in respect of the jetty.  Special Condition Clause 6(a) of the Grantimposed an obligation on the part of the Applicant to construct the landing steps (as in the case of the seawall or rubble mound)as part of the reclamation works and bearing in mind the natural right of access, I do not read that as a grant of an additionalincorporeal hereditament to the Applicant.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The private right of access to the sea is not an easement.  I agree with the submission of Mr Barnes that this right of access doesnot depend on any specific grant from the Crown.  It is an inherent incidence of the leasehold interest created in the land adjoiningthe sea.  This point was clearly expressed by Parker J in <i>Portsmouth Borough Waterworks Co. v London Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281909%29%2026%20TLR%20175" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1909) 26 TLR 175</a> in the context of a riparian property,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âWhen a riparian owner sells part of his estate, including land on the banks of a natural stream, it is not necessary to make anyexpress provision as to the grant or reservation of the ordinary rights of a riparian proprietor.  These rights are not easementsto be granted or reserved as appurtenant to what is respectively sold or retained, but are parts of the fee simple and inheritanceof the land sole or retained.  If it be desired to alter or modify these rights, it can only be done by the grant or reservationof such rights in the nature of easements as the nature of the case may require.  If no such rights are granted or reserved the vendorremains, and the purchase becomes, a riparian owner, and retains or acquires all the ordinary rights of a riparian owner.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In this regard, there is no distinction between access to tidal river and access to the sea, see <i>AG of the Straits Settlement v Wemyss</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281888%29%2013%20AC%20192" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1888) 13 App Cas 192</a> and <i>Coppinger v Sheehan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1906%5d%201%20IR%20519" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1906] 1 IR 519.</a>   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Since the Applicant enjoyed such natural right of access as an incidence of its leasehold interest in Lot 22, there was no needfor any additional incorporeal hereditament to be granted in order to permit the landing steps and the jetty to be built.  Againstsuch background, in the absence of any evidence of an intention to make a specific grant of some incorporeal hereditament, the permissiongiven by the Crown for the construction of the jetty and the landing steps was consistent with no such incorporeal hereditament havingbeen granted.  In other words, there was no implied grant.    </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  The slipways are different because the leased area identified in the Grant included the four elongated strips of sea-bed betweenpoints C and D.  As explained above, the Applicant had a leasehold interest in those parts of the sea-bed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  More importantly in the context of injurious affection, the landing steps, jetty and slipways did not serve any useful purposesother than as facilities for the exercise of the right of access from Lot 22 to the sea or vice versa.  In reality, it is difficultto see how these structures could be of any value to the Applicant independent from the use of Lot 22.  It is unthinkable for someoneto take an assignment of the leasehold interest regarding the slipways if he had no right to use Lot 22.  As a matter of law, giventhe nature of the interest of the Applicant in the jetty and the landing steps, they could not be assigned in gross separately fromthe interest in Lot 22. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The right of mooring is incidental to the public right of navigation, see <i>AG v Wright</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1897%5d%202%20QB%20318" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1897] 2 QB 318</a> and <i>Denaby v Anson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1911%5d%201%20KB%20171" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1911] 1 KB 171.</a>  In the former case, Lord Esher MR said this with regard to the right of mooring at p.321,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThis is not a right of any individual: it is a general right to use the waters for navigation in any ordinary way, and to anchorâ¦eitherby means of an anchor or of a mooring.

This is the fundamentalpremise for his contention that the notional purchase approach must be the correct one.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  On the other hand, whilst Mr Barnes accepted that in cases of compulsory acquisition of land, the relevant legislation usually providesfor compensation for the value of the land taken (as in the case of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 10(2)(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124" class="autolink_findacts">Lands Resumption Ordinance</a>), counsel submitted that we are not dealing with such a situation because Lot 22 was not resumed under the 1995 Authorization.  TheApplicant still retained its leasehold interest over Lot 22.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Mr Barnes submitted that the concept of injurious affection embodied in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 13(4)(b)</a> of the FSRO provides a fair compensation for the damage caused to the Applicant.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Based on the above analysis, although the 1995 Authorization did take away certain rights of the Applicant (since all the rights,interests and easements were extinguished under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 10</a> of the FSRO), only the leasehold interest over the seabed pertaining to the slipways can strictly be regarded as proprietary interestbeing taken away.  More importantly, none of the rights or interests taken away had any independent value to the Applicant apartfrom the value derived from the exercise of such rights for the benefit of Lot 22.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  If one adopts a wide meaning for property to include choses in action, the extinguishment of these rights of the Applicant can beregarded as the taking away of property.  But for <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 10</a>, the Applicant would be able to sue the Government for damages occasioned by the deprivation of the right of access and the rightof navigation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  On the other hand, it can equally be said that there had not been any taking of land because Lot 22 was retained by the Applicantand it could utilize the land for purposes not requiring access to the sea. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  In my view, the key question is not whether there had been any taking of property or taking of land.  The key issues should be whatmeasure of compensation is provided for under the FSRO and whether such measure fairly compensates the Applicant in accordance withthe principle of equivalence.</p>    <p class="heading">Notional purchase or notional tort?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  I agree with the submission of Mr Barnes that on the authorities cited (see <i>Ricket v Metrtopolitan Railway Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281867%29%20LR%202%20HK%20175" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1867) LR 2 HK 175</a>; <i>Metropolitan Board of Works v McCarthy</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281874%29%20LR%207%20HL%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1874) LR 7 HL 243</a>; <i>Caledonian Railway Co v Walkerâs Trustees</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281882%29%207%20AC%20259" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1882) 7 App Cas 259</a>; <i>Wildtree Hotels Ltd v Harrow LBC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 AC 1)</a>, injurious affection is a concept adopted in calculating compensation by reference to damages occasioned to a claimant as a resultof certain public works or public utilities authorized by statutes.  In other words, the formula imports a notional tort approachin the determination of compensation.  Although I would not rule out the reference to the market value of the extinguished interestas a possible way to work out the damage occasioned by the public works in an appropriate case when the damages suffered is properlycrystallized on a particular date, this is not the primary approach.  The tribunal has to assess the damages by asking what damageshas the claimant suffered as a result of the undertakings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  By adopting this formula in the FSRO, the legislature must be taken to have intended the same approach to be adopted by the LandsTribunal in determining the compensation under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 13(4)(b).</a>  I do not discern any justification to give a different construction to the âinjurious affectionâ referred to in that sectionas compared with those laid down in other compensation cases and statutes.  This seems to be in line with the underlying assumptionof Judge Cruden in <i>Chan Sik Cheung v Director of Lands</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%203%20HKC%20199" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 3 HKC 199</a> at p.207 H to I.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  In particular, I reject the submission that a different construction is called for by reason of the fact that the FSRO was meantto consolidate two earlier ordinances including the Public Reclamations and Works Ordinance 1956.  I do not think the 1956 Ordinancemandated a different approach, viz. by reference to a notional purchase on the date of extinguishment.  Reading Sections 6(2) and8 of that ordinance together, I am of the view that the notional tort approach is perfectly consistent with the ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  At this juncture, I must briefly deal with two cases decided under the 1956 Ordinance that have been cited by counsel.  In <i>Li Ling Shi v The Government of Hong Kong</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%20HKLR%20595" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] HKLR 595</a>, Judge Huggins (as he then was) simply proceeded on a basis agreed by the parties in assessing compensation by reference to a notionalpurchase approach.  But the learned judge also reiterated that the claimants were entitled to be compensated for what they are tolose --- no more and no less and one must not entirely close oneâs eyes to the future.  At p.605, the following was said,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ one does not have to value the right on the basis that the <i>status quo</i> would continue indefinitely.  We do not live in a static environment and any valuer must have regard to foreseeable, and even tolikely, developments in the future.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  In <i>In re Trustees of the Estate of Tsang Hung-tim</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20HKLR%2068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] HKLR 68</a>, the issue before the Full Court was not whether compensation should be assessed on the notional purchase or notional tort approach. Neither was the court concerned with the question whether the quantum of compensation was crystallized with reference to the stateof affairs as at the date of extinguishment.  The appeal on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> applicant was abandoned and the issue in the 2<sup>nd</sup> applicantâs appeal focused on whether he, as tenant of the godown, had a right to claim compensation.  There was no dispute asregards the approach in assessing the quantum for the 2<sup>nd</sup><sup> </sup>applicant (see p.77).  The contention of the Government was set out at p.74, viz. that the 2<sup>nd</sup> applicant was caught by the exception embodied in the expression âapart from the uses to which any particular owner or occupiermight put itâ laid down in <i>McCarthy</i>.  This argument was rejected by Mills-Owens J on two grounds,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)     The exception did not apply because there was no reference to injurious affection in the 1956 Ordinance and the ordinancecontemplated compensation to be provided for the taking of marine rights  (p.74-75);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)    The marine right enjoyed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> applicant was a right attached to the land, enured to the advantage of whoever occupying the land, not merely the particular businessof the 2<sup>nd</sup> applicant (p.75-77).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  No-one can gainsay this decision.  But it does not follow from that judgment that the notional purchase approach must be adoptedin assessing the quantum of compensation for the taking of marine rights.  I shall explain below why it might not be too useful torefer to the taking of some incorporeal rights to define what a claimant should be compensated for.  It should be noted that in theUthwatt Report cited by Mills-Owens J, the distinction is between cases where no lands are taken and where lands are taken.  Thetaking of incorporeal rights falls within the former category.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  The notional tort approach gives rise to a fair compensation in accordance with the principle of equivalence.  What the statutoryauthorization took away is a right to claim against the government in respect of the damages caused to a claimant by reason of thereclamation and the notional tort approach generates exactly the same amount of compensation for a claimant as if he brings a claimfor damages in court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Section 13(4)(b) refers to the injurious affection of any interest, right or easement of the claimant in or over any foreshore orsea-bed.  Mr Chang submitted that there is a distinction between injurious affection of the land adjacent to the seabed or foreshoreand injurious affection of interest, right or easement in or over the seabed or foreshore.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  In my judgment, whilst such distinction can be made in respect of cases where a claimant did not hold any interest in the land adjacentto the seabed or foreshore and he suffered loss occasioned by a reclamation solely by reason of his activities at the seabed or foreshoreunrelated to any interest in land (as in the cases of fisheries rights or oyster farming), there is no such distinction here.  Asstated earlier, my finding is that the Applicantâs rights and interests over the seabed and foreshore did not have any independentvalue apart from the value derived from the exercise of such rights for the benefit of Lot 22.  In those circumstances, for the Applicant,the injurious affection of any interest, right or easement in or over any foreshore or seabed is the same as the injurious affectionof the land.  In any event, I do not regard the drawing of such distinction as having much relevance in terms of assessment of afair compensation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Mr Chang submitted that what had been taken from the Applicant under the 1995 Authorization was the marine rights of the Applicantand such rights were proprietary in nature.  I have analysed the Applicantâs rights that were extinguished by the 1995 Authorization. Given my conclusion that they had no independent value apart from the adverse effect on the land, it may not be particularly usefulto ask whether they were proprietary in nature or otherwise.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  In substance, the argument of counsel is based on the following premises,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)     If there is a taking of proprietary interest, there cannot be a fair compensation unless compensation is calculated on thebasis of the market value of such interest at the time of taking;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)     The value of such interest is to be calculated by reference to the difference between the value of Lot 22 attached with suchinterest and the value of Lot 22 without such interest at the time of taking.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  As to (1), whilst I can see the logic of that proposition if the interest taken away is land in the physical sense, I doubt if itis correct if the interest taken away, be it proprietary as in the case of incorporeal hereditament or otherwise, is something thatis appurtenant to another piece of land which is retained by the claimant.  There is simply no meaningful way to measure the valueof that interest without reference to the effect of the taking of that interest on the retained land. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Mr Chang referred to cases where an affected person does not have any interest in the land adjacent to the sea-bed or foreshore. First, we are not dealing with that sort of situation.  Second, if the rights relied upon were public rights, viz. a right exercisableby a claimant as a member of the public, Judge Cruden decided in <i>Chan Sik Cheung</i> that no compensation could be claimed under the FSRO.  Mr Chang referred to the right to sue for public nuisance if a claimant canestablish âparticularâ damage over and above other members of the public.  If such a claim is viable, a claimant who can proveâparticularâ damages will be able to obtain fair compensation under the notional tort approach under the concept of injuriousaffection.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  In putting forward (2), the Applicant in fact recognized that there is no independent value for the rights and interests extinguishedapart from the value derived from the exercise of such rights for the benefit of Lot 22.  The approach of the Applicant involvesthe notional sale of Lot 22 at the time of extinguishment in order to derive the market value of the extinguished rights and interests.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  In other words, it is built into the Applicantâs equation an underlying assumption that the effect on Lot 22 is crystallized atthe time of extinguishment.  If the statutory formula provides for the determination of the market value of the resumed propertyat the time resumption, that would be the correct.  However, this is not the formula under the FSRO.  Why should the Tribunal assumethat the value of the damage to the land occasioned by the extinguishment of the Applicantâs interests and rights over and in theforeshore and seabed has to be crystallized when this is not the normal rule for measuring damages?  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  If a claimant has not sold the land (as in the present case) upon the reclamation or if the reclamation could not have said to havecaused the sale of the land in accordance with the usual principles governing assessment of damages for tort, why should he be compensatedon the basis that the loss was crystallized as if the land was sold on a particular date? More fundamentally, if a claimant retainedthe land and if the damages suffered by him were less than those worked out by reference to a notional purchase on a particular date,what is the justification for giving him such a windfall?  To allow that would indeed be inconsistent with the principle of equivalence. Such a claimant would get more than what he has lost.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  In my judgment, it is only when it is reasonably foreseeable that the extinguishment of the relevant rights and interests wouldcause the Applicant to sell its land and the Applicant had actually sold its land that the compensation could properly be assessedby reference to the approach advocated by the Applicant.  In that scenario, the notional tort approach would arrive at the same resultas the notional purchase approach.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Mr Chang relied on the statutory scheme regarding the filing of a claim to support his contention that compensation must be crystallizedby reference to the date of extinguishment.  I do not think that take us further.  Whilst a claim has to be made within the timelimit (not less than one year) specified by the Director and it has to state the sum of money that the claimant is willing to acceptin full and final settlement together with particulars to substantiate the claim (Sections 9(2)(c) and 12(1) and (2) of the FSRO)and the Director has to respond within 6 months (Section 13(1) of the ordinance), there is nothing in the ordinance to suggest thatthe figures entered into a claim cannot be amended.  The claimant and the Director have to do the best they can in assessing theclaim based on their prevailing knowledge.  That would be the same for every litigant involved in legal proceedings.  If the partiesare able to arrive at a settlement based on their prevalent knowledge and assessment, that would be the end of the matter.  If theclaim is not settled, the Tribunal will have to determine the claim in the same way as a court of law dealing with a claim for damages. Documents filed in the Tribunal for that purpose can be amended if necessary and no-one will suggest that the claimant is boundby the figure he previously submitted under Section 12(1) once and for all. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  It follows that in my judgment the proper measure for compensation under the statutory formula is to work out what are the damagesthat the 1995 Authorization had caused to Lot 22.  In other words, the answer to the first issue is that the notional tort approachshould be applied.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  Further, for reasons given, the notional tort approach provides the Applicant with a compensation that matches exactly what he wouldget without the intervention of the statute.  Hence, it is a fair compensation.</p>    <p class="heading">The extinguishment of the leasehold interest in respect of the slipways</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Mr Barnes conceded that there had been a taking of property insofar as the extinguishment of the leasehold interest in respect ofthe slipways are concerned.  According to the calculation submitted by the Applicant, the total area of the four slipways was 23,360square feet.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Should the notional purchase approach be applied to the compensation for the taking of the four slipways? In my judgment, if onewere to think the matter through carefully, the plain answer is that one should also apply the notional tort approach notwithstandingthat there was a taking of property in respect of the four slipways.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  The matter can be tested this way.  Let us assume for one moment that the notional purchase approach is to be applied.  The relevantpurchase must be the purchase of the slipways as opposed to the purchase of the land adjacent to them.  Once this is recognized,one would immediately face with a problem in finding a market value for the slipways.  There is simply no market for the slipwaysalone.  No-one in his right mind would purchase the slipways if he does not have any right to use the land adjacent to them.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  Hence, the slipways had no independent market value apart from its value as ancillary facilities to the use of the land adjacentto them.  This is precisely why the Applicant has to come up with a valuation by reference to the difference in the values of theland with and without the marine access, including the slipways.  The Applicant cannot come up with a valuation for the slipwaysalone (viz. separated from the marine access).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  In other words, the Applicantâs notional purchase approach is not a notional purchase of the slipways.  Rather, it is the differencein value between the notional purchase of the land with marine access and that without marine access.  In substance, it is an approachto work out the adverse effect of the taking of the marine rights (not only the slipways) on the land.  I have already explainedabove why this approach may inherently be unfair when the Applicant had not actually been forced to sell the land and had not soldit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  In the present circumstances, I do not think the extinguishment of the leasehold interests relating to the slipways makes any differencein my conclusion on the proper approach.  I see no basis for suggesting that the notional tort approach cannot generate a fair compensationfor the Applicant in respect of the slipways.      </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  In this connection, Mr Chang drew an analogy with cases where some of the land of a claimant was taken and compensation was awardedfor severance and other injurious affection (<i>Edwards v Minister of Transport</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%202%20QB%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] 2 QB 134</a>; <i>Holt v Gas Light &amp; Coke Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281872%29%20LR%207%20QB%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1872) LR 7 QB 728</a>; <i>Cowper Essex v Acton Local Board</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2014%20AC%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 14 App Cas 153</a>; <i>Re Stockport, Timperley &amp; Altrincham Railway Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281864%29%2033%20LJ%20QB%20251" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1864) 33 LJ QB 251</a>; <i>Cuthbert v Secretary of State for the Environment</i> (1979) 252 EG 1178).  Counsel submitted that when land is taken, compensation for injurious affection on the remaining land is assessedon a âbefore and afterâ basis and it is not coextensive as a common law claim for nuisance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  Those cases were decided under different pieces of legislation.  I doubt if the concept of severance regarding compulsory takingof part of the land can be applicable to the taking of marine rights, including the leasehold interest of the slipways in the presentinstance.  As explained, it is meaningless to have a leasehold interest in the slipways if one cannot have the use of the land. Even assuming some reference could be made to compensation for severance, I agree with Mr Barnes that the relevant legislation (e.g.section 63 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845, Section 7 of Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 in England and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 10(2)(c)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124" class="autolink_findacts">Lands Resumption Ordinance</a> in Hong Kong) refers to compensation for âdamageâ or âloss or damageâ.  As regards the land taken, the compensation is thevalue of the land taken.  As regards the land not taken, the compensation is assessed by reference to the loss and damage suffered. Thus, in the latter category, the compensation is not necessarily anchored to the value of the remaining land at a particular date. There has to be an enquiry as regards the actual loss or damage suffered.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  This is supported by the second proposition set out by Lord Halsbury in <i>Cowper Essex v Acton Local Board</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2014%20AC%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 14 App Cas 153</a> at p.161,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ where part of a proprietorâs land is taken from him, and the future use of the part so taken may damage the remainder ofthe proprietorâs land, then such damage may be an injurious affecting of the proprietorâs other lands, though it would not bean injurious affecting of the land of neighbouring proprietors from whom nothing had been taken for the purpose of the intended works.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  No doubt there were cases where the damage is measured by a depreciation of the value of the remaining land (as in <i>Cowper Essex</i> itself).  But the primary inquiry is the damage that has been suffered.  If there are matters which indicate that the real loss sufferedby the claimant is less than that arrived at by the notional purchase approach, there is no reason why those matters should not betaken into account.  None of the cases cited by Mr Chang deal with this particular issue. </p>    <p class="heading">Taking of marine rights without compensation?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Mr Chang submitted that the notional tort approach would result in nil compensation for the Applicant and that is clearly unfair. Whilst I note that this is the ultimate result contended for by the Respondent in pleadings, I do not think it is correct to saythis is the result of the notional tort approach.  At this stage, I must confine to the issues that have been framed.  I have notheard evidence nor submissions on each specific matter relied upon by the Respondent to contend that there should not be any additionalcompensation payable to the Applicant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  It is up to the parties to consider and if necessary to argue eventually whether <i>de facto</i> access, âbettermentâ occasioned by the unexecuted scheme under the 1995 Authorization, the 2000 Withdrawal and the 2000 Authorization,the Deed of Surrender of 3 April 2001, the <i>ex</i><i> gratia</i> payment and the costs of the decontamination works should have any impact on the fair compensation by applying the principles ofassessment of damages in tort.  I have not heard submissions from counsel in respect of how each of these matters might fit intosuch an assessment and it is not appropriate for me to express any views on them. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  It by no means follows from the adoption of the notional tort approach that the compensation payable to the Applicant must be nil. The notional tort approach seeks to compensate the Applicant for the real loss that it has suffered by reason of the loss of themarine rights.  How that loss is to be measured will depend on the evidence as regards the real damages suffered by the Applicant. It is not for me to pre-empt at this stage how the parties should conduct their case in the light of my decision on the preliminaryissues.  If the Applicant could show a real loss in accordance with the principles for assessing damages in tort, it would receivecompensation in the same amount.  If it could not show a real loss, why should it be compensated?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  Mr Chang was under the misapprehension that if the notional tort approach is adopted, the Applicant was forced to sell the landin order to generate a loss.  With respect, that is a misunderstanding of the notional tort approach.  If the extinguishment of themarine right would not have caused a reasonable person to sell the land, the sale of the land by the Applicant is neither here northere.  The loss occasioned by such a sale would not be fairly attributable to the taking of the marine rights.  Hence, accordingto the principle of equivalence, there is no reason why the Applicant should be compensated for it. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  On the other hand, even if there is no sale of the land, if the Applicant could establish that the loss of the marine rights causedit to suffer damages in terms of impediment in its business development and loss of profit, or that the land (or a portion of theland) could not be used for commercial purposes or it could only be used for a less profitable purposes than what it could have withmarine rights, it can claim such loss as the real loss it has suffered.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  Mr Chang further contended that it would be unjust if the Applicant gets no compensation for the marine rights and subsequently,when compensation was assessed for the resumption of the land (presumably under the 2000 Authorization), the compensation would onlybe assessed as 10% value of the land with marine rights.  If the notional tort approach would result in that, I would agree thatit would be unfair.  However, I do not see how that could be the result.  If the extinguishment of the marine rights did have suchadverse effect to the land so as to render its value to drop so drastically, it must surely be reflected in some real loss sufferedby the Applicant as outlined in the last paragraph.  The Applicant would receive compensation for the same under the FSRO.  Further,the Applicant had actually received $1,506 million odd in 2001 and this can hardly be regarded as 10% value of the land with marinerights.  The Applicantâs surveyor assessed the market value of the land with marine rights between $3,333 million and $2,639 millionin the report of February 1998.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  Neither would the notional tort approach result in nil compensation by reason of the <i>de facto</i> access being available for a limited duration.  Subject to the three conditions of Lord Nicholls being satisfied, there is no reasonwhy there could not be loss suffered in anticipation of <i>de facto</i> access being terminated.  An analogy can be drawn with loss in the shadow period adverted to in the <i>Shung Fung</i> case at p.135-139.  Further, the extinguishment of marine rights must have impact into the future and the temporary <i>de facto</i> access could not bar a claim based on a permanent loss of marine access.  Whilst there is a further complication in the present caseby reason of the 2000 Authorization and the surrender in 2001.  The impacts of those have yet to be explored.</p>    <p class="heading">Mr Changâs propositions: âThe Pennyâs Bay Rulesâ</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  Mr Chang submitted a document on 2 April 2007 inviting this Tribunal to adopt 10 propositions as formulated by the Applicant ascorrect.  I do not propose to set them all out.  Instead, I shall make a few comments on them.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  Rules 1 and 2 are uncontroversial and they simply set out the legal analysis regarding marine rights that may be affected by theFSRO.  Rule 3 sets out 6 principal scenarios where there could be injurious affection in the context of FSRO.  However, in his oralsubmissions, Mr Chang agreed that the 6 scenarios may not be mutually exclusive and there could be overlaps.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  Central to the issues that I have to resolve is Rules 4 to 6.  Rule 4 advocates the notional purchase approach as the basic principleof compensation for cases where leasehold interest in a portion of the foreshore and sea-bed or some other private proprietary rightwere extinguished.  Rule 5 postulates that the value of the marine right extinguished can be measured by comparing the open marketvalue of the land immediately âbeforeâ and immediately âafterâ the extinguishment of the marine right.  For reasons alreadycanvassed above, whilst I accept that there could be cases where the notional purchase approach may arrive at a proper measure ofthe damages suffered, the primary approach is the notional tort approach.  This follows directly from the principle of equivalenceand the three general conditions for assessing a fair compensation set out in the judgment of Lord Nicholls in <i>Shun Fung</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  Rule 6 qualifies Rule 5 by reference to the rule against double recovery.  The need to have such rider to Rule 5 underlines thepoint that the notional purchase approach is not the primary basis for assessment of compensation and the primary task is to findout what is the real loss suffered by a claimant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  Rule 7 deals with cases of partial extinguishment of marine rights.  It has no application in the present instance and I shall notcomment on the same.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  Rule 8 touches upon the effect of the 2000 Withdrawal.  I understand Mr Barnes did not dispute the proposition that the 2000 Withdrawalcannot revive the marine rights that had been extinguished under the 1995 Authorization.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  Rule 9 provides for the capitalization of future loss in respect of damage arising out the construction or execution of works. It does not arise on the facts of the present case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  Rule 10 says subject to the principle against double recovery, the claim arising out of the extinguishment of marine rights doesnot depend on proof of damage to land arising out of the construction or execution of any reclamation works.  I think this rule hasto be elaborated.  I agree that the damage and loss suffered by a claimant may not be confined to damage arising out of the constructionor execution of any reclamation works.  The Applicant may show damage and loss by reference to the loss in revenue generated fromthe land by reason of the loss of marine access or by reference to the impediment in the potential development of the land.  Yet,there must be some real loss suffered and the compensation has to be assessed by the notional tort approach.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusions</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  For the above reasons, the answer to issue (1) is that the primary approach for assessing compensation under the FSRO should bethe notional tort approach.  Although there could be cases where the notional purchase approach may arrive at an appropriate measureof damages, the ultimate criteria is to apply the same principles for assessment of damages in tort to come up with a fair compensationin accordance with the principle of equivalence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  Given that answer, issues (2) and (4) do not arise.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  It follows from my analysis that under the notional tort approach, the Applicant would receive a fair compensation for the realloss suffered by it.  If that compensation is less than the figure arrived at under the notional purchase approach, it is becausethe notional purchase approach would over-compensate the Applicant.  In particular, in the present context, the notional purchaseapproach may exclude some relevant developments since the date of extinguishment from consideration to generate a distorted pictureregarding the real loss suffered by the Applicant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  Hence, assuming that Article 105 of the Basic Law is engaged, the adoption of the notional tort approach in assessing compensationunder the FSRO does provide a compensation corresponds to the real loss suffered and it is also the real value of property concernedat the time of deprivation.  Thus, the answer to issue (3) is that there is no infringement of Article 105.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  Having decided the preliminary issues, I will list the matter for further directions regarding future conduct of the case.  Theparties are directed to file draft directions at least 7 days before the next hearing.
