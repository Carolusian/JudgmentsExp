The trial was on both liability and quantum.</p>    <p class="heading">The plaintiffâs case</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> 10 September 2000 was election day for the Legislative Council.  At 8:30 p.m., the plaintiff got off the MTR train at Wong Tai SinStation and was ascending the staircase at Exit A.  He looked up and saw four election promoters of the Third Party standing on thelanding at the top of the staircase.  They were holding placards in their hands.  The four of them blocked the better half of theexit, leaving the gap of about one to two persons on the right (from the plaintiffâs standpoint).  When the plaintiff was aboutfour to five steps below the promoters, he began to veer right.  When the plaintiff was about one to two steps from them, the promoteron his left suddenly waved the placard haphazardly and the upper corner of the placard hit his left eye.  The plaintiff did not expectthe movement of the placard and he did not use his hand to shield his eye.  He felt sharp pain and covered his eye and stepped asideto rest for a while.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The plaintiff could not identify the culprit but he said at all material times, he only saw four promoters in green vests belongingto the Third Party.  He did not see any promoters in yellow vests belonging to the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of HongKong (âDABâ). </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The plaintiff did not confront the culprit.  He said he did not think it would be so serious and he was taught to be tolerant andnot to take revenge.  Also, it would be bad to get involved in politics. </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> After a while, the plaintiff met a friend who suggested he go to the MTR office to ask for help.  The plaintiff told an officer ofthe MTR that he was hit by a placard held by a promoter in green vest of the Third Party.  The officer went to the staircase withhim but they never went to the top.  The officer went up to half way of the staircase about seven steps from the top and told thepromoters to leave.  The plaintiff stayed at the bottom of the staircase about seven steps behind the officer. </p>    <p class="heading">The defence case</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Mr So Tin Shan (DW1) was the station officer.  The plaintiff told DW1 that his eye was poked by a placard held by a Democratic Partypromoter.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> DW1 went to top of the staircase and he saw promoters holding placards of at least two parties at the landing and the uppermost steps. Their numbers were about half and half and they were intermingled with each other.  DW1 asked who injured the plaintiff and whetherthere was eye witness but there was no response.  DW1 said the plaintiff must have seen the DAB promoters as he was just one to twosteps behind him.  They stayed at the top for about five minutes.  The plaintiff did not cover his eye from time to time but notall the time.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> DW1 said the staircases and exits were patrolled at 7 a.m., 9 a.m., 10 a.m., 1:30 p.m., 3:30 p.m., 6 p.m., 7 p.m., 8 p.m. and 9 p.m.daily.  As far as DW1 was aware, the election campaigning activities were on the street and the MTR did not arrange for more manpowerto step up the patrols.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Mr Wei Pak Kin (DW2) patrolled Exit A at 8 p.m. and he walked along the pavement outside and then walked down the adjacent Exit E. He saw election campaigning activities on the pavement but not within the station premises.</p>    <p class="heading">The Third Partyâs case</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Mr Lui Wing Kei (TPW1) was the leader of the promoters for the Third Party.  TPW1 said neither he nor the other promoters of theThird Party waved the placards haphazardly at the entrance of the exit.  He said that if that were done, it would create a risk ordanger to the passers by.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> There were four promoters of the Third Party and about 10 promoters from DAB in the area outside Exit A.  The Third Partyâs promoterswere mixing with the DAB promoters, with each side covering the field taken by the other side rather than standing in a line.  Attimes, one promoter from each side had got onto the staircase near the landing. </p>    <p class="heading">The medical evidence</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> It was said that the plaintiff malingered and exaggerated the condition of his left eye, and understated the pre-existing conditionof diabetic retinopathy of his right eye.  Hence, the medical evidence is relevant in the consideration of his credibility.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> According to the plaintiff, he felt intense pain at the time.  He realized he had lost vision in the left eye at the hospital.  Subsequentoperations did not resolve the problem.  At worst, he could not perceive flash light.  His right eye deteriorated due to overusein compensation for the left eye.  In 2003, his left eye started to improve.  Apart from his right eyeball shifting to the left,the right eyesight is now normal.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The plaintiff was referred to the Eye Hospital on the date of the accident.  The medical report showed that visual acuity in theleft eye was light perception only.  Ocular examination revealed left vitreous haemorrhage.  Incidentally, the right eye was foundto have exudative maculopathy.  Subsequently, the plaintiff was diagnosed to be suffering from diabetes mellitus.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The left vitreous haemorrhage did not resolve and operation was performed on 15 March 2001.  Several laser treatments were also performedon both eyes to control diabetic retinopathy.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> On 29 December 2001, the plaintiff was examined by his own expert, Dr Kenneth Ng.  He was found to be suffering from quite advanceddiabetic retinopathy in the right eye.  Dr Ng referred the plaintiff to the Central Opthalmic Laboratory for the visual field test. However, the plaintiff refused to have the right eye tested, and his left eye was found to have very gross loss of visual fieldin all four quadrants.  Dr Ng concluded the loss of visual acuity of the left eye was 100% and loss of visual field of the left eyewas 98%, with combined impairment of the left eye of 100%.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> On 14 May 2003, the plaintiff was examined by Dr Paul Cheung for the Third Party.  On initial testing, the visual acuity impairmentfor the left eye was 95% and for the right eye was 60%.  However, on administering the âmalingering testâ (i.e. asking the patientto look at the test chart with both eyes open, while fogging the good eye at times so that the patient is actually looking with thebad eye and <i>vice versa</i>), the genuine visual acuity impairment was 60% for both the left eye and the right eye.  Dr Cheung referred to the finding of 100%loss of visual field in Dr Ngâs report and commented that the visual field test is a subjective one depending on the truthfulnessof the patientâs response.  He did not consider repeating the test as the plaintiff was malingering.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> On 21 July 2003, Dr Cheung and Dr Ng, jointly examined the plaintiff.  There was a 2.5 cm scar on the left eye lid, but that wascaused by an traffic accident eight years ago.  They agreed that the gross loss of peripheral visual field of the both eyes was contributedpartially by diabetic retinopathy.  They agreed that the loss of visual acuity for the left eye was only 60%, and for the right eyewas 30%.  They disagreed on : (1) the cause of vitreous haemorrhage; (2) exudative maculopathy; and (3) percentage of impairmentof the left eye as caused by the accident.  These are only relevant to the question of quantum in the light of the plaintiffâspre-existing condition but are not relevant to the plaintiffâs credibility.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> On 5 September 2003, Dr Cheung and Dr Ng, gave the further opinion that even without the accident in question and even if the lefteyesight were normal, the plaintiff could not resume his pre-accident job as a taxi driver by reason of the deterioration of theright eyesight.  Drivers of commercial vehicles including vans and taxis should have corrected visual acuity equal to or better than6/9 in the better eye and 6/12 in the worse eye.  The visual acuity plaintiffâs right eye was 6/18, and assuming the right eyewere the worse eye, it was worse than 6/12. </p>    <p class="heading">Assessment of the evidence</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Miss Molloy for the defendant and Mr Shum for the Third Party submitted that the plaintiff was not a credible witness.

Mr Shum also conceded vicarious liability in the event the defendant were liable and sought indemnity againstthe Third Party.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> The plaintiff based his claim against the defendant mainly on the breach of common duty of care and the breach of contractual dutyowed to the plaintiff.

Not only must the occupier avoid creating danger himself, he must also take reasonable steps to protect his visitors fromdangers which he did not himself create, as where a nightclub floor becomes strewn with liquor and broken glass.  It seems that theduty may extend to protecting visitors from dangers on neighbouring land not in the occupation of the defendant, for instance byusing fencing.  On the other hand, it is submitted that thyere must be some danger arising from the state of the premises: the merefact that they lack some given amenity will not do, even if injury may be foreseeable.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr Chan also referred para. 10 - 28 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn determining whether what was done or not done by the occupier was in fact reasonable, and whether in the particular circumstancesof the case the visitor was reasonably safe, the court is free to consider all the circumstances, such as how obvious the dangeris, warnings, lighting, fencing, the age of the visitor, the purpose of his visit, the conduct to be expected of him, and the stateof knowledge of the occupier.  The difficulty and expense of removing the danger is a relevant factorâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> I respectfully agree with the learned authors.

It is the duty of the operator to ensure the safety and a smooth environmentfor the users of the passageway.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Mr Chan said the hourly patrol was definitely insufficient, particularly on the election day of LegCo.

I do not think that a mere foreseeable possibility is or should be sufficient, for then the interveninghuman action can more properly be regarded as a new cause than a consequence of the original wrongdoing.  But if the interveningaction was likely to happen I do not think that it can matter whether that action was innocent or tortuous or criminal.  Unfortunately,tortuous or criminal action by a third party is often âthe very kind of thingâ which is likely to happen as a result of the wrongfulor careless act of the defendant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In <i>Lamb v.

Such attribution cannot, as I think, rationally be made simply on the basis ofsome geographical or temporal proximity and even âlikelihoodâ is a somewhat undertain touchstone.  It may be that some more stringentstandard is required.  There may, for instance, be circumstances in which the court would require a degree of likelihood amountingalmost to inevitability before it fixes a defendant with responsibility for the act of a third party over whom he has and can haveno control.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> <i>Hosie v.

Reading Football Club</i>, where the occupier of a football field was held liable when a spectator was trampled at a football match when hooligans forced theirway into the ground through an inadequately maintained exit barrier.  The pursuer was waiting for admission to a first division match. Some unruly persons made a deliberate attack upon the gate.  They overcame the gate and carried the pursuer with it.  He was knockeddown and trampled upon, and suffered grave injuries which resulted in a complete paraplegia.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> In the Scottish Outer House, Lord Stewart found that the guide of the exit gate was broken when pressure was exerted upon it by thosewho were swinging it inwards.  His Lordship found two defects with the gate : (1) the badly corroded guide at the ground level resultedin diminution of its original strength; (2) the absence of any device to stop the rollers from coming off the rail at the top sothat the gate could not be lifted up, where evidence indicated that such devices were commonplace and effective.  The difficultyin the case was that door gave way not as the result of ordinary crowd pressure but as a result of a deliberate attack upon it inthat whether it could be described as a <i>novus actus interviens</i>.  His Lordship considered that one of the purposes of the gate was to keep people out and that must have included people who wereover eager, whether through drink or partisan enthusiasm, to over come the barrier which the gate was constituted.  There had, moreover,been an incident at a previous game when apparently people tried unsuccessfully to break in a gate and a police officer opened thedoor to let the crowd enter and the defendersâ treasurer was well aware of that.
