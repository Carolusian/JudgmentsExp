So important is the principle of statutory interpretation involved, however, thatI nevertheless venture respectfully to contribute a few words of my own.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p2" name="p2">2.</a> The certified question is:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Does the abolition, on 2 August 1996, of all common law conspiracies in Hong Kong (other than the offence of conspiracy to defraud),by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s159e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.159E(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200">Cap. 200</a>, preclude an information being lawfully laid after that date, in relation to conduct which occurred before that date, fora common law conspiracy (other than for the offence of conspiracy to defraud), not within the terms of the transitional provisionsof <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s159e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.159E(7)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Ordinance</a>?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">In answering this question, I begin by considering the nature of the abolition involved here. What the appellants did undoubtedlyamounted to a conspiracy to obtain a pecuniary advantage by deception. It amounted to such a conspiracy when they did it before 2August 1996. And if they had done it after that date, it would still have amounted to such a conspiracy. It is in this context thatwe must decide whether they are immune from being charged after that date with the conspiracy which they entered into before thatdate.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p3" name="p3">3.</a> Now it is of course to be borne in mind that the Court is concerned with a criminal statute. At the same time, however, it is alsoto be borne in mind that the provisions in question are not ones which purport to criminalize hitherto lawful conduct. All that theprosecution says is that those provisions do not de-criminalize conduct which had been criminal prior to their coming into force</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p4" name="p4">4.</a> The word "abolished" in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s159e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.159E(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Ordinance</a>, necessarily raises the question: as from when did the abolition take effect? And the natural answer seems to be: as from the datewhen the relevant part of this Ordinance came into force. For this subsection does not say that persons who committed offences ofcommon law conspiracy prior to that date are pardoned or rendered immune from prosecution. Yet that would be the result of accedingto the appellants' submission and giving an affirmative answer to the certified question. Even though subsection (7) of the samesection would be otiose unless one were to attribute to the legislature an intention to bring about that result, I nevertheless findit impossible to attribute that intention to the legislature. For such a result would be bizarre and utterly at odds with the legislature'sobvious intention that conduct such as that of these appellants should remain criminal, albeit under statute rather than at commonlaw.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p5" name="p5">5.</a> In <strong>Inco Europe v. First Choice Distribution</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%201%20WLR%20586" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 1 WLR 586</a> Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead (in a speech with which all the other Law Lords hearing that appeal agreed) demonstrated (at p.592 C-H)that in plain cases of drafting mistakes the interpretative role of the courts properly includes, under certain conditions, the powerof adding words to, omitting words from or substituting words in a statute so as to preserve the obvious purpose of that statute.As to those conditions, his Lordship said (at p.592 F-G) that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Before interpreting a statute in this way the court must be abundantly sure of three matters: (1) the intended purpose of the statuteor provision in question; (2) that by inadvertence the draftsman and Parliament failed to give effect to that purpose in the provisionin question; and (3) the substance of the provision Parliament would have made, although not necessarily the precise words Parliamentwould have used, had the error in the Bill been noticed. The third of these conditions is of crucial importance."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">Then his Lordship added (at p.592H) that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Sometimes, even when these conditions are met, the court may find itself inhibited from interpreting the statutory provision in accordancewith what it is satisfied was the underlying intention of Parliament. The alteration in language may be too far-reaching. In <em>Western Bank Ltd. v. Schindler</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20Ch%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] Ch. 1</a>, 18, Scarman L.J. observed that the insertion must not be too big, or too much at variance with the language used by the legislature.Or the subject matter may call for a strict interpretation of the statutory language, as in penal legislation."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p6" name="p6">6.</a> The draftsman must be taken to have included the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s159e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.159E</a> (7) transitional provisions thinking that they were necessary or at least avoided doubt. But he cannot possibly be taken to haveincluded them thinking that they could be said to operate so as to provide persons like these appellants with an immunity from prosecution.I have no doubt, therefore, that the inclusion of subsection (7) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s159e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.159E</a> is plainly a drafting mistake. And I am satisfied in all the circumstances that the conditions identified by Lord Nicholls of Birkenheadin the <strong>Inco Europe</strong> case obtain in the present case. As to the fact that the statutory provisions in question are penal, I have already pointed out that,although they are penal, they do not create new criminal liability. So the choice before the Court is a stark one. One course isto permit an obvious drafting mistake to undo the intention obviously to be attributed to the legislature. The other one is to graspthe nettle of recognizing the draftsman's obvious blunder for what it is and treating the product of such blunder as otiose thuspreserving such intention. In my judgment, our proper course in this day and age of purposive interpretation is undoubtedly the latterone.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p7" name="p7">7.</a> Like Mr Justice Chan PJ, therefore, I would answer the certified question in the negative, and dismiss this appeal accordingly.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><strong>Mr Justice Chan PJ:</strong></p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p8" name="p8">8.</a> This appeal involves consideration of the effect of abolition of the offence of conspiracy at common law by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200#p12a" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIIA</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200">Cap 200</a> on offences committed prior to its coming into force on 2 August 1996.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p9" name="p9">9.</a> The 1st and 2nd appellants are husband and wife. On 18 November 1998, they were charged with conspiracy to obtain a pecuniary advantageby deception, contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/210/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 18(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/210" class="autolink_findacts">Theft Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/210">Cap. 210</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s159a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 159A</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Ordinance</a>. The offence was alleged to have been committed between 1 December 1994 and 28 March 1995. It was alleged that during that period,the appellants conspired with a Miss Mok whereby Miss Mok would allow copies of her Certificate of Education Examination and schoolreport to be used by the 2nd appellant for the purpose of seeking employment in Hong Kong. Both appellants were convicted after trialby a magistrate (Ms B Chainrai) in South Kowloon Magistracy on 21 January 1999. They were each sentenced to 9 months' imprisonment.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p10" name="p10">10.</a> The appellants appealed against the conviction. The main issue taken on appeal was this. The appellants' criminal conduct occurredbefore the Crimes (Amendment) Ordinance 1996 came into effect on 2 August 1996. By that Ordinance, the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Ordinance</a> was amended by the addition of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200#p12a" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIIA</a> which, among other things, created the statutory offence of conspiracy and abolished the offence of conspiracy at common law. Theconspiracy charge which the appellants faced and of which they were subsequently convicted was expressed to be contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/210/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 18(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/210" class="autolink_findacts">Theft Ordinance</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s159a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 159A</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Ordinance</a>. That is to say, they were charged with and convicted of a statutory conspiracy for conduct which was committed before the creationof this statutory offence. The prosecution accepted that this could not be done.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p11" name="p11">11.</a> Upon the application of the appellants which was supported by the prosecution, the case was reserved for the consideration of theCourt of Appeal under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/227/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 118(1)(d)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/227" class="autolink_findacts">Magistrates Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/227">Cap. 227</a>. Having heard submissions from the parties, the Court of Appeal (Stuart-Moore VP, Keith and Woo JJA) amended the chargeto an offence contrary to the common law and substituted the conviction by one under the amended charge. From this decision, theappellants now appeal to this Court, having obtained leave from the Appeal Committee under section 32 of the Court of Final AppealOrdinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484">Cap 484</a>.</p>    <p class="heading">Decision of Court of Appeal</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p12" name="p12">12.</a> The appellants' case is as simple as it is attractive. It is submitted that they cannot be charged with statutory conspiracy contraryto section 159A since it did not exist when the offence was committed. They cannot be charged with conspiracy contrary to the commonlaw either since such offence had been abolished for all intents and purposes by section 159E(1). It is accepted that the transitionalprovision (section 159E(7)) does not apply to them.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p13" name="p13">13.</a> The Court of Appeal rejected this submission. Its reasons for upholding the convictions on the conspiracy charge were these. The1996 Ordinance was not enacted to decriminalize certain forms of conspiracy but to put the law of conspiracy on a statutory footing.It was not the intention of the legislation to make conspiracies committed before the operation of the 1996 Ordinance immune fromprosecution. The normal effect of abolition of an offence was that unless there was an express provision in the legislation, thisdid not prevent proceedings to be commenced after the abolition against such offence which had been committed before its abolition.The transitional provision did not specify the only situations where proceedings against common law conspiracies committed beforethe operation of the 1996 Ordinance could be maintained after that date. Hence, the appellants could still be charged with and shouldbe convicted of a common law conspiracy.</p>    <p class="heading">Question in this appeal</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p14" name="p14">14.</a> The question certified as a point of law of great and general importance for the consideration of this Court is:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">Does the abolition on 2nd August 1996, of all common law conspiracies in Hong Kong (other than the offence of conspiracy to defraud)by Section 159E(1) <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200">Cap 200</a>, preclude an information being lawfully laid after that date, in relation to conduct which occurred before that date, fora common law conspiracy (other than for the offence of conspiracy to defraud) not within the terms of the transitional provisionsof <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s159e.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 159E(7)</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Ordinance</a>?</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p15" name="p15">15.</a> In my view, the answer to this question ultimately involves a construction of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s159e.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 159E</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Ordinance</a>. Before considering this particular provision, it is necessary to ascertain the intention behind the enactment of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200#p12a" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIIA</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p class="heading">Intention of legislation</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p16" name="p16">16.</a> In 1994, the Law Reform Commission in its report on "Codification: Preliminary Offences of Incitements, Conspiracy and Attempt" madevarious recommendations with regard to these offences. Of common law conspiracies, the Law Reform Commission in its Report said inparagraph 3.43:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"There is no real challenge to the rationale for and the continued existence of the offence of conspiracy ...There are aspects ofthe law, however, which remain imprecise."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p17" name="p17">17.</a> The desirability of having conspiracy as a punishable offence was never in doubt. It was the scope of the law which required clarificationand improvement. The Report recommended changes to the law of conspiracy which were largely modelled on the Criminal Law Act 1977which was enacted in the United Kingdom following a comprehensive review of the common law offence of conspiracy by the Law ReformCommission of England and Wales.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p18" name="p18">18.</a> Following the recommendations of our Law Reform Commission, the common law was changed by the enactment of the Crimes (Amendment)Ordinance 1996. The object of the exercise was (1) to codify the offence of conspiracy and place it in a statutory framework; (2)to remove some of the obscure crimes which may lead to misunderstanding; and (3) to improve on some of the less satisfactory anduncertain aspects in the law of conspiracy. It was intended to achieve this object by creating a statutory offence of conspiracyto replace common law conspiracy and making provisions for matters relating to this change. The statutory conspiracy as defined bysection 159A makes it an offence only if it is an agreement to commit a crime. The new law decriminalizes controversial offencessuch as conspiracy to commit a tort and conspiracy to corrupt public morals or to outrage public decency, but retains the offenceof conspiracy to defraud. However, it does not decriminalize conduct such as that committed in the present case which has alwaysbeen generally and undoubtedly regarded as a criminal offence both before and after the coming into effect of the new law. Conductwhich, if it were committed before 2 August 1996, would have been punishable as a common law conspiracy would also be caught by thenew statutory offence. The substitution of common law conspiracy (with the exception of conspiracy to defraud) by a statutory equivalentis clearly intended to produce a continuum. This is particularly important for conspiracies which are notoriously difficult to detectand may not be revealed until some time after they had been committed. It is therefore most improbable that it could have been theintention of the legislature that conspiracies which were committed prior to that date would become unenforceable by prosecutionafter that date either under the common law or the new statute. As the Court of Appeal said at p.8 of the judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Since the purpose of the new legislation was not to decriminalise certain forms of conspiracy, but to put the crime of conspiracyon a statutory footing, it cannot have been the intention of the legislature to make conspiracies which had been committed priorto 2 August 1996 unenforceable by prosecution if proceedings had not been commenced by then. That would have put beyond the reachof the criminal justice system criminal conspiracies which had been committed before 2 August 1996 but which had not been detectedby then or which, though detected, had not been investigated sufficiently to warrant the bringing of criminal proceedings by then.We regard it as unimaginable that the legislature could have intended such a state of affairs to exist. Indeed, it is plain thatthe promoters of the Bill which eventually became the Crimes (Amendment) Ordinance (No. 49 of 1996) had no such intention. That isapparent from para. 7(c) of the Explanatory Memorandum explaining the Bill. It reads, so far as is material :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">'... acts of conspiracy ... done before the commencement of the Bill shall not be subject to the provisions of the Bill ...'"</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p19" name="p19">19.</a> It is accepted by the parties that the appellants' conduct in the present case amounted to a common law conspiracy before 2 August1996 and would also be caught by section 159A(1) as a statutory conspiracy if it were committed after that date. It is the appellants'contention that no prosecution can now be brought against them for common law conspiracy after the effective date. This is becausecommon law conspiracy has been abolished and conduct committed before 2 August 1996 which has not been expressly preserved cannotbe prosecuted any more.</p>    <p class="heading">Relevant Provisions</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p20" name="p20">20.</a> The creation of the statutory offence of conspiracy by section 159A is expressed to be subject to the provisions of Part XIIA whichinclude section 159E. That section abolishes common law conspiracies except conspiracy to defraud and makes savings and transitionalprovisions consequent upon such abolition. The relevant parts of section 159E read as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"(1) Subject to the following provisions of this section, the offence of conspiracy at common law is abolished.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">...</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">(7) Subsection (1) shall not affect -</p>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">(a) any proceedings commenced before the time when this Part comes into operation; or</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">(b) any proceedings commenced after that time against a person charged with the same conspiracy as that charged in any proceedingscommenced before that time."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p21" name="p21">21.</a> At the centre of this appeal is the question: what, upon its true construction, is the effect of section 159E on conspiracies committedbefore 2 August 1996? This raises 2 issues: first, what is the effect of abolition of a common law offence by statute on offencescommitted before its abolition; and second, what is the scope of the transitional provision? I shall deal with the second issue firstbecause if the transitional provision has made sufficient provision for pre-abolition offences, the first issue may become less relevant.</p>    <p class="heading">Transitional provision</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p22" name="p22">22.</a> Section 159E(1) does not simply declare that the offence of conspiracy at common law is abolished. It provides that the abolitionis subject to the provisions of that section. Immediately one sees from section 159E(2) that the common law offence of conspiracyto defraud is not affected by it. The abolition is further subject to the transitional provision in section 159E(7). That subsectionenables two types of proceedings to be continued or commenced after the abolition. These proceedings clearly relate to common lawconspiracies committed before 2 August 1996. However, this subsection admittedly does not apply to the present case. Nor is it indeedapplicable to common law conspiracies committed before the effective date which were either not detected or for which no charge hadyet been laid before that date. There is no other provision for the transition. It would seem that if the abolition is expresslysubject to the transitional provision, one should not normally, as a matter of construction, look beyond such provision to discoverthe scope of the abolition.</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">Section 159E(7) is to be contrasted with the transitional provisions in section 5 of the English Criminal Law Act 1977 which readas follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">"(4) Subsection (1) above shall not affect -</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p align="justify" class="quote">(a) any proceedings commenced before the time when this Part of this Act comes into force;</p>                <p align="justify" class="quote">(b) any proceedings commenced after that time against a person charged with the same conspiracy as that charged in any proceedingscommenced before that time; or</p>                <p align="justify" class="quote">(c) ...</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">(5) Sections 1 and 2 above shall apply to things done before as well as to things done after the time when this Part of this Act comesinto force, but in the application of section 3 above to a case where the agreement in question was entered into before that time- ...."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p23" name="p23">23.</a> Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the 1977 Act are similar to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s159a.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 159A</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s159b.html" class="autolink_findacts">159B</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s159c.html" class="autolink_findacts">159C</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Ordinance</a>.

It is pointed out that no authority was referred to by thecourt in support of that proposition which is contrary to previous authorities on the effect of a repeal of a statutory offence.Counsel argues that a statutory offence does not survive its repeal unless it is saved by a transitional provision in the repealingstatute. Similarly if a common law offence is abolished, it is nullified and destroyed for all intents and purposes and offencescommitted prior to the abolition cannot be punishable any more. On the other hand, counsel for the prosecution submits that the appellants'argument necessarily suggests that the abolition in the present case had retrospective effect and that this must be wrong in theabsence of express legislation (see <strong>In re Athlumney</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1898%5d%202%20QB%20547" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1898] 2 QB 547).</a> The repeal by statute does not affect existing rights and liabilities.

There has beenno authority referred to us on what the position is with regard to the abolition of a common law offence by statute. However, itwould seem that there should be no logical basis for not applying this principle to such a case simply because the source of thelaw which is removed by statute is different. But if the abolition of common law conspiracy by section 159E(1) were to be construedas having the effect as contended by the appellants, then, in the absence of any express savings or transitional provision preservingthe position with regard to offences committed before the abolition, the result would be quite drastic. For this would mean thatall criminal conspiracies committed before 2 August 1996 which had not been detected or for which no charge had been laid would becomeimmune from prosecution after the abolition. The offenders would, as the Court of Appeal described, be put beyond the reach of thecriminal justice system. This could not have been the intention of the legislature. Any reasonable person would reject such suggestion.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p33" name="p33">33.</a> If, on the other hand, the approach of the Court of Appeal is to be adopted, this would also lead to some difficulty. It would renderthe transitional provision in section 159E(7), in fact all transitional provisions in similar situations, entirely otiose. For ifconduct committed before 2 August 1996 survives the new legislation and can still be prosecuted as a common law conspiracy, thenwhether proceedings against such conduct had already been commenced before that date is irrelevant. Further, to regard section 159E(7)as not sufficiently clear so that it could be considered as not exhaustive would also be doing violence to its language.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p34" name="p34">34.</a> It is suggested that the draftsman had made a blunder by overlooking this point and failed to make sufficient transitional provisioncovering past offences which come to light after the effective date. This may or may not be the case. But without knowing what exactlyhappened, I am not sure that this is an entirely fair criticism. Since Part XIIA was largely taken from the Criminal Law Act 1977,it would be inconceivable that the draftsman would simply have overlooked section 5(5) of the 1977 Act. Further, when he was draftingthe Hong Kong provisions, the issue of making provision for the transition was clearly very much alive. After all, he saw fit tointroduce the transitional provision in section 159E(7) as he did in section 159K for the offence of attempt. One possible reasonfor not including a provision similar to section 5(5) of the 1977 Act was that he was concerned that there might be a danger thatthis would contravene the Bill of Rights. This is because section 5(5) of the 1977Act has the effect of extending the new statutoryoffence retrospectively to certain type of conduct (e.g., conspiracy to commit an impossible crime) committed before the operativedate which was not criminal before the Act came into force. It would seem that the draftsman bearing this risk in mind might havemade a conscious decision not to include an equivalent of section 5(5) of the Act into the Hong Kong legislation. It might be thathe had come to the considered view that the Hong Kong provisions, in particular section 159E(1), would be sufficient to catch pastconduct which was criminal but which was not revealed until after the operative date.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p35" name="p35">35.</a> Whether it was a deliberate decision or an inadvertence, the fact remains that there is no clear and express provision to cater forconspiracies committed before the effective date but falling outside section 159E(7).</p>    <p class="heading">Construction to be adopted</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p36" name="p36">36.</a> As I have discussed above, in the absence of a clear and express transitional provision covering criminal conduct committed beforethe new law came into effect (assuming that this is the result of a conscious decision), section 159E(1) can be construed in twoalternative ways. First, the offence of common law conspiracy is abolished for all intents and purposes and all conduct committedbefore 2 August 1996 can no longer be prosecuted. Second, the offence is abolished only insofar as conduct committed after 2 August1996 is concerned but conduct committed before that date can still be prosecuted. It may be said that neither construction is satisfactory:the first one not giving effect to the intention of the legislature and the second one not doing full justice to the language ofthe provisions.

If section 159E has failed to give effect to the true legislative intentionas a result of the inadvertence of the draftsman, what has been omitted would be a provision to the effect that conduct committedbefore the effective date which amounted to a conspiracy at common law would continue to be punishable after the effective date.Although this is a penal statute, no injustice would be done to such offenders if they are permitted to be prosecuted now for thecriminal conduct which they had committed and for which they would have been rightly held liable if they had been discovered andcharged before 2 August 1996. On the other hand, it would be a grave injustice to allow such offenders to escape the criminal justicesystem. It is doubtful whether an amendment now to section 159(7) would have the desired effect of rectifying the position in viewof the provision in the Bill of Rights against retrospective incrimination. In these circumstances, it is, in my view, not too far-reachingto adopt a remedial construction in the interpretation of section 159E. This is amply justified in the present case in order to correctthe errors of the draftsman and give effect to the intention of the legislature.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p46" name="p46">46.</a> For these reasons, I take the view that the answer to the certified question must be in the negative.

The question we have to decide is what was the effect of abolition. It is contended by the Appellants that theeffect was that the offence of conspiracy at Common Law ceased to exist for all purposes, so that no proceedings in relation to suchan offence could be commenced or continued after 2nd August 1996, whilst the Respondent has argued that in the absence of the transitionalprovisions in sub-s. (7) the simultaneous promulgation of the statutory offence and the abolition of the common law offence (withno provision to make the abolition retrospective) "would mean that those offences committed whilst the common law offence was inforce would have remained liable for prosecution, as the common law offence, after the enactment of the statutory offence". In otherwords the Respondent submits that common law conspiracy was abolished in the sense that it was an offence which could no longer be<em>committed</em> after the coming into force of the Ordinance.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p51" name="p51">51.</a> It is true that s.159K(1 ) of the same Ordinance, which abolished the offence of criminal attempt, made it clear that that offence"is abolished for all purposes not relating to acts done before the commencement of this Part", and similar language could have beenused in s.159E(1). Nevertheless, had the draftsman intended so unlikely a result as that contended for by the Appellants it was tobe expected that he would have used very clear language and not left his intention to be implied. The meaning of "abolished" contendedfor by the Respondent is a perfectly natural meaning and it should, if possible, be adopted as being that most likely to have beenintended in the context. Abolition and repeal are not to be treated as synonymous. Cases such as <strong>Kay v Goodwin</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281830%29%206%20Bing%20576" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1830) 6 Bing. 576</a> are distinguishable on the facts.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p52" name="p52">52.</a> The question then remains whether the enactment of the "transitional provisions" makes such an interpretation impossible. It is saidthat para.(a) to sub-s.(7) by expressly preserving "any proceedings commenced before the time when this Part comes into operation"necessarily excludes proceedings commenced after that time and therefore does make the Respondent's interpretation impossible. Forthe reasons given by Mr Justice Chan, P.J. I do not think that argument can prevail. Whatever the reasons why the draftsman thoughtit necessary or desirable to include transitional provisions I cannot believe that it was intended to render unpunishable criminalconspiracies which had been committed before the coming into force of the Ordinance when such conspiracies committed subsequentlyremain punishable, albeit as a statutory offence. I do not shrink from accepting that the effect of the Respondent's interpretationis in fact to render transitional provisions otiose.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p53" name="p53">53.</a> In my view the Court of Appeal came to the right conclusion, but the passage in its judgment which said :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The fact is that the abolition of an offence merely means that conduct which would have amounted to the offence before its abolitionwill not amount to an offence if the conduct had taken place after its abolition."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">must be read in its context of a case where the abolishing statute simultaneously provides that similar conduct shall continue tobe punishable under that or another statute.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><strong>Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead NPJ :</strong></p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p54" name="p54">54.</a> I agree with the judgments delivered by Mr Justice Bokhary PJ, Mr Justice Chan PJ and Sir Alan Huggins NPJ.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><strong>Mr Justice Bokhary PJ</strong></p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p55" name="p55">55.</a> The Court unanimously dismisses this appeal.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <div align="left">        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">(Kemal Bokhary)</td>                <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">(Patrick Chan)</td>                <td style="text-align:center" width="34%">(R.A.V.
