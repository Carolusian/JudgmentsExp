In 2010, he wished to stand as a candidate in the election of the Management Committee of the IncorporatedOwners of the Development. However, he together with eight other owners were disqualified from standing as candidates by the thenManagement Committee which was referred to in the proceedings as the 4<sup>th</sup> Management Committee. At the Annual General Meeting of the owners held on 17 October 2011 the applicant together with the eight otherowners applied to stand for election. The owners at the meeting rejected their application. The applicant then brought proceedingsagainst the Incorporated Owners of Tin Shing Court (âthe 1<sup>st</sup> respondentâ) and the newly elected members of the Management Committee which was referred to as the 5<sup>th</sup> Management Committee (âthe 2<sup>nd</sup>â16<sup>th</sup> respondentsâ) seeking a declaration that the election of the 5<sup>th</sup> Management Committee was invalid.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Deputy Presiding Officer Kot (âthe Judgeâ) of the Lands Tribunal (âthe Tribunalâ) found that the applicant was wrongly disqualified(âthe disqualification issueâ) but held that the decision of the owners to reject the applicantâs application to stand as acandidate (âthe ownersâ decision issueâ) to be correct.  The Judge dismissed the application and made no order as to costsof the proceedings. </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent who was the successful party below applied for leave to appeal against the disqualification issue of the decision.  TheJudge refused the application. The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent then applied for leave before Chu JA sitting as a single judge of the Court of Appeal.  She was asked to grant leave toappeal in respect of the disqualification issue and the costs order made by the Judge.  Chu JA refused the application.  She heldthat while the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent was entitled to appeal against a decision, it had no right to appeal against the reason of a decision.  She held thatthe disqualification issue was only a reason reached by the Judge and it was not the decision itself.  She further held that theJudge had not erred in the exercise of her discretion on costs.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent renewed its application on both issues before this Court.  However, before the hearing, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent indicated through counselâs written submission that it would only seek leave to appeal on costs only.  At the conclusionof the hearing, we dismissed the application.  We now give our reasons.  Although the judgments of the Judge and Chu JA were in Chinese,the parties conducted their submissions before us in English.

Lord Woolf MR in <i>A.E.I. Ltd v. Phonographic Performance Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20WLR%201507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 WLR 1507</a> commented on the effect of the <i>CPR</i> on the award of costs.  I will set out his comments in full because it is also relevant to the understanding of the new rules introducedby the <i>CJR</i> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The Civil Procedure Rules 1998 which have now been made and come into force on 26 April 1999 confer an equally broad discretionas to costs as the existing Ord. 62, r. 3 but are much more specific as to the matters to which the courts should have regard indeciding what order should be made. I refer to Part 44.3(2) and (4) which have to be considered together with the overriding objectiveof the Rules contained in Part 1:</p>		<blockquote>			<p class="quote">â(2) If the court decides to make an order about costsâ(<i>a</i>) the general rule is that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party; but (<i>b</i>) the court may make a different order ... (4) In deciding what order (if any) to make about costs, the court must have regard toall the circumstances, includingâ(<i>a</i>) the conduct of all the parties; (<i>b</i>) whether a party has succeeded on part of his case, even if he has not been wholly successful; and (<i>c</i>) any payment into court or admissible offer to settle made by a party which is drawn to the courtâs attention ...â</p>		</blockquote>                <p class="quote">Part 44.3(5) defines âconductâ as including:</p>		<blockquote>			<p class="quote">â(<i>b</i>) whether it was reasonable for a party to raise, pursue or contest a particular allegation or issue; (<i>c</i>) the manner in which a party has pursued or defended his case or a particular allegation or issue; (<i>d</i>) whether a claimant who has succeeded in his claim, in whole or in part, exaggerated his claim.â</p>		</blockquote>                <p class="quote">Part 44 also sets out the wide range of different orders which the court can make in paragraph 44.3(6).</p>        <p class="quote"><u>I draw attention to the new Rules because, while they make clear that the general rule remains, that the successful party will normallybe entitled to costs, they at the same time indicate the wide range of considerations which will result in the court making differentorders as to costs. From 26 April 1999 the âfollow the event principleâ will still play a significant role, but it will be astarting point from which a court can readily depart.</u> This is also the position prior to the new Rules coming into force. The most significant change of emphasis of the new Rules is torequire courts to be more ready to make separate orders which reflect the outcome of different issues. In doing this the new Rulesare reflecting a change of practice which has already started. <u>It is now clear that too robust an application of the âfollow the event principleâ encourages litigants to increase the costsof litigation, since it discourages litigants from being selective as to the points they take. If you recover all your costs as longas you win, you are encouraged to leave no stone unturned in your effort to do so.</u>â</p>        <p>(emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Lord Woolf MR further held that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The âwell established practiceâ on which Nourse L.J. based his third principle is, as I have already indicated, less generallyfollowed than it has been in the past and it is no longer necessary for a party to have acted <i>unreasonably</i> or <i>improperly</i> to be deprived of his costs of a particular issue on which he has failed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  One can see immediately that Hong Kong has adopted a similar approach under Order 62, rule 3(2) in terms of the âfollow the eventprincipleâ and its departure and also under rule 5 in terms of the consideration whether a party has succeeded on part of the case,even if he has not been wholly successful, and conduct.  In our view, one can say with equal confidence that after 2 April 2009,while the âfollow the event principleâ will still play a significant role in Hong Kong, it will nonetheless only be a startingpoint from which the Court can depart, the rationale being that a mechanistic adoption of the âfollow the event principleâ mayresult in parties incurring unnecessary costs in civil litigation.  We do not consider the provisions of Order 62, rule 7(1) (whichenable the Court to disallow a partyâs costs or order it to pay the other partyâs costs if there is anything done or omittedwhich is improper or unnecessary) will by itself curtail the power of the Court under the new regime.  The amendment to rule 7(2)had specifically added the new (aa), namely, regard to the underlying objectives set out in Order 1A, rule 1.  In our view Order62, rule 7 enables the Court to address the costs issue when there are improper or unnecessary acts or omissions but it does notconfine the Courtâs power only to such situations. </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In the present case, the Judge had departed from the âfollow the event principleâ.  Ms    Ann Lui, counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent, argued that the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent being the successful party ought to be awarded the costs of the proceedings.  In our view the Judge was entitled to departfrom the usual approach having regard to the fact that the applicant, although being the unsuccessful party, had succeeded in thedisqualification issue below.  The only question is whether the Judge had erred in principle when she made no order as to costs? Should the Judge make a proportionate costs order to reflect the different success of the parties on different issues?</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Ms Lui argued that there were five issues before the Judge and the applicant only succeeded on one of them.  On that basis the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent should get at least 80% of the costs.  Ms Lui referred to the judgment of the Privy Council in <i>Seepsad v Persad &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/2004/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] UKPC 19</a> (1 April 2004) which held at paragraph 24 that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â <u>The Measure of Costs</u></p>        <p class="quote">24. The Court of Appeal gave the appellant only half costs of his appeal and the cross-appeal brought by the respondents against theamount of the award for pain and suffering and loss of amenity. In so ordering it must have treated the assessment of damages underthis head as if it were a separate issue on which the appellant had lost, while succeeding on the other issues. In their Lordshipsâview this was an erroneous approach. The award of costs in Trinidad and Tobago is in the discretion of the court, as is usual inmost common law jurisdictions. The general rule which should be observed unless there is sufficient reason to the contrary is thatcosts will follow the event. Where the party who has been successful overall has failed on one or more issues, particularly whereconsideration of those issues has occupied a material amount of hearing time or otherwise led to the incurring of significant expense,the court may in its discretion order a reduction in the award of costs to him, either by a separate assessment of costs attributableto that issue or, as is now preferred, making a percentage reduction in the award of costs: see, eg, <i>In re Elgindata (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20WLR%201207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 WLR 1207.</a> The Court of Appealâs order was predicated upon the proposition that the assessment of damages for pain and suffering and lossof amenity was a separate issue from the assessment of the other heads of damage. This was an incorrect assumption. An issue forthese purposes must be something so distinct and separate in itself that the decision of it constitutes an âeventâ. The âeventâwas the quantum of damages to which the appellant was entitled and he succeeded on his appeal in obtaining a higher award than thejudge had given him: even though one head was decreased, another was increased and one which the judge had omitted was added to thetotal. Their Lordships accordingly consider that the Court of Appeal had insufficient ground for reducing the award of costs madeto the appellant and that he should have been awarded full costs in that court, without separating out any element attributable tothe cross-appeal, which was only a means of putting in issue the quantum of all the items of damage in the judgeâs award.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Whether a matter is an issue in the context of an award for costs must depend on the circumstances of the case. One can understandwhy different heads of damages in a personal injury claim were not considered by the Privy Council as issues because in that casewhile there was an decrease in one head, there was an increase in another head.  In the present case the Judge identified five issuesin her judgment, namely,</p>    <p>(1) Whether the 4<sup>th</sup> Management Committee had the authority to appoint an Election Officer?</p>    <p>(2) Whether the Election Officer had the authority to make Election Rules. If yes, whether the Election Rules were reasonable?</p>    <p>(3) Whether the Election Officer had the authority to disqualify an ownerâs right to stand as a candidate in the election?</p>    <p>(4) Whether the resolution electing the 5<sup>th</sup> Management Committee was invalid because,</p>    <p>1) the applicant was disqualified or</p>    <p>2) a resolution was allowed to be passed at the AGM to consider whether owners could apply at the meeting to stand as a candidatefor election?</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In our view the broad categorisation of two issues by the Judge could not be faulted.  Issues 1 and 2 are obviously related to andmerged with Issue 3, namely, the disqualification issue which caused the applicant to bring the proceedings.  Issue 4, although dealingwith two events, is in fact one issue.  In practical terms the applicant had succeeded in one issue but failed in another.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Ms Lui further referred to <i>Fleming v Chief Constable of the Sussex Police Force</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/643.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] EWCA Civ 643</a> where the claimant claimed damages against the Police for</p>    <p>(1) wrong arrest, assault and false imprisonment;</p>    <p>(2) malicious prosecution;</p>    <p>(3) misfeasance in public office.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The jury awarded the claimant damages for assault and malicious prosecution and also aggravated damages in relation to the conductof the Police.  The judge ordered that, upon the issue of misfeasance (which was part of the original claim but later struck outby consent prior to trial) there should be no order as to costs as between the parties but that otherwise the defendant was to paythe remainder of the claimantâs costs of his claim.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The claimant argued on appeal that he should be entitled to the whole of his costs since he won the case. Alternatively even ifthere should be some discount of his costs for a matter he had lost, he should still be entitled to at least two third of his costson the basis he succeeded on two of the civil torts out of the three alleged by him.  The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  This case does not assist the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent because, contrary to Ms Luiâs submission and as apparent from our summary of the case, the claimant did not have thecosts of the action.  The Judge in fact departed from the âfollow the event principleâ.  The Court of Appeal was further of theview that it was not in a position to disturb the costs order below.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In the present case the Judge could well have ordered the applicant to have the costs on the disqualification issue on which hesucceeded, and the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent to have the costs on the ownersâ decision issue on which it succeeded.  But she did not do so.  In making no order asto costs of the proceedings, she was in the best position to assess the proportion of costs incurred relevant to each issue.  Weare unable to say that she had erred such that we can disturb the exercise of her discretion. </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  As we have not heard arguments on the merits of the judgment other than on costs, it would not be appropriate for us to expressany view on the merits of the applicantâs claim.  We proceeded on the basis of the finding made by the Judge.</p>    <p style="text-align:center"><u>Decision on Costs</u></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent failed in its application before us.  We see nothing to depart from the âfollow the event principleâ.  Accordinglythe applicant is entitled to the costs of the application.</p>	<p> </p>		<p> </p>	    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="50%">(Peter Cheung)<br />			Justice of Appeal</td>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="50%">(Maria Yuen)<br />			Justice of Appeal</td>        </tr>    </table>		<p> </p>		<!--sino section representation --><representation>		<p>Mr Clark Wang, instructed by Messrs Kwok, Ng &amp; Chan, for the Applicant</p>		<p>Ms Ann Lui, instructed by Messrs Wong, Fung &amp; Co., for the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent</p>	</representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2011/1866.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
