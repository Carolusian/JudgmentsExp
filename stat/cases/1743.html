It raises a question sosimple in itself that the only background facts I need refer to are that in proceedings for divorce the husband and wife came toa financial agreement, which by consent was made an order of the Court; that the agreement made provision for a lump sum paymentby the husband, to be paid by instalments over a number of years; and that the husband was in default of one payment for some considerabletime. The question is whether the wife is entitled to interest for the period of that delayed payment. The agreement made no provisionfor interest but <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s50.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 50</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336">Cap. 336</a> provides as follows: -</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p align="left" class="quote">50.      A judgment debt shall carry interest at the rate fixed by the Chief Justice by notice published in the Gazette on the aggregateamount thereof, or on such part thereof as for the time being remains unsatisfied, from the date of the judgment until satisfaction."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Had the proceedings been in the High Court the relevant section would have been Section 49 of the Supreme Court Ordinance <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap. 4</a>which, for the present purpose, is in identical terms.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The judge below put it as a more general question, to include periodical payments, although the order in question made no provisionof that kind so far as the wife is concerned. He said -</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p align="left" class="quote">       The point at issue is whether orders for maintenance, be they periodical payments or lump sum payments in lieu of monthly orweekly financial support come within the confines of a 'judgment debt' as referred to in Section 50. It is my view that maintenancedoes not constitute a judgment debt as envisaged in the provision in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a>. The determination and enforcement of orders for maintenance and/or lump sum payments are quite distinct from civil debts or claimsfor damages.It has it's own set of legislation and it's own unique form of enforcement namely by judgment summons with the ultimatepenalty of imprisonment. I do not believe it was ever intended by the legislature that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s50.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 50</a> of the Ordinance would encompass all orders for periodical payments of maintenance or instalments of lump sum payments."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> With regard to lump sum payments a different view has been taken in England. In <u>K.</u> v. <u>K</u>.<sup>(1)</sup> Stephenson L.J. gave as an example -</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p align="left" class="quote">         If therefore a husband had been ordered on May 17, 1964, to pay his wife a lump sum on September 1, 1964, interest would,in my judgment, have been payable on that sum from September 1....."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <blockquote>                        <p> </p>                    </blockquote>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In <u>Preston</u> v. <u>Preston</u> <sup>(2)</sup> Ormrod L.J. said -</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p align="left" class="quote">After the sum becomes due, it attracts statutory interest as a judgment debt, automatically, under a High Court judgment (but notunder a County Court judgment: see <u>Burrows</u> v. <u>Burrows</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1981%20Times%2010" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1981 Times 10th</a> march)"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left">In the same case Brandon L.J. said<sup>(3) _</sup></p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p align="left" class="quote">The position is that, once any instalment falls due and remains unpaid, it is a judgment debt on which statutory interest is payablein the normal way."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left">Neither case is directly in point. <u>K.</u> v. <u>K</u>.<sup>(1)</sup> was concerned with the time from which interest on an order for costs ought to run, while in <u>Preston</u> v. <u>Preston</u><sup>(2)</sup> the question was whether a judge could order interest on instalments not yet due, a point now covered in England by an amendmentto Section 23 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. Nevertheless the position that an unpaid instalment order attracts interest appearsto lie accepted, for example Butterworth's Family Law Service advises that "in the case of a garnishee to enforce a lump sum interest,calculated from the date of default, may also be claimed".<sup>(4)</sup></p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The English legislation is contained in Sections 17 and 18 of the Judgments Act 1838 -</p>    <p align="justify">  </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"17.   .... every judgment debt shall carry interest at the rate of <strike>Â£</strike>4 per centum per annum from the time of entering up the judgment .... until the sane shall be satisfied, and such interest may belevied under a writ of execution on such jgdgment.</p>        <p class="quote"> </p>        <p class="quote">18.   ..... all decrees and orders of courts of equity, and all rules of courts of common law .... whereby any sum of money, or anycosts .... shall be payable to any person, shall have the effect of judgments in the superior courts of common law ...."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Mrs. Penlington, who appears for the husband, draws our particular attention to Section 18 which has no counterpart in Hong Kong.The implication, I take her to suggest, is that because of their express mention therein, decrees and so on cannot otherwise havebeen thought sufficient to create judgment debts with Section 17. In Hong Kong a decree is in any event, at least in the High Court,a judgment: Sec. 2, Supreme Court Ordinance. However if the substance of Section 18 is not, nor ever has been, part of the law ofHong Kong I cannot see its relevance. We must take Section 50 in its own context, not in that of other legislation.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> That context then, as Mrs. Penlington reminds us, immediately includes Section 49, which provides power to order, on claims for debtor damages, interest from the date when the cause of action arose to that of judgment. It follows, so she suggests, that Section50 is restricted to judgment debts in those two instances. With respect I am not persuaded that it does.  I can find no connectionbetween the two sections, other than proximity.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> It is then said that not all orders are judgments, that there is a distinction, as shown for example by Section 74 of the CountyCourt Act 1984, which at last remedies the anomaly that judgment debts in the County Court did not carry interest. The section refersspecifically to "judgments <u>or</u> orders". (The emphasis is my own). We are also referred to <u>In re Olson</u> <sup>(5)</sup> , in which an order made in favour of a husband for provision out of his late wife's estate was held not to carry interest underthe equivalent New Zealand legislation. The reason given was that because the payment was to be made "out of the proceeds of therealisation of the estate", it was a conditionalorder and there is authority in that jurisdiction that an order for payment conditionallydoes not constitute such a judgment debt. It could perhaps have been argued, relying upon <u>K.</u> v. <u>K.</u><sup>(1)</sup>, that the payment was not due until the estate had in fact been realised, which due to the economic recession of the time took manymany years.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Be that as it may, I accept that there will be orders which do not qualify as judgments sufficient to create judgment debts withinSection 50. The question is whether orders for lump sum payments do or do not. I do not think it necessary to consider any esotericdistinction between judgments and orders as such. It is the substance of the order in question that is material. Lump sum ordersare once-for-all orders.They are orders for the payment of money and unlike, for example periodical payments, the amount cannot besubsequently varied. At most the liability to pay can be deferred or made payable by instalments, either in the original order orupon a judgment summons taken out by the party in whose favour it was made. In the present instance it is doubtful whether even thesepossibilities remain open, for the order was made by consent.  However no point has been taken in this respect.  In my judgment thecharacteristics I have mentioned combine to make an order for lump sum payments something that is properly called a judgment debt.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> But that is not an end of the matter. Even so, it is suggested that upon a proper construction of those words in Section 50 theydo not extend to anything within the matrimonial jurisdiction, either because the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/179A" class="autolink_findacts">Matrimonial Causes Rules</a>, and in particular <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/179A/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rules 87</a> to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/179A/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">90</a> which relate to judgment summonses, provide a complete and exhaustive code of enforcement, or because the nature of the matrimonialjurisdiction is so alien to that of normal civil process that the legislature must have intended that the provisions enacted withregard to that normal process should not apply to matrimonial affairs. This is said to be illustrated by what we are told is theinvariable practice of seeking to enforce matrimonial orders only by way of judgment summonses. A glance at Butterworth's FamilyLaw Service suggests that it may not be the invariable practice in England, but, whatever the practice either here or there, it isclear that the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/179A" class="autolink_findacts">Matrimonial Causes Rules</a> themselves recognise other forms of enforcement. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/179A/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 86(1)</a> refers to "any process ..... issued for the enforcement of an order made in matrimonial proceedings" and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/179A/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 86</a><sup>(2)</sup>makes special provision for "a writ of fieri facias or  warrant of execution ..... where an application for a variation order is pending".</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> However the question at issue is not concerned with how a judgment or order is to be enforced, but with what is imported by law intothe judgment or order itself. Of course the factors which a court takes into consideration when assessing appropriate payments inmatrimonial causes are very different from those to which it would refer in the assessment of damages for breach of contract or tort.But once the amount of the sum to be paid has been found it seems to me that there remains nothing to distinguish the one from theother. Both are sums of money which have been ordered to be paid. For myself I can see no reason why the legislature should haveintended that, in default of payment, one should bear interest and the other should not.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> For these reasons I would allow the appeal. The summons taken out before the judge below asked that an order for the payment of interestbe made. I do not think that would be correct. Interest is provided for by the statute. It is sufficient for the Court to say thatthe order falls within the statute.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(D.
