id="p1">1.</a> These proceedings began by way of action by Hong Kong Kam Lan Koon Limited (the Company) as plaintiff against Realray InvestmentsLimited (Realray) as defendant, in which the Company sought a declaration that Realray's title to certain new Territories land hadbeen extinguished.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> In the statement of claim it is first alleged that between 1969 and 1972 an unincorporated association, Kam Lan Koon (the Association)built a Taoist temple on the land, that until 1972 the land was in the adverse possession of the Association, and that since 1972it has been in the adverse possession of the Company, until the present time.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Realray has filed a defence to the action and has counterclaimed against the Company alleging trespass to the land, seeking an injunctionto restrain future trespass and seeking damages amongst other relief. In the counterclaim Realray seeks also to join the Associationas 2nd Defendant because of its alleged occupation of the land between 1969 and 1972. In the counterclaim as well as damages forthe trespass, an injunction is sought restraining future interference with the land.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> By virtue of the provisions of O. 15 R. 12 where numerous persons have the same interest in any proceedings, the proceedings maybe begun or continued against any one or more of them representing those numerous persons. Such proceedings are known as representativeproceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Now, Realray, by summons, seeks an order that Mr Kwan Yau-hang be appointed to represent the Association. The application is made,in part, because the Company now alleges that the Association ceased to operate since the incorporation of the Company in 1972, andthat what remains of the Association is a name only.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Realray's case however is that the Association is still alive and well and active and that accordingly it ought to be a party tothe proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> In dealing with this matter I have first regard to the decision of Megarry J in <strong>John v. Rees</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20Ch%20345" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] Ch 345</a>, correctly summarized in the headnote in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The rule for representative actions laid down in RSC O. 15 R. 12(1) was not a rigid one, but was a rule of convenience; that whatwas important was to have before the court, either in person or by representation, all those who would be affected, so that all shouldbe bound by the result."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Having regard to the nature of this matter, and the past history of the Association, the need to have all who would be affected boundby the result assumes a real and critical importance in this case.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Mr Chong for the company and for Mr Kwan says first, it must be shown that the defendants are numerous, second that the court mustbe satisfied that the person appointed is authorized by the others to represent them in that particular matter, and third, that arepresentative order ought not be made when the claim involves an action against certain members of an unincorporated associationon behalf of others to enforce a strictly personal liability.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> His primary submission, however, is that an order should not be made on disputed facts and that these interlocutory proceedings areinappropriate to determine disputed facts. Mr Chong refers here to the dispute between the parties as to whether the Associationhas existed since 1972, and whether it has had any members since 1972. Mr Kwan has made an affidavit in opposition to the order beingmade in which he asserts that since 1972 the Association has become a defunct association with no members.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> This is, in my view, a most audacious submission having regard to the history of the Association and Mr Kwan's involvement in theAssociation, and indeed Mr Chong's own personal involvement in other proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> In Judicial Review proceedings brought by the Association against the Government in HCAC 42/1997, the Association, by its representativeMr Kwan, sought certain declarations in relation to nearly the same land as is the subject of these proceedings. In those proceedings,Mr Kwan made an affidavit in which he asserted that he was the 'Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Association' and thathe was duly authorized by the Association to make the affidavit. The proceedings were conducted, plainly on the instructions of MrKwan on behalf of the Association, right through to the Court of Final Appeal with the Association being the appellant, and thereforethe instigator the proceedings, before both the Court of Appeal and the Final Court of Appeal. At no stage throughout those proceedingsdid Mr Kwan ever assert that the Association was defunct, that it had existed in name only since 1972, or that it had no members.Throughout those proceedings Mr Chong appeared as counsel for the Association and Mr Kwan.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> I have had regard to the provisions of O 38 r 12 and I am satisfied that the relevant affidavits in those earlier proceedings havebeen duly exhibited in these proceedings and are accordingly now evidence which may be considered in these proceedings. It is notwithout significance that the rule does not assert that evidence may not be used in other proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Findings of fact were made in the course of the Judicial Review proceedings that Mr Kwan "was an still is the head of the Association".It is right that in affidavits Mr Kwan and a Mr Wong Wing-hau have asserted that in 1972 the Company took over the affairs of theAssociation, but they do not assert that the Association was wound up and ceased to exist. Such an assertion would be quite inconsistentwith the Association pursuing as it did, the Judicial Review proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> I am satisfied that the members of the Association are numerous. The evidence before me establishes that on 25 June 2003 a websitepurporting to be that of the Association proclaimed Mr Kwan as its chairman and asserted 4 vice-chairmen and 69 committee members.In his affirmation Mr Kwan makes no reference to the website and does not disavow it in any way at all. Mr Chong seeks to say thatthe website is the Company's website, but there is no evidence to that effect from either the Company or Mr Kwan.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> In the circumstances, I am satisfied that an unincorporated association of an unknown number of persons which requires to have itsadministration conducted by no less than 74 persons falls clearly within the class of "numerous persons" contemplated by O 15 R 12(1).</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Next Mr Chong says that there is no evidence that the Association has authorized Mr Kwan in this particular matter. The subject matterof these proceedings is the occupancy of land by the Company and the Association on and nearby land upon which a Taoist temple hasbeen built. That is precisely the same subject matter that was before the courts in the Judicial Review proceedings before the Courtof First Instance, the Court of Appeal and the Final Court of Appeal. I use the expression "subject matter" in its broad colloquialsense. It is right that different and discrete legal issues arose and arise in the various proceedings, but at the heart of all thelitigation has been the occupancy of the land by the Association and the Company.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> I have not the slightest doubt that, should it be asked, the Association would appoint Mr Kwan as its representative, just as hehas been in the past. In any event, where it is necessary to sue an unincorporated association for the purpose of determining rightsthe proper course is to sue a responsible official, such as the Treasurer or the Secretary on behalf of the association: <em>see</em> <strong>Re Pritt, Morton v. National Church League</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281915%29%2031%20TLR%20299" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1915) 31 TLR 299</a>; HKCP 2004 15/12/23. The Chairman of an Association would fall clearly in the same class.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> It is argued that Mr Kwan should not be appointed against his wishes. He does not say in his affidavit that he is unwilling or unableto represent the Association. In the same affidavit in which he asserts the Association does not exist he deposes as to the existenceor otherwise of documents held by both the Company and the Association. He is plainly authorized and willing to act for both.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Any assertion by him now that he was unwilling or unable to represent the Association would be seen for what it would be; namelya deliberate attempt to frustrate the resolution of the issues between the real parties and to try to ensure that individuals involvedin the temple were not bound by any judgment in these proceedings. There is no doubt that as Chairman of the Association he is aproper person to represent the Association. He may even be compelled to represent the other members even against his own wishes:see <strong>Wood v. McCarthy</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1893%5d%201%20QB%20772" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1893] 1 QB 772.</a></p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Next Mr Chong says that a representative order should not be made where the claimant seeks to enforce a purely personal liability.I understand the essence of the argument to be that the claim by Realray is one of trespass, and that any trespass by any individualis a personal action by that individual, and not the responsibility of either the Company or the Association.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> There is no doubt that an association of incorporated persons can commit the tort of trespass. If the driver of a bulldozer, ownedby a construction company, is instructed to dig a piece of land, and that action constitutes a trespass, the construction companycould not be heard to say that while they may have instructed the action they were not liable and that liability should fall onlyon the individual who entered the land. Equally, if members of an unincorporated association take steps in furtherance of the associationsobjectives, and those steps constitute an actionable tort, the association must be liable.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The flexibility of the representative action rules sought by Megarry J, and the fact that in appropriate circumstances orders inrelation to torts by individuals may be made against members of an unincorporated association, is seen clearly in the Animal Aidcase: <strong>M Michaels (Furrier) Ltd v. Askew</strong> (1983) 127 SJ 597 CA, where action was brought against an unincorporated association of persons campaigning against cruelty to animals,a campaign which involved some members only of the association carrying out individual, tortuous actions against the property ofthe plaintiff. Mr Chong sought to distinguish this case by saying that the order sought was only an interlocutory order. That isright, but no issue was taken, nor could any have been taken, as to the suitability of the proposed representative defendant in circumstanceswhere all of the complaints that Mr Chong now makes were equally valid.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> It is important in making a representative order to bear in mind that while the judgment will be binding on all members of the Association,whether they are overseas or have no knowledge of the issues, it may not be enforced without leave. Such matters as lack of knowledge,and living overseas are clearly "facts and matters particular to his case", for which see <strong>Commissioner of Sewers v. Gellatly</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281876%29%203%20Ch%20D%20610" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1876) 3 Ch D 610</a> per Jessel MR, which would enable an individual member to escape from the damages aspect to the judgment while being properly boundby any declaration and injunction in respect of future conduct against members of the Association that might be made by the court.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Having regard to all of the circumstances of this case, the history of the conduct of litigation by the Company and the Associationin relation to the land, centre of the dispute, I am satisfied that the interest of justice demand that both the Company and themembers of the Association should be bound by any judgment given in Realray's counterclaim.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Notwithstanding the present assertion by the Company in the pleadings that it occupies the relevant land, and not the Associationthe very real danger in this case is that if a judgment is obtained against the Company it may later assert that it was the Associationwhich occupied the land or if obtained against individuals and not the Associations itself, those individuals will assert that theoccupation was by the Association. If obtained against the Company alone, individuals or the association may assert that they arefree to act and not bound by any orders made.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The decision appealed from was quite correct. The appeal is dismissed.
