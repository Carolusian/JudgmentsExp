The causes of action on which the action is based are:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)     negligence;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)    breach of statutory duty.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">The amount of damages claimed at the beginning of the trial approaches $190 million.  That amount was adjusted downward by 20% and50% respectively by a witness called by the plaintiff to give expert opinion on the business loss likely to have been suffered.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  By virtue of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435" class="autolink_findacts">Amusement Game Centres Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435">Cap. 435</a>), the defendant is vested with the power to grant licences for operating amusement game centres (â<i>AGCs</i>â (and â<i>AGC</i>â in singular)).  This action arises from the defendantâs earlier refusal of the plaintiffâs application for an AGC licence. The plaintiff alleges that the refusal was a result of the defendantâs negligence and/or breach of statutory duty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Background Facts</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The background facts are largely undisputed and can be summarized as follows.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In March 1999, a Ms Wong (â<i>Wong</i>â) applied on the plaintiffâs behalf to the defendant for an AGC licence.  The proposed location of the AGC was a basement shopin a multi-storey building in Marble Road, North Point (â<i>the proposed AGC</i>â).  There is an exit in the basement level leading to the North Point MTR station.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The defendant informed Wong on 1 April 1999 the application was being processed.  The defendantâs letter contained the followingstatement:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âç±æ¼æ¬èå¨ç¾éæ®µæªè½ç¢ºå®ä½ çç³è«æå¦ç²æ¹åï¼æåææ­¤é­éå¸å»ä½ ï¼åå¿å°±æ¬ä½¿ç¨çæ¨å®ï¼ä½åºä»»ä½æ¯åºæä»»ä½å½¢å¼çè²¡æ¿æ¿æãâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">A similar advice appeared in a number of the defendantâs subsequent correspondence with the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The defendantâs inspection staff visited the proposed AGC.  In a report prepared afterwards, 8 education institutions were foundto be within the 100-meter radius.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On 16 June 1999, the defendant informed Wong, subject to her representation, the AGC application would be refused because of thepresence of one education institute within 100 metres of the proposed AGC.  Written representations were made by Wong on 29 June1999.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The defendant informed Wong on 10 August 1999 the application to grant an AGC licence was refused.  The appeal against the refusalwas dismissed by the appeal board in February 2000 (written reasons were given in March 2000).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Wong sought, and was granted, leave to apply for judicial review in June 2000 (HCAL 775/2000).  In a judgment handed down in November2000, the decisions of the defendant and the appeal board were quashed.  The court remitted Wongâs application to the defendantfor reconsideration in accordance with the courtâs findings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 19 February 2001 the defendant informed Wong its intention to refuse the application subject to her representations.

This involves starting witha prima facie assumption that a duty of care exists if it is reasonably foreseeable that carelessness may cause damage and then askingwhether there are any considerations which ought to ânegative, or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the class of personto whom it is owed or the damages to which a breach of it may arise.â  Subsequent decisions in this House and the Privy Councilhave preferred to approach the question the other way round, starting with situations in which a duty has been held to exist andthen asking whether there are considerations of analogy, policy, fairness and justice for extending it to cover a new situation â¦provided that the considerations of policy etc. are properly analysed, it should not matter whether one starts from one end or theother.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">On the other hand the assumption from which one starts makes a great deal of difference if the analysis is wrong.

He started from the position that a coherent, principled control mechanismhas to be found for limiting a public authorityâs private law liability since the <i>Merton London Borough Council</i> case.  This is because:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â[the] powers conferred on public authorities permeate so many fields that a private law duty in all cases, sounding in damages,would be no more acceptable than the opposite extremeâ (p. 931).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">He examined the tripartite formulation of liability in the <i>Caparo</i> case (see para. 26 above) and opined that, although âproximityâ is a slippery word, and is nothing more than a convenient shorthandfor a relationship between two parties which makes it fair and reasonable one should owe the other a duty of care (p. 932B-C (andalso pp. 936H-937C), <i>Stovin</i>), the test still has advantages.  It enables the court to focus on the relationship between the parties.  But, he said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ the test of fairness and reasonableness is more difficult to satisfy with a duty to act.  This is especially so when the subjectmatter is potential financial loss, rather than physical injury or damage.  The reluctance to impose a duty to act is even greaterwhen the loss threatened is financialâ (p. 932).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">In relation to the relevance of the statute to the imposition of a common law duty, his approach is the same as Lord Hoffmannâs:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âPublic authorities discharging statutory functions operate within a statutory framework.  Since the will of the legislature isparamount in this field, the common law <b><i>should not impose</i></b> a concurrent <b><i>duty inconsistent</i></b> with this framework.  A common law duty must not be inconsistent with the performance by the authority of its statutory duties andpower in the manner intended by Parliament, or contrary in any other way to the presumed legislative intentionâ (emphasis supplied)(p. 935) (see also p. 937B-C).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  What appeared to have divided him and Lord Hoffmann in the outcome of the appeal in <i>Stovin</i> was whether imposing a duty on the highway authorityâs part to act (namely, to carry out the actual work of removing a visibilityproblem from a road junction) was inconsistent with the statutory framework.  Lord Nicholls (and the minority) concluded it was notbecause the highway authority had in fact decided to act, but merely failed to proceed with reasonable diligence (a duty which thelegislature intended to impose); this, coupled with other special features, rendered the authority liable: pp. 936C and 939-41. On the other hand, Lord Hoffmann (and the majority) concluded that the highway authority has not been irrational in not exercisingits discretion to act immediately (timing of the work and budgetary considerations being part of the discretion) (pp. 956); further,the evidence adduced before the court did not establish that the authority has in fact decided to act (p. 956-7).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Having considered the legal principles set out above, I do not consider <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435">Cap. 435</a> to intend to give rise to a private cause of action.

In relation to that matter, I said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â26.

But if this contention were right,it in fact makes this limb of the plaintiffâs claim unarguable.  This is because one of the main planks of its case is the defendanthas failed to interpret, adopt and/or apply the Guidelines correctly (see particulars (b) and (c), para. 24, statement of claim). The judgment in the judicial review application is relied on as the basis for such case (see particular (f), para. 24, statementof claim).  The defendant is also said to have persisted in such error even after the said judgment (see particulars (e), (g) and(i), para. 24, statement of claim).  As stated above, the reason given in the judicial review application for setting aside the defendantâsdecision was that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â31.   ... the policy [that is, the Guidelines], according to its plain meaning, has not been appliedand, accordingly, the decisionof the Board should â¦ be quashedâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Hence, if (as was argued in the written closing submissions) the Guidelines were of no legal effect, then the defendant can quitelegitimately ignore them when exercising the discretion powers conferred by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 5(4)(b).</a>  Consequently, in the absence of a pleaded basis of irrationality in the defendantâs refusal to grant the application, Lord Hoffmannâsfirst minimum precondition (see para. 28 above) has not been satisfied.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  As regards Lord Hoffmannâs second minimum precondition, the legislative intention of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435">Cap. 435</a> was mentioned in the <i>Lau Wai Kin, Dandy</i> case:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â30.

I think that onecan safely assume, though I have not seen the relevant Executive Council memorandum, that the words of the policy were placed beforethat body. <b><i>I do not see</i></b> <b><i>why the Commissioner should not be bound</i></b> by the policy thus expressedâ (emphasis supplied) (para. 30).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Thus, as its long title states, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435">Cap. 435</a> is a statute enacted for the regulation AGCs (which purpose must be for the benefit of thecommunity, especially children and young people).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The plaintiff also argues that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435">Cap. 435</a> was enacted to protect âlegitimate operatorsâ of AGCs as well, relying on words to sucheffect by the (then) Secretary for Home Affairs when moving the second reading of the bill: <i>Hong Kong Hansard</i>, 14 October 1992 (at p. 120).  Assuming in the plaintiffâs favour that the reference to <i>Hong Kong Hansard</i> is permissible for present purposes, two things should be noted:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)     the tenure of the speech was concerned with the need to pass the bill to enable a âmore effective and stricter control over[AGCs]â to tackle the increasing âconflicts with the former licence conditionsâ and the resultant public concern;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)     in any event, the plaintiff was never an operator of an AGC and thus never fell within the class referred to in the speech.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  By reason of the above matters, I do not consider it a policy of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435">Cap. 435</a> that compensation should be paid to applicants such asthe plaintiff when their applications have been refused by the defendant in the circumstances summarized above, being occasions wherethe defendant was clearly exercising a discretion conferred by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435">Cap. 435</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  It is strictly unnecessary to mention the point.  But merely because a person falls within the class which can benefit from a statutedoes not necessarily mean that the statute has conferred upon him a private cause of action: <i>Cutler v. Wandsworth Stadium Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] AC 398</a> (a claim brought by a bookmaker against the occupier of a licensed dog-racing track for failing to provide a space for carrying onbookmaking, in accordance with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 11</a>, Betting and Lotteries Act 1934).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In the course of its verbal closing submissions, the plaintiff recognised the flaw in its argument about the Guidelines not havingany legal effect, and accepted that they can be used by the defendant as a reference.  It is common ground that the defendant hasfallen into error when applying para. (g) of the Guidelines before the judicial review application.  But even so, and for the reasonsset out in para. 40 to 42 below, I do not consider the error to be such as to render the defendantâs decision to fall outside theambit of s. 5(4)(b)(ii).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  There is nothing inherently undesirable about a public authority laying down policies, or guidelines, when exercising its discretionarypowers conferred by statute.  As <i>de Smith, Woolf &amp; Jowell: Judicial Review of Administrative Action</i> (1995) 5<sup>th</sup> Ed. points out:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âA decision-making body exercising public functions which is entrusted with a discretion must not, by the adoption of a fixed ruleof policy, disable itself from exercising its discretion in individual cases â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">The rule against fettering discretion by no means forbids bodies upon which discretionary power has been conferred to guide the implementationof that discretion by means of a policy or a rule.  It directs attention to the <i>attitude</i> of the decision-maker â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">The underlying rationale of the rule â¦ is to ensure that two perfectly legitimate administrative values, those of <b><i>legal certainty and consistency</i></b>, may be counteracted by another equally legitimate administrative value, namely, that of <b><i>responsiveness</i></b> â¦ â (emphasis supplied) (para. 11-001, 11-003 and 11-004).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">(see also <i>Fordham: Judicial Review Handbook</i> (2001) 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed., para. 50.4, pp. 746-750).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The purpose of para. (g) of the Guidelines has also been touched upon in the <i>Lau Wai Kin, Dandy</i> case:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â33.   â¦ it has to be remembered that s. 5(4)(b)(ii) is essentially concerned with the âsuitability of an areaâ, and not simplyâan areaâ.  The purpose of the regulatory regime set up by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435">Cap. 435</a> has already been set out in para. 18 and 31 above.  Withthis in mind, matters like the <b><i>distribution and density</i></b> of AGCs and their <b><i>proximity</i></b> to institutions of concern (such as educational institutions) must be highly relevant to the Commissionerâs decision; hence, para.(g) of the Guidelinesâ (emphasis supplied).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The defendant has failed to measure the distances between the proposed AGC and the existing AGCs and educational institutions strictlyin accordance with the letters of the Guidelines.  Nevertheless, the actual measurements must have been undertaken with the purposeof s. 5(4)(b)(ii) in mind.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Thus, in short, the defendantâs earlier error in applying para. (g) of the Guidelines does not amount to:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)     a decision so unreasonable that it should fall outside the ambit of the statutory discretion under s. 5(4)(b) (using the wordsof Lord Browne-Wilkinson in the <i>Bedfordshire County Council</i> case, or Dyson LJ in the <i>Essex CC</i> case (and assuming the error is justiciable));</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)    no real exercise of the discretion, or an act in abuse or excess of the power conferred (using the words of the court in the<i>Dorset Yacht</i> case);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)     so irrational a decision as to not to have exercised the discretion, and hence in breach of the public duty to act (usingthe words of Lord Hoffmann in the <i>Stovin</i> case).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The above reasons can apply with equal force to the plaintiffâs case based on an alleged contravention of s. 5(4)(b)(i).  Butthere are other reasons why this part of the plaintiffâs case should also fail.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  First, the plaintiff contends (among other things) that it was improper for the defendant to also consider s. 5(4)(b)(i) after judgmenthas been pronounced in the judicial review application.  In view of the courtâs observations in that judgment (quoted at para.21 above), there is no substance in this contention.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The plaintiff also contends that the defendant has wrongfully sub-delegated the discretion power in the letter dated 24 April 2001(see also para. 11 above).  The gist of the complaint here is that the letter required the plaintiff to comply with requirementsrelating to hygiene and ventilation, fire prevention and noise reduction, and left inspection work to the Food and EnvironmentalHygiene Department as well as the Fire Services Department.  I see no merit in the contention.  Public safety (of visitors and neighboursof AGCs) must have been one of the important matters falling within s. 5(4)(b)(i).  The above requirements are all concerned withpublic safety.  There is nothing wrong for the defendant take into account the opinions of those two departments as regards whetherthose requirements have been fulfilled, the defendant herself not having the same expertise to undertake the task.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Finally, by failing to respond to the defendantâs letters since 24 April 2001, by 2 July 2002 (see para. 13 above), the defendantwas entitled to conclude that the proposed AGC has not met the requirements set out in the letter dated 24 April 2001.  In this connection,the letter dated 24 April 2001 expressly stated:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âä½ é æ¼äºï¼ï¼ä¸å¹´ä¸æäºååæ¥æä¹åï¼å¡«å¦¥è¡¨æ ¼ï¼éä»¶11ï¼ä¸¦æäº¤ä¸åè³æï¼ä»¥éç¥æ¬èä½ å·²éµå¾ªæéè¦å®â¦â.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Further, in relation to both ss. 5(4)(b)(i) and (ii), the same conclusion (see para. 31 above) can be reached via another route. One of the reasons given in <i>Yuen Kun Yeu v. Attorney General of Hong Kong</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20AC%20175" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 AC 175</a> for finding that the Commissioner of Deposit-Taking Companies owed no duty of care to the depositors of a deposit-taking companywhich was liquidated was:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â[it] must not be overlooked that the power to refuse registration, and to revoke or suspend it, is <b><i>quasi-judicial in character</i></b>, as is demonstrated by the right of appeal to the Governor in Council â¦ and the right to be heard by the commissioner â¦ â (emphasissupplied) (p. 195) (see also the <i>Stovin</i> case, p. 937C).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">(For completeness, the court in <i>Yuen Kun Yeu</i> also relied in support of the said finding on grounds such as the commissioner did not have power to control the daily managementof such companies, but merely to put them out of business, and there was no supervisory power to prevent fraud of those in charge).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Here, the defendantâs power to grant, suspend or revoke AGC licence is also quasi-judicial in character: see, for example, ss.5, 8, 9, 10 and 11 to 15, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435">Cap. 435</a>.  There are recognised public policy reasons for conferring immunity from suit to quasi-judicialdecision makers: see, for example, <i>Olowofoyeku: Suing Judges: A Study of Judicial Immunity</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20Ch%203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993), Ch. 3</a> (especially at pp. 82-5); <i>Russell on Arbitration</i> (2003) 21<sup>st</sup> Ed., para. 4-208 (especially text to nn. 50-1).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(b)     Breach of Duty of Care</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Even if the defendant somehow owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, this part of the plaintiffâs claim should still fail on theground that no breach of that duty has been established in relation to s. 5(4)(b)(ii), and possibly also in relation to s. 5(4)(b)(i).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  S. 11, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435">Cap. 435</a> provides that appeals from the defendantâs decision lies with the appeal board.  The appeal boardâs decisionsare thus binding on the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The plaintiff has (correctly) not contended the duty owed by the defendant is absolute.  Such being the case, the defendant cannotbe regarded as having failed to act reasonably when her decisions in effect followed (or at least accorded with) the decisions ofthe appeal board.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The facts relevant to this aspect are:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)     there is evidence that in September 1995, the appeal board upheld the defendantâs decision to refuse Wongâs earlier application.

However if the decision complained of is so unreasonable that it falls outside the ambit of the discretion conferredupon the â¦ authority, there is no a priori reason for excluding all common law liabilityâ (emphasis supplied) (p. 736).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  In relation to the last-quoted sentence, he quoted in support the following passages in the judgment of <i>Dorset Yacht Co.

Parliament cannot be supposed to have granted immunity to persons who do thatâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  By reason of the above matters, I agree with the plaintiff that, as a matter of construction (see Lord Hoffmannâs approach setout in para. 27 above), the policy of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435">Cap. 435</a> does not show an intention to confer a right of compensation in circumstances suchas the present:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)     the discretion conferred by ss. 5(3) and (4) is quasi-judicial in character;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)     <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435">Cap. 435</a> is intended to protect a class of the public (which does not include someone in the plaintiffâs position) and toregulate AGCs;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)     a private cause of action founded upon the manner in which the discretion is exercised may inhibit the proper and expeditiousexercise of that power;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)     applicants for an AGC licence have been given rights to appeal to the appeal board, or to apply for judicial review of thedefendantâs decisions.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Insofar as it may be necessary to do so, I also agree with the defendantâs submission that there has not been any breach of statutoryduty.  The reasons for so concluding are as follows.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The discretion conferred by s. 5(4) (read together with s. 5(3)) is a power on the defendantâs part to grant or refuse applicationsfor an AGC licence.  S. 5(4)(b)(i) requires the defendant to consider the suitability of a place proposed for operating an AGC whereass. 5(4)(b)(ii) requires the defendant to consider the suitability of an area in which the proposed operation is located.  The defendanthas acted pursuant to those provisions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Because the Guidelines are not regulations made pursuant to s. 18, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/435">Cap. 435</a>, there is no basis for arguing there was a separatestatutory duty on the defendantâs part to act in accordance with the Guidelines.  The judgment handed down in the judicial reviewhas made no finding on this.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  The manner in which the defendant arrived at the decisions that the applications ought to be refused, though not in accordance withthe letters of the Guidelines, was not so irrational as to take those decisions outside the ambit of s. 5(4).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Conclusion on Liability</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  The plaintiff has failed to establish the defendantâs liability under both limbs of its claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Loss and Damages</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  For completeness, I shall also deal with the issues relating to quantum.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Both parties called witnesses to give their respective opinion on the business loss likely to have been suffered for the periodfrom 1999 to 2006 (a period of about 8 years).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The tenancy relating to the proposed AGC (dated 1 September 1999) contained a lease term of 3 years commencing in August 1999 andending in August 2002.  There was also a schedule conferring an option on the plaintiffâs part to renew the tenancy for 3 years(taking the lease to August 2005) and another option to renew it yet again for 2 years (taking the lease to August 2007).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  As stated above, the plaintiffâs witness opines that the amount of loss should be almost $190 million.  On the other hand, thedefendantâs witness opines that no loss would be suffered because the proposed AGC is unlikely to be profitable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Evidence of Loss</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Before discussing the âexpertâ evidence adduced by the parties, a few words should be spent on whether âlikely business lossâis in fact a subject on which expert evidence should be admitted.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  A claim for likely business loss is inherently one based on probabilities.  Matters of general probability are an area over whichthe courts have resisted the introduction of expert evidence.  As has been stated in <i>Phipson on Evidence</i> (2005) 16<sup>th</sup> Ed. said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIn addition to the prohibition on experts giving evidence about matters of <b><i>general probability</i></b>, the advent of expertise dependent on statistical probabilities throws up problems of its own.

The object of such evidence - the <em>only</em> legitimate object - was to test the validity of the basic <em>Cookson v. Knowles</em> assumption in the Hong Kong context.

It would not be conducive to the efficient disposition of such cases as this that there should be a sophisticated, elaborate andexpensive actuarial inquiry into the value of superannuation benefits lost â¦ Policy considerations are against encouraging thatkind of approach â¦ â (at 61, 713) (quoted in <i>Freckelton &amp; Selby</i>, para. 16C.210).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  That the opinions of the witnesses called by both parties were based on probabilities is shown by the need in their reports to makevarious fundamental assumptions (for example, no changes to the political, legal and economic conditions, or to the demographic structureand composition, or to the market condition, or to the stability of expenses, and that the proposed AGC will be managed and operatedcompetently): see the heading âAssumptionsâ in the report of Wong Yung-sing (for the plaintiff) (â<i>YS Wong</i>â) and, similarly, the heading âValuation Assumptionsâ in the report of Li Wing-kang Brian (for the defendant) (â<i>Brian Li</i>â).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  The nature of the business involved in this action makes the situation even worse than other kinds of business.  It is undisputedthat AGCs generally attract business from young people.  Popularity of games available in AGCs themselves changes frequently.  But,as has been pointed out by Brian Li, the popularity of AGCs suffered with the advent of home video game consoles, followed by theintroduction of personal computer video games and the Internet video games; the two last-mentioned types of games probably resultedin the appearance of Internet cafes.  These developments make the business of AGCs very volatile.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  By reason of the above matters, and the simple fact that the proposed AGC has never been in operation, I conclude that the likelybusiness loss is merely a matter of general probability.  It is thus not a subject where expert evidence should be admitted.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Despite the above, I shall discuss further the evidence adduced by the parties purportedly as expert evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  The duty of expert witnesses at common law has been summarised in <i>Phipson</i> (adopting the judgment of Cresswell J in <i>The Ikarian Reefer</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%2068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 2 Ll Rep. 68</a>, 81-2):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â1.

L1/58/7). The courts have in effect warned that the first proposition cannot be read too literally: <i>Whitehouse v. Jordan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20All%20ER%20267" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 All ER 267</a>, 276, 284.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  The methodology adopted by both witnesses for assessing likely business loss is the âdiscounted cash flowâ method (which <i>Freckelton &amp; Selby</i> states was considered by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission to be an appropriate method to be considered by an expert:para. 16C.160).  This has been defined in Brian Liâs report as:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ the value [was determined] by firstly discounting [the proposed AGCâs] future expected cash flows back to the date of commencingthe operation â¦ had [the plaintiff] been issued with an AGC licence.  The future expected cash flows were determined from the netoperating profit plus non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortilization expenses and less non-cash income, capital expenditureand change in working capital in the forecast periodâ (para. 23);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe discount rate takes into account two different types of risks â¦ systematic risks and non-systematic risks â¦ â (para.24).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">The two types of risks were further defined in his report and will not be repeated here.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  As stated above, the plaintiffâs witness opines that the likely loss is in the region of $190 million whereas defence witnessopines no loss at all.  At the risk of over-simplification, the main reason for the vast difference is in short they differ immenselyin the likely amount of income of the proposed AGC.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  The number of selling units in the proposed AGC was stated in the application form to be 292.  YS Wong used 348 units as the basisof calculation, explaining that there were rooms for expansion in the proposed AGC.  His calculations were based on a 100% occupancyrate; in other words, all the selling units were regarded as being rented full time (16 hours per day) for 8 years.  On the otherhand, Brian Liâs basis of calculation was based on a 46.9% occupancy rate (and based on a daily operation of 15 hours).  Thereare also differences between them regarding the average charge per game ($5 for YS Wong and $1.5 for Brian Li) and average roundsof game per hour (8 for YS Wong and 6.2 for Brian Li).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  For the reasons set out below, I prefer the evidence of Brian Li to that of YS Wong.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  YS Wongâs basis of 100% occupancy rate (and his other bases) is unjustified except by his assertions that it accorded with theplaintiffâs instructions and was supported by authoritative textbooks.  Brian Liâs basis has the support of surveys, includingthose conducted in AGCs near the proposed AGC.  In so concluding, I have taken into account the differences between those AGCs andthe proposed AGC, with regard to locations, types of games available and scales of operation.  I have also taken into account theplaintiffâs attack on the survey method (which I find to have no substance).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  YS Wong is prompt to making sweeping statements, some probably without basis.  One such statement is his opinion that the wholelegal profession is so lacking in business valuation knowledge that he has considered donating some textbooks on the subject to theHigh Court library.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  He also appears not to possess the objectivity required of an expert witness.  Apart from the matters set out in para. 81 above,when cross-examined, he admitted he was disciplined by his professional body, the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors, in November 2005. According to that bodyâs publication (supplied by YS Wong (exhibit âD2â)), he was reprimanded for plagiarism of an articleand was found guilty of conduct unbefitting that of a professional surveyor.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  For present purposes, the importance of the disciplinary conviction lies in how he looked at it (as shown by his cross-examination). First, he testified that he wanted to meet the president of the professional body in connection with the then pending disciplinaryproceedings.  But that request was declined by the president (correctly so in my view).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Secondly, he refuted the disciplinary conviction, attributing the cause to mere attacks by business competitors and claimed that(a) any mistake was his staffâs, and (b) it was not a matter suitable to be dealt with by the disciplinary board.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Finally, YS Wongâs formal training and major area of professional work has been in surveying and not financial analysis.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Causation</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  I also agree with the defence that it can be inferred the plaintiff has abandoned the proposed AGC.  There is no causal link betweenthe business loss which the plaintiff may suffer and the defendantâs refusal of the application.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  As stated above, the tenancy agreement was entered into in September 1999.  In an action commenced by the landlord in March 2000(HCA 2185/2000), the plaintiff herein raised the defence to the effect the landlord promised to waive its claims for rent and othercharges until the application for AGC licence had been approved.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Hence, according to the plaintiff, payments under the tenancy agreement were made as a result of the landlordâs promises.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  I infer the plaintiff has abandoned the proposed AGC from the complete lack of response to the defendantâs correspondence since24 April 2001.  The allegation of the plaintiffâs witness to the effect that the plaintiff did not know the letter dated 24 April2001 was an approval-in-principle is unbelievable.  It does not stand with the testimony of defence witness that such kind of letterwas well known to people in the AGC business.  The matter was further put beyond doubt by the defendantâs letter dated 8 January2001.  It was addressed to the plaintiffâs solicitors, who earlier asked (among other things) for information about the procedurefor granting licences.  The defendantâs letter stated:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ if [the defendant] forms the preliminary view that the application meets the requirements laid down in section 5(4) â¦ , hewill issue a <b>letter of further consideration</b> to [the plaintiff].  The letter of further consideration is an indication of <b><i>approval in</i></b> <b><i>principle</i></b> to [the plaintiff].  [The plaintiff] will then be allowed a specified period within which to fit out [the proposed AGC] and to reportcompliance â¦ The application will continue to be processed pending the compliance of the requirements set out in the letter offurther considerationâ (emphasis supplied).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><i>Credibility of Witnesses</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  As stated above, there is little factual dispute.  The main area of dispute being whether the plaintiff has abandoned the proposedAGC.  I disbelieve the plaintiffâs witness regarding this matter and infer that the plaintiff has done so (see para. 90 above).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  I accept the testimony of defence witness to the effect that, after the pronouncement of the judgment of Stock J, the applicationfor AGC licence has been reconsidered by the defendant in accordance with the courtâs findings.  This testimony is supported bythe internal minutes of Ms. Maggie Lam dated 5 February 2001 (especially para. 5(b) and 15 thereof).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Other Matters</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  For the avoidance of doubt, I have considered all the points raised by the parties in their closing submissions even though someof them have not been expressly stated above.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  It should be recorded that the plaintiff indicated verbally the following matters raised in the plaintiffâs written closing submissionsneed not be considered:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)     the defendant has failed to make decision in her letter dated 24 April 2001 (para. 24 thereof);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)    the letters of 8 January 2001 and 24 April 2001 were inconsistent (para. 27 and 28 thereof);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)     para. 29 to 32 thereof;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d)    the defendantâs alleged improper sub-delegation of powers to the Director of Fire Services and the Director of Food and EnvironmentalHygiene (para. 40 to 44 thereof);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(e)     legitimate expectation on the plaintiffâs part (para. 46 to 47 thereof);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(f)     the defendant allegedly misled the appeal board and the court and provided inaccurate survey map to them (para. 58 thereof).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">In any event, they would have been unmeritorious matters even if relied upon in this action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  Some of the points raised in the plaintiffâs written closing submissions are so devoid of merit that I just set them out to disposeof them:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)     the defendantâs letter dated 24 April 2001 is void <i>ab initio</i> (para. 38 to 39 thereof);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)     the plaintiff could not comply with one of the requirements set out in the said letter because, by the time of that letter,the name of the Urban Services Department has been changed to the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (para. 20 thereof);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)     the defendant was under a duty to explain to the plaintiff why she withdrew the ground for refusing the application pursuantto s. 5(4)(b)(ii) (para. 45 thereof);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)     the defendantâs refusal of the application also amounted to an unlawful restriction of land use (para. 54 to 56 thereof).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  On the other hand, the defendant also indicates that she no longer pursues the defence that Wongâs application for AGC licencewas not made for the plaintiff, nor does she rely on the defence of <i>res judicata</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  The plaintiffâs claim is dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Costs Order</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  There is no apparent reason to depart from the usual rule that costs should follow the event.
