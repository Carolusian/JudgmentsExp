class="heading"><i>I. BACKGROUND</i></p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  The Defendant was the contractor responsible for carrying out improvement works to the Sha Tin Country Trail (â<u>Site</u>â), and employed the Plaintiff as a construction site labourer.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  On 26 February 2007, whilst the Plaintiff was operating a rubber track carrier to transport cement up an inclined path at the Site,the carrierâs engine failed.  The carrier slipped backwards and overturned, thus causing the Plaintiff to suffer personal injuries(â<u>Accident</u>â).</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  On 24 November 2007, the legally aided Plaintiff through his assigned solicitors Messrs TS Tong &amp; Co (â<u>TST</u>â) commenced the present action against the Defendant to claim damages for personal injuries as a result of the Accident.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The present action has been settled by the Defendantâs payment of the sum of HK$220,000.00 on top of the employeesâ compensationsettlement sum of HK$359,501.33 already received by the Plaintiff (â<u>EC Sum</u>â).  Such settlement sum of HK$220,000.00 has been paid into court by way of three sanctioned payments in the respective sums ofHK$161,000.00, HK$39,000.00 and HK$20,000.00 on 26 August, 19 October and 19 November 2010 (â<u>1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> SP</u>â).</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The outstanding dispute before me concerns certain costs that have been reserved in the course of the litigation, ie costs on theissue of liability in the present action (â<u>1<sup>st</sup> Reserved Costs</u>â), costs of the Checklist Review (â<u>CLR</u>â) hearing on 13 January 2011 (â<u>2<sup>nd</sup> Reserved Costs</u>â), and costs of the Defendantâs summons filed on 3 May 2011 (â<u>Settlement</u> Summonsâ) including costs of the hearing of such summons on 18 May 2011 (â<u>3<sup>rd</sup> Costs</u>â).</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  At the hearing before me on 26 July 2011 (â<u>1<sup>st</sup> Hearing</u>â), the parties made some concessions in respect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Reserved Costs and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Costs which helped to narrow the scope of the dispute.  But since the present action and its settlement have a chequered history,it is necessary to recount the chronology of the salient events for proper understanding of the dispute.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>II. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS</i></p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In the Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff averred <i>inter alia</i> that the Accident was due to the Defendantâs default, and as a result his âleft lower limb was hit and pressed by the [carrier]âand he sustained injuries to his left lower limb, back and neck (â<u>Alleged Injuries</u>â).  In the Statement of Damages, the Plaintiff claimed damages in the total sum of HK$1,310,783.67 with interest.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In the Defence, the Defendant admitted negligence on their part in respect of the Accident.  In paragraph 5 of the Defence, theDefendant admitted the occurrence of the Accident save as except that (a) the causation of the Alleged Injuries was not admitted(â<u>Causation Dispute</u>â), and (b) the Plaintiff was put to strict proof that his left lower limb was hit and pressed by the carrier and that he sustainedpersonal injuries to his left lower limb, back and neck.  The Defendant further averred that upon taking into account the EC Sumalready paid to the Plaintiff and the expert medical opinion already available at the commencement of the present action the Plaintiffwould not be entitled to any recoverable common law damages in respect of the Accident.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On 24 March 2010, the Director of Legal Aid (â<u>DLA</u>â) re-assigned Messrs Joseph Leung &amp; Associates (â<u>JLA</u>â) to act for the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  At the CLR hearing on 28 April 2010 (â<u>28/4/10 CLR</u>â), notwithstanding the Defendantâs admission of negligence, case management directions were granted <i>inter alia</i> in relation to the issue of liability, such as directions for (a) serving âwitness statement as to factâ (as opposed to witnessstatements as to quantum), (b) limiting expert evidence on liability to the occupational safety officerâs accident report, and(c) adducing the statements made to (and the plan and/or photographs taken by) the Labour Department in relation to the Accident(â<u>28/4/10 Order</u>â).</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The letter from JLA to WKT referred to in paragraph 13 below suggested that at the 28/4/10 CLR the PI Master had explored with JLAand WKT the option of entering judgment on liability, but WKT âadopted âno liability / no pay / defendâ stance â¦â¦ despitethe learned Masterâs repeated advice and warningâ.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  On 4 May 2010, WKT sent a letter to JLA on a âwithout prejudice save as to costsâ basis to remind them that the Defendant hadadmitted negligence in respect of the Accident and that the Defendant merely required proof of the Alleged Injuries.  They askedJLA to treat paragraph 5 of the Defence as amended to the effect that the Defendant admitted the circumstances of the Accident asaverred by the Plaintiff âsave and except the extent of the [Alleged Injuries] is denied and the Plaintiff is put to strict proofthereof.  The Defendants shall rely on Dr Lam Kwong Chinâs evidence to rebut the Plaintiffâs claim as well as his medical expertâsevidenceâ.  On such basis, WKT suggested that the only outstanding issue would be the assessment of damages, and there was no needfor the parties to revisit the issue of liability in terms of the cause of the Accident and/or to prepare their respective case onthe issue of liability.  They told JLA not to include any evidence on the issue of liability in the Plaintiffâs witness statementsince the Defendant would not bear any wasted costs in this regard.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  On 5 May 2010, JLA by open letter to WKT reminded them to make proper application to amend the Defence, and stated that they wouldnot regard WKTâs letter as any amendment of the pleadings. They also informed WKT that following the 28/4/10 CLR (which specified19 May 2010 as the deadline for serving the Plaintiffâs witness statement) they had already taken the Plaintiffâs instructionson the issue of liability and had prepared his draft witness statement, so they rejected WKTâs refusal to bear such costs.  JLAnoted the court still had no record that liability would not be in issue, and asked WKT whether interlocutory judgment could be enteredagainst the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On 6 May 2010, WKT by open letter to JLA stated that although the Defendant had admitted negligence the Plaintiff in fact sufferedno loss or damages over and above the EC Sum and the advance payments he had already received, and therefore he was not entitledto any judgment on liability.  WKT went on to say that â[if] you so wish, you may go ahead with your so-called summons for âjudgmentâ. We will oppose the same vigorously and claim costs against you on a full indemnity basis, if necessary.  Your client and you proceedat your perilsâ.  On the question of costs on the issue of liability, WKT said â[we] will <u>never</u> concede that you are <u>entitled</u> to costs of the action on liability and on the accident since our Defence.  Quite to the contrary, it is very clear that you haveonly tried to inflate the costs contrary to the Civil Justice Reformâ.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On the same day, WKT also sent on a âwithout prejudice save as to costsâ letter to JLA and stated that in order to save timeand costs they would be prepared to advise the Defendant to enter into a Consent Order on <i>inter alia</i> the following terms and asked JLA to take instructions:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)  judgment on liability be entered against the Defendant in favour of the Plaintiff with damages, if any, to be assessed;</p>        <p>(b)  costs of this action on the issue of liability up to and inclusive of this application, if not agreed, be reserved for furtherargument before the court after the assessment of damages or at the conclusion of the present action.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  On 14 May 2010, JLA wrote to the PI Master to seek clarification as to whether the parties were required to prepare witness evidenceas to liability.  The PI Master replied he would not give comments without hearing from the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  On 20 May 2010, pursuant to the 28/4/10 Order, the Plaintiff served his witness statement dated 18 May 2010, which canvassed <i>inter alia</i> some aspects of the issue of liability, including the circumstances of the Accident.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  On the same day, WKT wrote to the PI Master referring to the above correspondence between the solicitors for the parties and maintainingtheir complaint against the inclusion of matters that touched on the issue of liability in the Plaintiffâs witness statement. They also asserted that notwithstanding the Defendantâs admission of negligence in respect of the Accident, interlocutory judgmenton liability should not be entered because the Plaintiff did not suffer any recoverable loss or damages.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Apparently, on the same day, JLA sent a reply to WKT on a âwithout prejudiceâ basis, but such letter was not placed before me.Nevertheless, WKTâs letter dated 2 July 2010 (see paragraph 23 below) alluded to JLAâs reply which stated <i>inter alia</i> that the Plaintiff was entitled to costs on the issue of liability.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On 1 June 2010, the PI Master (who was not the master who granted the 28/4/10 Order) by written directions to the solicitors forthe parties urged the Defendant to clarify their position to enable early resolution of the issue of liability, and provisionallyopined that the following matters implicitly suggested that liability had not been admitted: (a) the terms of the 28/4/10 Order and(b) the need for the Plaintiff to prove his case on the issue of liability at trial in the absence of any interlocutory judgmenton liability.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  On 23 June 2010, WKT again wrote to the PI Master to maintain their complaint against the Plaintiffâs witness statement whichtouched upon matters concerning the issue of liability.  They stated that âthe Defendant has admitted negligence and hence responsibilityfor the accident is not equal to the statement that the Defendant has admitted liability for the cause of action now claimed by thePlaintiff.  The Plaintiff still has to prove as a complete cause of action that they have suffered losses and damages as a resultof or caused by such negligence claimable in the present proceedingsâ.  They claimed that the Defendant had no liability in thepresent action upon deduction of the EC Sum from any common law damages that might be claimed in the present action, so</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[for] obvious reason, âinterlocutory judgment on liabilityâ should not be entered against the Defendant in this case, as enteringof interlocutory judgment with damages to be assessed presupposes that there will be net damages claimable in the present proceedings(or else there is no damages to be assessed as such), which is not the pleaded case of the Defendant â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">We do not think that the Court has any jurisdiction to enter judgment on liability against the Defence [<i>sic</i>], on the basis as aforesaid and it will be unhelpful and misleading if the Courtâs impression of the matter is not clarified norremoved.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  On 25 June 2010, the PI Master directed the parties to agree on a âlist of issues to be triedâ.  Pursuant thereto, JLA forwardeda draft list to WKT. On 23 July 2010, WKT gave their comments on the draft list.  On 26 July 2010, JLA made further observationson the draft list.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  On 2 July 2010, WKT sent a âwithout prejudice save as to costsâ letter to JLA inviting the Plaintiff to reconsider the proposalin their âwithout prejudice as to costsâ letter dated 6 May 2010.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  On the same day, the Plaintiff filed his Revised Statement of Damages to claim damages in the sum of HK$1,334,998.67 with interest. On 30 July 2010, the Defendant filed their Answer thereto.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  On 26 August 2010, the Defendant filed a Notice of Sanctioned Payment (â<u>1<sup>st</sup> SP Notice</u>â) giving notice that he had made sanctioned payment in the sum of HK$161,000.00 into court on top of the EC Sum in settlement ofthe whole of the Plaintiffâs claim (â<u>1<sup>st</sup> SP</u>â).  The 1<sup>st</sup> SP Notice stated that â[it] is part of the terms of a sanctioned offer set out in <u>the sanctioned offer dated 26<sup>th</sup> August 2010</u>.  If you give notice of acceptance of this sanctioned payment, you will be treated as also accepting the sanctioned offerâ.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  On 19 October 2010, the Defendant filed a further Notice of Sanctioned Payment (â<u>2<sup>nd</sup> SP Notice</u>â) giving notice that he had made sanctioned payment of HK$39,000.00 into court on top of the EC Sum and additional to the 1<sup>st</sup> SP in settlement of the whole of the Plaintiffâs claim (â<u>2<sup>nd</sup> SP</u>â).  The 2<sup>nd</sup> SP Notice stated that â[it] is part of the terms of a sanctioned offer set out in <u>the sanctioned offer dated 19<sup>th</sup> October 2010</u>.  If you give notice of acceptance of this sanctioned payment, you will be treated as also accepting the sanctioned offerâ.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  On 19 October 2010, WKT sent a âwithout prejudice save as to costsâ letter to JLA stating they were instructed to make a sanctionedoffer pursuant to Order 22 rule 5 of the Rules of the High Court (â<u>RHC</u>â) as part and parcel of the 2<sup>nd</sup> SP (which took into account the EC Sum) in respect of the whole claim (â<u>2<sup>nd</sup> Offer</u>â).  By the 2<sup>nd</sup> Offer, â[the Defendant] offers to pay costs on a party and party basis on District Court scale to be taxed if not agreed if [the2<sup>nd</sup> SP] is accepted by the Plaintiff as a full and final settlement of the whole of this claim and it is a condition of the settlement,if the [2<sup>nd</sup> Offer] is accepted, to execute a consent summons/order incorporating the terms of settlementâ.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Offer further stated it was open for acceptance within 28 days thereof, and after the expiry of such period the Plaintiff could onlyaccept the 2<sup>nd</sup> Offer if (a) the parties agreed on the liability for costs or (b) the Court granted leave to accept it.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  At the CLR hearing before me on 20 October 2010 (â<u>20/10/10 CLR</u>â), I took note of (a) the Defendantâs admission that the Accident was caused by their default and (b) their claim that the remainingdisputes were the extent and quantum of damages and the Causation Dispute, which disputes in my view (i) should not be a bar againstentering interlocutory judgment on liability for damages to be assessed, (ii) should be resolved at the assessment of damages andnot at any full trial on the issues of both liability and quantum, and (iii) should not inhibit any argument the Defendant mightraise at the assessment of damages that upon proper assessment there were no recoverable loss or damages beyond the EC Sum.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  So at the 20/10/10 CLR, I granted leave for the Defendant to amend the Defence to admit liability but deny the extent of the damage,which would enable the Defendant to eventually raise the Causation Dispute in their Answer to the Statement of Damages.  The previouscase management direction by the PI Master requiring the parties to prepare an agreed list of issues to be tried therefore becameredundant, and I also gave the parties a further 7 days to try and resolve the issue of liability, failing which the Defendant wasdirected to apply within 14 days for interlocutory judgment to be entered with costs on the issue of liability reserved.  The reasonwhy costs on the issue of liability should be reserved was because the Defendant on their Amended Defence insisted that the Plaintiffwas not entitled to any common law damages over and above the EC Sum, which argument suggested that the Plaintiff should not havecommenced the present action at all (and hence costs on the issue of liability could have been avoided) notwithstanding any interlocutoryjudgment that might be entered for damages to be assessed.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  On 21 October 2010, WKT by a âwithout prejudice save as to costsâ letter to JLA proposed for both parties enter into a consentorder for judgment on liability with damages to be assessed and for reservation of costs on the issue of liability up to and inclusiveof such application (if not agreed) for determination by the court at the assessment of damages or upon argument before the courtat the conclusion of the present action.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  On 22 October 2010, the Defendant filed the Amended Defence.  On 2 November 2010, the Plaintiffâs legal aid certificate was dischargedand he became unrepresented. Pursuant to the Defendantâs summons filed on 3 November 2010 and returnable on 16 November 2010, Igranted interlocutory judgment on liability in favour of the Plaintiff for damages (if any) to be assessed, and directed that costsof the present action on the issue of liability (if not agreed) be reserved for determination at the hearing of the assessment ofdamages or upon argument before the court at the conclusion of the present action (ie the 1<sup>st</sup> Reserved Costs) (â<u>16/11/10 Order</u>â).</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  On 19 November 2010, the Defendant filed a further Notice of Sanctioned Payment (â<u>3<sup>rd</sup> SP Notice</u>â) giving notice that they had made a sanctioned payment of HK$20,000.00 into court on top of the EC Sum and additional to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> SP (thus bringing the overall sanctioned payments to a total sum of HK$220,000.00) in settlement of the whole of the Plaintiffâsclaim (â<u>3<sup>rd</sup> SP</u>â).  The 3<sup>rd</sup> SP Notice stated that â[it] is part of the terms of a sanctioned offer set out in <u>the sanctioned offer dated 19<sup>th</sup> November 2010</u>.  If you give notice of acceptance of this sanctioned payment, you will be treated as also accepting the sanctioned offerâ.

They said that (a) to WKTâs knowledge the Plaintiffwas unaware of the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP and (b) previous negotiations were made on the erroneous premise of there being no more sanctioned payments made after 19 October2010.  They further claimed that the Plaintiffâs offer to accept the 2<sup>nd</sup> SP could not stand, and as a result of the legal aid stay pursuant to the LA Memo the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP Notice was still open for acceptance without leave of the court.  JLA stated they would âfile Notice of Acceptance of SanctionedPayment today (copy enclosed).

Again on the same day, WKT by open letter to JLA maintained that (a) the Plaintiff was well aware of the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP Notice (and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer being part and parcel of the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP) and (b) a settlement was concluded on 11 January 2011 as <i>per</i> WKTâs two open letters of such date, so the Plaintiff was not entitled to file the Acceptance Notice.  WKT added that such purportedacceptance of the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP would not have benefited the Plaintiff since (i) the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP Notice referred to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer which was part and parcel of the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP and (ii) by accepting the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP the Plaintiff agreed to bear the Defendantâs costs on the issue of liability on High Court scale from 6 May to 16 November 2010.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  At the adjourned CLR hearing on 13 January 2011, JLA and WKT informed me that the parties had compromised the present action butthere was still disagreement over the precise scope/terms of the settlement.

In respect of (c), WKT asked JLA to state the legal basis for making such claimfor costs.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Initially, WKT and JLA proposed that the Settlement Summons be adjourned for substantive argument, but at the hearing before meon 18 May 2011 I drew their attention to the difference of only HK$20,000.00 in respect of the settlement sum under the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> SP Alternatives, and queried whether it would be proportionate to incur the effort, time and costs to resolve such dispute.  In theend, the parties sensibly agreed to settle the present action for the sum of HK$220,000.00 without formal determination of the substantivemerits of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> SP Alternatives, and further agreed to seek court determination of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Reserved Costs.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  I therefore granted the following orders at the hearing on 18 May 2011 (â<u>18/5/11 Order</u>â):</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)  leave be granted to the Plaintiff to accept the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> SP in the total sum of HK$220,000.00 on top of the EC Sum in full and final settlement of the present action;</p>        <p>(b)  save and except for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Reserved Costs, costs of the present action be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff on District Court scale to be taxed if notagreed;</p>        <p>(c)  the issue of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Reserved Costs be adjourned for argument and in the meantime the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> SP shall remain in court;</p>        <p>(d)  costs of the hearing on 18 May 2011 be reserved.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In the circumstances, apart from the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Reserved Costs, costs of the Settlement Summons including costs of the hearing on 18 May 2011 (ie the 3<sup>rd</sup> Costs) are also pending court determination.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>III.

The 2<sup>nd</sup> SP Alternative (see paragraph 45(a) above) is no longer applicable in light of the 18/5/11 Order.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  At the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing, Mr Chan, solicitor for the Plaintiff, and Ms Hui, solicitor for the Defendant, also agreed on the following matters:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)  for the 1<sup>st</sup> Reserved Costs, the Defendant shall pay the Plaintiffâs costs on the issue of liability for the period up to 5 May 2010;</p>        <p>(b)  each party shall bear their own costs in respect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Reserved Costs;</p>        <p>(c)   for the 3<sup>rd</sup> Costs, each party shall bear their own costs in respect of (i) the Settlement Summons (including the affirmations referred to inparagraphs 46-47 above) in respect of the matters specified in paragraphs 50(a), (b) and (d) above under the 18/5/11 Order and (ii)the hearing of the Settlement Summons on 18 May 2011;</p>        <p>(d)  there be legal aid taxation in respect of the Plaintiffâs own costs in respect of the costs in (a) to (c) above.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>For the avoidance of doubt, I hereby grant formal order in respect of (a)-(d) above.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Thus, the remaining disputed costs that require my determination are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)  for the 1<sup>st</sup> Reserved Costs, costs of the action on the issue of liability for the period from 6 May to 16 November 2010 (â<u>1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs</u>â);</p>        <p>(b)  for the 3<sup>rd</sup> Costs, costs of the Settlement Summons (including the affirmations referred to in paragraph 46 or paragraph 47 above, whichever isappropriate) in respect of the matters specified in paragraph 50(c) above under the 18/5/11 Order and (ii) the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing on 26 July 2011 and the part-heard hearing on 4 August 2011 (â<u>2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing</u>â) in respect of the Settlement Summons (collectively, â<u>3<sup>rd</sup> Disputed Costs</u>â).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Initially at the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing, Ms Hui and Mr Chan also had no dispute over the following matters:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)  the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer is a sanctioned offer within the meaning of Order 22 of the RHC;</p>        <p>(b)  without prejudice to the partiesâ dispute over whether the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer has been served on the Plaintiff by ordinary post on 19 November 2010 and/or whether the Plaintiff has received such document,the form and content of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer meet the requirements in Order 22 rule 5 of the RHC.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>After the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing, I have referred Ms Hui and Mr Chan to the authorities referred to in paragraphs 65, 66 and 68 below and called for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing for further addresses to be made.  At the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing, Mr Chan withdrew his concessions in respect of (a) and (b) above. In any event, where a concession on law was wrongly madeby a party, in the absence of prejudice (and there is none in this case as the concessions were made in respect of legal and notfactual matters), it is open to the court to hold that the concessions were wrongly made and to allow the party to argue his caseon proper legal basis (see <i>Deng Minghui v Chau Shuk Ling</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%201%20HKLRD%20905" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 1 HKLRD 905</a>, 910-912).</p>    <p class="heading"><i>IV.

This is reflected in thewide ambit of Order 22 rule 3(1) of the RHC (see paragraph 58 above) as well as the last check-box in the prescribed Form 23 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¡ It is part of the terms of a sanctioned offer set out (identify the document).

I therefore invited Ms Hui and Mr Chan for furtheraddresses at the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Under Order 22 rules 2(4) and 3(1) of the RHC (see paragraph 58 above) (which provisions are analogous to Parts 36.1(2), 36.2(1)and 36.3(1) of the English Civil Procedure Rules (â<u>CPR</u>â) prior to the amendments that came into effect on 6 April 2007 (â<u>Old C</u><u>PR</u>â) â see paragraph 62 below), unless the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer is a sanctioned offer made in accordance with the order, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer will not have the consequences specified in the order unless the court so orders.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Parts 36.1(2), 36.2(1), 36.3(1), 36.13(1) and 36.14 of the Old CPR provide as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â36.1(2) Nothing in this Part prevents a party making an offer to settle in whatever way he choose, but if that offer is not madein accordance with this Part, it will only have consequences specified in this Part if the court so orders.</p>        <p class="quote">(Rule 44.3 requires the court to consider an offer to settle that does not have the costs consequences set out in this Section indeciding what order to make about costs)</p>        <p class="quote">36.2(1) An offer made in accordance with the requirements of this Part is called â (a) if made by way of a payment into court, âaPart 36 paymentâ; (b) otherwise âa Part 36 offerâ.</p>        <p class="quote">36.3(1) Subject to rules 36.2A(2), 36.25(5) and 36.23, an offer by a defendant to settle a money claim will not have the consequencesset out in this Part unless it is made by way of a Part 36 payment.</p>        <p class="quote">36.13(1) Where a [defendantâs] Part 36 offer or a Part 36 payment is accepted without needing the permission of the court the claimantwill be entitled to his costs of the proceedings up to the date of serving the notice of acceptance.</p>        <p class="quote">36.14 Where a claimantâs Part 36 offer is accepted without needing the permission of the court the claimant will be entitled tohis costs of the proceedings up to the date upon which the defendant serves notice of acceptance.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Parts 36.1(2) and 36.10(1) of the current version of the CPR (â<u>New CPR</u>â) provide as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â36.1(2) Nothing in this section prevents a party from making an offer to settle in whatever way he chooses, but if the offer isnot made in accordance with rule 36.2, it will not have the consequences specified in rules 36.10, 36.11 and 36.14.</p>        <p class="quote">36.10(1) Subject to paragraph (2) and paragraph (4)(a), where a Part 36 offer is accepted within the relevant period the claimantwill be entitled to the costs of the proceedings up to the date on which notice of acceptance was served on the offeror.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  There is no doubt that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer contains terms as to costs (see items 2-3 of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer in paragraph 33 above).  It is also plain that the validity of such offer must be decided, in principle, at the date such offerwas made (see <i>Eiles v London Borough of Southwark</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/TCC/2006/2014.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] EWHC 2014 (TCC)</a> (28 July 2006) para.26).  </p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  In <i>Mitchell &amp; ors v James &amp;</i> ors  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%202%20All%20ER%201064" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 2 All ER 1064</a>, a case concerning an alleged Part 36 offer under the Old CPR, Peter Gibson LJ (with whom Potter LJ and Sir Murray Stuart-Smith agreed)held that the draftsman of Part 36 did not intend terms as to costs to be included in a Part 36 offer.  He gave four reasons forthat conclusion at pp.1071-1072:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<a name="para30" id="para30">[</a>30] <i>First, r</i> <i>36.14</i> <i>is worded as applicable whenever a claimant's Pt 36 offer is accepted without needing the permission of the court.</i> <i>It does not say</i> <i>âunless a claimantâs Part 36 offer indicates to the contraryâ</i> <i>(r 36.22(1)) or other wording to indicate that the parties can agree otherwise.</i> Similarly, para 7.2 of the practice direction indicates that on acceptance of the Pt 36 offer â[t]he costs consequences set outin [rule] ... 36.14 will then come into effect.â So too in a case where the courtâs permission is needed for the defendants toaccept a Pt 36 offer, if permission is given, para 7.5 envisages that the court may order that the costs consequences set out inr 36.14 will apply. These provisions are inconsistent with a term as to costs being part of the Pt 36 offer. <a name="para31" id="para31"></a></p>        <p class="quote">[31]Second, r36.21 [being the equivalent of Order 22 rule 24 of the RHC] is applicable where at trial either a defendant is âheldliableâ for more, or âthe judgmentâ against a defendant is more advantageous to the claimant, than the offer. The words âheldliableâ and âthe judgmentâ both appear to me to connote what the trial judge holds or decides on the substantive issues inthe case as distinct from the ancillary issue of costs to be determined after the substantive issues are decided. Mr. Brunner acceptedthat that was so in relation to âheld liableâ, though not in relation to âjudgmentâ. For my part, I cannot see why thereshould be such a difference. <a name="para32" id="para32"></a></p>        <p class="quote">[32]Third, the rule is intended to apply universally at the end of the trial when the judge is required to make an order for costs.Save in a case where the judge can make a summary assessment or the rare case where the costs at that point are agreed, there willhave been no assessment of the costs, the figure for which would therefore be uncertain. Yet the rule contemplates that merely byreference to that for which the defendant is held liable or by reference to the judgment the judge will be able to decide whetherr36.21 [being the equivalent of Order 22 rule 24 of the RHC] applies because the defendant has been held liable for more, or thejudgment against a defendant is more advantageous, than the offer. I find it hard to believe that the draftsman contemplated thata Pt 36 offer is one which includes a term as to costs, so that the judge might have to evaluate the quantum of his costs order.That is normally the function of a costs judge, not the trial judge. <a name="para33" id="para33"></a></p>        <p class="quote">[33]Fourth, there would be a real risk of abuse if a term as to costs could be included in a Pt 36 order. Every well-advised claimantwould make a Pt 36 offer containing the terms sought in his claim plus an offer as to costs in the hope that if he succeeded in hissubstantive claim he would obtain indemnity costs in place of the ordinary award of costs on the standard basis. Merely to win onhis substantive claim and to obtain an order for costs under the general rule (see CPR 44.3(2)) will cause r36.21 [being the equivalentof Order 22 rule 24 of the RHC] to be applicable, so that the court âwillâ make the orders referred to in r36.21(2) and (3) [beingthe equivalent of Order 22 rule 24(2) and (3) of the RHC] unless it considers it unjust to do so [being the equivalent of Order 22rule 24(4) of the RHC]. Injustice in the eyes of the court is therefore the only basis on which the court could refuse to make anorder for indemnity costs and interest. That does not confer a general discretion on the court.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  The English courts have consistently regarded the conclusion in <i>Mitchell</i> (ie that an offer which includes terms as to costs is not a valid Part 36 offer) to be of general application whether under the Oldor New CPR, (see <i>Eiles</i> at para.28 and <i>Shah v Elliot</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/Misc/2011/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2011] EW Misc 8</a> (27 June 2011) at paras.26-27).</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  For the present purpose and for considering the reasons given by Peter Gibson LJ, Order 22 rule 24 of the RHC is modelled on andis almost on all fours with Part 36.21 of the Old CPR as referred to in <i>Mitchell</i>. Further, in my view, the provisions under the Old and New CPR set out in paragraphs 62-63 above are not materially different fromOrder 22 rules 2(4) and 20(1) of the RHC (see paragraph 58 above) except for the proviso âunless the Court otherwise ordersâ(â<u>Otherwise Proviso</u>â) in Order 22 rule 20(1) of the RHC which is absent in Parts 36.13(1) and 36.14 of the Old CPR and/or Part 36.10(1) of the NewCPR.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Turning to the local scene, the applicant in <i>Sunbeam Investments Limited v The Incorporated Owners of Villa Veneto</i> LDBM 370/2007 and LDBM 175/2009, HH Judge Wong (unreported, 7 September 2010) sought to distinguish the rationale in <i>Mitchell</i> by referring to the Otherwise Proviso in Order 22 rule 20(1) of the RHC which is absent in the Old and New CPR.  However, the learnedPresiding Officer rejected such argument as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â    31. I do not accept the Applicantâs submissions in this regard.  Apart from the addition of the discretion proviso, the sanctionoffer referred to Order 22 and its counterpart in Part 36 of the English rules are basically the same.  There may be some modificationsof the wordings, but the essential features of the sanctioned offer in Hong Kong are not different from its English counterpart. I find that the intention not to include any terms as to costs is equally applicable to Hong Kong, especially when one looks atOrder 22, rule 15(2)(b) and rule 16(2)(b), where the liability for costs can be considered separately from the acceptance of thesanctioned offer.  From these provisions, it is clear that the parties can always accept the sanctioned offer without agreeing onthe liability for costs.  I do not accept that the word âjudgmentâ is construed restrictively, as costs is always to be dealtwith after the substantive issues are determined first.  It is always possible to have judgment on the substantive issues with orwithout any costs order.  If costs were to be considered as part of the sanctioned offer, there could be real situations where aparty offers an actual amount of costs to the other side, and the court would have to assess whether the amount offered is the rightamount, and hence there would be a taxation or assessment exercise on costs.  The court can prevent any abuse is one thing, but whethera sanctioned offer would create situations for abuse is another matter.  I do not think that the intention of the sanctioned offerprovisions was to include terms as to costs so as to create such a risk of abuse.  â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">  32. I therefore find that all the reasons given in <i>Mitchells</i>â case are equally applicable to sanctioned offers in Hong Kong, and a term as to costs should not be considered as part of a sanctionedoffer. â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  At the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing, Ms Hui resurrected the argument raised by the applicant in <i>Sunbeam Investments Limited</i>, and urged me to depart from the conclusion reached by HH Judge Wong and to go on and hold that a sanctioned offer within the meaningof Order 22 of the RHC can include terms as to costs that are inconsistent with the express provision as to costs in Order 22 rule20(1) of the RHC.  In support of such contention, Ms Hui was only able to say that Order 22 rule 20(1) of the RHC contains the OtherwiseProviso absent in Parts 36.13(1) and 36.14 of the Old CPR.  She also sought to distinguish <i>Mitchell</i> and <i>Sunbeam Investments Limited</i> on the basis that those cases dealt with applications made after judgment under Part 36.21 of the Old CPR or Order 22 rule 24 ofthe RHC for indemnity costs and/or for variation of the costs order <i>nisi</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  I am not persuaded by such arguments. First, under Order 22 rule 20(1) of the RHC, if a sanctioned offer is accepted without requiringleave of the court, the plaintiff is statutorily entitled to his costs of the proceedings up to the date of serving the notice ofacceptance âunless the Court otherwise ordersâ.  </p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  In such context, if a sanctioned offer may contain terms as to costs that deprive the plaintiff of all or part of his costs of theproceedings, once the plaintiff accepts the sanctioned offer without requiring leave of the court, the terms of such offer (includingthe terms as to costs therein) will become binding on both parties through the operation of the Order 22 statutory regime that prescribeshow sanctioned offers are to be made/accepted, thereby ousting the costs provision in favour of the plaintiff in Order 22 rule 20(1)of the RHC.  Such departure from the statutory costs provision is not achieved by any order otherwise made by the court as requiredunder Order 22 rule 20(1) of the RHC.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  I bear in mind that Order 22 of the RHC is a self-contained statutory code with a carefully structured and prescriptive set of rulesthat are wholly procedural and not contractual in nature (see <i>Hong Kong</i> <i>Civil Procedure 2011</i> Vol.1 para.22/1/B at p.470).  There is no provision for any third methodology (as distinct from (a) the statutory costs provisionin Order 22 rule 20(1) of the RHC and (b) costs that may otherwise be ordered  by the court under the same sub-rule) for identifyingthe costs consequences upon acceptance of a sanctioned order without requiring leave of the court.  To use the words of Peter GibsonLJ in para.30 of his judgment which sets out his first reason for excluding terms as to costs in a Part 36 offer, Order 22 rule 20(1)of the RHC does not say âunless a defendantâs sanctioned offer indicates to the contraryâ or other wording to indicate theparties can agree otherwise (see paragraph 65 above). In my view, an offeror cannot seek Order 22 protection without at the sametime accepting the burden of the costs consequences unless he can invoke the courtâs discretion under the Otherwise Proviso.  Toput it in another way, an offer which deals with costs consequences upon acceptance (unless such term is precisely the same as thestatutory provision for costs in Order 22 rule 20(1) of the RHC â see paragraph 58 above) means that such offer can only be validlyaccepted by disapplying the costs provision in Order 22 rule 20(1) of the RHC, and yet such statutory costs provision is expressedto apply without limitation to sanctioned offers only if the court otherwise orders (and not when the offeree otherwise accepts orthe parties otherwise agree).  Hence, an offer that contains terms as to costs is inconsistent with the notion of sanctioned offerunder Order 22 of the RHC.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Secondly, three of the four reasons put forward by Peter Gibson LJ in <i>Mitchell</i> for his conclusion that terms as to costs should not be included in a Part 36 offer turn on the provisions in Part 36.21 of the OldCPR.  Since Order 22 rule 24 of the RHC is materially the same as Part 36.21 of the Old CPR, the potential problems arising fromthe inclusion of an offer in relation to costs in a sanctioned offer as highlighted by Peter Gibson LJ are equally applicable tothe scheme under Order 22 rule 24 of the RHC.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Although Ms Hui sought to distinguish <i>Mitchell</i> and <i>Sunbeam Investments Limited</i> on the basis that the present case is concerned with Order 22 rule 20(1) and not rule 24 of the RHC, the fact remains that at thetime when the sanctioned offer is made one never knows whether its impact on costs will be considered upon acceptance of such sanctionedoffer within time without requiring leave of the court or after trial/judgment.  After all, as pointed out in paragraph 64 above,the validity of a sanctioned offer is not determined by hindsight but at the date when such offer was made.  Plainly, a sanctionedoffer under the Order 22 statutory regime must be valid for the purpose of both Order 22 rule 20(1) and rule 24 of the RHC. Consequently,the matters discussed in the above paragraph remain pertinent even though the present case concerns the costs consequences in Order22 rule 20(1) of the RHC.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Thirdly, although the remaining reason put forward by Peter Gibson LJ relies on the mandatory nature of the costs provision in Part36.14 of the Old CPR, which Ms Hui claims to be materially different for the present purpose from Order 22 rule 20(1) of the RHCwith the Otherwise Proviso, there are both English and Australian authorities that suggest the Otherwise Proviso does not confera general discretion but instead requires the discretion to be exercised only under exceptional and compelling circumstances (seeparagraphs 97-105 below).  Underlying this approach is the importance of having some certainty as to the costs consequences to facilitateproper consideration and/or acceptance of reasonable offers for promoting settlement of litigation.  This also lends weight to theapplication of the <i>Mitchell</i> prohibition of inclusion of terms as to costs in any sanctioned offer.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Taking the above matters into consideration and bearing in mind the reasons for HH Judge Wongâs decision set out in paragraph68 above, I conclude that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer is not a valid sanctioned offer because it includes an offer in respect of costs.  As such, it does not have the consequencesspecified in Order 22 of the RHC unless the court otherwise orders.</p>    <p><i>(c) Acceptance Notice</i></p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  There is no dispute that the Acceptance Notice is in the prescribed Form 24 (see Order 22 rule 15(4) of the RHC), and that it hasbeen served on WKT on 12 January 2011 (see paragraph 43 above).  Hence, the Plaintiffâs acceptance of the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP was âwithin the prescribed time, ie no later than 28 days after the offer or payment was madeâ (see Order 22 rule 15(1) ofthe RHC â see paragraph 58 above).

Mr Chan argued that since the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP was for settlement of the whole of the Plaintiffâs claim, the Plaintiff was therefore entitled to his costs of the whole ofthe present action up to 12 January 2011 including the 1<sup>st</sup> Reserved Costs and/or the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Putting aside the Otherwise Proviso for the moment, the first question is whether the statutory costs provision in Order 22 rule20(1) of the RHC (ie â[the plaintiffâs] costs of the proceedings up to the date of serving notice of acceptanceâ â see paragraph58 above) triggered by the Acceptance Notice covers the 1<sup>st</sup> Reserved Costs (inclusive of the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs) such that the Defendant becomes liable to pay such costs to the Plaintiff.  To answer this question, it is necessaryto first turn to the meaning of âcosts reservedâ since the 1<sup>st</sup> Reserved Costs (inclusive of the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs) have been reserved under the 16/11/10 Order (see paragraph 31 above).</p>    <p><i>(d) Costs reserved</i></p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  In <i>Hong Kong</i> <i>Civil Procedure 2011</i> Vol.1 para.62/1/3 at p.1089, it is said as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â â<i>Cost reservedâ</i> means that the costs will be lost and will not be allowed on taxation unless the court makes a specific order dealing with them atthe conclusion of the proceedings (<i>British Natural Premium Provident Association v.

It is said in <i>The Supreme Court Practice 1999</i> Vol.1 para.62/3 at p.1120 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="80%">            <tr>                <td width="76" valign="top" class="quote"><br />                ââCosts reservedâ</td>                <td width="405" valign="top" class="quote"><br />                (Except in proceedings in the Family Division) the party in whose favour an order for costs is made at the conclusionof the cause or matter in which the proceedings arise shall be entitled to his costs of the proceedings in respect of which thisorder is made unless the Court otherwise orders;â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>Further, in <i>Cook on Costs 2011</i> paras.[16.8] and [16.16] at pp.292 and 297, it is said that âcosts reservedâ means â[the] decision about costs is deferredto a later occasion, but if no later order is made the costs will be costs in the caseâ and â[any] interim costs which have beenreserved will automatically be awarded to the winner of the action unless the trial judge orders otherwiseâ. No authorities havebeen cited for the English approach to âcosts reservedâ in the learned legal texts.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  In my view, the different approach to âcosts reservedâ adopted by the local and English courts is probably due to the evolutionof court practice in separate common law jurisdictions.  For the present purpose, there is no reason not to follow the conventionalapproach consistently adopted in Hong Kong, and I shall do so.  Such approach not only enjoys the support of legal authorities, itis also in line with Order 62 rule 2(1) of the RHC which provides that â[subject] to the provisions of this Order, no party shallbe entitled to recover any costs of or incidental to any proceedings from any other party to the proceedings except under an orderof the Courtâ.  This provision is of particular relevance to the 1<sup>st</sup> Reserved Costs and/or the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs because the 16/11/10 Order specifically reserved such costs for determination either at the hearing of assessmentof damages or for argument before the court at the conclusion of the present action (see paragraph 31 above) and there is as yetâno order of the Courtâ as required under Order 62 rule 2(1) of the RHC that allows either the Plaintiff or the Defendant torecover such costs.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  In the circumstances, even though the Plaintiff is <i>prima facie</i> entitled to his costs of the proceedings up to 12 January 2011 (ie up to the date of service of the Acceptance Notice), Order 22rule 20(1) of the RHC of itself does not confer on him any entitlement to recover against the Defendant the 1<sup>st</sup> Reserved Costs and/or the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs âunless the Court otherwise ordersâ.  Likewise, unless there is a court order in favour of the Defendant in respectof the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs pursuant to the Otherwise Proviso, the Plaintiff is not obliged to pay them the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs.  It seems that both parties have to pray in aid the Otherwise Proviso to seek their respective costs on the issueof liability from 6 May to 16 November 2010.</p>    <p><i>(e) Otherwise Proviso</i></p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  How is the discretion to be exercised under the Otherwise Proviso in Order 22 rule 20(1) of the RHC (see paragraph 58 above)?  Inher recent decision in <i>Chan Cheuk Kwan v Ho Kam Wo &amp; anor</i> DCPI 2103/2010 (unreported, 20 July 2011) where the defendant sought costs from the date of a <i>pre-</i>action offer until the date of acceptance of the sanctioned payment (in the same amount as offered in the <i>pre-</i>action offer) without requiring leave of the court, Master J Chow was called upon to consider âin what circumstances should theCourt order costs otherwiseâ (at para.18).</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  In her decision, Master J Chow referred to Part 36.10(1) which was said to be extracted from the Old CPR as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSubject to paragraph (2) and paragraph 4(a), where a Part 36 offer is accepted within the relevant period the claimant will beentitled to the costs of the proceedings up to the date on which notice of acceptance was served on the offeror.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and then to Part 36.10(1) which was said to be extracted from the New CPR as âupdated in 2011â as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf a person makes an offer to settle before proceedings are begun which complies with the provisions of this rule, <i>the court will take that offer into account when making any order as to costs.</i>â <i>[emphasis added]</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p>The learned Master then said â[the] court shall embark on the same test [see the emphasis add in the above extract] to decide oncosts consequence in the present caseâ and â[the] new Rule 36.10 shed light to situations where the Court should considerâ(at paras.16 and 19).</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  However, a review of <i>Civil Procedure 2006</i> and <i>Civil Procedure 2011</i> shows that in fact the first extract of Part 36.10(1) in the above paragraph said to be from the Old CPR was in fact drawn from theNew CPR (see paragraph 63 above) and the second extract of Part 36.10(1) in the above paragraph was in fact drawn from the Old CPR(and the wording has been the same since the CPR was originally made in 1998). Further, the 55<sup>th</sup> Update to the CPR that came into force on 6 April 2011 did not bring any changes to Part 36.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Still further, the Old CPR case of <i>Walker Residential Limited v Davis &amp; anor</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2005/3483.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] EWHC 3483 (Ch)</a> (9 December 2005) cited in <i>Chan Cheuk Kwan</i> referred to the second extract of Part 36.10(1) of the Old CPR in paragraph 88 above, and held that under Part 36.13(1) and not Part36.10(1) of the Old CPR (which does not contain the Otherwise Proviso â see paragraph 62 above), the English courts had no jurisdictionto deprive the claimant of the mandatory costs in his favour upon acceptance of a Part 36 offer.  The same conclusion was reachedby the English Court of Appeal in <i>Lahey v Pirelli Trust Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%201%20WLR%20998" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 1 WLR 998</a>, which was also decided under the Old CPR.  Under Part 36.10(1) of the New CPR (which again does not contain the Otherwise Provisoâ see paragraph 63 above), the English courts continued to hold they had no power to disallow any part of the mandatory costs (see<i>London Tara Hotel Ltd v Kensington Close Hotel Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2011/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2011] EWHC 29(Ch)</a> (14 January 2011) and <i>Civil Procedure 2011</i> Vol.1 para.36.10.1 at p.1100).  In the circumstances, I am not persuaded that either Part 36.13(1) of the Old CPR or Part 36.10(1)of the New CPR is helpful in interpreting the power of the Hong Kong courts to âotherwise orderâ costs under Order 22 rule 20(1)of the RHC.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  As regards Part 36.10(1) of the Old CPR (see the second extract of Part 36.10(1) in paragraph 88 above), an offer to settle beforethe commencement of proceedings which is not a Part 36 offer but is compliant with the provisions in Part 36 of the Old CPR shouldbe treated in a like fashion to a Part 36 offer made after proceedings are begun and should where appropriate attract the provisionsof Part 36 of the Old CPR.  But Order 22 of the RHC does not apply to any <i>pre</i>-action offer (see Order 22 rule 5(6) of the RHC â see paragraph 58 above). I am not persuaded that Part 36.10(1) of the Old CPRis of any material relevance to the exercise of the courtâs discretion under Order 22 rule 20(1) of the RHC.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  So for the present purpose, whilst I do not wish to go behind the decision in <i>Chan Cheuk Kwan</i>, I wish it to be understood that I am not thereby to be taken to be agreeing with it.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  The Otherwise Proviso appears in Part 36.10(2) of the New CPR which provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhere â</p>        <p class="quote">(a) a defendantâs Part 36 offer relates to part only of the claim; and</p>        <p class="quote">(b) at the time of serving notice of acceptance within the relevant period the claimant abandons the balance of the claim,</p>        <p class="quote">the claimant will be entitled to the costs of the proceedings up to the date of serving notice of acceptance <i>unless the court orders otherwise</i>.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and also in Part 36.13(2) of the Old CPR which provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhere â</p>        <p class="quote">(a) a Part 36 offer or a Part 36 payment relates to part only of the claim; and</p>        <p class="quote">(b) at the same time of serving notice of acceptance the claimant abandons the balance of the claim,</p>        <p class="quote">the claimant will be entitled to his costs of the proceedings up to the date of serving notice of acceptance, <i>unless the court orders otherwise</i>.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  It has been suggested in <i>Phillips v Associated Newspapers Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%202%20All%20ER%20455" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 2 All ER 455</a>, 457 that in the absence of the Otherwise Proviso in Part 36.13(1) of the Old CPR, â[it] seems tolerably clear, however, that thewording of sub-para (2) [of Part 36.13 of the Old CPR] is intended to draw attention to the courtâs power to deprive a claimantof some part of his costs in respect of a partial offer where the balance of the claim is abandonedâ (at para.6).</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  In <i>E Ivor</i> <i>Hughes Educational Foundation v Leach</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2005/1317.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] EWHC 1317 (Ch)</a> (14 June 2005), a case also under the Old CPR, the claimant accepted the payment in and abandoned the rest of its claim.  The defendantaccepted he was liable to pay the claimantâs costs relating to such aspect of the claim that was compromised, but denied liabilityto pay the claimantâs costs relating to the rest of the claim on the ground that it had been seriously exaggerated by the claimant. Peter Smith J said that âthe courts should not limit the clear and wide discretionary words âunless the court orders otherwiseâ[in Part 36.13(2) of the Old CPR].

After all, the issue ofcosts where only part of the claim has been compromised with abandonment of the balance of the claim (in <i>contra-</i>distinction to settlement of the whole of the claim) necessarily calls a wider discretion.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  I have referred Ms Hui and Mr Chan to the pre-CPR decision of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Glenlion Construction Limited v Beaverfoam (Moreton) Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20134%20Fam%20Law%20861" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 134 Fam Law 861</a>; Lexis-Nexis transcript (3 November 1983).  In that case, the question was whether, when a plaintiff accepted a payment into courtin full satisfaction of all claims so that the proceedings were thereby stayed, the court had discretion to deprive the plaintiffof all or any of the costs of the action.  Under Order 62 rule 10(2) of the English Rules of the Supreme Court (ie the equivalentof Order 62 rule 10(2) of the Hong Kong Rules of the Supreme Court that was in effect before the amendments brought about by LN403/1992dated 30 November 1992), â[the plaintiff] may, after four days from payment out and <i>unless the court otherwise orders</i>, tax his costs incurred to the time of receipt of the notice of payment into court and 48 hours after taxation may sign judgmentfor his taxed costsâ (my emphasis).  At p.6 of the transcript, Stephenson LJ said that whilst the words of the English sub-ruledid not limit or restrict the courtâs power over costs,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[but] this, as I shall endeavour to indicate later, was an exceptional case by the judge; <i>it was an order</i>, and the order which he made, and <i>which should only be made, in an exceptional case</i>. <b><i>Secondly</i></b>, this was a case in which the plaintiffs from a very early stage had been put on notice by a warning from the defendants that theywere going to ask the court to make the order which the judge in fact made [ie to deprive the plaintiff of some of the costs of theaction]. â¦â¦ <i>I would regard it as a wrong exercise of the judgeâs discretion to make such an order as was made in this case unless there hadbeen a clear warning to the plaintiffs by the defendants that that was their intention â that it was their intention to claim suchan order.</i> â¦â¦â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  At p.9 of the transcript, Griffiths LJ opined that the words âunless the court otherwise ordersâ in the sub-rule, far from cuttingdown the very wide discretion on costs conferred by the terms of section 51 of the Supreme Court Act 1981, were inserted to makeclear that the court retained its discretion in the circumstances dealt with by that sub-rule.  At p.10 of the transcript, he agreedwith Stephenson LJ as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ A plaintiff faced with a payment into court has a very difficult decision to take. As a general rule he should be entitled,when applying his mind to that decision, to assume that if he takes the money he will at least be able to recover his taxed costsup to the date of payment in. But if he has been put specifically on notice by the defendants either at or before the date of paymentin, then they propose to apply to the court for an order that he should not recover his full costs, then that is a further factorwhich he must take into consideration. <i>It would however, in my view, save in the most exceptional cases, the circumstances of which at the moment I am unable to envisage,be quite wrong for a defendant to allow a plaintiff to take money out of court on the faith that he would recover his costs up tothe date of payment in and then thereafter, without warning, apply to the court for an order either limiting or excluding his rightto recover those costs.</i>â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Griffiths LJ went on to say at p.10 of the transcript as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âBut, however that may be, I agree with my Lord that it would only be in an exceptional case that it would be right to exercisethe discretion in favour of a defendant who had not put the defendant [<i>sic</i>] on notice at or before the time of the payment in that he intended to make an application as to costs.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  Turning to the Australian jurisdiction, <i>Maitland Hospital v Fisher (No.2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%20721" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR 721</a> dealt with an equivalent rule of the New South Wales Supreme Court Rules 1970 concerning plaintiffâs offer and indemnity costs.Rule 17(4) provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â17(4) Where an offer is made by a plaintiff and not accepted by the defendant, and the plaintiff obtains an order or judgment onthe claim to which the offer relates no less favourable to him than the terms of the offer, then, <i>unless the Court otherwise orders</i>, the plaintiff shall, subject to rule 24, be entitled to an order against the defendant for his costs in respect of the claim fromthe day on which the offer was made, taxed on an indemnity basis in addition to his costs incurred before and on that day, taxedon a party and party basis.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In that case, the Court of Appeal said at p.725 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âLitigation is inescapably chancy. The purpose of the rule is to put a premium on realistic assessment of cases. It is not to demandperfect foresight which is denied even to judges.

It has added a new duty to the functions of legal practitionersadvising litigants.</i> <i>It is a duty which is both protective of the interests of litigants and of the public interest in the prompt and economical disposalof litigation.</i> <i>It is the duty of courts, allowing for exceptions in particular cases, to give effect to the purpose of the rule.</i>â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  I have also referred Ms Hui and Mr Chan to the case of <i>Donald John Wills and Heather Reney Wills v Bigmac Pty Ltd &amp; anor</i> VG59/1992 (unreported, 9 December 1994).  In that case, the respondents made payment into court.  The applicants successfully appliedto amend the statement of claim shortly before trial, and during the trial the respondents made a second payment into court, whichwas eventually accepted.  Under Order 23 rule 11(1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules, the applicants would be entitled to tax theircosts on a party and party basis up to and including the day the offer was accepted, unless the court otherwise orders, but the respondentsasked for their costs from the date of the first payment into court to the date of the hearing of the applicantsâ amendment application.

The idea behind the rule isto encourage settlement or compromise of proceedings, and more specifically, to encourage litigants to give serious considerationto the settlement of proceedings.

In my view, the Australian authorities on the exercise of discretion to oust the statutory costsprovision upon acceptance of an âoffer of compromiseâ are more akin to the present context where the acceptance of a sanctionedpayment compromises the whole of the claim.  </p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  The <i>pre-</i>CPR English case of <i>Glenlion Construction Limited</i> being concerned with a compromise of the whole claim by acceptance of payment into court is also akin to the present context. Likethe Australian authorities, Stephenson LJ (with whom Griffiths and Purchase LJJ agreed) considered both an exceptional case and âsecondlyâa prior warning are fundamental to the exercise of the discretion under the Otherwise Proviso (see paragraph 97 above).</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  Yet, in the recent decision of <i>Cheung Mai Po v Chan Yu Ching, Alexs</i> HCPI 71/2010 (unreported, 24 June 2011), Master KK Pang after considering <i>Glenlion Construction Limited</i> and <i>Donald John Wills and Heather Reney Wills</i> was âprepared to hold that the Courtâs discretion should only be exercised in compelling and exceptional circumstancesâ (atpara.18), but did not consider that any prior warning to be a prerequisite for the exercise of the discretion to order costs âotherwiseâ(at para.68).  He came to the following view based on Griffiths LJâs observations set out in paragraph 99 above:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ One can see from Griffiths LJâs statement â¦â¦ that where there is exceptional and compelling circumstance, it couldbe right to exercise the discretion in favour of a defendant who had not put the plaintiff on notice at or before the time of thepayment in that he intended to make an application as to costsâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  However, Griffiths LJâs observations must be viewed in context. As explained in paragraph 107 above, Griffiths LJ in fact agreedwith the observations of Stephenson LJ that the exercise of the discretion under the Otherwise Proviso to deprive the plaintiff ofhis statutory entitlement to costs required both an exceptional case and âsecondlyâ a prior warning.  Indeed, Griffiths LJ himselfstated that âsave in the most exceptional casesâ, the circumstances of which were so rare that at the moment he was unable toenvisage, it would be âquite wrongâ to oust the claimantâs entitlement to costs under the sub-rule without any prior warning(see paragraph 98 above), and it was in such context that he went on to say it would only be in an exceptional case that it wouldbe right to exercise the discretion in favour of a defendant who had not given prior warning at or before the time of the paymentin that he intended to make an application as to costs.  In my view, Griffiths LJ in so saying was merely underlining or emphasisingthe fundamental importance of giving prior warning for the exercise of the âotherwise orderâ discretion.  In the circumstances,whilst I do not think the court in <i>Glenlion Construction Limited</i> put the matter of prior warning as high as a prerequisite to the exercise of discretion, and even if the matter of prior warningis not a âsecondâ requirement that has to be satisfied but is part of the overall considerations, they obviously considered itto be a most material factor in deciding whether the discretion is engaged.  </p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  <i>Cheung Mai Po</i> is presently under appeal.  Since we shall shortly have the benefit of the appellate courtâs guidance on the approach to be adoptedin the exercise of the âotherwise orderâ discretion as to costs under Order 22 rule 20(1) of the RHC, I do not propose to sayanything further except to refer to the edifying English trend in respect of the exercise of the courtâs discretion on costs discussedin paragraph 125 below.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  However, in the present case, it is unnecessary for me to come to a definitive view on the approach to be adopted upon review ofthe above authorities because, unlike those authorities, the present action is a not one in which one party seeks to deprive theother partyâs entitlement to costs under any statutory costs provision, but one in which both parties want the court to make acosts order in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs in his/their respective favour.  In such circumstances, it must be common ground that the discretion under the OtherwiseProviso is engaged irrespective of whether there are any exceptional and compelling circumstances and/or any prior warning.  If priorwarning is required, by the terms of the 16/11/10 Order (see paragraph 31 above) both parties have already been alerted to the needfor eventual court determination of the 1<sup>st</sup> Reserved Costs at the assessment of damages or upon argument before the court at the conclusion of the present action.</p>    <p><i>(f)  Order 22 rule 2(4)</i> <i>and Order 62 rule 5 of the RHC</i></p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  Order 22 rule 2(4) of the RHC (see paragraph 58 above) on its face seems to give the court a wide discretion to order that an invalidsanctioned offer to have Order 22 consequences.

In reviewingthe discretion under Part 36.1(2) of the Old CPR, Dyson LJ observed that it was unfortunate that the rules gave no guidance as tohow the discretion should be exercised, but he (with whom Auld LJ agreed) identified four features an offer had to exhibit in orderto be regarded as a Part 36 payment (at p.3604):</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)  the offer was expressed in terms which left no doubt as to what was being offered, including which parts of the claim it wasintended to satisfy, whether any counterclaim had been taken into account, and what provision for interest was proposed;</p>        <p>(d)  it was open for acceptance for at least 21 days;</p>        <p>(e)  it was not a sham or non-serious offer; and</p>        <p>(f)   it was made by a defendant who was clearly good for the money at the time the offer was made.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  Dyson LJ went on to say at p.3604 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â 25. To the extent that any of these conditions is not satisfied, the offer should be given less weight than a payment into courtfor the purposes of a decision as to the incidence of costs. Where none of the conditions is satisfied, it is likely that the courtwill hold that offer affords the defendant no costs protection at all.</p>        <p class="quote">26. But if all the conditions to which I have referred are met, then I can see no reason in principle why the effect of an offer shoulddiffer from that of a payment into court. Simon Brown LJ mentioned the need to promote clarity and certainty. I agree. That is whyan offer which is unclear and uncertain will usually not carry the same weight as a payment into court. But an offer which satisfiesthe four conditions should by definition be no less clear or certain than a payment into court. It is important to emphasis thatthe purpose of a payment into court is not to provide the claimant with security for his judgment if he succeeds at trial. It isto encourage settlement. As Lord Woolf said (Access to Justice final report, ch 11, para 3), a payment into court is âa usefulway of assuring claimants of the substance of an offerâ, and thereby encouraging them to settle by accepting the money that hasbeen paid into court. If a claimant has no less assurance as to the substance of an offer than where a payment into court has beenmade, there is no reason to treat the offer as providing any less encouragement to settle or to treat it differently from a paymentinto court.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  Ramsey J in <i>Eiles</i> (at para.42) in deciding whether to exercise his discretion whether to order the claimantâs invalid Part 36 offer as having therelevant consequences in Part 36, summarised the factors he would have regard to, ie the observations of Dyson LJ in <i>Trustees of Stokes Pension Fund</i>, the overriding objectives under Part 1.1, and the requirement to deal with cases justly and in particular to save expense and dealwith the case in ways which are proportionate to the amount of money involved.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  But before considering how to exercise the discretion under Order 22 rule 3(4) and Order 62 rule 5 of the RHC, it is necessary toask whether the court can order an offer which includes terms as to costs to have the consequences specified in Order 22 of the RHC.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  Peter Gibson LJ in <i>Mitchell</i> at p.36 stated as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â34. <a name="para34" id="para34">I therefore conclude that a term as to costs is not within the scope of a Part 36 offer.</a> That does not of course mean that a claimant cannot make an offer which includes a term as to costs; the court will have regard tothat in exercising its usual discretion in relation to inter partes costs at the end of the case. As r 36.1(2) states, nothing inPart 36 prevents a party making an offer to settle in whatever way he chooses. However, nothing in r 36(1)(2) permits a party toinclude a term as to costs as part of a Part 36 offer for the purpose of obtaining an order for costs on an indemnity basis.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  In <i>Feakins v Burstow &amp; anor</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2005/2441.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] EWHC 2441 (QB)</a> (11 November 2005), Jack J cited <i>Mitchell</i> with approval and reiterated that an offer could be considered under Part 44.3(4)(c) even though it was not a Part 36 offer becauseit included a term as to costs.  Such approach in <i>Mitchell</i> was also followed in Hong Kong by HH Judge Wong in <i>Sunbeam Investments Limited</i> at para.32.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  Ramsay J in <i>Eiles</i> at paras.36-39 said the above passage extracted from <i>Mitchell</i> did not circumscribe the discretion which would otherwise apply under Part 36.1(2) of the Old CPR. Rather, the English Court of Appealin <i>Mitchell</i> was pointing out that an order under Part 36.1(2) that the consequences of Part 36.21 of the Old CPR (ie the English equivalent ofOrder 22 rule 24 of the RHC) should apply to an offer did not thereby change the threshold test for Part 36.21, so that if, as in<i>Mitchell</i>, âthe decision on the substantive issues was insufficient in itself to exceed the offer, the ancillary issue of costs could notbe used to determine whether the defendant was held liable for more or the judgment against a defendant was more advantageous tothe claimant than the offerâ.  Where a claimant had, independently of the offer as to costs, satisfied the conditions in Part 36.21and did not need to rely on the success on costs to succeed in relation to the threshold test for Part 36.21, there would be no impedimentto the exercise of discretion under Part 36.1(2) to order that the offer should have the consequences specified in Part 36.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  Underhill J in <i>Huntley v Simmonds</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2009/406.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2009] EWHC 406 (QB)</a> para.7 said he was not troubled by giving Part 36 effect to an offer that failed to comply with the rules:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><a name="para7" id="para7">ââ¦â¦ A defendant who makes a non-compliant offer is in a worse position because he is at the mercy of the Court instead of beingable to rely on the strong presumption that the costs consequences specified by CPR 36.14 will apply.</a>  It would not be in every case that the Court would be prepared to overlook any defects, even if they could be characterised as technical. But in a proper case â and I think, for the reasons advanced by Mr Walker, that this is such a case â I see no reason why aparty should be penalised for what are in truth purely technical failures.  I was referred to <i>Mitchell v James</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%201%20WLR%20158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 1 WLR 158</a> and <i>Hertsmere Primary Care Trust v Estate of RabindraâAnandh</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2005/320.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] EWHC 320 (Ch)</a>, in which the Court gave effect to a non-compliant Part 36 offer in broadly analogous circumstances.  Those cases are not directlyapplicable because they relied on the terms of CPR 36.1(2), which has since been amended; but they reinforce my view that there isnothing wrong in principle in the approach which I propose to take.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  But currently there seems to be a tightening trend in the exercise of such discretion by the English courts as the ills of a wide-rangingdiscretion gradually become more apparent. In <i>Fox v Foundation Piling Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/790.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2011] EWCA Civ 790</a> (7 July 2011), Jackson LJ referred to the body of case law that had accumulated around the provisions of Part 36 and their interrelationshipwith Part 44.3 as ânot a welcome developmentâ.  He alluded to a new Part 36.14(1A) that will be introduced with effect from 1October 2011 which will reverse the effect of <i>Carver v BAA Plc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%203%20All%20ER%20911" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 3 All ER 911</a> in which the English Court of Appeal held that the New CPR permitted a more wide-ranging review of all the facts and circumstancesof deciding whether the judgment being the fruit of the litigation was worth the fight.  Jackson LJ also added as follows:<a name="para62" id="para62"></a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â 62. There has been a growing and unwelcome tendency by first instance courts and, dare I say it, this court as well to departfrom the starting point set out in rule 44.3 (2) (a) too far and too often. Such an approach may strive for perfect justice in theindividual case, but at huge additional cost to the parties and at huge costs to other litigants because of the uncertainty whichsuch an approach generates. <a name="para63" id="para63"></a>â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">  63. I hope that the forthcoming amendment to rule 36.14 will point the way to a more clear cut approach to the costs rules in future. In the context of personal injury litigation where the claimant has a strong case on liability but quantum is inflated, the defendantâsremedy is to make a modest Part 36 offer. â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  These authorities are largely concerned with the issue of whether after judgment a party has obtained a more advantageous resulton the substantive issues than that proposed in the Part 36 offer or <i>Calderbank</i> offer.  But this comparison of the offer in question and the result after trial is not relevant to the present situation where thePlaintiff did not proceed with the assessment of damages and instead accepted the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP without admission of liability and without any findings made by the court.  Moreover, for the purpose of determining liabilityfor the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs as distinct from the 3<sup>rd</sup> Disputed Costs, it is doubtful whether the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer adds anything further to the Defendantâs position.  After all, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer only repeats the Defendantâs claim all along and under the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP Alternative in the Settlement Summons that the Plaintiff should bear their costs in the present action on the issue of liabilityfrom 6 May to 16 November 2011 (see paragraph 45(b) above) and does not make any offer or concession.  In my view, subject to myruling on whom the liability for the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs should fall and on whether it is permissible under Order 62 rule 5(1) of the RHC to take the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer into account on the question of costs, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer may possibly be relevant to the exercise of discretion in respect of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Disputed Costs.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  In any event, as explained in paragraph 111 above, this is not a case of one party asking the court to exercise its discretion underOrder 22 rule 3(4) and Order 62 rules 3 and 5 of the RHC to deprive the other partyâs entitlement to any statutory costs provision. Rather, the present situation is one in which each party is seeking a cost order in his/their favour beyond the scope of the statutorycosts provided for under Order 22 rule 20(1) of the RHC.  Given that under the 16/11/10 Order the 1<sup>st</sup> Reserved Costs have been expressly reserved for future determination (see paragraph 31 above), I am of the view that in the specialcontext of the present case the exercise of the courtâs discretion in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs is unfettered by any principles that may be distilled from the above authorities vis-Ã -vis the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer.  I leave for future consideration in an appropriate case the applicability of those principles to the question of costs wherethe judgment on the substantive issues fails to exceed an admissible offer outside Order 22 of the RHC.</p>    <p><i>(g) Without prejudice save as to costs</i></p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  But apart from the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer, Ms Hui at the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing also asked me to look at the series of âwithout prejudice as to costsâ correspondence emanating from WKT between 4 Mayand 21 October 2010 (see paragraphs 12, 15, 23 and 30 above).  Quite correctly, Ms Hui did not suggest that these letters constituteany sanctioned offer, and she did not ask for the exercise of the courtâs discretion under Order 22 rule 2(4) of the RHC in respectof such letters.  Rather, she urged me to take into account the offers made in these letters in the exercise of my discretion inrespect of the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs as required under Order 62 rule 5(1)(d) and (g) of the RHC (see paragraph 113 above).</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  There is no dispute that letters referred to above are expressed to be âwithout prejudice save as to costsâ or are what is commonlycalled <i>Calderbank</i> letters.  Such letters are kept secret until the substantive issues have been resolved, but can be taken into on the question ofcosts.  To be effective a <i>Calderbank</i> offer must be made in clear terms so that the party against whom it may be used on the issue of costs knows what he is offered otherwiseit may well be reasonable for such party to refuse an offer made in ambiguous terms (see <i>C &amp; H Engineering v F Klucznic &amp; Sons Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%20FSR%20667" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] FSR 667</a>, 671 and <i>Butcher v Wolfe and Wolfe</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20FLR%20334" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 FLR 334</a>, 340).  For the present purpose, I shall assume that the aforesaid âwithout prejudice save as to costsâ letters from WKT aresufficiently certain, and are therefore âadmissible offers to settleâ within the meaning of Order 62 rule 5(1)(g) of the RHC.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  However, Order 62 rule 5(1)(d) of the RHC prohibits the court from taking any <i>Calderbank</i> offer into account if, at the time it is made, the offeror could have protected his position as to costs by means of a sanctionedpayment âor a sanctioned offerâ under Order 22 of the RHC.  I note that Order 62 rule 5(1)(d) of the RHC permits a <i>Calderbank</i> offer âwhich relates to any issue in the proceedingsâ to be taken into account, but query is necessarily raised as to whetherthe Defendant could have made a sanctioned offer within the meaning of Order 22 of the RHC and then invoke (if they can) the âotherwiseorderâ discretion in Order 22 rule 20(1) of the RHC for protection on costs. I am inclined to think that a forceful argument canbe made that even if the terms of a <i>Calderbank</i> offer are clear and certain and such an offer may be regarded as an âadmissible offerâ within the meaning of Order 62 rule 5(1)(g)of the RHC, the court should not take into account such offer on the question of costs if the relevant party could have made a sanctionedoffer instead. But since neither Ms Hui nor Mr Chan argued these points before me at the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing, I shall assume without decision that WKTâs <i>Calderbank</i> letters as aforesaid (see paragraphs 12, 15 and 23 above) are admissible for the present purpose.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  As to the exercise of discretion in light of the aforesaid âwithout prejudice save as to costsâ letters from WKT, they shouldinfluence but not govern the exercise of such discretion.  The following guidance by Mummery LJ in <i>Butcher</i> at p.340 was cited with approval in <i>Luk Kwan Hung Nelson v Victory Mark Investment Limited</i> HCA 8530/1999, Sakhrani J (unreported, 9 February 1994) and is, in my view, also applicable to the <i>post-</i>CJR scene:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA <i>Calderbank</i> offer is made for the same reason as a payment into court is made; to encourage a settlement and, failing a settlement, to protectthe position on costs of the person making the payment in or the <i>Calderbank</i> offer. But a <i>Calderbank</i> offer is not to be treated as, or to be regarded as a substitute for, or to be equated for all purposes with, a payment into court.As a <i>Calderbank</i> offer is appropriate in a case other than a claim for debt or damages, it requires a greater degree of flexibility. The proper approachto a <i>Calderbank</i> offer, when it is taken into account on a later argument on costs, is to ask whether the party to whom the offer was made âoughtreasonably to have accepted the proposal in the letter?â Or, to put it another way, account must be taken of the reasonablenessor otherwise of the refusal to accept the offer - see <i>Cutts v Head and Another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20Ch%20290" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] Ch 290</a>, 302 per Oliver J, and <i>Chrulew and Others v Borm-Reid &amp; Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20WLR%20176" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 WLR 176</a>, 182A. This approach is to be compared with the payment into court where, in the absence of a special reason for depriving the offeringparty of his post-offer costs, the simple question is whether the payment in is equal to or is beaten by the defendants at trial.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  Emboldened by the above analysis of the authorities, I now turn to the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs.</p>    <p><i>(h) 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs</i></p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  In determining where liability for the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs should lie, I need to ask the question whether the Plaintiff ought reasonably to have accepted the Defendantâs proposalin WKTâs letter of 6 May 2010 (see paragraph 15 above) or, to put it in another way, whether the Plaintiffâs refusal of the offeris unreasonable.  It is necessary to look at the reality of what was going on and not dwell unduly on the precise particulars inwhich such <i>Calderbank</i> letter has been expressed.</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  In reality, on the issue of liability, the Plaintiff has secured interlocutory judgment for damages (if any) to be assessed, andon the issues of causation and quantum of damages he secured HK$220,000.00 upon his acceptance of the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP within the prescribed time.  Having crossed the hurdles on all issues of liability, causation and quantum of damages so that asa matter of substance and reality he has arguably âwonâ, why should the Plaintiff be deprived of and further has to pay the Defendantthe 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs?</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  In the present case, there is no doubt the Defendant has admitted the occurrence of the Accident and their negligence in relationthereto as early as in the Defence.  However, they disagreed that in the course of the Accident the Plaintiffâs left lower limbwas hit and pressed by the carrier (which allegation puts the circumstances of the Accident in issue) and they also raised the CausationDispute (see paragraph 8 above), and on such premise they resisted any attempt to enter interlocutory judgment for damages to beassessed.  This resulted in the 28/4/10 Order which granted case management directions on <i>inter alia</i> the issue of liability (see paragraphs 10-11 above).  In my view, the Plaintiff was fully justified in preparing his case on theissue of liability as required under the 28/4/10 Order.</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  I am not persuaded that WKTâs âwithout prejudice save as to costsâ letter dated 4 May 2010 (see paragraph 12 above) is ofassistance to the Defendant.  First of all, as JLA rightly pointed out in their letter of 5 May 2010 (see paragraph 13 above), itis inappropriate for a party to effect amendment of pleadings by way of a <i>Calderbank</i> letter that can only come to light on the issue of costs after resolution of the substantive issues, and it is even more inappropriatein the present case when the Defendant required the Plaintiff to desist from preparing his case on liability as required under the28/4/10 Order on the strength of so-called amendments to pleadings made by way of a <i>Calderbank</i> letter.  I have no hesitation in coming to the view that JLAâs rejection of such demand was reasonable.  In declining to allowjudgment on liability to be entered and in not proceeding to seek leave to properly amend their pleadings (despite JLAâs reminder)to remove any impediment to full resolution of the issue of liability, the Defendant could not dictate the content of the witnessstatement which the Plaintiff was required to prepare to meet the court-imposed case management direction and timetable specifiedin the 28/4/10 Order.  Indeed, JLA advised that by the time of their receipt of WKTâs <i>Calderbank</i> letter of 4 May 2010, some costs had already been incurred on the issue of liability since they had already taken instructions fromthe Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  WKTâs open letter and <i>Calderbank</i> letter both dated 6 May 2010 (see paragraphs 14-15 above) must be looked at together in order to properly understand the offer madein the latter correspondence.  Putting aside the flamboyant language in the open letter, WKT indicated that the Defendant would resistany interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed because the Plaintiff suffered no recoverable loss or damages beyond the ECSum and the advance payments he had already received.  In short, WKT was asserting that the Plaintiff had no viable claim for anyrecoverable loss or damages, and therefore he should not have commenced the present action at all notwithstanding the Defendantâsadmission of negligence, and so it must be the Defendant and not the Plaintiff who should be entitled to costs on the issue of liability.</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  Plainly, it must be on the above rationale that the Defendant made the <i>Calderbank</i> offer to allow judgment on liability to be entered for damages (if any) to be assessed with costs on the issue of liability to bereserved for argument after the assessment of damages or at the conclusion of the present action.  But for such rationale, I canhardly think of any justifiable reason for the Defendant not to have offered to pay the Plaintiffâs costs on the issue of liabilitywhen in their <i>Calderbank</i> letter they were prepared to allow judgment on liability to be entered.  Indeed, even as at 23 June 2010, WKT continued to maintainthere were no recoverable loss or damages to justify entering interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed notwithstanding theDefendantâs admission of negligence (see paragraph 21 above).</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  It seems to me that the Defendant wanted to have the best of both worlds, on one hand refusing to let interlocutory judgment onliability to be entered and on the other hand ousting cost responsibility for the evidential efforts by the Plaintiff on the issueof liability.  The Plaintiff was understandably concerned for he carried the onus of proving his case and seeking judgment on liabilitybefore he could proceed with assessment of his loss and damages.  After all, to the knowledge of the Defendant and WKT, the casemanagement directions granted by the 28/4/10 Order were premised on the basis that the issue of liability was still at large (seeparagraph 10 above) otherwise directions for, say, expert evidence on liability would have been wholly meaningless, and the Plaintiffâsconcern was reflected in the PI Masterâs provisional view that liability had not been admitted by the Defendant and in his directionfor preparation of a list of issues to be tried (see paragraphs 20 and 22 above).</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  In my view, the Defendant was misconceived in resisting interlocutory judgment on liability and in requiring the Plaintiff to proceedwith the assessment of damages without any interlocutory judgment being entered.  In determining whether liability should be admittedor interlocutory judgment should be entered for a cause of action based on negligence, it is necessary to consider whether the componentsof the tort of negligence have been established.  According to <i>Charlesworth &amp; Percy on Negligence</i> 12<sup>th</sup> ed (2010) para.1-34 at pp.17-18:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ Whatever form of words is adopted the essential components are recognised as three: âdutyâ, âbreachâ and âresultingdamageâ, i.e.:</p>        <p class="quote">1.      the existence of a duty to take care, which is owed by the defendant to the complainant;</p>        <p class="quote">2.      the failure to attain that standard of care, prescribed by law, thereby committing a breach of duty; and</p>        <p class="quote">3.      damage, which is both causally connected with such breach and recognised by the law, has been suffered by the complainant.</p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote"><i>If the claimant satisfies the court on the evidence that these three ingredients are made out, the defendant should be held liablein negligence.  It will then be necessary to identify the extent of damage referable to the breach of duty, before assessing itsvalue in money terms.</i> â¦â¦â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote">Likewise, in <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> 20<sup>th</sup> ed (2010) para.8-04 at p.415, it is said that when the requirements for the tort of negligence (including the elements of âa causalconnection between the defendantâs careless conduct and the damageâ and âthat the particular kind of damage to the particularclaimant is not so unforeseeable as to be too remoteâ) are satisfied, âthe defendant is liable in negligence. Only then is itrelevant to consider the assessment of damages, i.e. the compensation for the damage for which the defendant is responsibleâ.</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  Thus, the component of âresulting damageâ only goes to the question of whether the claimant has suffered the type of damagethat is not nominal and not too remote, and is not concerned with the quantum or extent of damages that may be subject to properassessment in due course. In the present case, the first two components have been admitted, and there is no dispute that the Plaintiffdid suffer some personal injury, which plainly must be the type of damage not too remote in respect of the Accident.  In such circumstances,the cause of action on negligence is complete and the Defendant is plainly liable in negligence.  There is no room for the Defendantto resist interlocutory judgment being entered.  The remaining question, as the above passage from <i>Charlesworth &amp; Percy on Negligence</i> shows, is the identification of the extent of damage referable to the breach of duty, and this is where the denial of the AllegedInjuries and the Causation Dispute become relevant in the assessment of damages.  WKTâs suggestion that interlocutory judgmenton liability should not be entered because there is no ârecoverableâ loss or damages after taking into account the EC Sum andthe advance payments already received by the Plaintiff and the expert medical evidence as to the extent of the Plaintiffâs impairmentsand disabilities (see paragraphs 8, 12 and 21 above) merely focuses on the extent and quantum of damages upon assessment and doesnot address the component of âresulting damageâ that comprises the cause of action on negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  It is for the above reasons that at the 20/10/10 CLR I granted leave for the Defendant to amend the Defence to properly reflectthese matters and to enable interlocutory judgment on liability to be entered for damages to be assessed (see paragraphs 28-29 above). Since the Defendant at that stage still maintained that the extent and quantum of ârecoverableâ loss and damages would be nil,costs on the issue of liability had to be reserved pending the outcome of the assessment of damages or the conclusion of the proceedings(see paragraph 29 above).  If it turns out that the Defendant were correct in their contention, there may be room for argument thatthe Plaintiff ought not to have commenced the present action at all and hence be liable for the Defendantâs costs of the actionincluding costs on the issue of liability.  But if the extent and quantum of the Plaintiffâs loss and damages exceed the EC Sumand the advance payments he has already received, then he would have been justified to bring the present action and there may beroom for argument that the Defendant should be liable for his costs of the action including costs on the issue of liability.  Onsuch basis, interlocutory judgment was eventually entered on 16 November 2010 on application by the Defendant made on 3 November2010, and the 1<sup>st</sup> Reserved Costs were reserved for determination at the assessment of damages or for argument at the conclusion of the proceedings(see paragraph 31 above).</p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  Clearly, notwithstanding the Plaintiffâs consistent stance all along that he was entitled to interlocutory judgment on liability,the fact that such interlocutory judgment was only entered on 16 November 2010 was due to the Defendantâs resisting attitude (whichI have found to be unjustified) notwithstanding concerns expressed by the Plaintiff and the PI Master.  Even though it may be arguedthat the Plaintiff need not adduce evidence to prove the admitted matters for the purpose of establishing his case on the issue ofliability and/or causation of damages, given the dispute in the pleadings (which the Defendant had not sought to amend until the16/11/10 CLR despite JLAâs earlier reminder to them to make proper application for such purpose â see paragraphs 12-13 and 28-29above) over whether the carrier hit and/or pressed on the Plaintiffâs lower limb at the time of the Accident, the Defendant clearlyput the Plaintiff to proof as to the circumstances of the Accident insofar as relates to his leg injury and to the causation of theAlleged Injuries, so the Plaintiff cannot be criticised for making efforts to prepare his case in respect of the circumstances ofthe Accident and all matters concerning the Causation Dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  This case eventually did not proceed to assessment of damages but was finally resolved by the Plaintiffâs acceptance of the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP on 12 January 2011.  Thus, by accepting the sanctioned payments the Plaintiff in reality has obtained âsomething moreâ fromthe present action beyond the EC Sum and the advance payments he had received.  In this sense, the Plaintiff can be regarded as theâsuccessfulâ party on the issue of liability since there can be no doubt that he has an incontrovertible case on all relevantcomponents of the cause of action on negligence, and his pursuit of the present action has been vindicated by the recovery of HK$220,000.00through acceptance of the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP.</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  But the Defendant claims that the Plaintiff has obtained nothing from the present action that (a) he could not have obtained byaccepting the offer made in WKTâs <i>Calderbank</i> letter dated 6 May 2010 (see paragraph 15 above) which has been repeated in their further <i>Calderbank</i> letter dated 2 July 2010 (see paragraph 23 above) and (b) justified his pursuit of the action on liability until 16 November 2010. Is that correct?</p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  It is true that in their offer letter of 6 May 2010 the Defendant proposed to let judgment on liability be entered in favour ofthe Plaintiff with damages, if any, to be assessed (see paragraph 15 above).  But it is an integral part of that offer that costson the issue of liability would be reserved for further argument before the court at the assessment of damages or at the conclusionof the present action. Plainly, the Defendant was not making any concession at all on who should be liable for costs on the issueof liability (whether incurred before or after 6 May 2010); they wanted to adopt a wait and see attitude to see if the Plaintiffwould eventually recover any damages at all and then decide.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  But it is clear that as at 6 May 2010 there was at the very least no justification for the Defendant to resist liability for costson the issue of liability from the commencement of the present action until 5 May 2010.  By virtue of the fact that (a) the Defendantwas not prepared to admit liability (as distinct from admitting negligence in respect of the Accident) even on <i>Calderbank</i> basis at least until 6 May 2010, (b) judgment on liability was eventually entered against the Defendant, and (c) the Defendant eventuallyrecovered HK$220,000.00 from his acceptance of the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP in the present action, there can be no doubt that at the very least the Plaintiffâs demand for an immediate order for costson the issue of liability up to 5 May 2010 in his favour without any deferral of such costs issue for eventual argument as proposedby the Defendant has been vindicated.  The Defendant failed to concede liability for such costs either on open basis (see 3<sup>rd</sup> SP Alternative in the Settlement Summons which requires the Plaintiff to bear such costs â see paragraph 45(b) above) or on <i>Calderbank</i> basis (see WKTâs <i>Calderbank</i> letters dated 6 May, 2 July and 21 October 2010 â see paragraphs 15, 23 and 30 above).  The Defendant only conceded liability topay such costs at the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing.  Simply on this point, it cannot be said that the Plaintiffâs rejection of the Defendantâs <i>Calderbank</i> offer is unreasonable.  On the contrary, I find such refusal reasonable.</p>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  In respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs, I also cannot see how the Defendant can resist such costs. On an open basis, the Defendant tried to limit the caseto an assessment of damages but at the same time sought to avoid responsibility for costs on the issue of liability by resistinginterlocutory judgment.  On a <i>Calderbank</i> basis, whilst the Defendant was prepared to accede to judgment on liability, they declined to bear responsibility for costs on theissue of liability.  This is a classic case of a litigant wanting to have his cake and eat it.  The court has little sympathy fora party who seeks to oust responsibility for costs on liability but at the same time refuses to bring closure to the issue of liability. Likewise, the court also has little sympathy for a party who concedes liability but declines to bear responsibility for costs thatthat concession entails.  The Plaintiffâs insistence on having his costs on the issue of liability without deferral for argumentas to who should be liable for such costs has been vindicated by his being âsuccessfulâ on both liability and quantum, ie havingjudgment on liability entered and recovering HK$220,000.00 from the sanctioned payments paid by the Defendant.  There is simply nobasis for the Defendant to resist costs on the issue of liability, especially when it was their resisting attitude that delayed enteringinterlocutory judgment on liability until 16 November 2010.  The Plaintiff in demanding the Defendant to pay costs on the issue ofliability and refusing to defer such costs for argument (ie which contention by the Plaintiff is tantamount to leaving the matterof liability for such costs wholly at large) is not unreasonable.  In all the circumstances, I consider the Plaintiffâs conductreasonable, and I order the Defendant do pay the Plaintiff the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs (ie costs on the issue of liability from 6 May to 16 November 2010), and the Plaintiffâs own costs be taxed in accordancewith <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>.</p>    <p><i>(i) 3<sup>rd</sup> Disputed Costs</i></p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  Given my conclusion on the 1<sup>st</sup> Disputed Costs, even assuming without decision that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer is an âadmissible offer to settleâ under Order 62 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5(1)(g)</a> of the RHC on the issue of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Disputed Costs, it still does not assist the Defendant.  There is no good reason why costs should not follow event, and bearing inmind that the Defendant only conceded liability for costs on the issue of liability for the period from the commencement of the presentaction to 5 May 2010 at the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing, I therefore grant a costs order <i>nisi</i> that the Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff the 3<sup>rd</sup> Disputed Costs to be taxed if not agreed, and the Plaintiffâs own costs taxed in accordance with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>VII. OTHER OBSERVATIONS</i></p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  The above is sufficient to dispose of the application before me.

Hence, the Acceptance Notice filed/served in response to the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP Notice cannot be regarded as any acceptance of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Offer.</p>    <p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a>  In other words, Mr Chan suggested that the appropriate methodology for completing any prescribed Form 23 was for the party makingthe sanctioned payment to choose 1 out of the first 3 check-boxes therein to identify the scope/nature of the settlement (ie whetherthe sanctioned payment was for settlement of the whole of the claim, part of the claim or certain issue(s) arising from the claim),and if he selected the 1<sup>st</sup> check-box (ie the sanctioned payment is for settlement of the whole of the claim), he should not and has no need to complete the4<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> check-boxes, which are to be completed only if he chooses the 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> check-box (ie the sanctioned payment is for settlement of part of the claim or certain issue(s) arising from the claim).</p>    <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a>  In my view, such argument is misconceived. First, Mr Chan is mistaken in his reading of the prescribed Form 23.  In accordance withusual principles of statutory interpretation, a natural and purposive meaning should be given.  I am unable to accept Mr Chanâsconstruction either on plain reading of the prescribed Form 23 or upon construction of such standard form based on the aforesaidprinciples.</p>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  First, the 4<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> check-boxes in the prescribed Form 23 are as equally relevant to a sanctioned payment for settlement of the whole of the claim asfor a sanctioned payment for settlement for part of the claim or certain issue(s) arising from the claim.  For example, irrespectivewhether the sanctioned payment is for settlement of the whole of the claim, part of the claim or certain issue(s) arising from theclaim, there may well be earlier sanctioned payments, interim payments or sums of money paid into court to be taken into account. Thus, the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP Notice gave details of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> SP which together with the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP made up the total sanctioned payment sum of HK$220,000.00.  Such check-box and the information given therein remained relevantand applicable even though the 3<sup>rd</sup> SP was for settlement of the whole of the Plaintiffâs claim.  Likewise, the issue of whether the sanctioned payment is inclusiveor exclusive of interest can be relevant to a sanctioned payment for settlement of the whole or part of the claim or for certainissue(s) arising from the claim.  Still further, the position vis-Ã -vis a counterclaim or set-off may need to be addressed whetherthe sanctioned payment is for settlement of the whole or part of the claim or for certain issue(s) arising from the claim.</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  Mr Chan countered by saying that where a plaintiff had selected the 1<sup>st</sup> check-box (ie for settlement of the whole of the claim), there would have been no need to, say, fill in the 4<sup>th</sup> check-box to remind the recipient of the Notice of Sanctioned Payment of the sums previously paid into court because such recipientshould have been aware of such information and the court file would have record of any previous payment in.  But in my view, if suchrationale holds water, it is equally applicable to any sanctioned payment for settlement of part of the clam or certain issue(s)arising from the claim.  There is no merit to such argument.</p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  For the last check-box of the prescribed Form 23, I am unable to appreciate why a sanctioned payment made as part of the terms ofa valid sanctioned offer is necessarily limited to settlement of part of the claim or certain issue(s) arising from the claim andnot for the whole of the claim, and Mr Chan was unable to offer any plausible explanation.  Such suggestion also flies against thebroad terms of Order 22 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 3(1)</a> of the RHC, which allows the parties to make both a sanctioned offer and sanctioned payment for settlement of any claim (see paragraph58 above).</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  Mr Chan next suggested that the phrase â<i>(give details below)</i>â at the end of each of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> check-boxes in the prescribed Form 23 relating to settlement of part of the claim or certain issue(s) arising from the claim in factrefers to the 4<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> check-boxes in the form.  Such contention does not bear scrutiny.  In my view, details to be given under such italicised phrase necessarilyrefer to the description of the precise âpartâ of the claim or the precise âissue(s)â arising from the claim that correlateto the sanctioned payment in question (see Order 22 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5(3)(a)</a> of the RHC) and not to the distinctly different type of information to be given in the 4<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> check-boxes.  In my view, the party making the sanctioned payment should âgive detailsâ of the relevant âpartâ of the claimor the relevant âissue(s)â arising from the claim under â<i>(give details)</i>â at the end of the phrase âThe (part)(issue or issues) to which it relates is (are): <i>(give details)</i>â in the prescribed Form 23.  Since the description of the relevant âpartâ of the claim or the relevant âissue(s)â arisingfrom the claim must necessarily be fact or case sensitive, the standard form can do no more than prescribe â<i>(give details)</i>â.  Consequently, the phrase âThe (part)(issue or issues) to which it relates is (are): <i>(give details)</i>â necessarily correlates to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and/or 3<sup>rd</sup> check-boxes rather than to the 4<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> check-boxes.</p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  I am therefore driven to the construction that the 4<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> check-boxes of the prescribed Form 23 are applicable irrespective of whether the sanctioned payment is for settlement of the wholeof the claim, part of the claim or certain issue(s) arising from the claim. Mr Chanâs argument fails to give proper meaning tothe plain terms of Form 23.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>VIII.
