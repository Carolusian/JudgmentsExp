C. Leung), and the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant, (Newide).  The application for summary judgment includes an application to strike out Dr H. C. Leungâs counterclaimagainst IAL.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Dr H. C. Leung, for his part makes application to strike out a prayer in the Amended Statement of Claim for damages for conversion,and to amend his Defence and Counterclaim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Newide resists summary judgment</p>    <p class="heading">Background:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The history of the matter is accurately set out in paragraphs 4-28 of the judgment of Deputy High Court Judge Gill, delivered on10 July 2007, in which he dealt with an interlocutory injunction sought by IAL.  I gratefully adopt that formulation of the circumstances.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Since that judgment IALâs pleadings have been amended.  The primary claim on the part of IAL is now a claim in equity allegingthat since 14 October 2006, or at the latest, 16 November 2006, Dr H. C. Leung has, by virtue of an executed agreement for sale andpurchase, been a bare trustee of the legal title of his shares in Group Benefit Development Ltd, (GBDL).  A claim of conversion ofthe title of the shares by Dr H. C. Leung remains, and an additional claim based upon breach of fiduciary duty on the part of DrH. C. Leung, that duty arising from the allegation of trusteeship of the shares, has been added.</p>    <p class="heading">The arguments to resist summary judgment:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In his proposed Amended Defence and Counterclaim, Dr H. C. Leung pleads primarily that he entered into the contract for the saleof his shares in GBDL to IAL in reliance upon two representations made by the chairman of IAL, (Dr John Shum), and his wife, namely:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)     that Dr John Shum and his wife believed that the managing director of GBDL, Dr Vincent Leung, (the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant), had been discharging his directorâs duties dishonestly; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)    that the purpose and intention of IAL in acquiring Dr H. C. Leungâs shares in GBDL were to form a majority group of the GBDLshareholders in order to improve the governance of GBDL;</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Dr H C Leung says that both of these representations were misrepresentations, as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)     in fact neither Dr John Shum nor his wife honestly held a belief that Dr Vincent Leung was dishonest, and further there wasno proper foundation in fact for such a belief; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)    in fact the true purpose of IAL was not to improve governance of GDBL, but to sell on the GBDL shares to a buyer for a profit.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  By virtue of the alleged misrepresentations it is contended that Dr H. C. Leung was entitled to rescind any contract there may havebeen to sell his GBDL shares to IAL, and to sell them to Newide.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The argument made for Dr H. C. Leung is that there are triable issues on these allegations of misrepresentation, and that accordinglythere should be no summary judgement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The argument for Newide first adopts the contention of Dr H. C. Leung, that by virtue of the misrepresentations there was no enforceablecontract between IAL and Dr H. C. Leung, and that accordingly Dr H. C. Leung was free to sell his shares in GBDL to Newide.  Second,it is said that Newide was a bona fide purchaser for value of Dr H. C. Leungâs shares in GBDL, without notice of any beneficialinterest of IAL in the shares.</p>    <p class="heading">Discussion:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  As I have concluded that there should be no summary judgment, and that the matter should proceed to trial, I do not propose to commenton the merits of the arguments made by both Dr H. C. Leung and Newide, other than to say that in the circumstances I am unable tosay that the contentions fall within the category of âmoonshineâ, they being, on the face of the papers, at least arguable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  I say that for the following reasons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Dr John Shum acknowledges in his 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit, (para 13(c)), that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦. Eva Shum and I probably told Dr H. C. Leung that we had reasons to suspect that Vincent Leung had acted dishonestly in conversationswith him.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">However he then arguably purports to resile, at least in part, from the allegation of dishonesty.  Instead of asserting the basisupon which he alleged dishonesty, he uses somewhat less pejorative language, conceding only to an assertion that Dr Vincent Leung:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âhad not been discharging his duties properly and that he has received excessive remuneration without proper authorisation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In his 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit whilst asserting to âevasionâ on the part of the Dr Vincent Leung, and a âlack of proper authorisationâ, he doesnot go so far as to make direct allegations of dishonesty.  In his 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit he merely said that Dr Vincent Leungâs management: âlacked transparency and accountabilityâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In the light of his concession that the expression âdishonestlyâ may have been used in the discussions with Dr H. C. Leung,and having regard to the terms of his affidavits, I am satisfied that there is a triable issue as to whether or not such a representationwas made, and the terms of any such statement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In seeking to assert that the true purpose of IAL was to acquire and resell the GBDL shares at a profit, and that there was no intentionto improve governance, Dr H. C. Leung takes on a heavy burden for there are significant and extensive documents in support of IALâscontention that it wished to improve the governance of GBDL.  That said however, there is evidence to substantiate the propositionthat prior to the contract between IAL and Dr H. C. Leung for the acquisition of the GBDL shares, GBDL had been in discussion witha prospective purchaser.  There is no direct evidence of IAL communicating that fact to Dr H C Leung.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  An issue is raised on the papers as to the precise point in time at which Dr H. C. Leung learned of those discussions.  If Dr H.C. Leung had not learned of that prospective sale prior to entering into the contract to sell his GBDL shares to IAL, I am unableto say that his contention that, in failing to disclose those negotiations or discussions to him, IAL has misrepresented its trueposition, is unarguable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  I accept too, that, if made in the terms alleged by Dr H C Leung, it must be an issue for trial, as to whether the misrepresentations,if any, were material in the decision of Dr H. C. Leung to sell his GBDL shares to IAL.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  For Newide, two points are made.  First, if there is an arguable case that Dr H. C. Leung did not have a specifically enforceablecontract with IAL, in relation to the GBDL shares, then it is contended that Dr H. C. Leung was free to sell those shares to Newide.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Having found that Dr H. C. Leung does have an arguable case that he was entitled to rescind the contract with IAL, it follows thatthere can be no summary judgment against Newide.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  A second contention on the part of Newide, that it did not have notice of the transaction between IAL and Dr H. C. Leung is, inthe light of the facts, simply incapable of serious argument. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Dr Vincent Leung admits, (1<sup>st</sup> affidavit, paragraph 75), that IAL applied to the board of GBDL, of which he is the chairman, for approval to register the sharetransfer from Dr H. C. Leung to IAL.  Irrespective of the precise nature of the transaction between IAL and Dr H. C. Leung, wherebyDr H. C. Leungâs GBDL shares were transferred to IAL, in his capacity as chairman of GBDL, Dr Vincent Leung unarguably knew ofthe fact of the transfer.  What is important as far as notice is concerned is the <i>fact</i> of the transfer, not the <i>means</i> by which the transfer was to be effected.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  It is clear that the attempts to register share transfers took place well prior to 27 February 2007, the date upon which Newideand Dr H. C. Leung assert they entered into a contract for the sale of the shares in GBDL.  In all of those circumstances, the assertionby Dr Vincent Leung in paragraph 9 of his 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit that he was not aware that Dr H. C. Leung had transferred his shares to IAL prior to 27 February 2007, is plainly untenable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Dr Vincent Leung is the sole shareholder and director of Newide, a BVI company.  The knowledge he had in his capacity as chairmanof GBDL is not confined that capacity.  He carries that knowledge to his position in Newide, which is vested with that knowledge. In those circumstances there is simply no foundation whatsoever upon which it might be contended that Newide, in entering into acontract purchase Dr H. C. Leungâs shares in GBDL, was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, and unaware of the priortransfer to IAL.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Notwithstanding that that secondary argument is destined to failure, Newide is entitled to defend the action upon the basis thatDr H. C. Leung was arguably able, by virtue of the alleged misrepresentations, to rescind his contract with IAL.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Both defendants have managed to succeed in reaching the low threshold required to establish that they have an arguable defence.</p>    <p class="heading">The application to strike out the counterclaim:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The application to strike out Dr H. C. Leungâs counterclaim, which seeks, first, rescission or cancellation of the transactionin favour of IAL, and second, damages for malicious falsehood, is not now pressed by Mr Jat.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  First, having found there is an arguable case as to misrepresentation, the counterclaim for rescission must be allowed to stand.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Second, Mr Jat acknowledges that the summons to strike out the counterclaim for malicious falsehood was based on a misunderstandingthat the claim was for malicious prosecution.  In the circumstances, with the allegation as to whether or not the representationof dishonesty was made by Dr John Shum and his wife, and whether or not they honestly held that belief, being alive and matters fortrial, the counterclaim, being based upon the assertion that the representation was made, and was not honestly held, must go to trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Accordingly, the application to strike out the counterclaim must fail.</p>    <p class="heading">The conversion issue:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  This is in reality a mere pleading point.  Mr Chan makes the point that the allegation in the Amended Statement of Claim is an allegationof conversion of âtitle to sharesâ.  He refers to the decision of the Court of Final Appeal in <i>China Everbright-IHD Pacific Ltd v Châng Po</i> (2002) 5 HKCFR 630 at 661F, where Millet NPJ said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIt is trite law that converge and must be conversion of corporeal personal property: choses in action cannot be converted: <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> (18<sup>th</sup> Ed).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">âTitle to Sharesâ is a chose in action.  The certificate evidencing the right to title to those shares is, on the other hand,corporeal personal property. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  At the time of the transaction between IAL and Dr H. C. Leung, the share certificate representing the shares in GBDL owned by DrH. C. Leung had been lost.  In order to enable the registration of the transfer application for a new share certificate was madeto GBDL.  Although the board of GBDL refused to issue a new share certificate for the purpose of registering that transfer, it didissue a new share certificate to enable registration of the transfer to Newide.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  It is clearly arguable that if the transaction between IAL and Dr H. C. Leung was not capable of being rescinded, then upon theissue of the new share certificate, Dr H. C. Leung was obliged to hand it to IAL, to enable IAL to register its transaction.  Hisact in handing the share certificate to Newide instead is arguably a conversion of the share certificate.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  A simple amendment to the statement of claim remedies the matter.  The application to strike out the prayer for damages for conversionis accordingly refused.  IAL must make the appropriate amendment.</p>    <p class="heading">Amendment of the Defence and Counterclaim:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  It follows, summary judgement having been refused, that Dr H. C. Leung may have leave to make the amendments in accordance withthe draft filed.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  All questions of costs on each of the applications heard by me will be in the cause.
