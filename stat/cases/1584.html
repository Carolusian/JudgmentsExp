Rent was then tendered for the months of April andMay. Thereafter, the respondent again defaulted in payment of the June rent on due date and when the respondent's cheque for theJune rent was received by the applicant in July, another letter was sent to the respondent reminding him of the warning previouslygiven.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(d)</td>            <td width="94%">                Notwithstanding such further reminder, the respondent still neglected to pay his rent on time.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(e)</td>            <td width="94%">                On the 25th of October, 1983, a notice to quit was served on the respondent terminating his tenancy on the 30th ofNovember, 1983, and the respondent was informed that proceedings would be instituted against him for his eviction under Section 53(2)(d)of the Landlord &amp; Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(f)</td>            <td width="94%">As from the 1st of November, 1983 onwards, the respondent tendered his rent punctually even after the Form 13 application for possessionwas issued in January 1984.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> In the light of my findings, the success or failure of the applicant's claim would depend on whether a warning notice is effectualfor the purposes of Section 53(2)(d) if such notice is given before the contractual tenancy has been terminated. This issue was raisedin the Notice of Opposition and I have had the benefit of hearing submissions on this point.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The contention advanced on behalf of the applicant is that: (a) the warning in writing referred to in the section may be given whilethe contractual tenancy is still subsisting; (b) if after such warning in the tenant continues in default, then immediately upontermination of the contractual period of the tenancy the landlord is entitled to claim possession under Section 53(2)(d) withoutfurther ado because, it is argued, the right to serve a warning notice is not expressed to be conditional upon the contractual tenancybeing first terminated. In substance, as I see it, the contention is that if proceedings are immediately begun on the expiry of thenotice to quit, the door of escape is closed to the tenant who can be subjected to an order for possession without waiting to seeif any default arises after the notice to quit and without any further notice.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> I am unable to regard the proposition put forward as being well-founded. Let me start with basic principles. In the absence of anyprovision in the contract, a landlord has no redress, at Common Law, for any inconvenience, as such, caused by the tenant. If thetenant's behaviour has caused the landlord annoyance of a nature that is actionable, the landlord's remedy lies in tort and not asa consequence of a landlord and tenant relationship. However, when the contractual period of the tenancy is brought to an end, eitherby effluxion of time or on termination by the landlord and the tenant remains in possession, there is a statutory continuation ofthe tenancy. From the date of the statutory continuation of the tenancy, the terms under which the tenancy was originally held becomevaried by the inclusion of terms and conditions which entitle a landlord to possession under Part II. Those terms and conditionsare to be found in Section 53(2). Section 52(1A) makes this intention of the legislature apparent. It is only then - after the contractualtenancy has been terminated - that the provisions of Section 53(2) come into operation. While the contractual tenancy exists, Section53(2) has no application; a landlord is simply left with such rights of forfeiture as he may have at Common Law or under the termsof his contract. In the absence of any covenant by the tenant not to cause any annoyance, inconvenience or disturbance, section 53(2)(d)may be looked upon as if it were a new term of the tenancy which formerly did not exist but which will come into existence when thetenancy continues by virtue of Section 52.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> As the ordinance does not create or give to a landlord any new rights while the contractual tenancy remains alive, it becomes evidentthat the intention of the legislature is that upon section 53(2)(d) coming into operation, it will still not be open to the landlordto invoke it, and his right will still not crystalize until he first serves a warning in writing to the tenant and the inconveniencecontinues after such warning. I read the ordinance as giving to the tenant a right of expectation that when the contractual tenancycomes to an end and he continues in occupation, he will not be liable to an order under that section unless the landlord first serveshim with a warning in writing and he continues with the annoyance, inconvenience or disturbance, as the case may be, after such warning.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> As I see it, the intention of the legislature is that when section 53(2)(d) becomes applicable (which is when the contractual tenancyhas come to an end) the tenant is to be given a chance to make amends before an order for possession can be made against him underthat section; and the proviso makes it clear that the landlord cannot take advantage of the tenant's failure to make amends unlessa sufficient warning in writing is served on the tenant. It follows that the warning must be given after and not before the sectiontakes effect and only if the tenant does not pay heed to the warning can an order for possession be made.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> In view of my ruling that the warning notice to be given pursuant to the section can only take effect when the section comes intooperation, I have no option but to dismiss the applicant's case for failure to give such notice.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" height="45"></td>            <td width="50%" height="45">                <p style="text-align:center">(L.J.
