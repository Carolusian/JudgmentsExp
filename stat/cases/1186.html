The suit concerns a Crown grant of a plot of land, with some houses thereon, situated in Kowloon. The land is part of a lot knownas Kowloon Inland Lot 1088. The Crown had let that lot in 1903 to a person called Sassoon for a term of 75 years from the year 1900with a right of renewal for a further 75 years. Originally the lot was an "island lot" bounded by four streets. There were variousassignments thereafter and about the year 1931 the then tenant assigned three sub lots with the houses upon them to other persons.In 1946 Mr. LAM Kwan the father of the four plaintiffs became the assignee of the four remaining houses to the north of the originallot by virtue of an assignment dated 21st of July 1946 of what was then known as the remaining portion of Inland Lot 1088. At thatdate because of the prior assignment the remaining portion was bounded by only three public streets; Man Ming Lane to the north;Arthur Street on the east and on the west by a public road since named Temple Street. The sourthern boundary of the original lotwas Hi Lung Lane but that had gone with the 1931 assignment. On the 7th of April 1955 by a deed of gift the proprietor LAM Kwan assignedthe plot of land with the four houses to the four plaintiffs. In about the year 1955 the Crown, by its servants, had caused a publiclatrine to be built in Man Ming Lane along the northern border of the remaining portion of Lot 1088. In 1962 the Crown through themediacy of the Legislature of Hong Kong introduced Planning Regulations under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123" class="autolink_findacts">Buildings Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123">Cap. 123</a> certain provisions of which will explain the emphasis thus far laid on the matter of street boundaries. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123F/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation 2(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123F" class="autolink_findacts">Building (Planning) Regulations</a> establishes certain categories of building site in terms which appear as follows:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">Class A site means a site that abuts on one street or on more than one street, not being a Class B site or a Class C site;</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">Class B site means a corner site that abuts on two streets;</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">Class C site means a corner site that abuts on three streets and also means an island site;"</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">The practical importance of this measure consists in the fact that the same regulations establish building specifications for maximumpermitted site coverage and plot ratio in respect of these three kinds of property the most generous figures, from the developer'spoint of view, being allocated to Class C sites and the least generous to Class A (see Regulation 21 and the Schedule to the Regulations).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> In 1976 the plaintiffs were minded to re-develop their site and on the 13th of February 1976 a letter was sent to the Building Authoritynotifying that body of their intention and asking a confirmation of the plaintiffs' estimation of their property as a Class C site.The reply to that letter was in effect the first shot in the present engagement for the Building Authority so far from confirmingthis opinion placed the site in Category A the least advantageous from the re-developers' point of view. For the moment it will sufficeto note that the latrine erected on the northern boundary of the plot was the material determinant of this decision. I will returnpresently to the reasons given for ascribing A Class status to the site but before doing so I will complete this brief account ofthe progress of the dispute and the nature of the claim. No evidence was led by either side but I was given to understand that althoughthe latrine still stood upon the street at the date of the reply by the Building Authority to the plaintiffs' letter of the 13thof February it has since been demolished and removed though whether that was, in the year 1977 or 1978 counsel could not say. Thereason for that removal was that the Crown had granted a lease for 4 years to the Mass Transit Corporation covering certain portionsof land in the vicinity of Inland Lot 1088. These included the area covered by the latrine in Man Ming Lane and that area is presentlybeing used by the Corporation to erect a structure connected with a ventilation shaft to serve that portion of the under ground transportationsystem. The information concerning this is far from clear. Neither side appears to attach much importance to the supplanting of onestructure by the other. I understand however that the new structure will be of a permanent character and will be some 20 ft. highwhen completed and generally, apart from being somewhat taller, that it will constitute an obstruction in the street of comparablealignment and magnitude with the former public convenience.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> After receiving the opinion of the Building Authority various representations were made on behalf of the plaintiffs concerning compensationboth to that authority and to the Mass Transit Corporation. These were based on the alteration of Man Ming Lane firstly by the latrineand then by the workings of the M.T.R. which were regarded as having altered the plot boundaries. When these approaches proved unfruitfulthe plaintiffs commenced the present action. They claim a declaration to the effect that the Crown as landlord has derogated fromthe grant originally made to Sassoon, the benefit of which has passed to them, by erecting the latrine in Man Ming Lane the effectof which has been to re-classify the property in a category which permits of development on a scale which will be economically lessadvantageous than would be the case if, being bounded by three streets instead of two only, the site were to qualify as a Class Csite. They claim damages for this alleged breach of the implied covenant not to derogate. Particulars of the estimate of this damagewere delivered to the other side wherein a potential loss in the region of $1 Â¼ million Hong Kong dollars is suggested. It may besaid that while the Crown does not accept this estimate as to quantum it does not deny that the development of the plot as a ClassC site would yield substantially higher profit to a developer than would the same plot if buildings were restricted to the prescriptionsas to plot ratio and site coverage enjoined upon proprietors in the A Category. Mr. Gittins for the plaintiffs points to provisionsof the Crown Grant which, while reserving certain rights to the Crown, do not include any express reservation in respect of alterationof lot boundaries. He emphasizes also a clause in the lease which obliges the grantee his executors, administrators or assigns beforethe expiration of 24 calendar months of the term granted:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"At his and their own proper costs and charges to erect, build and completely finish fit for use in good substantial workmanlike mannerand with the best materials of their respective kinds one or more good substantial and safe brick or stone messuage or tenement,messuages or tenements, upon some part of the ground hereby demised, with proper fences, walls, sewers, drains and all other usualor necessary appurtenances, and shall and will before the expiration of the said 24 calendar months lay out and expend thereon thesum of $5,500 at the least, which said messuage or tenement, messuages or tenements, shall be of the same rate of building, elevation,character and description, and shall front and range in a uniform manner with the buildings (if any) immediately adjoining in thesame street etc."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Counsel maintains that the citing of the public latrine in Man Ming Lane constituted a clear act of derogation from the title grantedin 1903 to the plaintiffs' predecessor in title but he would maintain that his clients' cause of action did not arise until the receiptby his clients of the letter from the Building Authority proclaiming the category of the site as Class C. His primary argument hasbeen that this notification was in the nature of a mere administrative decision which even now might readily be altered by the BuildingAuthority consenting to re-categorise his clients' property as Class C. His pleadings were thus originally framed and the defencethereto was a simple denial that there had been any wrongful derogation from the grant. At the trial however Mr. Barlow for the Crownsought a late and radical amendment to the defence by adding a plea that the plaintiffs' claim was in any event barred by virtueof the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>. Two other additional pleas of less moment were also put forward. Mr. Gittins proposed an amendment to his original reply at thesame time the principal effect of which was to plead the effect of the siting of the latrine in Man Ming Lane as a continuing breachof covenant. These several amendments were allowed, upon terms, and the argument proceeded without the adducing of evidence otherthan was put forward by way of agreed documents.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> To these various pleas I will return hereafter but before taking up the argument as it was presented I would like to refer to oneaspect of the case which has somewhat puzzled me. I do so with no intention of criticising the labours of counsel who may very wellhave good practical reasons for leaving unexpressed or unexplored the matters to which I am going to refer. Nevertheless, thoughI put it tentatively, I cannot help feeling that more may have been conceded to the defendant than was necessary on points touchingboth the substance of the claim and the principal plea in defence. As to the former the reason given for consigning the plaintiffs'property to Class A viz.: that it had lost its northerly street abutment is in its turn supported by reference to one simple physicalfact - the fact that the distance between the northerly plot boundary and the nearest wall of the latrine (which presumably at thatdate was still in existence) is less than 4.5 metres. This is roughly the equivalent of the figure of 15 feet mentioned in the BuildingAuthority's letter of the 20th of March announcing the classification of the site. The significance of this is that it is providedin <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation 23</a> of the same Planning Regulations that a street less than 4.5 metres (or 15 feet) wide shall be deemed not to be a street. This hasbeen interpreted by the Crown to mean that Man Ming Lane which is indubitably a street to either side of Lot 1088 ceases to be suchwhen it reaches that lot because at that point it is forced to negotiate an obstruction which diminishes what I may perhaps referto as the fair-way by splitting it into two separate channels one of which is, and perhaps both of which are, less than 15 feet wide.I do not doubt that there are practical reasons behind this provision which would be readily apparent to those used to the technicalitiesof building construction and town planning. Nothing very clear was said in court but I think it was suggested that these provisionswere designed to ensure the adequate flow of light and air to such buildings as might be constructed along the street. At all eventsit is a technical matter and one might have expected that a declaration would have been sought to challenge the propriety of theruling given by the Building Authority on the basis of technical advice. It is difficult to believe (if the purpose of the provisionis as I have surmised) that countervailing opinion would be lacking where a multi-storey building far overtopping the low obstructionin the street is in contemplation. On that approach I would have more readily understood Mr. Gittins' contention that the cause ofhis clients' difficulty was something in the nature of an arbitrary administrative act. For on that point there may be a measureof room for differing opinions. Moreover there seems something questionable in the very notion of a street which, as it were, disappearson encountering one end of an obstruction only to reappear once more at the other. The words employed in Regulation 23 are easierto apply where a street, over the whole of its length or over a substantial part of its length is less than 4.5 metres wide. Thealternative possibility that Man Ming Lane has ceased to be a street in its entirety by virtue of the narrowing of a few yards ofits length is scarcely to be considered. However it is not pleaded or argued that the regulations have been misapplied to Man MingLane.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> As to the defence under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, the argument advanced for the plaintiffs moved from the same premiss as that for the defence, in that both sides accept that theCrown's act of derogation (assuming it to exist) persists unchanged to the present time. Now, if one thing is plain on the argumentswhich actually were advanced it is that Mr. Barlow is right to date the alleged derogation (though of course he does not concedeto have been such) from the year 1962. The grantor in this case is the Crown. It differs from the natural person not only as anycorporation differs in being potentially deathless but in having what no ordinary corporation has: the office of Legislature whichobliges the passing of laws binding upon all its subjects. Nevertheless, it is the same person who treats with the private land purchaserand grants him title and who later obliges him, with all other members of the public, to take heed of such general laws as may affectall private landed interests, including those of the kind which passed with the grant. The building of the latrine was of itselfno act of derogation from that grant and could not have become so until the Crown, in its public manifestation, had introduced thelaw which, as seems to be accepted by both sides, cut down the right of user thus confining the grantees within limits of developmentwhich had not previously applied to them. The argument that the act of derogation occurred when the Building Authority notified theplaintiffs of the classification of their site is, to my mind, not sustainable on any view of the facts save the view that the applicationof the regulations is a matter of administrative decision. Certainly, it cannot be sustained if the regulations are considered tohave the effect of reducing the site to Category A. For then there can be no question of an arbitrary administrative act. The publicofficial is, as Mr. Barlow says, merely declaring the effect of the general law. It is not within his power to do otherwise. Whatseems surprising, however, is that it should be considered that the Crown has done but a single act of derogation whether that beviewed as deriving from the building of the latrine or the passing of the regulations or the combination of the two. For plainlythere was an interlude of time in very recent days when the offending latrine no longer encumbered the northern boundary of Man MingLane. The ground beyond the northern boundary of the site was again, and for the first time in 40 years, level and bare. It mattersnot whether at that date the Crown had already engaged to lease that portion of the street to the M.T.R. Corporation or whether thisarrangement came later and about this we have no evidence. The fact is there was an interlude during which the material basis forthe classification of the site had disappeared. I will assume that by then the Crown was committed contractually to the M.T.R. Ifprior to that it had derogated from its grant to the successors in title of the original grantee, by a combination of acts intendedfor the public welfare, it had ceased to do so with the removal of the public convenience. The officers of the Crown who were concernedin the affair then had a choice of leaving the site bare or of erecting something else or permitting something else to be erectedin place of it. It does not appear to me to matter whether they were then aware of the possibility that a claim might be made onthe basis of derogation or whether they were not. It has been said, rightly in my view, that the fact that the plaintiffs were notaware of the effect of or even of the existence of the regulations of 1962 can give them no relief against the running of time. Thecitizen in such matters is said to be presumed to know the law. But the same rule binds the servants of the Crown to a knowledgeof the legal effects of their acts when confronted with a claim of the present kind. If there was any substance in that claim itceased with the removal of the latrine and could only spring up again when something else was put on the highway which, combined with the existing legislation, caused the street inthe vicinity of Lot 1088 once more to disappear. I am not at all sure that there is any structure at the moment at that place inthe street but I was told that the underground portion of the ventilation shaft is complete and that in the end a superstructurewill appear which will, in the eye of the Building Authority, equally attract the restrictive operation of the Planning Regulations.I find it difficult to regard this as anything other than an entirely new user by the Crown of its property adjoining Lot 1088. Ifthat be a proper conclusion then clearly there could be no question of invoking the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> against the plaintiffs. I mention these two points for completeness and because in reflecting upon what was put before me they seemedto obtrude from the common facts insofar as I understood them. It may very well be that there are considerations of a legal, practicalor technical nature of which I am unaware which would disarm such considerations as I have put forward. If that be so then I makeapology to counsel for this divagation. At all events no such point has been taken before me and I must deal with the case as ithas actually been presented, that is to say, on the basis that the regulations have the effect contended for by the Building Authorityand that the present works upon the site of the latrine are a mere continuation of the former obstruction.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> I have in effect already rejected Mr. Gittins' primary contention on the question of limitation. He relies on the principle thattime does not begin to run until there is in existence a person who can sue and another who can be sued and when all the materialeffects have happened which if proved would entitled the plaintiffs to succeed. His clients' cause of action only arose, he says,when they were notified of the classification of their property by the Building Authority. He relied on <u>Welch</u> v. <u>Bank of England</u><sup>(1)</sup> and <u>Barton</u> v. <u>North Staffordshire Railway Co.</u><sup>(2)</sup>. These were cases involving forgeries as a result of which in the one case Bank stock and in the other railway shares were transferredout of the possession of their true owners. On this being discovered more than six years after it occurred the bank in one case andthe company in the other refused to re-register the owners as proprietors of the equivalent amounts of stock or shares. The Statuteof Limitations was pleaded and in each case it was held that the time did not start to run against the plaintiff until the refusalto re-register. In each case the courts held that the damage to the plaintiffs' rights and consequently their cause of action onlyarose when upon the refusal to re-register. But the difference is clear between that kind of case and the circumstances here. Therefusal of the bank and that of the railway company was held to be wrongful. The refusal of the Building Authority to restore theplaintiffs' site to Class C is, provided the factual basis for it is correct, wholly legal and proper. Indeed if the Building Authority'sview of the regulations is correct it would be quite illegal for any officer of the Crown to attempt any such restoration. The injuryto their title of which the plaintiffs complain consists in the inhibition of their capacity to exploit their own property to themaximum degree consonant with its size and other physical characteristics and with the available financial and technological resources.The act of the Crown which so inhibits them is the composite act of erecting the latrine and later legislating in a way which affectedthe plaintiffs' property because of the existence of the latrine. Whether they realised it or not it was upon the date that the regulationscame into force that their right of development was cut down. It is the diminution of that right, if anything, which constitutestheir right in action.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Then it is said that even if the right of action must be held to have arisen in 1962 the breach is a continuing breach of covenantin respect of which time cannot run. But the authority cited for that is no more satisfactory. The case is <u>Spoor</u> v. <u>Green</u><sup>(3)</sup>. For one thing it is not on all fours with the facts of the present case and, insofar as the judgments of the three judges thereinare concerned with breach of covenant, the covenants under consideration are principally those for title and for quiet enjoymentand do not touch the question of derogation from grant. Insofar as the case can be argued to be in pari materia with the presentcase there is, it must be said, some considerable dissonance in the opinions expressed on the questions of breach and of limitationof time for action. There are complications in the facts of the case which need not concern us. Put simply, in relation to theirbearing upon these issues, they went this way: the defendant who was the nominal owner of land held to the benefit of another granteda lease to two persons to work several seams of coal thereunder and to remove the coal. He then conveyed part of this land in feeto another person, Jamieson, who knew of the lease and of its purpose. Jamieson sold part of this land to the plaintiff who was unawareof the lease. At the time when Jamieson bought and entered on the land the coal under that portion of the defendant's original estatehad all been removed. The plaintiff built houses on the part of the land conveyed to him and more than 20 years later the land subsidedand the houses were damaged. The subsidence was due to the old coal excavations. The plaintiff sued on the covenants for title andquiet enjoyment. The plaintiff however wrongly had pleaded that the extraction of the coal had taken place after the conveyance tohim whereas it had taken place even before his grantor had entered on the land. At the time of trial the plaintiff sought to amendand all three judges concurred in the view that this should not at that stage be permitted. As to the breach of covenant they differedgreatly. Cleasby, B. held that there had been no breach of covenant and he said: (page107)</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The plaintiff bought of Jamieson the land and all his right, title, and interest in it; he therefore never purchased any of the coal,but only the land without the coal, and the covenants apply only to what was the subject-matter of purchase, and therefore thereis no breach of covenant for title by reason that the coal had been removed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Although Bramwell, B. concurred in the judgment of Cleasby, B. he nevertheless thought that there had been a breach of covenant fortitle. He said at page 110:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I think there is no variance as to the breach of covenant for title. The breach is that the Defendant had not title when he enteredinto the covenant; the incorrect statement is in the alleged consequence, in the per quod, viz. that Smith and Sharp entered andtook coal while the plaintiff was the owner. This is an allegation of special damage resulting from the breach, which, being untrulystated, the plaintiff could not prove; the breach, however, remains, and is correctly stated."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">He then went on to find that the Statute of Limitations was an answer to that breach and he said (at page 110):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"But assuming the breach to be correctly stated and proved, I am of opinion that the Statute of Limitations is a bar to it. It wascompleted, if it ever existed, at the time the deed was executed. If Jamieson had recovered on it, or released it, no further actionon it could have been maintained by him, nor, consequently, by his assignee. It is not what is called a continuing breach, any morethan not paying money is a continuing breach. The covenant remains broken indeed, but broken once for all."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The third judge, Kelly, C.B. alone, and in dissent from his brothers, thought that, mispleadings of fact apart, the plaintiff wouldhave a cause of action for breach of covenant for good title and that the Statute of Limitations did not apply. Having concurredwith the opinions of the other judges on the question of refusing an amendment to cure the variance between the facts found by thearbitrator and the facts in the case pleaded he went on to say (at page 115):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is unnecessary, therefore, to pronounce an opinion on the chief question in the case; but, as a court of appeal may hold the varianceimmaterial, or may strike out the words which consitute the variance, I think it right to observe that, looking to the case of <u>Bonomi</u> v. <u>Backhouse</u>, in the Exchequer Chamber and the House of Lords, but especially to the judgment pronounced by Willes, J., in the Exchequer Chamber,I think that the true cause of action in this case is the subsidence of the land and the consequent destruction of the houses in1865, and that therefore the Statute of Limitations is no bar; and that such subsidence and its results being caused by acts lawfullydone by the lessees under the lease, which lease was a breach of the covenants by the defendant, he is responsible for the damagedone, and, but for the variance, would be liable for that damage in this action."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">I pause there to note that the covenant he was referring to was the covenant for title. Later he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Finally, if the Statute of Limitations apply at all to covenants for title, the time for limitation does not necessarily begin torun from the making of the covenant, or of a lease which is a breach of the covenant, and that it is no bar as long as the leasecontinues, and any damage, nominal or substantial, is or may be sustained."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Earlier he had said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It was a covenant running with the land, and a continuing covenant, and the breach of it by means of the lease was a continuing breach;"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">It is to be noted that both Cleasby, B. and Bramwell, B. regarded <u>Bonomi</u> v. <u>Backhouse</u><sup>(4)</sup> as having no relevance to the facts before them and Bramwell, B. put the matter this way (page 111):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<u>Bonomi</u> v. <u>Backhouse</u> has, in my judgment, no bearing upon this case. I can claim to be well acquainted with the ratio decidendi of that case in the ExchequerChamber. It was an action of tort. There was neither damnum nor injuria till the plaintiff's land was affected. The excavations werenot tortious at the time they were made, and never would have become so had those who made them prevented their consequences reachingthe plaintiff's land."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Although Mr. Gittins has relied on the case of <i>Bonomi</i> v. <u>Backhouse</u><sup>(4)</sup> as well I am satisfied that it cannot apply in the case of a claim based on breach of covenant when there is no question of a tortiousact causing physical damage to the plaintiffs' property. As to the decision in <u>Spoor</u> v. <u>Green</u><sup>(3)</sup> I would be hesitant indeed to conclude in Mr. Gittins' favour by applying, by way of analogy, a favourable opinion in a minorityjudgment concerning a covenant of a quite different nature. Since however some analogical support for his case can be derived fromthe words of the learned Chief Baron I prefer not to dismiss altogether the possibility that in a clear case of derogation from granta good argument might not be advanced to show that such a breach of covenant ought to be regarded as a continuing breach so as toprevent the running of time. I do not profess to decide that question and although I incline rather to the view that there has notin this case been a continuing breach of covenant yet I confess I would be somewhat regretful to decide upon against the plaintiffsupon the point not only because of the doubt I have earlier expressed concerning the existence of a temporal bar but also because,even if that doubt be not well founded, I would prefer that the Crown should show greater merits in overcoming the claim than areinvolved in a complaint as to time since it may be said that, having so much greater store of it than any subject has, the Crownmay reasonably be thought in most cases to be less disadvantaged than is the subject by its passage. I prefer therefore not to decidethe issue as to time but this is of little benefit to the plaintiffs for in the end it does not seem to me that a good case of derogationhas been shown. The doctrine of derogation, as Mr. Barlow aptly puts it, gives rise to a class of restrictive covenants which operateto prevent a grantor of land from using the adjoining land in ways which impair the use and enjoyment of the land granted by hisgrantee in ways which were within the contemplation of both parties at the time of the grant. That that principle is not restrictedto cases where it can be shown that the act of the grantor has totally frustrated the purpose of the grant by rendering the intendeduser impossible is well established and the courts have consistently followed the principle put by Mr. Justice Parker in <u>Browne</u> v. <u>Flower</u><sup>(5)</sup> in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Thus, if the grant or demise be made for a particular purpose the grantor or lessor comes under the obligation not to use the landretained by him in such a way as to render the land granted or demised unfit or materially less fit for the particular purpose forwhich the grant or demise was made."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Does an act of the Crown which has the effect of making a grant of Crown land materially less profitable to the grantee in using theland for the purpose for which it was granted fall within this principle? I think it does not and the authority which I regard asdecisive on the point is that relied on by Mr. Barlow: the case of <u>O'Cedar. Ltd.</u> v. <u>Slough Trading Co. Ltd.</u><sup>(6)</sup>. The facts are given in the headnote as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Lessees of factory premises for a term of twenty-one years covenanted to pay as additional rent such sums as the lessors might expendin effecting or maintaining the insurance of the demised premises against fire and not to do or suffer anything on the demised premiseswhich would render payable an increased or extra premium for the insurance of the demised premises or other premises adjacent thereto.The lessors covenanted to keep the demised premises insured against fire and that the lessees should have quiet enjoyment of them.Subsequently, the lessors let premises adjacent to the demised premises to another lessee whose trade as a woodworker rendered itimpossible for the insurance of the demised premises to be effected except at considerably increased premiums."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In the course of argument counsel relied upon the suggestion that there had been in this way a derogation from the grant and in dealingwith that matter Mr. Justice Branson said as follows at page 129:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The contention is that the defendants, by doing something on the adjoining land which is not in itself unreasonable or unbusinesslike,which has not affected the demised premises physically in any way, which has not rendered it less easy or less legal to carry onupon them the business for which they were demised, but which has had the effect of adding substantially to the expense of carryingon that business there, have derogated from their grant. I should be extending the application of the principle into a region quitedifferent from that in which it has hitherto been applied if I were to hold that it applied to anything done by a lessor upon adjoiningland which, while not otherwise affecting the demised premises or their user in any way, merely made it more expensive than it wasbefore for the lessee to carry on his business on the demised premises. I do not think such a case comes within that principle atall. It might as well be said that if the defendants had started paying higher wages in the adjoining factories on their land andthereby raised the price of labour in the neighbourhood the plaintiffs would have had an action for damages upon this principle.And many other instances might be cited, for it is difficult to place any limit upon the application of the principle if it extendsto such a case as the present."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">I emphasize the words in that passage "adding substantially to the expense of carrying on that business" for they make it clear thatMr. Justice Branson was not refusing to find a derogation on the grounds that the disimprovement in the plaintiffs' position wasslight or immaterial. It is not suggested in the present case that this site cannot be very extensively and profitably developedbut only that the expected profits from its development may be considerably less than they might otherwise have been had the latrineor the ventilation shaft not been built or the regulations not introduced. I think I must refuse to extend the principle into sucha region as this and, I think, with even more reason than prompted the refusal of Mr. Justice Branson in the <u>O'Cedar Case</u><sup>(6)</sup> since the acts of the grantor which are complained of in the present case were done not out of any motive of private profit, howeverlegitimate that might be, but in pursuance of the Crown's obligation to promote the welfare of the public at large. I must make itplain however that I have based my decision in this case upon that objection solely. I have not dealt with the other arguments advancedagainst the plaintiffs by Mr. Barlow and in the circumstances I am not proposing to do so though it may be proper for me to add thatI would not in any event have thought that they were of such substances as to defeat the plaintiffs' claim. Neither do I proposeto deal with the question of damages. For the reasons given the plaintiffs' claim must be dismissed with costs.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">(A.M.
