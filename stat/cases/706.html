Prior to 1956 he was sole proprietor of a business called the Tai Cheung ConstructionCompany (referred to throughout this trial as "the unlimited company"). The 2nd defendant company which is the successor of the unlimitedcompany was incorporated on 5th November 1956 with an authorised capital of $2,000,000 divided into 10,000 shares of $200 each. Theonly shareholders are the 1st defendant and his wife. He holds 2,400, and his wife holds 100, shares. They have been directors ofthe company since its incorporation, but two employees of his (Woo Chan Sum and Chan Ming Shan) were appointed directors in 1957.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> There is no doubt at all that the 2nd defendant company is entirely under the control of the 1st defendant.

It is commonground that no space has been provided for the parking of vehicles owned by residents of Mirador Mansion. But the Crown is not aparty to these proceedings; and the statement of claim does not raise any issue as to whether the lot has been developed in accordancewith the General and Special conditions.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> When the building was in course of construction the 1st defendant issued a brochure (Ex. Z) the object of which was apparently togive prospective purchasers of shops and flats an idea of what they would be paying for. There is a sketch plan at the end of thisbrochure showing the location of Mirador Mansion and other buildings in the immediate vicinity. Today, of course, the President Hoteloccupies a site on the opposite side of Nathan Road and the Imperial and Ambassador Hotels are nearby. But when Mirador Mansion wasbeing built, these hotels had not been built. A witness called by the defendants (Lo Shung Wing) said that in 1957 there was oldproperty on the sites where the President, Imperial and Ambassador Hotels are now.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The building was completed in 1959; but most of the agreements for sale and purchase of the shops and flats were executed long beforethe building was completed. Shortly before this case began, the records in the Land Registry were examined. The results of this searchwere embodied in a document (Ex. E) which was put in as an agreed document. From a cursory glance at the right hand column of Ex.E, the position as regards sale and purchase agreements appears to be:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="center" width="20%"><u>Year</u></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="40%"><u>No. of 			sale and purchase agreements executed</u></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="20%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="center" width="20%">1957</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="40%">362</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="20%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="center" width="20%">1958</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="40%">277</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="20%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="center" width="20%">1959</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="40%">32</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="20%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="center" width="20%">1960</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="40%">18</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="20%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">I gathered from the evidence that a considerable number of prospective purchasers had no intention of residing in the building. Indeed,the 95th and 143rd defendants frankly admitted that they had each purchased a flat purely as an investment; that they had never livedthere, and that they had, from the beginning, let the flats out to tenants on a monthly basis.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The building consists of a basement and seventeen floors.

It is common ground that theshopping arcade consists of the following:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="20%">Ground floor</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="79%">65 shops</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="20%">First floor</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="79%">74 "</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="20%">Second floor</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="79%">73 "</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="20%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="79%">_________</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="20%">Total:</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="79%">212 shops.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="20%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="79%">========</td>        </tr>    </table>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">There are 36 flats on each of the floors from the 3rd to the 16th floor (14 storeys). The flats bear the numbers A, B, C, D, E, andF. On each of the 14 upper floors there are 15 flats marked A1 to A15; 5 flats marked B1 to B5; 4 flats marked C1 to C4; 4 flatsmarked D1 to D4; 4 flats marked E1 to E4; and 4 flats marked F1 to F4. (Total 36 flats). All flats bearing the same letter are ofapproximately the same size except the D1, E1 and F1 flats which are considerably larger than the other D, E, and F flats. For example,flat D1 on each of the upper floors, appears to be 29' 10" x 36' 5" (approximately, 085 sq. ft.) whereas flat D2 appears to be 14'6" x 36' 5" (approximately 529 sq. ft.). The C flats are smaller than the A and B flats. Whereas the latter are approximately 15'x 46' (690 sq. ft.) the former are approximately 15' x 35' (525 sq. ft.).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> On the ground floor, the shops vary considerably in size. For example, shops Nos. 5 and 6, according to the plan, appear to be oneunit. The floor space of each is 655 sq. ft. and 627 sq. ft. respectively. If the two shops were sold as one unit (as the plan appearsto suggest) the floor space would be 1,382 sq. feet. Shops Nos. 7 to 11 are each approximately 840 sq. feet; shop 30 is 602 sq. feet;shop 35 is 542 sq. feet; shop 47 is 447 sq. feet; shop 52 is 326 sq. feet; shop 53 is 232 sq. feet; shop 51 is 148 sq. feet; shop61 is 50 sq. feet; shop 63 is 20 sq. feet; and as regards shop 65 (if it is a shop and not simply a show case), the plan does notindicate any measurements. Certainly it is a very small unit indeed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The variations on the 1st and 2nd floors are not so marked, but on the 1st floor the shops do vary in size from 562 sq. feet (shop60) to 70 sq. feet (shop 73). A considerable number are in the 220-320 sq. feet bracket. The same is true as regards the 2nd floor.For example, shop 27 is 622 sq. feet; shop 60 is 562 sq. feet; shop 68 is 348 sq. feet; shop 45 is 176 sq. feet; and shop 72 is 50sq. feet.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> On the ground floor there is an area between the escalators and the lifts which is marked "court" on plan 2. According to the evidence,it was originally intended as a garden. The upper floors are arranged round one large central light well.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Ingress and egress to and from the upper floors is by the shopping arcade on the ground floor. There are 4 entrances to this arcade.There are escalators to the first and second floors and lifts to floors Nos. 3 to 16. There are also four staircases from the groundlevel to the roof. One leads to Bristol Avenue from the upper floors. Another leads to Mody Road near Bristol Avenue. Another leadsto Mody Road near Nathan Road; and another leads to Carnarvon Road. There is another stair from the ground floor to the basementon the Carnarvon Road side adjacent to the stair from the upper floors. There stairs were referred to in evidence sometimes as fire-escapesor "escape routes", the latter being a phrase used in a report (Ex. UU) by an architect (C. Haffner) who visited the building onthe 4th and 8th March 1970 and wrote 2 reports on the state of the building (Exs. TT and UU).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> All the agreements for sale and purchase and the subsequent assignments of the units appear to have been executed in the officesof Messrs. Lo and Lo, the 1st defendant's solicitors; and on each occasion this firm acted as solicitors for both parties. No assignmentswere executed in 1959; the first documents of this nature were signed on 24th April 1960. Between that date and 31st December 1960some 515 assignments were executed; and in 1961 143 assignments were executed. One of the assignees in 1960 was a Mr. David AnthonyPaulie and his assignment (Ex. B4 in respect of shop 60 on 2nd floor) was executed on 15th November 1960. It appears from Ex.

In other words if the purchase price of a share of the building was $10,000, theannual premium was fixed at $65. It appears from Ex.W page 21 that the whole building has now been sold by the 1st defendant for$21,691,524; and the total of all sums which assignees have convenanted to pay by way of premium is $141,507.95, that is to say $512.95more than the annual instalment payable to Government by 1st defendant. Of course, under the Conditions of Regrant, the first instalmentof premium was payable on or before 17th September 1957; the second instalment was payable on 25th December 1957; the third instalmentwas payable on 25th December 1958; and the fourth instalment was payable on the 25th December 1959; and so on annually. It is evidentfrom Lowe Bingham &amp; Mathews' audited accounts (Ex.D p.11) that assignees only began to contribute towards the fourth and subsequentinstalments.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> In certain letters (which I shall come to) written by the Chairman of the 1st plaintiff association prior to the commencement ofthese proceedings in 1967, it was being maintained that 12/752 parts of the building were in the name of the 1st defendant. Indeedparagraph 2 of the statement of claim reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"2. The 1st defendant was the registered owner of the whole of the said building, portions of which he sold to the present co-owners,reserving to himself parts of the said building."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In his defence, the 1st defendant pleads (para. 2):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Paragraph 2 of the re-amended statement of claim is denied. The 1st defendant was the owner of the land known and registered in theland office as ......... on what he caused to be built the said building. Since its completion he has sold all the interests in theland and in the said building and those interests which he still holds legally are held in trust for beneficial owners who have purchasedbut as yet not completed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> On the first day of the trial Ex.F was put in evidence by the plaintiffs. This document purported to represent the results of a searchin the Land Office records as at 20th October 1966 and appears to have been put in evidence with a view to proving that the 1st defendanthad "reserved to himself parts of the said building". Mr. Zimmern did not accept the accuracy of this document; and eventually Mr.Bernacchi agreed that the defendants' document (Ex.W) was accurate.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> On the very last day of the trial when Mr. Asome was endeavouring to explain the reliefs claimed by the plaintiffs, he took the opportunityof amending finally paragraph 15 of the statement of claim, which now reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"15 The 1st defendant has always been the registered owner of the units in the said building known as Garage D, and Flat 42 on the12th floor, but in breach of the said Deed of Mutual Covenant has never contributed his share in respect of such units to the paymentof the said premium."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">I do not understand the allegation in the latter part of this paragraph. Clause 4 of the Deed of Mutual Covenant deals with Crownrent, and the Deed makes no reference to the payment of proportion of premium. On the last day of the trial, counsel for the plaintiffsfinally abandoned all allegations and claims in relation to Crown rent and amended the statement of claim accordingly. I shall comeback to the question of premium later. But meantime, I shall examine the plaintiffs' allegation (expressed in different languagein paragraphs 2 and 15) that the 1st defendant is still the owner of "parts of the said building".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Ex. F. was put in evidence before paragraph 15 was finally amended; and in putting this document in evidence it would appear thatthe plaintiffs were endeavouring to prove that:</p>	<blockquote>		Shop 64 (ground floor)<p>Shop 42 (2nd floor)</p>		Flats B.3 and B.4 (8th floor)<p>Flat B.5 (9th floor)</p>		Flat F.2 (12th floor)<p>Flat F.1 (14th floor)</p>		Flat E.3 (15th floor)<p>Flat B.4 (16th floor);</p>	</blockquote>    <p align="left">(which are items (1), (5), (12), (13), (15), (18), (20), and (21) on the above list) had not been assigned by 1st defendant on 20thOctober, 1966. Clearly Ex. W is the result of a search undertaken on a date subsequent to 20th October, 1966 because it purportsto show that all these units have been assigned. The plaintiffs' solicitor produced the memorials relating to the registration ofthe assignments in respect of Shop 64 ground floor, which was assigned together with a portion of the basement marked purple on plan1, to Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. (Ex. HH); Shop 42 2nd floor (Ex. II); flats B.3 and B.4 8th floor (Ex. JJ); flat B.5 9th floor(Ex. KK); flat R1 14th floor (Ex. LL); flat E.3 15th floor (Ex. MM); and flat B.4 16th floor (Ex.NN).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> But throughout the trial, the plaintiffs' contention was that the 1st defendant is still the legal owner of:</p>	<blockquote>		Flat F.2 12th floor;<p>Shop 8 1st floor;</p>		Shop 64 ground floor; and<p>the portion marked purple on plan 1 (basement).</p>	</blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> As regards flat F.2 12th floor, there was an agreement dated 5th September, 1958 for the sale and purchase of this flat (Ex. E. page31). The "name of the assignee" is not given - presumably because no assignment has yet been registered. There was another agreementdated 11th February, 1960 for the sale and purchase of this flat (Ex. B.67). Mr. Stevenson said that no assignment has yet been registeredin respect of this flat; but he agreed with Mr. Zimmern that the absence of any record in the Land Office of an assignment havingbeen registered might mean nothing more than that the prospective assignee has either not called for an assignment or that he hasnot paid the solicitors fees or the stamp duty, or both. Mr. Stevenson agreed that if there was no question of mortgaging or furtherassigning the flat, the prospective assignee might well consider that there was no immediate neccssity to call for an assignment.Of course, he was merely expressing an opinion as an experienced solicitor.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> As regards the assignment (Ex. B.66) in respect of shop 8 1st floor, it is undated and unstamped, and consequently not registeredin the Land Office. Mr. Stevenson was asked by Mr. Zimmern if he could, as an experienced solicitor, express any view as to why anassignment such as Ex. B.66 should not have been registered. His answer was:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I do not know; but my guess is that the stamp duty and the solicitors' costs have not been paid. A deed such as Ex. B.66 is whatis known in Hong Kong as an imprisoned deed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> However, Mr. Bernacchi submitted that Ex. B.66 is a worthless piece of paper in the absence of some evidence either from the 1stdefendant that he had ceased to have any beneficial interest in shop 8, 1st floor, or evidence from the purchaser that he had paidthe purchase price, or that he had entered into possession of the shop and intended to complete.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> I do not agree with this submission. In the light of Mr. Stevenson's evidence, and the fact that, on the face of the document, thereis a receipt by the 1st defendant to the effect that he has received the purchase price, there is prima facie evidence of a bonafide assignment of the shop. The deed was signed in the offices of Lo and Lo; and if the plaintiffs wished to impugn the transaction,it was up to them to call some evidence to this effect.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> Throughout the trial, the plaintiffs referred to the 2nd and 3rd defendants and to Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. as "artificialextensions" of the 1st defendant. The 1st defendant has never denied that he was in a position to control entirely the activitiesof the 2nd defendant company. He and his wife are the only shareholders. They are directors; and the other two directors (Woo ChanSum and Chan Ming Shan) are his employees. He is not a shareholder of the 3rd defendant company; but the shareholders and directorsappear to be his employees. This company was incorporated on 2nd February, 1962 (Ex. B.5 is a copy of their memorandum and Articles).One of the subscribers is one Au Yeung Tak San, who was the Sales Manager of the 2nd defendants. Since 1st May 1954 Lo Shung Winghas been a director of the 3rd defendants; and he said in evidence that he was an employee of the 2nd defendants. Huer Kwok Chaiwas appointed a director on 15th October 1958; and he admitted that he was an accountant, or bookkeeper, employed by the 1st defendantand that he was paid by the 2nd defendants. The authorised capital of the 3rd defendants is $10,000, divided into 1,000 shares of$10 each. On incorporation, Au and one other each took one share, Lo and Huen each hold one share. Only 5 shares have so far beenissued. The submission made on behalf of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants was that whoever eventually takes over the management ofMirador Mansion should take over the 3rd defendant company as well.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> The original, amended, and re-amended statement of claim made no mention of Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. It was after the trialcommenced that paragraph 14A was added. This reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The 1st defendant has sold and assigned on or about the 31st January, 1967 to Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. the premises known asGarage D on the basement of Mirador Mansion together with Shop 64 on the ground floor of the said building, for the total considerationof $20,000. The said Garage D and Shop 64 together comprise a total of 10 units out of a total of 752 units in the said building.Such consideration of $20,000 was an undervalue and the said Wang Yip Construction Co. (Ltd) is another artificial extension of the1st defendant."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> Mr. Zimmern said that he was not going to bother filing a defence in regard to this allegation at such a late stage; but he askedme to take it that the defendants were denying that the shares in this building sold to Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. were soldat an undervalue, and that Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. was an "artificial extension" of the 1st defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. was incorporated on 14th April, 1958, that is to say some 15 months before the occupation permit wasissued. The issued capital is $200,000 divided into 2,000 shares of $100 each. The subscribers were Chan Ming Shan and Woo Chan Sum.They are, and have been since incorporation, the only directors of this company. They are the only shareholders; and each holds 10shares; and, as I have said, they have been directors of the 2nd defendant company since 1967.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> In opening, Mr. Bernacchi cited <u>Jones v. Lipman</u><sup>(1)</sup>. The headnote to the report of this case reads:-</p>    <blockquote>		"By an agreement dated February 27th, 1961, the first defendant agreed to sell for Â£5,250 to the plaintiffs certain freehold land........... Pending completion the first defendant sold and transferred the land to the defendant company for Â£3,000. The company,which had a nominal capital of Â£100, had been acquired by the first defendant and he and a clerk employed by his solicitors werethe only shareholders and directors. This sale was financed by the borrowing by the company of Â£1,564 from a bank whilst the restof the purchase-money remained owing to the first defendant.<p>In an action - - - for specific performance of the agreement of February 27th 1961.</p>		Held: (1) that the defendant company was the creature of the first defendant, a mask to avoid recognition by the eye of equity,and that, accordingly, in those circumstances, a decree of specific performance could not be resisted by a vendor, since by his controlof the limited company, in which the property was vested, he was in a position to cause the contract in question to be completed."</blockquote>    <p align="left">In his judgment, Russell J. at page 835, says:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"- - - - - - - - the first defendant made it plain - - - - - - - - - - - - that the acquisition of the defendant company - - - - -- and the transfer to it of the real property - - - was carried through solely for the purpose of defeating the plaintiff's rightsto specific performance and in order to leave them to claim such damages, if any, as they might establish."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">It is hardly surprising therefore that the learned Judge held (p.836) that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"the defendant company is the creature of the first defendant, a device and a sham, a mask which he holds before his face in an attemptto avoid recognition by the eye of equity."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> But I am not sure how far this case assists the plaintiffs. Mr. Bernacchi's submission was that I should infer from all the circumstancesthat the 1st defendant did his utmost to assign all remaining shares in the building when, in 1967, he realised that proceedingsagainst him were about to be instituted, that is to say that he deliberately planned matters (presumably under legal advice fromLo and Lo) so that he could get the benefit of proviso (b) to sub-section (1) or, if not, the benefit of sub-section (2) of section3 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/297">Cap. 297</a> as read with clause 3 of the Deed of Mutual Covenant. If that is so, then it is surprising that he did not take theprecaution of giving the purchaser of flat F2, 12th floor, an assignment which, according to the plaintiffs, would in effect havebeen in favour of himself, and that he did not ensure that both this assignment and the assignment of shop 8, 1st floor, were registered- if need be by paying the stamp duty and legal expenses. It is said that he is a wealthy man; and this should not have inconveniencedhim to any appreciable extent.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> The facts relating to the constitution of Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. are undoubtedly such as to raise one's suspicions that thiscompany is in fact controlled by the 1st defendant. The only directors and shareholders are the 1st defendants' employees in the2nd defendant company. But unlike the 1st defendant in <u>JONES</u><sup>(1)</sup>, the 1st defendant in this case is neither a shareholder nor a director of Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. He is certainly not ina position to control that company against the wishes of its registered shareholders and directors. The legal consequences of thatdistinction might be illustrated by the following example. Let us suppose that 1st defendant, purporting to act as agent for WangYip Construction Co., Ltd., entered into an agreement for the sale and purchase of shop 64, ground floor, that the purchaser institutedproceedings for specific performance of that agreement, that Wang Yip Construction Co., Ltd. pleaded that they had not authorisedthe 1st defendant to enter into any agreement for the sale and purchase of shop 64, and that the 1st defendant was unable to produceany such authority. Can one imagine any court ordering Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. to complete the agreement for sale and purchase?I venture to suggest that on the evidence which the plaintiffs have chosen to adduce, no court could reasonably do so. The plaintiffshave not called a scrap of evidence to show what sort of activities are being carried on by Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. in thebasement. For all I know, these two employees of the 1st defendant may be carrying on a perfectly bona fide business of their own.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> The plaintiffs' attitude throughout this case has been: "We do not need to call evidence; the facts speak for themselves." The facts,as I know them, are that Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. is the registered owner of 10 shares of Mirador Mansion. The company maywell be an "artificial extension" of the 1st defendant; but how can I say that the 1st defendant has not parted with the legal andbeneficial ownership of the premises in question in the absence of some evidence on the plaintiffs' side to impugn the transaction?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Paragraph 13 of the Statement of Claim reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The first defendant has also sold or otherwise wrongfully disposed of the roof of the said building to the 75th defendant in breachof the said Deed of Mutual Covenant, and in breach of the rights under all the assignments, or agreements to assign, to the saidco-owners whereby the co-owners were entitled to use the said roof in common."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> By Ex.B 68, the 1st defendant assigned to the 75th defendant "four equal undivided seven hundred and fifty second" parts or shares..... in the building and "the exclusive use occupation and enjoyment" of the roof. The consideration was $40,000. The 75th defendantundertook to pay "the annual sum of $260 being the due proportion of the annual instalment of the premium reserved by the said Conditions."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> By Clause 4 of the Deed of Mutual Covenant, the parties to that deed agreed that certain expenses should be shared and paid by theowners "in proportion to the number of units, that is to say shops or flats for the time being owned by such owners and <u>for the purpose of this clause</u> the basement shall be deemed to consist of 36 units."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> Clause 1 of the Deed, as read with the First Schedule, declares that Peninsula Taxi Co. Ltd. owns 4/752 shares in the building andhas exclusive possession of a specified portion of the basement. It is not known how many shares of the building were assigned toChan Pak Yeung and Others; but they were given exclusive use of the 12 basement shops; and from the Land Office Control Card (Ex.QQ)it would appear that the 1st defendant probably assigned 12 shares to Chan Pak Yeung and Others. Similarly, Harilela probably received5 shares and the exclusive use of basement shops Nos. 27A - 31A.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> As I have said Mr. Stevenson's evidence was that from his examination of the Land Office cards, it was evident that the whole ofthe basement had been assigned by the 1st defendant (apart from such portions as the right of way and the area occupied by the liftsand the transformer and switch room). The plaintiffs say that if one looks at Ex. QQ1, it appears that at the date this card wasprepared the assignment to Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. had not been entered up by the Land Office staff; that there are 23 entrieson Ex.QQ, leaving 13 shares unallocated; that the figure 10 appears in the Memorial of the assignment of the portion of the basementmarked purple on plan No. I together with Shop 64 on the ground floor to Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. (Ex.HH); that if one takesone unit for shop 64, this leaves 9 units for the basement portion assigned to this company; 23 plus 9 is 32; and the plaintiffsargue that the 1st defendant has "allocated the remaining 4 units" to the roof (Exs. QQ8 and B68).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> I find this reasoning somewhat difficult to follow. As late as February 1960, the 1st defendant appears to have contemplated dividingthe building into "800 units" (vide the recitals on page 1 of Ex.B67). In fact the purchaser of flat F2 12th floor agreed to purchase"one equal undivided eight hundredth part or share" in the building as a whole (clause 1 of Ex.B67). However, clause 18 of the agreementfor sale and purchase (Ex.B.67) reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The vendor hereby expressly reserves the right to adjust the share of and in the said premises sold to the purchaser in manner followingthat is to say the said premises shall be divided into a number of equal undivided shares such number being equal to the number ofshops and flats in the said building with the addition of 70 shares in respect of the basement and the owner of each shop or flatshall have one such share and the owner or owners of the basement shall together be entitled to 70 such shares provided that suchadjustment shall not affect the purchaser's right to use and enjoy the said flat or shop."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> According to the plans attached to the Deed of Mutual Covenant, there are 716 shops and flats. Therefore in February 1960, the 1stdefendant presumably contemplated dividing the building into 786 undivided parts or shares (716+70). But this plan did not materialize.The Deed divides the building into 752 undivided parts or shares, but the main purpose of the Deed was to accord to each of the signatoriesexclusive possession of a given number of "units" i.e. shops or flats. Furthermore the Deed does not carry out the apparent intentiondisclosed in clause 18 of Ex. B67. The Deed says nothing about the owner of each shop or flat having one undivided share in the buildingas a whole, nor does it say that the "owners of the basement" shall together be entitled to 36 undivided shares in the building asa whole. Clause 4 merely says that for the purpose of sharing certain expenses, the basement shall be "deemed to consist" of 36 units.The Deed does not say that the 1st defendant must divide the basement into any particular number of units of any particular sizein the event of his deciding to assign the exclusive possession of the remainder. Under the Deed, he is given an entirely free handso far as the granting of exclusive possession of the remainder of the basement and the roof is concerned. He was free to give exclusivepossession of portions of varying size of both the basement and the roof. He could not, of course, derogate from his grant by assigningmore than 752 undivided shares in the building as a whole. But, in assigning the exclusive possession of portions, of varying size,of the basement and roof to a number of persons and companies, together with such number of undivided shares in the entire buildingas he thought fit, subject to the total not exceeding 752, the 1st defendant was not in breach of the provisions of the Deed of MutualCovenant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> The Deed of Mutual Covenant is not a very well-drafted document. In the phrase "in proportion to the number of units that is to sayshops or flats - - - - - - owned by such owners" which appears in clause 4, the word "owned" is quite inappropriate. Of course, thedraftsman obviously intended it to mean "of which the assignee has exclusive possession". But throughout this case, the words "unit","part", and "share" have been frequently used as if these words were synonymous. They are not synonymous.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> The point surely is this: although under clause 18 of the agreements for sale and purchase the 1st defendant apparently intendedthat the building should be divided into such number of undivided shares as would accord with the number of shops and flats on the17 floors of the building plus a further number in respect of the basement, and contemplated agreeing with his co-owners that eachshop or flat would be entitled to one undivided share in the whole building and that the owners of the basement would be entitledto 70 (later 36) undivided shares in the building, he never, so far as I can see, gave effect to that intention. The Deed dividedthe building into 752 undivided shares; and although in the First Schedule to the Deed, the number of undivided shares apparentlyassigned to the Peninsula Taxi Co. Ltd., George Zee, Woo Chung Ming and Fung Tze Shing appear to be the number of shops and flatsto which each of these co-signatories was given exclusive possession, there is nothing in the Deed itself to say that one undividedshare in the building would be assigned together with the exclusive possession of each shop or flat; and even assuming that thiscould be inferred so far as the 716 shops or flats on the 17 floors are concerned, the Deed was silent as to how the remaining 36undivided shares should be allocated and as to how the basement or the roof should be divided.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> Mr. Bernacchi argued that it is illegal to assign possession of the roof of a building because the roof must be kept open for thecommon use of all residents in the event of a fire. Mr. Zimmern said that since the Deed of Mutual Covenant was signed, Government(in some way which was not explained to me) has taken steps to prevent developers from assigning possession of the roof to anyone.That may well be so. It may well have been contrary to various statutory provisions to have done so in 1962. But such provisions,if any, were not brought to my attention; and in any event, in these proceedings the allegation (or one of the allegations) in paragraph13 of the statement of claim is that the assignment of the roof in 1962 to the 75th defendant was in breach of the Deed of MutualCovenant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> It is also said that in assigning the roof (Ex.B68) to the 75th defendant the 1st defendant was in breach of his assignment to allother co-owners, including the assignment Ex.B4. It is said that Ex.B68 was in derogation of all previous grants by the 1st defendant.The words of the assignments which are relied upon are:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"- - - - - - hereby assign - - - - - - all rights, rights of way (if any) privileges, easements and appurtenances thereto belongingor appertaining";</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">and the words:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"- - - - - excepting and reserving unto the vendor and the other co-owners for the time being of the said building the right to theexclusive use, occupation and enjoyment of all the other flats, shops and units in the said building."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">It is argued that the intention of the parties to the assignment was that the assignee should have a "privilege" or "right of way"over the roof in the event of a fire; that in any case the 1st defendant could only assign the roof subject to other co-owners' rightof way over the roof, and that Ex.B68 does not do so. It is further argued that the roof is not a shop, a flat, or a unit.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> I do not agree that the words "rights, rights of way - - privileges easements and appurtenances" give the assignee of a share inthe building a right to wander over the roof at any time, whether during a fire or otherwise. I agree that the roof is not a shopor a flat. I also agree that in clause 4 of the Deed the word "units" is used as being synonymous with the words "shops and flats".But in the assignments, the phrase is "shops, flats and units". The word "unit" in the assignment clearly must mean something otherthan a shop or flat; and the only other assignable portions are the basement and the roof.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> The assignments are "subject to - - - - - - the performance of the terms and conditions" in the Conditions of Regrant; but thereis nothing in the Conditions of Regrant which precludes the 1st defendant from assigning exclusive possession of the roof.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> It is a term of the Conditions of Regrant that "adequate space shall be provided - - - - - - for the parking of motor vehicles tothe satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, and any space so provided shall not be used for any other purpose." Clearly, thebasement was the space which the Director approved for the parking of motor vehicles, and if it is the case that any portion of thebasement has been assigned for some other purpose (I was told that Harilela operates a bar) it may well be that there has been abreach of the Conditions of Regrant. Indeed, from the scanty evidence before me, I would have thought that it was obvious that therehad been a breach of special condition (1), yet the plaintiffs have not chosen to take the point. Of course, I can understand Harilela(the 1st named of the 2nd plaintiffs) not wishing to take the point. But it is surprising that some of the other plaintiffs, if theyreside in Mirador Mansion, have not complained that they are unable to park their cars in the basement. But that is not an issuein this case; and the validity of the assignment of a portion of the basement to, say, Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. may not, inthese proceedings, be questioned on that ground.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> As I have said, the Deed of Mutual Covenant did not provide that if the 1st defendant assigned the exclusive use of the basementto one or more assignees he should also give the assignees 36/752 shares in the building as a whole, nor did it provide that anypart of the basement or roof so assigned (or rather if the exclusive use of a part of the basement or roof were assigned,) this wouldnecessitate the assignment of any particular number of shares in the building as a whole to the assignee of that part - whateverthe size of that part might be. In my view, therefore, so far as paragraph 15 of the statement of claim is concerned, there is noevidence which would justify me in coming to the conclusion that the 1st defendant "has reserved to himself parts of the building"or that the transactions relating to Garage D and flat F2 on the 12th floor were not bona fide. There is no evidence to justify theallegation that the 1st defendant "has never contributed his share in respect of such units to the payment of the Government premium."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> As regards paragraph 14A, Mr. Zimmern's comment was: "So what?" I agree. So far as the Deed of Mutual Covenant is concerned, it saysnothing about units being sold at "undervalue" or "overvalue". The 1st defendant was not in breach of the Deed of Mutual Covenantor in breach of the other assignments when he assigned 4/752 undivided shares of the building together with exclusive possessionof the roof to the 75th defendant; nor was he in breach of the Deed or the assignments when he assigned parts of the basement, including9/752 undivided shares together with the use of the part marked purple on Plan 1, to Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this case is the fact that both sides have chosen to call so little evidence. The plaintiffskept harping on about the fact that, in their view, this action is a representative action and that it was therefore not necessarythat all the co-owners should give evidence. But when it came to the alleged "representatives" (i.e. the 2nd plaintiffs) giving evidence,not one of them went into the witness box to prove any of the allegations in the statement of claim. Their main witness was Mr. D.A.Paulie, who is a co-owner and occupier of Mirador Mansion, and Chairman of the 1st plaintiff association. But he is not himself aplaintiff. Apparently, he tried to sue the 1st defendant in 1965 (O.J. 1596 of 1965). The endorsement on the writ appears to havebeen drafted by himself. I cannot believe that it was drafted by any legally-qualified person; and it is hardly surprising that theJudge in Chambers ordered that it be struck out as disclosing no cause of action. It is said by counsel for the plaintiffs that thatis why Mr. Paulie is not a plaintiff in this action, namely that he might have had to face a submission of res judicata.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> Mr. Paulie's evidence was very revealing in a number of respects. He was cross-examined as to why he had not paid the $191.78 which,by his assignment, he had covenanted to pay. Apparently, on 16th December 1965 he paid 3 years arrears of premium; and on 27th February1970 he paid 4 years arrears. Obviously he had been advised by his legal advisers to pay this before the trial of the action commenced.In evidence he said that he had paid it under protest. He also admitted that he had not paid any management fees for the year 1969.In fact the defendants proved that, with the exception of February and March 1966, Mr. Paulie has paid no management fees since 1963.They produced their books to prove this; and the whole tenor of his answers in cross-examination on the subject of his non-paymentof dues was in effect: "Why should I pay management fees when the building is so badly managed?" He also said twice in evidence thatone of his objects in not paying management fees and the proportion of premium due under his assignment was to goad the 1st defendantinto suing him so that he would then have a chance of cross-examining the 1st defendant - presumably about matters completely irrelevantto the question of payment or non-payment of management fees or premium!</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> The plaintiffs seem to have gone to trial hoping that the defendants would be forced to call the 1st defendant and a number of responsibleofficials in the 2nd defendant company, and that, by dint of skilful cross-examination, they would be able to prove their case outof the mouths of the defendants' witnesses.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> The 1st defendant did not choose to oblige the plaintiffs in this regard! Indeed, Mr. Zimmern's opening address was virtually a no-case-to-answersubmission. The defendants did however call three witnesses, namely, the auditor in Lowe, Bingham &amp; Matthews who had examinedthe books of the unlimited company and the books of the 2nd and 3rd defendants, a book-keeper employed by the 1st and 2nd defendantsnamed Huen Kwok Chai, and Mr. Lo Shung Wing, a director of the 3rd defendants and a caretaker of the building. But these witnessescould not really answer many of the questions which Mr. Bernacchi wanted to know. The result was that Mr. Zimmern was, to some extent,justified in his complaint that Mr. Bernacchi's cross-examination of these witnesses was to some extent a "fishing expedition". Itwas. I am not suggesting that Mr. Bernacchi wasted the time of the court or that his questions were irrelevant; but I am not preparedto put anything like as much weight on some of the answers given by these witnesses as Mr. Bernacchi would like.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> For example, the auditor was asked some questions about the basis on which the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants had charged managementfees. The auditor spent many hours re-examining the defendants' books and documents. He produced a memo, the result of his researches(Ex. KKK) which, according to the plaintiff, indicates that the defendants have never charged management fees against all the occupiersof "the 752 units." In 1959, 712 units were so charged; in 1963 the figure seems to have dropped to 688; in 1968, it was 697, 693,699, 695, and 707 at different times during that one year; and the plaintiffs say that this supports their view that the 1st defendantmust have an interest in portions of the building; that the net result was that unit holders (688 in 1963 and so on) were payingmore in management fees than they ought to have done; and furthermore that in going through the motions of assigning properties toa number of assignees such as Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd. and purporting to charge the assignees a proportion of the premium,the 1st defendant was merely transferring money from one pocket to the other.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> It is all very well to argue in this way; but it is up to the plaintiffs to prove their case. It is no good adopting the attitude:"Use your common sense; the facts speak for themselves." Every court must use its common sense; but it may not speculate. It canonly act on evidence.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a> There are 716 shops and flats on the 17 floors (ground floor to the 16 floor). In 1959, 712 units were, according to Ex. KKK, chargedmanagement fees. The fact that the books did not show the receipt of management fees in respect of the remaining units could obviouslybe due to any one of a number of reasons. But, in any event, it appeared to me from the auditor's evidence that he could not havebeen certain from his examination of the books that the figures 712, 688 etc. were not simply the number of units which had in factpaid management fees. There was ample evidence that a very considerable number of unit holders had not paid management fees. Therewas evidence from Huen that the defendants would not pay more than $17.50 per month by way of management fees. This was said in answerto a question in cross-examination. This figure was put to him because the defendants disclosed a document (Ex. "G") which appearsto have been a carefully worked out calculation of monthly expenditure for the month of February 1969 and which indicated that managementfees for that month in respect of the upper floors was $17.50. Not only did Ex. G state the actual number of units of electricityconsumed with reference to the common passageways, etc. during that month, it even made reference to expenditure on a Chinese NewYear bonus to the staff. That, of course, could only have been applicable to February 1969. On the other hand, as a result of cross-examinationof the defence witnesses, who really were not qualified to answer such questions, it was elicited that after 1967 there was a fixedcharge of $17.50 per month for management fees. But this could not have been accurate either because in September 1967, the 3rd defendantssued the occupants of 3 flats on the 10th floor for management fees in respect of various periods during the years 1965 - 1967, allof which were calculated at the rate of $17.50 per month. (Exs. C20, C21, C22) The evidence of Huen was that the occupants of MiradorMansion would not pay a cent more than $17.50 per month, at any rate in recent years, although in the early years management feeswere charged on an ad hoc basis.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> But, if that is so, how does it come about that the actual amount for February 1969 (which includes a Chinese New Year bonus) shouldalso come to $17.50? I am left, to a large extent, in the dark on such matters; and that is due to the manner in which the plaintiffsconducted their case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> In his closing address, Mr. Bernacchi suggested that the defendants' books of account might well be false; that the auditor couldonly speak about what was in those books, not what may, or may not, have been omitted from the books; and he commented that the defendantshad called no witness to say that the entries in the books were accurate and that every transaction had been entered up in the bookswhich the auditor examined.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> I shall come to the evidence of the auditor presently. But I would say here that on several occasions throughout the trial, Mr. Zimmernmade it clear that the defendants' books had been available for inspection for many months prior to the commencement of the trial- indeed. I think he said that he had offered the books for the plaintiffs' inspection; he certainly did so during the trial. Mr.Zimmern submitted, and I think rightly so, that if the plaintiffs had intended to challenge the books of account kept by the defendants,it was up to them to have them re-audited by their own auditors. This was not done. Instead, the plaintiffs appear to imagine, becausethey may have obtained a few answers from witnesses who were not capable of answering the questions put to them, and consequentlya number of points have been left "in the air", that I should now order that the defendants' books of account be re-examined. I donot propose to do any such thing. I shall decide this case on the evidence which the parties have chosen to place before me.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> In their closing addresses, counsel for the defendants had some caustic comments to make on the fact that none of the plaintiffschose to enter the witness box. Mr. Bernacchi also had quite a lot to say about the absence of the 1st defendant. It is not for meto say how I would have conducted the case if I had been in counsel's position. As far as I am concerned, the onus was upon the plaintiffsto prove their case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> The statement of claim alleges that the 1st defendant has over-charged the co-owners as regards proportion of premium. Paragraph14 reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"....................................................... the 1st defendant has since 1957 collected from the 2nd plaintiffs sums inexcess of that demanded by Government for the said premium. The said co-owners are also under a liability to the Crown to pay suchannual premium by privity of estate and by assignment by the 1st defendant of the original contract he had with the Crown relatingto the lease of the said building. By the said Deed of Mutual Covenant and by the said assignment the said co-owners are obligedand obliged only to contribute towards the payment of such premium in the proportion of units or shares to the total 752 units orshares which comprise the whole premises and of which they have exclusive possession. The 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3rd defendants, inbreach of the said Deed of Mutual Covenant, and their respective assignments have since 1957 demanded and collected from the co-ownersrepresented by the 2nd plaintiffs sums in excess of the due proportion and in excess of those demanded by Government for the saidpremium and has retained the balance to their own use and benefit."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> The suggestion in this paragraph that the co-owners are liable to the Crown to pay the annual premium "by privity of estate and byassignment by the 1st defendant of the original contract he had with the Crown" appears to be irrelevant to the issues raised inthis action. The Conditions of Regrant certainly governs the position of the 1st defendant vis-a-vis the Crown; but I am concernedin this case with the position of the 1st defendant vis-a-vis the co-owners of Mirador Mansion, not with the position of the co-ownersof Mirador Mansion vis-a-vis the Crown.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> It is not true that since "1957" the 1st defendant has collected premiums from co-owners of Mirador Mansion. It is now common groundthat the co-owners contributed nothing towards the payment of the first three instalments of premium. Sums were collected from themaccording to the assignments beginning from 1959.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a> It is clear from Exs. M and D that, under the assignments, the 1st defendant should receive annually from the co-owners $141,507.95.His annual obligation to Government for 30 years under the Conditions of Regrant is $140,995. The first figure exceeds the secondto the extent of $512.95. The auditor from Lowe Bingham &amp; Matthews, when giving evidence, commented that, having regard to thesize of Mirador Mansion, this small sum would hardly cover the cost of collecting the premiums from the large number of co-ownersinvolved.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p93" class="pseudopara" id="p93">93.</a> Paragraph 14 is silent as to the mode of calculating the premiums payable by the various assignees. Obviously, when their statementof claim was drafted the plaintiffs did not know the method of calculation viz. $65 per $10,000 of consideration. From letters signedby Mr. Paulie before proceedings were instituted it appears that all he knew from his researches at the Land Office was that no twoco-owners were paying the same amount.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p94" class="pseudopara" id="p94">94.</a> In my view the allegation in paragraph 14 that the premiums collected were in breach of the Deed of Mutual Covenant is just plainnonsense. The Deed (clause 4) deals with Crown rent. It says nothing about premium. The payment of premium is governed by the individualassignments.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p95" class="pseudopara" id="p95">95.</a> The plaintiffs' submission is that the fixed amounts in the assignments are not "the due proportion of the annual instalments ofthe premium reserved by" the Conditions of Regrant; that quite irrespective of the size of the flat or shop, for each 1/752 partor share of the building assigned, the due proportion of premium payable by the assignee should have been calculated simply by dividing$140,995 by 752; that the result would have been that each of the 752 "units" would have been required to pay $187.50 ($140,995 Ã·752) and there would consequently have been no over-collection of $512.95 per annum; that there is no other satisfactory way of calculating"due proportion" of premium; that to calculate it on the basis of selling price is whimsical because market pricesvary; that WangYip Construction Co. Ltd., the assignee of 10 shares in the building, should be paying $1,875 and not $130; and that in paying $191.78,Mr. Paulie is paying $4.28 per annum too much.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p96" class="pseudopara" id="p96">96.</a> If the plaintiffs' submission is correct, Chan Pak Yeung and others who are the assignees of 12 shares in the building with exclusivepossession of 12 basement shops should be paying annually $2250 as their proportion of the premium ($187.50 x 12) instead of $1736.80which is calculated at $65 per $10,000 on a selling price of $267,200. Similarly, the Cordial Co. Ltd. (formerly the 9th defendantagainst whom proceedings have now been discontinued, and who paid only $16,800 for shop 37 on the 1st floor - page 4 of Ex.W) should,according to the plaintiffs, be paying $187.50 per annum instead of $109.20 which they in fact pay in accordance with the "$65 per$10,000 of consideration" method of calculation. The co-owner of shop 73 1st floor pays only $65 per annum. In fact, from a cursoryglance through the pages of Ex.W it is clear that there are 560 shops and flats in Mirador Mansion paying less than $187.50 annuallyby way of proportion of premium. A considerable proportion of the premium is paid by the more expensive shops with a good frontageon the ground floor and the shops and other areas in the basement - with the exception of Wang Yip Construction Co. Ltd.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a> Would the co-owners of these 560 shops and flats approve of this court increasing the amounts which they pay at present to $187.50?It would suit a number of the 2nd plaintiffs. Five of the 2nd plaintiffs pay the following amounts:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="15%"><u>2nd plaintiff</u></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="26%"><u>Name</u></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:left" width="29%" colspan="2"><u>Unit</u></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="28%"><u>Proportion of premium</u></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="15%">1</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="26%">Harilela</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:left" width="29%" colspan="2">Basement shops 27A-31A</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="28%">$1007.50</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="15%">2/3</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="26%">Sitlani</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:left" width="29%" colspan="2">Shop 35 ground floor</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="28%">$884.00</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="15%">6</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="26%">Wong Shoot Yam</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:left" width="13%">Shop 40)</td>            <td valign="middle" style="text-align:left" width="15%" rowspan="2">ground floor</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="28%">$395.00</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="15%"></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="26%"></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:left" width="13%">Shop 45)</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="28%">$691.60</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="15%">12</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="26%">Goddard &amp; Co.

Ltd. But it would certainly not benefit financially the co-owners of 560 shops andflats throughout the entire building.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p99" class="pseudopara" id="p99">99.</a> The assignments do not disclose on their face what premium was payable by the 1st defendant to Government. So, on the face of theassignments, there was no means of checking the fixed amounts said to be the "due proportion" of the premium due to Government. Butthe plaintiffs are not alleging misrepresentation. They do not seek rectification of the assignments nor do they seek to avoid them.They do not deny that they contracted with their eyes open. All Mr. Paulie would say was: "I took the assignment in good faith."The question therefore arises: is it open to these plaintiffs to plead as they have done in paragraph 14?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p100" class="pseudopara" id="p100">100.</a> But first, do the words "being the due proportion" etc. in the assignments add anything to the fact that the assignee has covenantedto pay a specified sum? Assuming for the moment that these words should be given some meaning in these proceedings, having regardto the considerable variations in the size of the shops and flats, it would be surprising if the parties to the assignments intendedthat each assignee should pay 1/752 part of what the 1st defendant was obliged to pay to Government (although that appears to havebeen the intention in regard to the sharing of expenses under clause 4 of the Deed). But if that was the parties' intention it iseven more surprising to find that they have expressed themselves so badly in the assignments. If the intention was that each assigneeshould pay 1/752 part or share of $140.995, why did they not say so, or perhaps say "..... will hereafter pay 1/752nd share of theCrown rent and annual instalment of the premium reserved by the Conditions of Regrant"? Why specify "1/752nd share" in regard torent and "due proportion" in regard to premium? Why a mode of calculation in the one case, and a specific amount in the other? Onthe face of it, one would expect the parties to have intended "due proportion" to mean something other than 1/752nd share of thepremium reserved in the Conditions of Regrant, if this phrase meant anything at all.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p101" class="pseudopara" id="p101">101.</a> There could be said to be two methods of fixing the proportion of premium apart from simply dividing $140,995 by 752: (1) to calculateit according to the size of the unit in respect of which the assignee has exclusive possession; and (2) to make it a fixed proportionof the sale price of the "part" or "share" of the building assigned. The 1st defendant chose the latter method of calculation. Canit be said that he erred in doing so?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p102" class="pseudopara" id="p102">102.</a> At first sight method (1) would appear to be the fairest; but on reconsideration, I do not think it is because the number of squarefeet in a unit is only one factor to be considered when estimating the value to be attached to the exclusive possession of any particularunit. True, market prices vary; but I do not see anything inherently wrong in calculating "due proportion" on the basis of the morevaluable units paying more than the others; and, if that is accepted, market price seems to be as good a guide as any. Consideringthe large proportion of sale and purchase agreements signed in 1957 the developer obviously saw no difficulty in getting rid of theunits and he decided that $65 per $10,000 of consideration would result in his being able to recover the total amount of $140,995when all 752 shares had been sold.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p103" class="pseudopara" id="p103">103.</a> From the figures at page 11 of the auditor's accounts (Ex.D) it would appear that the assignees did not start contributing as fromthe date of the assignments, but in respect of the 4th instalment of the premium and that the amount receivable (although not allreceived) was $141,507.95.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p104" class="pseudopara" id="p104">104.</a> However, Mr. Zimmern's submission was that as none of the plaintiffs have suggested that they were misled in any way, and that rectificationor avoidance of the assignments is not sought, it matters not how the various amounts were described in the assignments; that eachplaintiff covenanted to pay a particular amount annually and that he should be held to his covenant. Mr. Zimmern even went so faras to say that if the 1st defendant had wished to make a profit on the premium, there was nothing to prevent him doing so; and thatthe manner in which the 1st defendant contracted with each individual co-owner has nothing to do with these plaintiffs in this action.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p105" class="pseudopara" id="p105">105.</a> If, in an assignment of an interest in land, the assignee covenants to pay to the assignor annually "$191.78 being the due proportionof" something-or-other, is he covenanting to pay this sum of money or covenanting to pay "the due proportion" of whatever is mentionedin the assignment? Supposing the assignee covenanted to pay "$191.78 being the price of 100 cases of beer" and it was agreed on allsides that $191.78 was the market price of 10 cases of beer. Is it to be said that the covenantor has undertaken to pay the marketprice of 100 cases of beer or the market price of 10 cases of beer or $191.78? In my view, the covenantor has undertaken to pay $191.78.The fact that this amount is said, accurately or inaccurately, to represent the value or share of something or other is quite immaterialto the issues which have been raised in this action which does not involve allegations of misrepresentation and consequently claimsfor rectification or avoidance of the deed. I am entitled to assume, until I have some evidence to the contrary, that in signingthese assignments, the co-owners, including the plaintiffs and Mr. Paulie, understood what they were signing. It was up to them toraise any query on the manner in which the proportion of premium had been calculated when they took their assignments - not 10 yearslater.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p106" class="pseudopara" id="p106">106.</a> I am not prepared to interfere with the method of calculation which the 1st defendant chose to adopt, or to order that any smallexcess in the total amounts receivable should be refunded. I say "receivable" because when one examines the accounts Ex.D (p.11),it is clear that the total of the arrears of premium owing to the 1st defendant by the co-owners of Mirador Mansion as at 31st March1967 was $125,750.51; and by 28th February 1970, this figure had increased to $159,215.75.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p107" class="pseudopara" id="p107">107.</a> The unlimited company and the 2nd defendants were and are construction companies. They have developed 32 sites in Hong Kong and Kowloon(Ex. LLL); and, according to Mr. Lo Shung Wing, the 2nd defendants have managed buildings erected on those 32 sites for short periodsafter construction was completed until such time as the co-owners them selves took over. I have no real evidence as to how thingshave worked out in practice in these other buildings; but Lo said that they have had no trouble in handing over to the co-owners;and, according to him, the only trouble they have ever had has been with the occupants of Mirador Mansion - or, at any rate, withsome of the occupants.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p108" class="pseudopara" id="p108">108.</a> Returning for a moment to the Deed of Mutual Covenant, (Ex.A2), it seems to me that although a document of this nature may be adequatefor a small building of say 3 or 4 floors, it is utterly inadequate for a multi-storey building such as Mirador Mansion. It madeno provision for the appointment of any person or company to manage the building, even on a temporary basis. The 1st defendant wasunder an obligation to the Crown to keep the building (1) in good substantial repair and condition; (2) see that all refuse matterwas properly removed daily and (3) not to use the lot for industrial purposes (General Conditions 6(a) and 7, and Special Condition(b)); and, of course, it was in his own interests to do what was necessary to protect the building until all parts of it had beenassigned. But he was under no legal duty to take over the management as such.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p109" class="pseudopara" id="p109">109.</a> Clause 15 of the Deed is, in my view, utterly inadequate for a large multi-storey building. It provides for the holding of meetingsto decide matters concerning the building which are mentioned in clauses 4, 5, 6 and 7. But who is supposed to take the initiativeand put the machinery of management in motion? And how can a building such as this be managed otherwise than by a paid full-timemanager (be it an individual or company) with an adequate staff and managerial organisation behind him?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p110" class="pseudopara" id="p110">110.</a> No one concerned with the management of the building in its early years gave evidence; but, from such scanty evidence as was placedbefore me, I gather that the 1st defendant, through the 2nd defendants, simply began to manage the building without any sort of mandatefrom the assignees who moved into the building one by one after the issue of the occupation permit in July 1959.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p111" class="pseudopara" id="p111">111.</a> The first known act of management on the part of the 2nd defendants (or rather their predecessors, the unlimited company) appearsto have been the issue of a circular letter dated 1st May 1959 (Ex.B2).

The allegations of fact in the first part of the paragraph are quite extraordinary. No evidence was calledto say what happened in the office of Lo &amp; Lo when any of the assignments were executed. Mr. Paulie did not even tell the court.The schedule to the Deed of Mutual Covenant shall, of course, always indicate that on 28th April 1960 the 1st defendant owned 741shares in Mirador Mansion. But the preposterous suggestion implicit in this paragraph, as read with Faulie's evidence, is that wheneach and every prospective purchaser had left the offices of Lo &amp; Lo, having taken his assignment, he firmly believed that the1st defendant had built this huge building for himself; that he, the assignee of, say, 1/752 part was one of a very small number;and that, as time passed, each assignee said to himself: "I must accept the 1st defendant as manager of this building because heowns practically the whole building, and there is not a hope that we can ever put clause 15 of the Deed of Mutual Covenant into operation;but if I had only known that by the end of 1958 the 1st defendant had entered into 639 sale &amp; purchase agreements, I would neverhave accepted him, or any of his companies, as manager of Mirador Mansion!"</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p115" class="pseudopara" id="p115">115.</a> In all probability, the truth of the matter was that they never gave a thought as to who was going to manage the building, that theynever bothered to read their Deed of Mutual Covenant, and that the first time any of them adverted to the question of what they couldthemselves do about managing the building was when they found that the management was not to their liking. I say 'they' - I haveno idea how many took the view that the management was, and is, unsatisfactory. But there is no question about it: They acquiescedin the 1st or 2nd defendants (and later the 3rd defendants) managing the building, not because they were deceived in any way butsimply because they assumed that, somehow or other, the building would be managed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p116" class="pseudopara" id="p116">116.</a> Thrown into this paragraph under the heading "particulars" is an allegation of mismanagement which, one would have thought, was deservingof a paragraph on its own. After all, as I understood the case by listening to the cross-examination of the witnesses, the main purposeof this action is to force the 1st defendant to spend something in the region of $250,000 in order to put the building back intothe state it was in when it was built in 1959, or at any rate into the state which Mr. Paulie thinks it should be in. I shall dealwith the latter part of paragraph 11 later.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p117" class="pseudopara" id="p117">117.</a> Mr. Paulie was asked in cross-examination why his association (1st plaintiffs) have not invoked clause 15 of the Deed of Mutual Covenantlong ago with a view to taking over the management. He said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We do not want to take over a sick elephant".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In other words, they want an order from this court that the 1st plaintiffs take over the management of the building, but only if the1st defendant is also ordered to spend a great deal of money cleaning it up. However, I have no doubt that the plaintiffs anticipatedthat a question might well be asked why clause 15 had not been invoked by any of the co-owners during the last 10 years. So, clause12 of the statement of claim was drafted. It reads:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote">"12.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="93%" class="quote">The said Deed of Mutual Covenant referred to herein is a Deed executed on the 28th day of April 1960 between, inter alia, the 1stdefendant and some of the co-owners including some of the 2nd plaintiffs and intended to bind, and which did bind, all who were orin future became co-owners of the said building. The plaintiffs will refer to the whole of the contents of the said Deed of MutualCovenant for its true meaning and effect. By clause 15 thereof provisions were laid down for the calling of meetings of co-owners;and for the majority vote to prevail. Despite requests made both in writing and orally the 1st defendant and/or the 2nd defendantsrefused or failed ever to give an up-to-date list of all the co-owners thereby nullifying the operation of the said clause."</td>        </tr>    </table>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p118" class="pseudopara" id="p118">118.</a> The requests "both in writing and orally" presumably included Mr. Paulie's letter dated 14th August 1962 (Ex. B14) to the 2nd defendants.It reads:-</p>    <blockquote>		"I understand that most of the shops and flats have now been sold to various people like myself; and that a good few of the ownersdo not reside in the building. Therefore would it be possible for your good office to let me have an up-to-date list of all the otherco-owners whereby I might be able to contact these people and try to put paragraph 15 of the Deed of Covenant into actual operation.<p>As mentioned in several of my telephone conversations with you, the present management is far from satisfactory and conditions aregetting worse from day to day."</p>	</blockquote>    <p align="left">There was another letter from a Dr. Wong containing a similar request.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p119" class="pseudopara" id="p119">119.</a> Mr. Zimmern described paragraph 12 as irresponsible pleading. In his closing address, Mr. Bernacchi said: "These paragraphs (11 and12) have caused me some difficulty." I am not surprised. How can it be argued that the failure of the defendants to supply a listof co-owners" nullified the operation" of clause 15? The defendants were under no obligation to supply a list of co-owners. The locallaw, such as it was, lay in clause 15; it was there to be invoked by the co-owners. It was up to the co-owners to set up a machineryfor taking over the management of the building at once, certainly as soon as they regarded the defendants' efforts as inadequate.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p120" class="pseudopara" id="p120">120.</a> Paragraphs 5, 20 and 21 of the statement of claim refer to the 4th and 5th defendants in addition to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants.Paragraphs 20 and 21 read:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote">"20.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="93%" class="quote">The 4th defendants are a firm of cleaning contractors who were purportedly appointed by the 1st defendant and/or the 2nd defendantsand/or the 3rd defendants to clean and care for the water pumps of the said building for which privilege the sum of $12000 was paidover to the 1st defendants and/or the 2nd and/or the 3rd defendants by the 5th defendants on his own behalf and on behalf of the4th defendants.

The shute was never used by the contractors. In 1960 the managers of thebuilding were the Tai Cheung Construction Co. I became aware of that directly I moved in in 1960.

From the Business Registration Certificate (Ex. C2) it wouldappear that there are 6 partners. The first name on the list is Chan Shui Tong; and Paulie's evidence that Chan Shui Tong and ChanKin are one and the same person was not challenged. It would appear from Ex. C2 that the firm commenced business on 1st January 1961.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p123" class="pseudopara" id="p123">123.</a> The receipts (Exs. P and Q are examples) issued by Chan Kin bore the name Tai Cheung Co. (not Cheong). But it is common ground thatit is the same firm. Each of the co-owners (or the tenants of the co-owners) paid $8 per month. The receipts state "Charging forcleaning. Charging for caring water pump. Total $8". It appears from Mr. Paulie's evidence and from the receipts that this $8 wasin respect of the "disposal of garbage from all floors ....... and the cleaning of all parts of the building in common use" and atleast "........ maintaining ........... the ............ electric pumps for supplying water to the flush system ........." (sub-clauses(d) and (e) of clause 4 of the Deed of Mutual Covenant). I have no reason to think that it covered "the keeping in good and tenantablerepair of the ....................... staircases landings and passages (except as regards damage caused or resulted from any actor default or negligence by any of the parties hereto or for which any of them is responsible)" which is sub-clause (b) of clause4 of the Deed. Presumably this latter item was the responsibility of the co-owners who regarded the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants astheir "agent". At least that is the allegation in paragraph 11 of the statement of claim.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p124" class="pseudopara" id="p124">124.</a> Until the very end of the trial the plaintiffs' attitude in regard to Chan Kin's position seemed doubtful. Mr. Bernacchi, in hisclosing address, submitted that, if it could be said that the co-owners acquiesced in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants managing thebuilding "as their agent", then it was not open to these defendants to "delegate" their duties under clause 4 to others. However,in his closing submission in connection with the relief sought, Mr. Asome said that the plaintiffs asked this court to regard ChanKin and his company (4th defendants) as sub-contractors of the 1st and/or 2nd defendants.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p125" class="pseudopara" id="p125">125.</a> It seemed to me during the examination of Mr. Paulie it was expected that he would, or might, say that, for a long time, he regardedTai Cheung Co. and Tai Cheung Construction Co. as one and the same. It was perfectly clear to me that Paulie was under no such illusion;and there is not a scrap of evidence that in paying Tai Cheung Co. $8 per month for cleaning the common parts, maintaining the waterpump and removing the garbage, any of the other co-owners or occupiers imagined that their money was going into the pockets of the1st, 2nd or 3rd defendants.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p126" class="pseudopara" id="p126">126.</a> Paulie appears to have moved into the building in February 1960. His evidence that Chan Kin was at that time already the cleaningcontractor was not challenged; and, as so often happens in these courts, very little weight can be placed on the details enteredup on Business Registration Certificates. That being so, it appears that the co-owners have dealt direct with Chan Kin for the last10 years. It may have been the 1st defendant who put the cleaning contract in Chan Kin's way, or "appointed" him as the pleadingssay; but that "appointment" was ratified over and over again by the fact that the co-owners continued to deal direct with him. Fromthe scanty evidence adduced, it seems to me that Chan Kin was regarded by the co-owners and by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants asan independent contractor so far as concerns the matters set out in sub-clause (d) and part of sub-clause (f) of clause 4 of theDeed of Mutual Covenant. "The implied contract" referred to in paragraph 21 of the statement of claim was between the co-owners andChan Kin, not between the co-owners and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants. Whatever may be the 1st defendant's position vis-a-vis theCrown under condition 6(a) of the Conditions of Regrant, he had no responsibilities to the other co-owners in regard to the matterscovered by sub-clause (d) and part of sub-clause (f) of the Deed. If the plaintiffs felt (quite erroneously) that Chan Kin's contractcould be rescinded by the institution of this action (paragraph 21), why did they not terminate his services long ago by giving hima month's notice? Why didn't they appoint someone else to do the cleaning after deciding upon what to do at a properly convened meeting?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p127" class="pseudopara" id="p127">127.</a> At this stage I wish to refer to another matter relating to paragraph 20 of the statement of claim. Mr. Paulie gave evidence abouta conversation which he said he had had with Dr. C.C. Wong and Chan Kin in 1965. (At that time this Dr. Wong, apparently, lived inFlat A15 on the 15th floor and owned shop 46 on the 1st floor). Mr. Paulie said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(They) called at my office about 11 or 12 noon on 13th June 1965. During the course of conversation Chan Kin informed Dr. Wong andI that he had paid $12,000 to a Mr. Cheung who was headmaster of Wellington College to be given to Mr. Chan Tak Tai as a gratuityfor obtaining the cleaning contract in the building."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">He said Chan Kin spoke in Cantonese; and Mr. Paulie was asked to repeat what Chan Kin said in Cantonese. He did so; and the CourtInterpreter translated his words as:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I have paid to a Mr. Cheung $12,000 for him to pay to Chan Tak Tai. I have paid him this money because he wanted this money for givingme the contract for cleaning."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Mr. Paulie said that Dr. Wong was now in Sydney; that he had "suddenly" sold his shop and his flat in Mirador Mansion and had leftHongkong in December 1968.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p128" class="pseudopara" id="p128">128.</a> When Mr. Paulie had finished giving evidence, counsel for the plaintiffs applied for an affidavit dated 5th December 1968 by Dr.Wong to be admitted in evidence. In this affidavit Dr. Wong said that he had sold his flat on 7th August 1968; that he had disposedof his shop and flat because "I intend very shortly to leave Hong Kong permanently." He then referred to the alleged conversationwith Mr. Paulie thus:-</p>    <blockquote>		"10. During the course of the said discussion the said Chan Kin stated to the said Dave Paulie and me that he had paid the sumof $12,000 to Chan Tak Tai ...... as a bribe for the purpose of obtaining from the said Chan Tak Tai the cleaning contract of .....Mirador Mansion for his said firm Tai Cheung Company .....<p>11. I remember hearing the said Chan Kin make some remark to the effect that as a result of the said payment the said Tai Cheung Companywas financially embarrassed and had insufficient money left for carrying out properly its cleaning contract.</p>		12. The re-amended statement of claim has been shown to me and I would have been able to give evidence on a number of the allegationscontained therein ......"</blockquote>    <p align="left">The application was made under Order 38 rule 2(1); and it was strongly opposed by Mr. Zimmern not so much because of the contentsof the affidavit but because, as he said, to admit an affidavit in such circumstances would be to create a dangerous precedent.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p129" class="pseudopara" id="p129">129.</a> I admitted the affidavit (Ex. VV); but I place no weight on it at all. I informed counsel of this during the trial; and my only reasonfor admitting it was to enable me to say why I think such documents should not be admitted in evidence in circumstances of this kind.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p130" class="pseudopara" id="p130">130.</a> Firstly, the affidavit itself, on its face, is calculated to arouse suspicion. The statement of claim was not "re-amended" untilafter the date on which the affidavit was sworn. Secondly, why was no application made for the evidence of Dr. Wong to be taken debene esse? There is no affidavit by any of the plaintiffs' solicitors (and they have employed several from time to time) that Dr.Wong left Hongkong in such a hurry that they had no time to make such an application. Thirdly, if a witness has left the jurisdictionand a party intends to place reliance upon his evidence on matters which are to be contested and the party regards the evidence asof importance, it is that party's duty to take steps to have the evidence taken on commission.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p131" class="pseudopara" id="p131">131.</a> But the matter does not end there. The existence of this affidavit was known to the plaintiffs' legal advisers as from the date whenit was sworn, and, presumably, it was intended from the beginning that an application for its admission in evidence would be made.No mention was made of it to the 1st defendant's legal advisers upon the Summons for Directions. Indeed, neither Mr. Zimmern northe court knew anything about the affidavit until after the trial of the action had commenced.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p132" class="pseudopara" id="p132">132.</a> Why should Chan Kin come to see Paulie at all? Paulie gave no reason for the visit. If Chan Kin did tell Paulie and Wong this storyabout being "financially embarrassed" it was probably because Wong and Paulie had been complaining to him about the fact that hewas not keeping the common passages clean, and Chan Kin might have thought that this was as good a story as any in order to pacifyPaulie and Wong. But I simply do not know. I have not seen Chan Kin or Wong; and I have no chance of probing the whole matter.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p133" class="pseudopara" id="p133">133.</a> There is no doubt at all that the 1st defendant received $12,000 from the 5th defendant (Chan Kin). But I place no reliance whatsoeveron Dr. Wong's allegation that Chan Kin paid $12,000 "as a bribe", or on his allegation that the payment of this sum resulted in TaiCheung Co. being "financially embarrassed" with the result that they could not clean Mirador Mansion properly. The latter allegationis double-hearsay and not admissible against 1st defendant; and in any case 1st defendant has been deprived of his opportunity ofcross-examining Dr. Wong and Chan Kin in regard to both allegations. Any future application to admit an affidavit in circumstanceswhich in any way resemble the circumstances disclosed in this case will get short shrift by this court.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p134" class="pseudopara" id="p134">134.</a> Clearly the 1st defendant did not accept the $12,000 as a co-owner. The most reasonable inference is that, as manager of the building,he knew that the building had to be cleaned, and he put the cleaning contract in the way of Chan Kin and charged him $12,000 forso doing. The defendants entered the payment in their books of account and used the money on general expenditure in the building.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p135" class="pseudopara" id="p135">135.</a> I shall deal later with the plaintiffs' allegations in paragraph 21 that the 4th defendants did not keep the building clean and havekept it "in a very poor condition" together with their allegations in paragraph 11 that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants "have notkept the building in good order and the plaintiffs, including the co-owners, suffered damage".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p136" class="pseudopara" id="p136">136.</a> I shall now summarise the evidence relating to what was referred to throughout this case as "the illegal shops and stalls". Thesestructures are shown on plans 2, 3 and 4 attached to Ex. A.4 (which was put in evidence as an additional copy of the Deed of MutualCovenant). It is necessary to set out the evidence in some detail because no person has come forward to say that he was obstructedor inconvenienced in any way by the presence of these structures; and it is necessary to have a clear mental picture of their sizeand location.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p137" class="pseudopara" id="p137">137.</a> A summary of Mr. Paulie's evidence relating to these structures and that of an architect (Christopher Haffner) who visited the buildingon 4th and 8th March 1970 and subsequently made two reports (Exs. TT and UU) is as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>		<u>Polly's Co. Emporium</u>: This is defendant No. 178 in the statement of claim. Mr. Paulie said that this firm is now in occupation of the space by the sideof the escalator on the ground floor, and that at the commencement of the action the occupiers were Peter's Gift Shop (defendantNo.60).<p>The dimensions of Polly's as given in Mr. Haffner's report is 6'6" x 15'10" (102.90 sq. ft.). I gathered from Mr. Paulie that he particularlydisliked this firm because, being a tailor's shop, prospective customers who had been referred to him mistook the name "Polly" for"Paulie".</p>		<u>Hong Kong Gift Centre</u>: This is the 61st defendant. The firm is registered under the Business Registration Regulations (Ex. C.3) It commenced business inAugust 1964. Mr. Haffner's report on this shop reads:-<blockquote>			<p class="quote">"(Under the escalator, next to 62) 20'3" x 5' plus display in arcade abutting 62 (4' x 1'6") and 4' x 8" (total 109.89 sq. ft.). Inaddition Hong Kong Gift Centre occupy an area next to the stairs adjoining 62 during the day of 13'9" x 5' (68.75 sq. ft.) accordingto Mr. Paulie. Hong Kong Gift Centre also occupy shop 61. This is shown on plan as 7'8" x 7' (53.62 sq. ft.) but the actual areameasures 9'7" x 10' (95.83 sq. ft.)."</p>		</blockquote>		Mr. Paulie's evidence was that the Hong Kong Gift Centre was the "legal owner" of Shops 61 and 62; and that by their "illegal"extension and that by the presence of Polly's, the passageway by the side of the escalator is completely blocked.<p>		<u>(China Leatherware Co</u>. This is defendant No. 62</p>		(<u>Pui Kee</u>: This is defendant No. 63. The firm Pui Kee was registered as a business (Ex. C.4) in July 1963. Mr. Haffner's report reads:-<blockquote>			<p class="quote">"Toho Co. and Pui Kee (in light well) Note Pui Kee still has old notice 'China Leather'. Two companies are measured together becausethe division between them is not clear. 16' x 9'7" plus 10'8" x 19'11". (365.83 sq. ft.)"</p>		</blockquote>		Mr. Paulie said that China Leatherware had now vacated and that the shop was occupied by a tailor's shop named Toho Co. Pui Keealso appears to have a show case beside the lift near to shop No. 63. Mr. Haffner's measurements are 8'9" x 11" (8.05 sq. ft.)<p>		<u>Wong Kwok Kwan trading as Wing Fung</u>: This is defendant No.64. This is beside the lifts near shop No.51. It was registered as a business in January 1961 (Ex. C.5). Itis said to measure 6'1" x 10 1/2. It is described by Mr. Paulie as "a wall shop". I would have thought 10 1/2 merited the descriptionshow case rather than shop.</p>		<u>Pak Kee</u>: This is defendant No. 65. The measurements given by Mr. Haffner are: 1'8" x 15'5" (25.75 sq. ft.). On plan 2 it appears to be nextto the lifts between shops Nos. 61 and 32. Whether the measurement 1'8" merits the description "shop" is, I should have thought,doubtful.<p>		<u>Luxury Co.</u>: This Company is not a defendant. My note of Mr. Paulie's evidence reads:-</p>		<blockquote>			<p class="quote">"Prior to the action there was an electrical shop occupying a small area. We did not put them in the writ. Since the action commenced,this space is now occupied by Luxury Co. and Fortuna Co."</p>		</blockquote>		It appears to adjoin Shop No.26. Mr. Haffner's measurements are 13'2" x 3' (39.54 sq. ft.).<p>		<u>Mansion Office</u>: According to Mr. Paulie, this area (part of the 'Court') is occupied by the 3rd defendants as an office. Mr. Haffner's measurementsare 14'1" x 5'5" (76.31 sq. ft.). Speaking of the encroachment of the Hong Kong Gift Centre, paragraphs 10 and 11 of Mr. Haffner'sreport (Ex. UU) reads:</p>		<blockquote>			&quot;It should be noted that this last example is not exceptional, and that the majority of shops in the ground floor arcadeshave encroached about 1'6" into what is probably the original width of the arcade. This can only be assessed by column lines andby floor pattern.<p>Commercially, therefore, a shop which occupies only the area assigned to it is prejudiced by others who cover over part of the adjoiningshop by projections and by displaying goods in arcades. Even more so, a shop which bought a space with a good view could find itselfblocked by completely unexpected shops.</p>			<u>Ground floor light well</u>: The filling in of the light well with shops make ventilation of the arcade far worse, and makes them less attractive for shoppers.<p>The area of light well left over was inspected. It is full of old furniture, rubbish, and air-conditioning plant. Most of the ventilationopenings which do remain have been blocked off"</p>		</blockquote>	</blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p138" class="pseudopara" id="p138">138.</a> Paragraph 3 of Mr. Haffner's report (Ex.

Accordingto plans given me by Mr. Paulie, this is the only escape route from this part of the basement except for two ramps for vehicles almostat the opposite side of the building."</p>    	</blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p139" class="pseudopara" id="p139">139.</a> Mr. Haffner speaks of the possibility of the grilles on the escape routes being locked. Mr. Paulie said that several months ago theiron grilles were locked. On othe other hand, there was evidence that although these grilles may well have been closed years ago,they have not been used recently - at any rate during the last few months; and that, although there are boards put up at night atthe entrance to one of the staircases, there is always someone sleeping there who is in a position to open the boards whenever necessary.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p140" class="pseudopara" id="p140">140.</a> Mr. Paulie's evidence continued thus:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="left"><u>Mirador Electrical Co</u>.</p>        <p align="left">This is defendant No. 66. The firm was registered as a business (Ex.C6) in April 1963. It is referred to above in paragraph 3(a) ofMr. Haffner's report. The architect also gives the dimensions of it as follows:-</p>        "3'1" x 10'4" (31.82 sq. ft.) plus display 4" x 10'4" (3.41 sq. ft.)<p>This does not include wooden shutters blocking landing."</p>        <p align="left">One night in October 1965 between 9 to 10.30 p.m., Mr. Paulie took a number of photographs of the building.

According to Mr. Paulie, the proprietor (Fan Kar Fan) was evicted by the 3rd defendantsfor non-payment of rent!

Save aforepleadedeach .............. allegation ........... is denied."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The admission is that the occupants of these structures are licencees. The plans together with Mr. Haffner's report indicate theirlocation. There was no evidence as to which "two instances" the 3rd defendants are referring in regard to areas for access and egress.They are probably referring to Polly's and the Hong Kong Gift Centre (plan 2) i.e. the passageway adjoining the escalators on theground floor.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p156" class="pseudopara" id="p156">156.</a> As regards the allegation in the latter part of paragraph 10 of the defence, it will be seen presently from Ex.D that it is the casethat all licence fees collected (or rentals as they are called by the auditor) are accounted for in the defendants' books and havebeen utilised for purposes of management. However, the 3rd defendants were incorporated on 2nd February 1962; and Ex.D indicatesthat a certain amount of rental income was received in respect of the years ending March 1960 and March 1961. Therefore it is notstrictly true to say that "the 3rd defendants granted the licences". But I do not think anything turns on that. During the trial,counsel for the 1st defendant made it perfectly clear that the 2nd and 3rd defendants were under his control.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p157" class="pseudopara" id="p157">157.</a> The defendants' witness Huen Kwok Chai said in evidence that he collected the following "rent" from the "illegal shops and stalls":-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="48%"><u>Unit</u></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="50%" colspan="2"><u>Rent for month</u></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="48%">Mirador Electrical</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="15%">$ 165</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="35%">(def.

No.68) or Kowloon Curio Bazaar (def. No.67) and thatthe 3rd defendants were in no way responsible for the presence of these stalls or show cases; but he did not know the position asregards the 1st and 2nd defendants. He also said that no rent was collected from Luxury Co.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p158" class="pseudopara" id="p158">158.</a> In opening his case, Mr. Bernacchi referred to clauses 1, 10 and 11 of the Deed of Mutual Covenant and submitted that the licencingor renting of these shops on the passageways near lifts and escalators was a clear breach of clauses 10 and 11. I do not read clauses10 and 11 in that way. Clause 10 says that each party may make additions and improvements "in his own part". Clause 11(a) is a covenantby each party not to make any structural alterations in "his part" which may damage the other "parts" or cause inconvenience to theother occupiers. Clause 11(b) is a further covenant by each party not to do anything which is likely to increase the insurance premiumson the "building" and so on. Clause 11(c) is a further covenant.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"not to use his part of the said building for any illegal unlawful or immoral purposes nor do or permit anything therein or thereuponwhich may create unnecessary noise or may be or become a nuisance annoyance or inconvenience to the other occupiers of the said building."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The word "part" in these clauses obviously has the same meaning as in clause 1; and the parts set out in the second schedule oppositethe name of each party are, with the exception of the basement and the roof, specified shops and flats - not common passages. Inother words clauses 10, 11(a) and 11(c) refer to what each party may, and may not, do in relation to the shops or flats of whichhe has exclusive possession. True, clause 11(b) refers to activities which may affect the building as a whole in the matter of insurance.But clauses 10, 11(a) and 11(c) do not appear to apply to common passageways. The Deed of Mutual Covenant did not give the 1st defendantexclusive possession of the common passageways. From the moment when he assigned 4/752 shares of the whole building to the PeninsulaTaxi Co. Ltd. on 28th April 1960, he owned 648/752 shares in the whole building, until, of course, he assigned more shares to subsequentassignees. At no time did the 1st defendant assign shares in the whole building to the occupiers of the "illegal structures". But,in licensing them, he has, of course, given them exclusive possession of portions of the common passageways.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p159" class="pseudopara" id="p159">159.</a> I would have thought that clause 2 was more relevant to the question of the licensing of the illegal structures on the common passageways.This clause reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Each of the parties hereto shall have the right in common with the others of the parties hereto and all others having the like rightto use for the purpose of access to and egress from the part of the building so alloted to each of them the entrances hall, lifts,staircases and landings in the said building and such of the passages therein as are not included in any part of the said buildingallotted to any party."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">So far as I can see, no passages are included in any part of the building allotted to any party under clause 1 and the second schedule.If there has been a breach of the Deed of Mutual Covenant, so far as the licencing of these "illegal" structures is concerned, Iwould have thought that it was because the right of access and egress to and from the "parts" allotted to the co-owners, by the useof the common passages, has been impaired or restricted. Furthermore, in each assignment the 1st defendant assigned "all rights,rights of way" etc. and the premises in each case are assignment "subject to the covenants terms and conditions on the part of thevendor in the said Deed of Covenant"; and one of the "terms" of that Deed is clause 2.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p160" class="pseudopara" id="p160">160.</a> At one stage of the case, Mr. Zimmern made a submission in law which I regarded as referring to the licencing of the "illegal shopsand stalls"; but, from his closing address, I gathered that it related only to the "illegal workshops", which I shall deal with presently(defendants Nos. 76-177). But, in case I misunderstood counsel and that his submission refers to both aspects of the case, I shallrecord it here and deal with it so far as it relates to the "illegal shops and stalls".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p161" class="pseudopara" id="p161">161.</a> Mr. Zimmern's submission was this: The system of conveyancing in Hongkong is (and always has been) such that the developer is neverleft with the common parts of a multi-storey building; a developer does not sell, or assign flats in the building but a certain numberof parts in an undivided whole together with exclusive possession of a certain portion of the building; that the moment a developersigns the Deed of Mutual Covenant and the first assignment (even though he may only assign 1/752 part or share of the whole) thedeveloper is in no better position, qua owner, than the assignee of that one part or share; the assignee holds one undivided shareof the whole building, he has exclusive possession of a given portion; and his only right to the passageways and other common partsis for the purpose of giving him ingress and egress to and from the portion over which he has exclusive possession (flat, shop orwhatever portion it happens to be); that when a developer has assigned one share of the whole, his rights and liabilities are identicalto those of the assignee and all those who take under him are in the same position; that so long as he remains owner of a share orinterest in the building the developer takes the benefits and shares the liabilities under the Deed of Mutual Covenant; but the momenthe has sold his last share in the building, his liability under the Deed ceases in view of clause 3 of the Deed as read with section3 of the Law of Property (Enforcement of Covenants) Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/297">Cap.297</a>; that by 1967 the 1st defendant had sold all shares in theMirador Mansion and all assignments had been completed except two; that one of them (Ex. B66) was executed but unstamped; that ifthe 1st defendant received the purchase price, his position, qua owner, at the time of the issue of the writ in April 1967 was thatof a bare trustee for the purchasers; that there is nothing before the court to suggest that the beneficial interest in shop 8 1stfloor (Ex. B66) and flat F2 12th floor (Ex. B67 has not passed to the purchasers; that, on the evidence, the probabilities are thatone of these purchasers could get his assignment by calling for it; and, as regards the other, the assignment which he has in factexecuted could be registered by his paying the stamp duty and solicitors fees.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p162" class="pseudopara" id="p162">162.</a> True, upon executing the Deed of Mutual Covenant the developer, vis-a-vis his co-owners, is in no different position from any otherco-owner, that is to say so far as the benefits and liabilities under the Deed are concerned. But I do not understand how this couldlet the 1st defendant "off the hook" so far as the licensing of the "illegal shops and stalls" is concerned because all such licensingwas done at a time when the 1st defendant was undoubtedly a co-owner. He was also an "owner" as defined in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/297">Cap.297</a> in that his nameappeared in Land Office records as such. Indeed it still does as regards 2/752 shares of Mirador Mansion. Therefore there would,in any case, be no question of his getting any benefit from proviso (b) to section 3(1) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/297">Cap.297</a>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p163" class="pseudopara" id="p163">163.</a> Sub-section (2) of section 3 makes it clear that the Ordinance was not intended to nullify the effect of any arrangement which co-ownersmight make in regard to the limitation of liability as between themselves. But what is the meaning of the words "cease to have anyshare or interest"?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p164" class="pseudopara" id="p164">164.</a> As regards shop 8 1st floor, there is prima facie evidence of receipt of the purchase price on the face of the assignment (Ex. B66).In the case of flat F2 12th floor, clause 2 of the agreement for sale and purchase (Ex. B67) reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The purchase price shall be $39,500 which are now paid and fully satisfied by the purchaser to the vendor."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Therefore there is prima facie evidence before the court that the 1st defendant has been fully paid for all 752 undivided parts orshares of Mirador Mansion. There is no doubt at all that his position as regards the two undivided shares involving shop 8 1st floorand flat F2 12th floor is that of a bare trustee.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p165" class="pseudopara" id="p165">165.</a> But even if, as a result of the provisions of the Deed of Mutual Covenant and the form of assignment used in Hongkong, it could besaid that the 1st defendant has now (or at any rate may at any moment) cease to have any "share" in Mirador Mansion, how can it besaid that he has no longer any "interest" in the land and building upon which it is built? He is the prospective Crown Lessee. Heis under continuing liability to the Crown for the next 17 years to pay $140,995 per annum by way of instalments of premium and heis liable to the Crown for Crown rent for the next 80 years. He expects to be able to recover from co-owners of the building sumswhich will enable him to discharge his own obligations in the matter of premium and Crown rent.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p166" class="pseudopara" id="p166">166.</a> At any rate, so far as the licensing of the "illegal shops and stalls" is concerned, it is not open to the 1st defendant to say:"I am not liable for this because I no longer have any share or interest in Mirador Mansion."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p167" class="pseudopara" id="p167">167.</a> I shall now endeavour to summarise the evidence relating to what was referred to during the trial as "the workshops" (defendantsNos.76-177). Paragraphs 10, 22, 24 and 25 of the statement of claim refer. Paragraph 22 reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"........... the 1st defendant has, in breach of Special Condition (b) of the said Conditions of Regrant concerning the said building,sold or let off portions of the said building then under his control to the ............................... defendants or their predecessorsin title for use for industrial purposes. The plaintiffs including the said co-owners whom they represent objected and/or never agreedto such actions and say that the same are in breach of the assignments or agreements to assign from the 1st defendant to the otherco-owners and in breach of the said Deed of Mutual Covenant."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p168" class="pseudopara" id="p168">168.</a> There was not a scrap of evidence called to support the allegation that the 1st defendant sold or let off portions of the buildingto any person for industrial purposes. There was no evidence that the 2nd plaintiffs objected to the presence of the "workshops";nor was there any evidence that any co-owner, other than Mr. Paulie and Dr. Wong, did so. When Mr. Paulie was asked whether he knewof any case in which the 1st defendant had "sold or let off" a unit of the building for industrial purposes, his answer was:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"No; I do not say that he does so."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p169" class="pseudopara" id="p169">169.</a> Paragraphs 23-25 of the statement of claim read:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="7%" class="quote">"23.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="92%" class="quote">Each of the .................. defendants is bound to observe the said Conditions of Regrant in respect of the said building, underthe said Deed of Mutual Covenant, and by privity of estate with the Crown.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="7%" class="quote">24.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="92%" class="quote">Further or in the alternative, the said Deed of Mutual Covenant bound the parties to such Deed as well as their executors, administratorsand assigns, and the ............. defendants are bound by the said Deed of Mutual Covenant.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="7%" class="quote">25.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="92%" class="quote">In breach of the said Deed of Mutual Covenant and/or of the said Conditions of Regrant the said .................. defendants haveand still are operating workshops and other industrial concerns in the said building and the Crown can reenter at any time."</td>        </tr>    </table>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p170" class="pseudopara" id="p170">170.</a> The plaintiffs rely on a letter dated 23rd May, 1961 from the Superintendent of Crown Lands and Surveys to a firm of solicitors whohad apparently complained on behalf of some client in regard to the use to which certain units in the building were being put. Theletter reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">".......... any industrial use of these premises or any part thereof is a breach of Special Condition (b) of the Conditions of Regrantof a new lease under which the lot is held. If your client can give me details of any specific cases I will have these investigated."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">It is not known who the client was. There is no evidence that the solicitors supplied the Superintendent with any details; there isno evidence that the Superintendent did any investigation or took any action; and there is no evidence that the Crown is contemplatingre-entry.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p171" class="pseudopara" id="p171">171.</a> In relation to the workshops, Mr. Paulie said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(They) are noisy. Some operate round the clock. One man rents a flat and he tries to get as many sewing machines as he can. You mighthave 30 sewing machines in one flat, i.e. 30 adults and each has a learner, in a flat built for 6 people. So each flat has 30-40people and they sleep there. They scream in the passageways, kick dustbins, play mahjong, all the time."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p172" class="pseudopara" id="p172">172.</a> While he was giving evidence, Mr. Paulie handed up a bulky typewritten document containing particulars of a large number of unitsin the building and remarks made by himself concerning those units and as to what action he had taken in regard to them. Counselagreed that the document was inadmissible; but it was agreed that the plaintiffs' solicitors should extract from this document suchitems as they considered relevant; and so Ex.L was typed out.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p173" class="pseudopara" id="p173">173.</a> It is a document relating to defendants 76-177; and it purports to give particulars relating to a number of "workshops" in the buildingas at some date in 1967, about the time this action commenced.

It fits in exactly with the statement of claim which alleges that on some date in 1967 defendantsNos. 76-177 (except those against whom the action has been withdrawn) were operating workshops. From an examination of Exs. E andW, most, but not all, of the names appearing on Ex. L are first assignees. One might be tempted to assume that those names whichare not on Exs. E and W are either subsequent assignees, or the actual occupiers of the premises in question. But it is not as simpleas that. For example, the 81st defendant is shown on Ex. L as "occupying" A.6 3rd floor, A.3 6th floor and F.2 6th floor. In Exs.E and W, he is shown as the registered owner of A.6 3rd floor and in Ex. W, he is shown as the registered owner of A.3 6th floor,but some other person is shown in Ex. E as the registered owner of that flat; and in both Exs. E and W some other person is shownas the registered owner of F.2 6th floor. Yet the 81st defendant is shown on Ex. L as carrying on a tailor's workshop at all thoseunits.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p175" class="pseudopara" id="p175">175.</a> He probably does not "occupy" any of the three premises. His address for service on the original writ is 32 Wo Fung Street, 1st floor,Luen Wo Market, Fanling, New Territories. It may be, of course, that the registered owner of F.2 6th floor has assigned the premisesto him since the searches in the Land Office which resulted in Exs. E and W and that he has some tenants in all those flats carryingon tailor's workshops.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p176" class="pseudopara" id="p176">176.</a> The 83rd defendant is the registered owner of A.15 3rd floor; but he is not the registered owner of A.12 7th floor. Yet, he is shownon Ex.L as carrying on a tailor's workshop at both units.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p177" class="pseudopara" id="p177">177.</a> The 130th defendant (Mary Winyard) is shown on Ex.L as carrying on a tailor's workshop at F.3 10th floor. She is the registered ownerof F.2 10th floor; but not F.3 on that floor.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p178" class="pseudopara" id="p178">178.</a> The 170th defendant is shown on Ex.L as operating a food caterer's business at C.1 15th floor. He is not the registered owner ofthat unit; but according to Exs. E and W, Chan Pui Kee is the registered owner. Is this the Chan Pui Kee (formerly 12th defendant)in respect of whom proceedings were discontinued after this action commenced?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p179" class="pseudopara" id="p179">179.</a> The first name on Ex.L is Au Lock Tung (defendant No.76). When Mr. Paulie was asked about him in examination-in-chief, he said: "Heoccupies shop No.60 1st floor, shop 51 on ground floor, B.1 16th floor and flat B.2 3rd floor". I do not know what was the purposeof the question. Incidentally, Au Lock Tung was not served with any writ or statement of claim in this action. Ex.L indicates thathe occupies B.2 3rd floor. Fung King Man is shown in Ex.E as the registered owner of shop 60 1st floor, shop 51 ground floor andB.2 3rd floor. Au Lock Tung is shown as the registered owner of B.1 16th floor.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p180" class="pseudopara" id="p180">180.</a> Paragraph 6 of the report (Ex.O) which was made as a result of a visit to the premises on 14th December, 1964, deals with 18 "unregisteredfactories using power driving machines".

As I have said, he did not sell or let off portions for industrial purposes. He is certainlyunder continuing liability to the Crown under the Conditions of Regrant; but his liability to the Crown is not an issue in this case.And if some co-owners choose to use their premises for industrial purposes, how can it be said that the 1st defendant is liable toother co-owners because he signed all the assignments? At all material time he has been a co-owner; and, as such, he, like any otherco-owner, <u>could</u> have taken action to prevent his fellow co-owners (or some of them) from putting their premises to industrial use; but the fact thathe <u>could</u> have done so (as the 2nd plaintiffs in this case are now doing) does not mean that he is and always has been, "liable to ensure"to his co-owners that no part of the building was put to industrial use.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p188" class="pseudopara" id="p188">188.</a> However, this is all now of academic interest because on the last day of the trial, Mr. Asome finally sought leave to amend thatportion of the statement of claim in which the plaintiffs seek relief against the 1st defendant in regard to the "workshops". Theplaintiffs now seek no reliefs against the 1st defendant in respect of their allegations under paragraphs 22 to 25 of the statementof claim.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p189" class="pseudopara" id="p189">189.</a> Any co-owners who are using their premises for industrial purposes are, of course, clearly liable for breach of the Conditions ofRegrant and of the terms of their assignment which are subject to the Conditions of Regrant. Also, it is no good their saying thatthey have no personal knowledge of what is going on in the "parts" (i.e. flats etc.) which they have let on a monthly tenancy. Theproviso to clause 13 of the Deed of Mutual Covenant provides that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"........ such party shall be responsible to the other owners for the due performance and observance on the part of such tenant orlessee of the terms and conditions hereof";</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">and the conditions include clause 11(c) which is a covenant not to use "his part ........ for any illegal, unlawful ........ purposesnor do or permit anything therein ........ which may create unnecessary noise or may be or become a nuisance, annoyance, damage,or inconvenience to the other occupiers ..........".

This report was, as I have said, disclosedto the plaintiffs long before the trial commenced; and Mr. Zimmern said in court that he had made it perfectly clear to their legaladvisers that the books, upon which the auditor's accounts and report were based, were available for inspection and re-audit at anytime. The auditor's report was put in as Ex. D at the commencement of the trial; and Mr. Bernacchi relied upon it in opening hiscase.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p191" class="pseudopara" id="p191">191.</a> Although the business of the unlimited company had, in theory, been would up on 31st March 1961 (Ex.B26) upon the incorporation ofTai Cheung Construction Co. Ltd., it is clear from the auditor's report (and from his subsequent evidence in court) that for thewhole period 1959/1967, entries relating to Mirador Mansion were made both in the books of the unlimited company and in the booksof the 3rd defendants. Indeed, Mr. Young said that he had the greatest difficulty in sorting out the entries which had been madein the books of the unlimited company which ought to have been made in the books of the 3rd defendants. But he said that he was givenevery assistance by the staff of the 2nd and 3rd defendants; and that he was satisfied, as an auditor, that all relevant books anddocuments were before him.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p192" class="pseudopara" id="p192">192.</a> The auditor said that he had inspected all deposit receipts in respect of sums paid to the Water Authority and the China Light andPower Co.

Ltd. (or the 3rd defendants) in 1965 when 504 individual watermeters were installed in the flats on floors 3-16. It was mentioned by the 1st defendant in his letter of 2nd February 1966 to Dr.C.C. Wong (Ex.B23). In 1965, most of the unit holders apparently paid their deposits to the Water Authority direct; but a numberdid not do so; and the 2nd (or 3rd) defendants paid the Water Authority on their behalf.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p194" class="pseudopara" id="p194">194.</a> Mr. Young was asked by Mr. Bernacchi why the company should pay a further deposit of $54,830 to the China Light &amp; Power Co.

But on returning to the witness box a few days later he handed up to counselthe whole bundle of receipts from the China Light &amp; Power Co. Ltd. in respect of deposits required by this Company followingthe installation of individual meters in each unit. Counsel did not request that the whole bundle of receipts be put in evidence,but he asked that one be admitted in evidence as an example (Ex. CCC).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p195" class="pseudopara" id="p195">195.</a> In the defendants' books, the figures $88,506.10, being the total of utility deposits paid on behalf of unit holders, is shown foreach year till the year ending 31st March 1965; but for the two years ending March 1966 and March 1967 the figure is $93,796.10 becauseof the additional payment of $5,290 paid by the defendants to the Water Authority because of the failure, or refusal, on the partof certain unit holders to pay their deposits when individual meters were installed. The same figure ($93,796.10) appears in thebalance sheets of the 3rd defendants for the years ending 31st March 1968 and 31st March 1969. (Exs. XX and WW)</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p196" class="pseudopara" id="p196">196.</a> The installation of separate water meters in 1965 cost the 3rd defendants $84,600. Assuming, as 1st defendant says in his letterof 2nd February, 1966, that the 3rd defendants had obtained the prior approval of the majority of unit holders, it appears reasonablethat they should recover what they had spent thereof; and, according to the accounts, the majority of unit holders have repaid thedefendants. But a few have not done so. $7,857.30 is apparently outstanding. Again. a certain amount ($4,270) has been over-collectedunder this heading. How this happened was not gone into during the trial; but, apparently, part of the over-collection has alreadybeen refunded. The $84,600 appears on the assets side of the balance sheets under the heading "temporary payments"; and on the liabilitiesside, the net amount which had been recovered as at 31st March, 1967, was $81,012.50.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p197" class="pseudopara" id="p197">197.</a> Turning to the profit and loss accounts forming part of Ex.D, the two biggest items of expenditure in the Profit and Loss accountsare salaries and wages, and light and power.

The witness had no details in front of him; but he thought thatthe main reason for the increase in 1968 and 1969 was that much of the electrical wiring had to be replaced. He said that with theincrease in the number of air conditioning and other electrical installations, the original wiring in the building was quite inadequate.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p199" class="pseudopara" id="p199">199.</a> As regards income, Mr. Young said that so far as he could ascertain from the books, management fees were charged on all the 504 unitson floors 3 - 16; but the number of shops paying management fees appeared to vary from time to time. In 1959, 208 shops (ground,1st and 2nd floors) were paying management fees; but in 1963 this figure was reduced to 184. It remained about 190 till August 1968when the number of shops paying management fees increased again to 203.

is that it does not purport to cover all items mentioned in clauses 4, 5, 6,and 7 of the Deed. Except for the cost of a few bulbs and two small amounts in respect of miscellaneous expenses, no mention is madeof expenditures for repairs and maintenance (sub-clause (b) of clause 4 of the Deed) although it is clear from the profit and lossaccount for the year March 1968/March 1969 (Ex. XX) $61,173.15 was spent on this item. Of course, one would not expect to see anyreference to sub-clause (d) of clause 4 because this was Chan Kin's responsibility; but there is no mention of water charges underclauses 6 and 7 of the Deed - presumably because Government's debit notes for such items are issued quarterly or half-yearly andnot monthly.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p203" class="pseudopara" id="p203">203.</a> The apportionment of expenses does not follow strictly clauses 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Deed in that there is no statement of what, accordingto clause 4, should be shared equally by all co-owners from the basement upwards. This would include the items mentioned in sub-clauses(c), (e) and (f) of clause 4. There are 18 floors in the whole building, including the ground floor and basement; but in Ex. G inapportioning the expenditure among unit holders the building has been regarded as of 17 floors.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p204" class="pseudopara" id="p204">204.</a> Clauses 4 - 7 of the Deed clearly contemplate that the co-owners in the basement would pay considerably less than other co-owners.Clauses 5 and 6 do not apply to them. But, according to clause 4, the basement should contribute to the wages of the general caretakerand watchmen employed for the entire building, electricity charges and other expenses for the lighting of all parts of the buildingin common use and electricity charges wages and other expenses of operating the pumps for supplying flushing water.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p205" class="pseudopara" id="p205">205.</a> If Ex. G is typical of all statements of monthly expenses issued by the 1st defendant or his companies, either he has not chosento charge the basement owners a proportion of these expenses, or they have objected to being charged for items which they may wellhave regarded as of no concern to them. Of what concern is it to them whether the flushing system in the upper floors is working?What do they care about the state of the lighting in the common passageways on, say, the 2nd floor? Neither Mr. Harilela (the 1stnamed of the 2nd plaintiffs) nor any of the other co-owners in the basement have come to court to testify on this. In the face ofclear evidence from Huen and Lo (which I accept) that a very considerable number of co-owners have consistently refused to pay theirshare of management fees, why should I assume (as the plaintiffs ask me to do) that the basement was simply not charged by the 1stdefendant (for reasons best known to himself) rather than that the co-owners in the basement regarded themselves as in a class bythemselves and refused to pay according to clause 4? In any event Ex. G is nothing more than a statement of expenses for one month.From the very nature of the figures on that document, it could not have been issued by the 1st defendant every month. In other words,it simply cannot be the case that from 1965, or 1967, onwards co-owners were asked to pay a fixed charge of $17.50 per month.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p206" class="pseudopara" id="p206">206.</a> However, the question of apportionment does not affect the fact that in February 1969, the 1st defendant or his companies spent,according to Ex.G $10,970 in management expenses. In fact they spent more than that. This did not include anything for Crown rentor repairs under clauses 4(b) and 6(a), or for water charges under clauses 6(d) and 7; and, of course, it did not look at the wholequestion of management as the auditor has done in his profit and loss account (Ex. XX). For example, the auditor has made allowancefor property tax for which the 1st defendant is liable in respect of the income from the rents of the "illegal shops", (income whichaccording to Exs. D, WW and XX, was vital to the carrying on of the management.). $10,970 can therefore be taken as a minimum figurefor one month. (The Chinese New Year gratuity does not affect the position to any material extent). Therefore on this basis, the1st defendant would appear to have expected the co-owners to contribute $131,640 ($10,970 x 12) during the year 1968/69. In factduring that year the total of all management fees paid by the co-owners was $76,850 (Ex. XX - profit and loss account).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p207" class="pseudopara" id="p207">207.</a> Going back to the early years (Ex. D - profit and loss accounts) during the year 1959/60 the 1st defendant and his company spent$75,115.86 in managing Mirador Mansion. The co-owners contributed a mere $36,377.70. The cost of management during the year 1960/61rose to $134,168.48. During that year the co-owners contributed $75,380.15 towards the cost of management during that year plus $9,807.95arrears of management fees in respect of the year 1959/60, making a total of $85,188.10. The profit and loss accounts tell the samestory for every year up to the present with the exception of the years 1963/64 and 1964/65. For these two years there was more incomethan expenditures. The reason is obvious from the accounts. During those 2 years the co-owners paid $16,556.90 and $13,945.30 arrearsof management fees which more than offsets the $6,615.14 and $10,090.75 "profit". Mr. Young, the auditor, said that only managementfees which had actually been paid were brought into his accounts. Although a very considerable number of co-owners had paid no managementfees for years, he said that there was no point in showing arrears as an asset as the chance of recovery was nil.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p208" class="pseudopara" id="p208">208.</a> Below the profit and loss accounts there is a statement showing excess of expenditure on income for the 8 years 1959/67. By 31stMarch 1967, according to the accounts, the 1st defendant had spent $104,896.45 of his own money in the management of Mirador Mansion.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p209" class="pseudopara" id="p209">209.</a> But this figure takes account of the rental income from the "illegal shops".

From the accounts for the 2 years 1967/1969(Exs. WW and XX), it appears that the 1st defendant is still losing heavily; but his losses were less than what they would otherwisebe because he has received $51,123.07 and $50,780 rental income from the "illegal shops" during those 2 years.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p210" class="pseudopara" id="p210">210.</a> I do not see how the 1st defendant could have carried on the management of this building without this source of income. During thevery first year of management (1959/60) there was a loss of $22,609.03. He received only $3,905.83 in rental income during that year.It would appear that most of these "illegal" structures were established between 1962/1964 because there was a very considerableincrease in rental income between 1963/65. But, there was a loss in the management for every year except the years 1963/65.

As at the 31st March,1967, the total amount which unit holders owed the 1st defendant in respect of premiums was $125,750.51. By 28th February, 1970,this figure had increased to $159,215.75. Of course, payments of premium have nothing to do with the expenses of managing the building.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p215" class="pseudopara" id="p215">215.</a> Mr. Young was asked this question by Mr. Zimmern:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"How much have the 1st and 2nd defendants sunk into the management of Mirador Mansion?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Mr. Young's answer was:- "$336,390.15". Mr. Young arrived at this figure in this way: he took the losses for the first two years asper the Profit and Loss Accounts for 1959/60 and 1960/61 (Ex. D) namely $22,609.03 and $40,514.88. He then apportioned the loss forthe year 1961/62 because the 3rd defendants had been incorporated on 2nd February 1962; and instead of taking the full figure of$24,255.89 as loss for the year 1961/62, he took $20,401.54 being the proportion for the period 1st April 1961 to 2nd February 1962.The total of the three figures $22,609.03, $40,514.88 and $20,401.54 is $83,525.45. To this he added the $93,648.95 owing by 3rddefendants to the 2nd defendants as per the 1968/69 balance sheet; and the $159,215.75 owing to the 1st defendant personally in respectof premium. The total is $336,390.15.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p216" class="pseudopara" id="p216">216.</a> There was no means of attacking those figures. All counsel for the plaintiffs could say was that it might be that the defendants'books did not contain all relevant entries. As I have said, if that was to be the plaintiffs' line it was up to them to call forthe books and have them re-audited long before the case came on for trial. Nothing came out of the cross-examination of the auditorto justify re-opening the whole question of the accuracy of the books at this stage.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p217" class="pseudopara" id="p217">217.</a> I find it very surprising therefore that the plaintiffs proceeded with paragraph 17 of the statement of claim. This paragraph asamended up to the time when the trial began, read:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"17. - - - - - the 1st defendant and/or the 2nd defendants purportedly charged with the management of the said building by the 1stdefendant, has demanded and collected a sum in excess of $150,000 from the 2nd plaintiffs including the co-owners by way of depositsfor water and electricity, such sum being over $100,000 over and above the sums required for such deposits under the said Deed ofMutual Covenant and the said sum of over $100,000 has, since the date of collection and in fraud of the 2nd plaintiffs and thoseco-owners whom they represent, been converted to the use of the 1st defendant and/or the 2nd defendants for their own purposes, norhave any accounts of the purposes for which such sums may have been used rendered to the 2nd plaintiffs or any of the individualco-owners of the said building represented by the 2nd plaintiffs nor has such sum or any part thereof been refunded to the 2nd plaintiffsand/or to any of the co-owners represented by them"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Halfway through the trial the two amounts ($150,000 and $100,000) were amended to read $127,000 and $95,000 respectively.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p218" class="pseudopara" id="p218">218.</a> The allegations in paragraph 17 refer to the sums received in response to the letter of 1st May 1959 (Ex.B2). As I have said, ifevery unit had paid the amounts demanded in Ex. B2, the unlimited company should have received $127,880. In the letter (Ex.B2) theunlimited company clearly indicated to each addressee that the sums which each purchaser was required to pay included "a reservefund for management"; and, pursuant thereto, they allocated $30 per unit in their books. Sums so allocated are shown in the balancesheets as "Management fee deposits received". According to a schedule attached to Mr. Young's accounts (Ex.D p.14) this managementfee deposit appears to have been worked out on the basis of 719 units because the figures shown as what they ought to have receivedunder this heading is $21,570. (719 x $30) Again, a number of unit holders appear to have objected to paying this sum because fromyear to year the schedules show sums under the heading "amount still not yet received". As at the 31st March, 1967, the total amountheld by the defendants under the heading 'management fee deposits' was $20,700.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p219" class="pseudopara" id="p219">219.</a> The plaintiffs first submission was that the letter Ex.B2 was superseded by the Deed of Mutual Covenant, and that because the Deedmakes no reference to a reserse deposit in respect of management fees, the reserve deposits should have been returned to unit holdersimmediately. I do not agree. When the Deed was signed a year later, it did not say that the letter (Ex.B2) would be treated as ofno effect and that all deposits paid under Ex.B2 would be refunded to the co-owners. One must therefore ask oneself whether the phrases"other expense for the lighting" and "other expenses of operating" in paragraphs (e) and (f) of Clause 4 of the Deed were intendedto refer to any deposits already paid. I do not think that this could have been the intention.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p220" class="pseudopara" id="p220">220.</a> One of the documents in the agreed bundle is a deposit receipt (Ex.B3). During the cross-examination of the auditor, counsel forthe plaintiffs put to the witness the original of another such deposit receipt (Ex.FFF) in favour of the 81st defendant (who didnot give evidence herself). It reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Received from Madam Ngai Ting Yung $270 being payments for the following items in respect of Flat F2 Mirador Mansion 7th floor:</p>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">1.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="76%" class="quote">Deposit for water meter being 1/... share HK$.........(Deposit Receipt No.)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">2.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="76%" class="quote">Deposit for electric meter in respect of water pump being 1/.... share HK$.....(Deposit Receipt No.)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">3.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="76%" class="quote">nos. of chops HK$</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="4%" class="quote">			<p style="text-align: left"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="76%" class="quote">Basic Fund for management of the Mansion."</td>        </tr>    </table>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The argument put forward on behalf of the plaintiffs was that this deposit receipt (Ex. FFF) did not have the numeral "4" opposite"Basic Fund for management of the Mansion"; therefore these words must mean the initial deposits under items 1, 2 and 3.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p221" class="pseudopara" id="p221">221.</a> I do not accept this submission. If one looks at the original of Ex. FFF, one sees that the receipt, as originally printed, did contain3 items and the 4th item ("Basic fund for management of the Mansion") has been stamped on in the place where one would normally expectto find a 4th item. I do not think there can be any doubt but that the receipt followed the terms of the letter of 1st May 1959.Quite obviously each co-owner who paid the initial sums demanded did so with his eyes open that a proportion of the sum paid wouldbe allocated as a reserve fund for management.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p222" class="pseudopara" id="p222">222.</a> The Schedule (p.13 of Ex.D) is a summary of the position as disclosed in the books of account of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendantsin regard to utility deposits.

Certain deposit receipts (Ex.CCC) were put in evidence; and Mr. Bernacchi saidthat these receipts were in the name of unit holders and he made no admission as to how the defendants came into possession of thesereceipts. But counsel did not amend the figure $42,059.30. He submitted that on the evidence there was prima facie evidence of fraudbearing in mind that the standard of proof was balance of probabilities.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p226" class="pseudopara" id="p226">226.</a> In my view the plaintiffs have not even begun to prove fraud or wrongful detention. Owing to the fact that the plaintiffs did notcall for any books of account (despite Mr. Zimmern's repeated offer to produce them) the defendants' system of bookkeeping was notinvestigated by the Court; but Lowe, Bingham &amp; Mathews did a very thorough investigation; and although Mr. Young said that hehad very great difficulty indeed in straightening out the various entries in the books of account belonging to the 3rd defendantsand the unlimited company, there is nothing in the auditor's evidence to suggest for one moment that he suspected fraud. Indeed,he said that the 3rd defendants kept a register showing what deposits had been paid on behalf of each unit holder and what each unitholder had paid to the defendants, and he said that the amounts over-collected could be refunded whenever application was made therefor.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p227" class="pseudopara" id="p227">227.</a> Mr. Zimmern said he regarded paragraph 17 of the statement of claim as irresponsible pleading. He pointed out that not one plaintiffhad come forward to say that he had over-paid anything, or that he had requested a refund, or that a request for a refund had beenrefused; and that, anyway, the amount over-collected had nothing to do with the 2nd plaintiffs.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p228" class="pseudopara" id="p228">228.</a> It is sufficient for me to say that in my view no case of fraud or wrongful detention of $42059.30 or any other sum has been madeout. The 1st defendant was not called upon for any explanation on the evidence before the court. It is extraordinary that the plaintiffsdid not even call for the register of deposits. They seemed to think that more suspicion could be thrown on the 1st defendant byconcentrating on the form of wording used on deposit receipt Ex. FFF. Out of the numerous unit holders of the 752 units, surely someonecould have been found to say something in support of the plaintiffs' allegation in paragraph 17. I cannot disregard this aspect ofthe case, especially when I read the wild allegations which were disseminated by Dr. Wong and Mr. Paulie in Ex. PPP which I shallcome to presently.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p229" class="pseudopara" id="p229">229.</a> I now consider the plaintiffs' right to sue. Despite the pre-trial rulings of Huggins, J. in chambers, Mr. Bernacchi maintained thatthe 1st plaintiff association was entitled to sue in a representative capacity "on behalf of themselves and all co-owners of MiradorMansion except the 1st defendant and the other defendants who are co-owners". The only oral evidence called by the plaintiffs onthis question was that of Mr. Paulie; and at this stage I think it is desirable to quote verbatim portions of various letters whichhe and Dr. Wong wrote to the 1st or 2nd defendants, the 1st defendant's replies thereto and the substance of Mr. Paulie's oral evidencein regard to the circumstances in which the 1st plaintiff association came to be formed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p230" class="pseudopara" id="p230">230.</a> On 3rd September, 1962, Paulie wrote to the 2nd defendants as follows (Ex.

On 18th November 1965 Mr. Paulie wrote to the 1st defendant personally as follows (Ex. B.17):-</p>    <blockquote>		"................. by selling flats and shops to people living in Shanghai Street and Wanchai could only result in complicationsfor yourselves and other respectable owners, as these types of people are only interested in collecting rent and would not care twohoots as to who their tenants are, what purpose their flat or shop is put to. Needless to say the type of tenant occupying a unitwhich is owned by the lesser educated owner is an uneducated person who has no consideration whatsoever for the other occupants ofthe building, because he litters the passages with rubbish, damages the flooring and the walls, refuses to pay dues, and makes lifein general most uncomfortable for other respectable occupants. Now this problem ............. was not created by me, but by the lackof thought and foresight on the part of your good-selves when you undertook selling units in this building to these types of owners.However, as the manager of this building you could still have protected the interests of respectable owners by engaging a suitablemanager or handed over the management to proper real estate agents such as Harrimans. No, Mr. Chan, you wanted to eat your cake andstill have it, so you decided to appoint your own concern Messrs. Tai Cheung Construction Co. who had no previous experience of managingbuildings to undertake the task of managing one of the biggest buildings in the Colony, and, quite naturally, the result was thatwithin a few months of mismanagement this building has earned for itself the name of being the most filthy building in the Colony.....................<p>2. ............. I purchased in good faith 1/752nd part or share of Kowloon Inland Lot 7275, Shop 60, Mirador Mansion. And, ............I naturally assumed that the other empty spaces on this floor would also be used for the purpose which they were meant for, i.e.shops. However, after spending nearly $40,000 in decorating and airconditioning my space as a shop, I then found that the other spaceswere being used as workshops, godowns, etc. and this was being permitted by your so-called management. Needless to say that withthese types of neighbours one could only expect the worst, i.e. (a) passages littered with rubbish, (b) cargo stored in the passages,(c) damage to flooring of passages and steps, (d) damage to my own shop on several occasions, and (e) vandals and vagrants sleepingin the passages and using the public toilets as bath houses ..................................................................</p>		3. In late 1963 or the beginning of 1964, you took it upon yourself to build additional shops in the court, blocking our all ventilationto the air well from all four sides, thereby causing a health and fire hazard. Additional shops were also built in the passagewayson the ground and first floors. All three fire escape exits were also rented out as shops and these exits are locked and barred duringthe night, which could prove fatal in case of a fire. Several spaces in the passages on the ground and first floors are also beingrented out, much to the discomfort of the other occupants of this building. This, you already know, is a violation against the Deedof Mutual Covenant, yet you claim that you were forced to build and rent these illegal shops and spaces to subsidise loss of revenuewhich is caused by fifty percent of the occupants refusing to pay their monthly dues. ................... do you honestly think thatit is fair to let decent people suffer simply because you are unable to collect dues from some that are possibly not too happy aboutthe service and others that are just dead beats? .................................................................................<p>4. Your attention is drawn to paragraph 4(a) which reads as follows:- (a) the Crown Rent shall be shared and paid by the owners inproportion to the number of units that is to say shops or flats for the time being owned by such owners and for the purpose of thisclause the basement shall be deemed to consist of 36 units. This would mean that the annual Crown rent for Kowloon Inland Lot 7275should be split equally into 752, as there are or were this many units prior to your taking it upon yourself to add to the numberof units as shown on the building plans which were supplied with the Deed of Covenant. However, my investigations have proved thatthere are no two units paying the same amount of Crown rent, .............. a larger unit on the same floor was paying $39.08 lessthan I was ............................. the flats which were fitted out with wooden flooring, toilets, water, windows, doors, tiling,and of a larger area than these bare spaces which you sold us on this floor as shops were sold at considerably lower prices thanwe paid for our spaces, are paying less Crown rent than we pay for our spaces, yet the flats have always been able to earn more rentalper month than our spaces on this floor. As shops, I would say that the Crown rent as stated on the Assignment is a fair figure,but you must appreciate that the spaces on this floor can no longer be termed as shops, as your management permitted most of thespaces on this floor to be rented out as godowns, workshops, etc. Also, with regard to the additional shops which were built, I shouldlike to enquire whether these units are paying Crown rent? If so, why has there not been a reduction on Crown rent for the original752 units?"</p>	</blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p231" class="pseudopara" id="p231">231.</a> The 1st defendant replied to this letter by a letter of 29th November, 1965 (Ex.

After all any small group of persons can register a company. No inferencecan be drawn from the mere fact of registration. It does not create any prima facie presumption.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p241" class="pseudopara" id="p241">241.</a> I was given very little information from Mr. Paulie about the meeting on 3rd November 1965; and he did not say who signed the letterof 6th December, 1965 or describe the circumstances in which the signatories came to append their signatures to this document. Mynote of his evidence reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The first general meeting was held on the open space on the 2nd floor on 3rd November, 1965 ............. we functioned before incorporation.Our letter head clearly states the address of the office. This is known by most of our members who drop in to discuss matters, andaction is taken on their behalf."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">But what happened at this meeting? Who attended it? Have there been any other meetings? And who are the members? Mr. Paulie said hekept a membership receipt book, a "legal action" receipt book, and a minute book. None of these things were shown to me. A questionarose during the trial as to whether I should be supplied with a list of members. Mr. Zimmern also wanted a list of those personswho had contributed to the so-called "Legal Action Fund", that is, as I understood the position, a fund started by Dr. Wong and Paulieto pay legal expenses in connection with the prosecution of this action. Mr. Bernacchi advised Mr. Paulie not to produce the latter.Why, I do not know. Anyway Mr. Zimmern wanted both documents produced. But I am not concerned with disputes between counsel as towhat should or should not be produced. I told Mr. Bernacchi at the time that so far as I was concerned, it was up to the plaintiffsto prove their case. It was for then to produce evidence to satisfy me that the 1st plaintiffs represent the great body of co-ownersand occupants of Mirador Mansion. I am certainly not prepared to accept a bald assertion from Mr. Paulie that this is so, nor a generalassertion from the Bar that this is so.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p242" class="pseudopara" id="p242">242.</a> It was not until Lo Shung Wing gave evidence that I had some idea of what efforts were being made in 1965 towards forming a representativeassociation. He said that owing to the large number of units, it was impossible to hold one meeting and that he had therefore called5 meetings in April 1965. The notice calling the meetings appears to have been the circular Ex. B.61. It had a two-fold purpose:-</p>    <blockquote>		"(1) to elect representatives of landowners from each section of the building to organise the landowners welfare association<p>(2) to discuss the technical aspects of the proposed installation of separate meters".</p>	</blockquote>    <p align="left">Of course, the installation of separate meters concerned the upper floors only; but the formation of an association concerned everyonein the building.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p243" class="pseudopara" id="p243">243.</a> Mr. Lo said that he gave instructions that the circular letter should be sent to every unit holder; and it is obvious from Ex. B.61that the date of the particular meeting and the name of the addressee was filled in after the letter had been typed, or more probably"Roneo-ed".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p244" class="pseudopara" id="p244">244.</a> Lo said he dealt with the building in sections; that the first four meetings concerned floors 3 - 16 and that the fifth meeting concernedthe owners of the shops on the ground, 1st and 2nd floors. He said that 26 persons out of about 100 persons addressed attended thefirst meeting on 8th April, 1965; that 27 persons out of about 100 attended the second meeting on the 13th April, 1965; that 14 outof 100 addressees attended the third meeting on 15th April, 1965 that 33 attended the fourth meeting; and that 23 attended the fifthmeeting; that the first four meetings approved of the installation of separate meters for the upper floors; that the first meetingelected 8 representatives to serve on a "preparatory committee" but that none of the 2nd plaintiffs were elected; that the secondmeeting elected 7 representatives, one of whom was Dr. Wong; that the third meeting elected 6 representatives, one of whom was IpLing Sheung (the 26th named of the 2nd plaintiffs); and that the fourth meeting elected 11 representatives, (none of the 2nd plaintiffswere elected).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p245" class="pseudopara" id="p245">245.</a> My note of Mr. Lo's description of what happened at the 5th meeting reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Mr. Paulie did attend ........... There was some trouble at this meeting. Mr. Paulie and Dr. C.C. Wong were often not satisfied withthe management. So we made explanation saying: 'Now we are opening this meeting and if there is any dissatisfaction, let the dissatisfactionbe resolved later; and now let this meeting not be obstructed?</p>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">Q.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%" class="quote">What do you mean by that?</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">A.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%" class="quote">It was because Mr. Paulie and Dr. Wong said that the management was not very good and therefore it served no purpose to call thismeeting."</td>        </tr>    </table>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">This is a very different picture from the one painted by Mr. Paulie. From Lo's evidence it would appear that it was Dr. Wong and Mr.Paulie who obstructed the business of the meeting. I accepted Lo's evidence. He seemed a truthful witness.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p246" class="pseudopara" id="p246">246.</a> Lo said that they managed to elect 7 representatives, two of whom were Mr. Paulie and Mr. Wong Shoot Yan (6th named of the 2nd plaintiffs).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p247" class="pseudopara" id="p247">247.</a> As a result of these 5 meetings, 39 persons were elected representatives of the preparatory committee.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p248" class="pseudopara" id="p248">248.</a> There is no doubt at all that these five meetings were held. Lo took minutes of the proceedings and he had his minute book besidehim when he gave his evidence. He had obtained the signatures of all persons attending these meetings including that of Mr. Paulie.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p249" class="pseudopara" id="p249">249.</a> Lo said he called a meeting of the 39 representatives on 11th May, 1965; that 26 persons attended including Mr. Paulie, Ip Ling Sheungand Dr. C.C. Wong (not Wong Shoot Yan). Lo said that there was trouble at this meeting because "Paulie scolded Chan Pui Kee" (formerly12 defendant, against whom the plaintiffs withdrew at the commencement of the trial).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p250" class="pseudopara" id="p250">250.</a> The purpose of the meeting, Lo said, was to appoint a sub-committee to draft regulations for the proposed association; and that asub-committee of 11 persons was elected. These were:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="85%">Dr. C.C.

My note of Lo's description of the proceedings reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Some committee members were of the opinion that in so calling a meeting it was not very proper, so there was no result. Finally WongKwan Wai, Lam Chung Ming, Tang Nai Cheuk, Tsui Kin Fom, Li Chi Hing, suggested to let the Tai Cheung Construction Co. Ltd. to bethe convenor of the draft committee. I accepted."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Lo took no further action towards calling a meeting of the 39 representatives till 31st December, 1965 when he issued his notice (Ex.B.62/B.63) calling a meeting for 7th January, 1966. He said that 21 persons attended including Mr. Paulie, Dr. C.C. Wong and Ip LingSheung; that Wong Shoot Yan was not present. The purpose of the meeting was to pass the regulations, and elect a committee for theassociation. Lo said that the regulations were unanimously passed; that the meeting elected the following committee:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%">Tang Nai Cheuk</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%">Wong Kwan Wai</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%">Tsui Man Hing</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%">Wu Kok</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%">Chan Pui Kee</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%">Li Chi Hing</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%">Hui Tang Man</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%">Madam Sze Tai</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%">Chan Yuen Chen</td>        </tr>    </table>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Lo said that both Dr. C.C. Wong and Mr. Paulie were present at this meeting; but that neither of them were elected to the committee;that Lo &amp; Lo were subsequently instructed to deal with the incorporation of what was to be known as "Mirador Mansion Owners AssociationLtd." (Ex. MMM); but that it was found that in the meantime the 1st plaintiffs had been incorporated on 19th March 1966, and thatit was therefore not possible to register the Mirador Mansion Owners Association Ltd.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p252" class="pseudopara" id="p252">252.</a> Lo's version of the various meetings was not put to Paulie. Nonetheless I find it quite extraordinary that Paulie should have saidnothing in evidence about the 2nd defendants' efforts to form an association and of the fact that he was elected as a member of apreparatory committee. Clearly, after the meetings of April, May and July 1965, Paulie made efforts to form another association (describedby Mr. Bernacchi, in my view very accurately, as a "rival association"); and it developed into a race as to which association wasregistered first.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p253" class="pseudopara" id="p253">253.</a> Lo said that he knew that Paulie had convened a meeting in the passageway of the 2nd floor for 3rd November 1965; that he was notinvited to attend but that a Mr. Ma Man Fai had written to him suggesting that he should attend; that he did so; and that Mrs. ElsieElliott and Mr. Ma Man Fai made speeches.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p254" class="pseudopara" id="p254">254.</a> Mr. Zimmern had some caustic comments to make about Paulie's tactics in inviting a member of the Urban Council and a person associatedwith some organisation called the United Nations Association of Hongkong to attend this meeting. Of course, what matters to me asa trial judge is not whether Mrs. Elliott or Mr. Ma Man Fai attended the meeting. What I am interested in is: How many of the co-ownersof Mirador Mansion attended that meeting? The evidence on this was left extremely vague. Lo could not remember how many attended.He was not in the chair and he kept no minutes. If the meeting was called pursuant to clause 15 of the Deed of Mutual Covenant, arecord "of the persons present at the meeting and the proceedings thereof" should have been kept by the chairman in accordance withclause 15(f); but no such record was produced by Paulie. Lo said that many of the workers in the tailors workshops attended "outof curiosity". But what, if anything, was decided is not known to this court.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p255" class="pseudopara" id="p255">255.</a> The plaintiffs left me completely in the dark as to the number of co-owners actually living in Mirador Mansion. One would have thoughtthat having chosen to allege nuisance they would at least have given me some indication of that. There is no means of knowing whetherany of the 2nd plaintiffs live in the building; but, as regards the defendants, the addresses for service endorsed on the originalwrit of summons may offer some guidance. Indeed it is very revealing. The addresses for service of 39 out of the 54 defendants (Nos.6-59 inclusive) are not addresses in Mirador Mansion. The addresses for service of 75 out of the 100 defendants (Nos.75-174 inclusive)are not addresses in Mirador Mansion. It may be that that could be taken as some slight indication that 74% of all the co-ownersdo not live in Mirador Mansion. Certainly the plaintiffs have not done or said anything to suggest otherwise.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p256" class="pseudopara" id="p256">256.</a> And if it is true to say that 74% of all the co-owners do not live in Mirador Mansion, just how many co-owners attended that meetingon 3rd November 1965? It is impossible to say; but on the material before me, it would appear that not many attended.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p257" class="pseudopara" id="p257">257.</a> During the cross-examination of Lo, the circular letter dated 28th October 1965 (Ex. NNN) calling the meeting of 3rd November 1965was put in by consent. It reads:-</p>    <blockquote>		"In view of the worsening condition of the building (Mirador Mansion) and the irresponsibility on the part of the present management,we Owners and Tenants feel that we shall have to suffer serious damage through the sharp dropping of our property value and the flatsbecoming gradually no longer livable.<p>Though many owners and tenants have complained either verbally or in writing, and requested the management to carry out certain necessaryimprovements and repairs, the management simply ignored such, but still continue collecting monthly dues without rendering the necessaryservices.</p>		Since this building is ideally located at Tsim Sha Tsui, the value of our property can be easily made to increase		<u>IF</u> it is properly managed and taken care of. After consulting legal experts and community leaders, we are advised that we can collectivelybring pressure on the present management and make them to effect the improvements.<p>Therefore we promoters of the Preparatory Committee of Mirador Owners and Tenants, propose to call a meeting of all parties concernedon Wednesday 3rd November 1965 at 8 p.m. at the opening beside the lift on 2/F1. to discuss this matter, which so vitally effectsour interests.

PPP3) which began:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Are you one of those thoughtless co-owners or tenants who has not contributed towards our Legal Action Fund nor paid your annual$12 subscription per unit."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Towards the end of the letter he said:-</p>    <blockquote>		"(a). ............. $97,960 of our initial water and electricity deposit is yet to be accounted for (b) a discrepancy of $45,248.21in Crown Rent and Premium over the past 7 years (c) the 12 units which are still in Mr. Chan's name do not and have not paid CrownRent or Premium, nor do the additional 14 units and (d) approximately $460,000 illegal rental collected on the additional units duringthe past 5 1/2 years .....<p>If you or any of your friends has been served a writ, it is never too late to make amends ............................"</p>	</blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p262" class="pseudopara" id="p262">262.</a> Mr. Zimmern did not mince his words when commenting on Exs. NNN and PPP. He said that many, who apparently have contributed to the'Legal Action Fund' in the belief that they were on to a good thing, were grossly misled (1) by being told a pack of lies about the1st defendant by a handful of malicious or badly-advised individuals and (2) that the majority of those who paid, did so under threatof being made a defendant if they did not pay. He drew attention particularly to the passage in Ex. NNN reading:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"............. we are advised that we can collectively bring pressure on the present management and make them to effect the improvements".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">He also drew attention to the fact that the 7 signatories of the letter Ex. NNN had thought fit to add the letters "U.N.A." to thename of their committee.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p263" class="pseudopara" id="p263">263.</a> I agree with Mr. Zimmern that, on the evidence which has been placed before me, I can not possibly put the matter any higher thanto say that the 1st plaintiffs are the agents of some of the co-owners or tenants. As to how many, I simply do not know; but thereis no solid foundation in evidence for the belief that they represent more than a handful of the co-owners.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p264" class="pseudopara" id="p264">264.</a> Assuming that they are agents for some of the co-owners, this does not entitle them to sue in a representative capacity. <u>London Association of Shopowners and Brokers Ltd. and another v. London and India Docks Joint Committee and another</u><sup>(2)</sup> appears to be clear authority on this point.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p265" class="pseudopara" id="p265">265.</a> But paragraph 1 of the statement of claim was amended so as to read "............ owners and/or occupiers of the building ........";and it is argued that the 1st plaintiffs are occupiers, presumably so as to entitle them to sue in nuisance.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p266" class="pseudopara" id="p266">266.</a> They are not a party to the Deed of Mutual Covenant. They are not assignees of any share in the building. But Mr. Paulie said thattheir registered office is his shop and that one of his staff does a certain amount of work (presumably clerical) for the associationand receives some payment for doing so. There was no independent evidence about this. I am quite satisfied that Mr. Paulie worksextremely hard in the name of the 1st plaintiff association; but I am very doubtful indeed as to whether anyone else does.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p267" class="pseudopara" id="p267">267.</a> On this slender evidence, I suppose I can say that the 1st plaintiff association is a licencee in Mirador Mansion; but this doesnot give it any proprietary right to shop 60, 2nd floor; and in view of the decision in <u>Malone v. Laskey and another</u><sup>(3)</sup>, I do not see how it can be argued that the 1st plaintiff association can sue in nuisance. At page 305 Gorell Barnes P. said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Many cases have been cited with reference to persons having proprietary rights in property which has been injured by a nuisance,but no authority has been cited, and no principle formulated, which would enable a person in the position of the plaintiffs, havingno right of property, to sue for damages for personal injury caused by a nuisance."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">It is true that the ratio decidendi of <u>Malone</u><sup>(3)</sup> was over-ruled in <u>Billings &amp; Sons Ltd. v. Redin</u><sup>(4)</sup> so far as actions in negligence are concerned; but, as the editors of Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Tort (12th Ed.) say at page 645 note76, <u>Billings</u><sup>(4)</sup> does not affect the authority of <u>Malone</u><sup>(3)</sup> so far as concerns actions in nuisance. Mr. Bernacchi argued that the law relating to contractual licences has developed considerablyover the last 20 years, and he cited <u>Errington v. Errington</u><sup>(5)</sup>; but the law appears to be clearly stated by Clerk &amp; Lindsell at paragraph 1283 where the learned authors say:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Apart from rights arising from public nuisance, the person who can sue for a nuisance is the person in possession or occupation ofthe land affected. A licensee without possession has no right of action."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p268" class="pseudopara" id="p268">268.</a> Having had all the evidence placed before me I entirely agree with the view expressed by Huggins J. upon the interlocutory applicationto strike out the writ as disclosing no cause of action. The writ in its original form was a nullity; and if it had come before mein its original form unquestionably I would have struck it out as disclosing no cause of action against any of the defendants. Inmy view the 1st plaintiffs have no standing to sue either in a representative capacity or as an occupier of the building.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p269" class="pseudopara" id="p269">269.</a> In his closing address, Mr. Bernacchi said that there was "no difference" between the 1st plaintiff association and the 2nd plaintiffs.If, by this statement, counsel meant that the 1st plaintiff association consisted of the 41 named 2nd plaintiffs there is no evidenceof this. In their statement of defence, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants say:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The 2nd plaintiffs' rights, interests, duties and liabilities as co-owners of the said building are set out in their respective saleand purchase agreements (if any) and deed of assignment all subject to a Deed of Mutual Covenant dated 28th April 1960 to which saiddocuments these defendants will refer for their full terms and effect".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The defendants did not have the opportunity of referring to sale and purchase agreements and deeds of assignment relating to the 2ndplaintiffs as co-owners because the latter neither produced their titles to any share in the building nor gave evidence. From anexamination of Exs. E, W, HHH and III, I find that all the named 2nd plaintiffs are co-owners of shares in Mirador Mansion with theexception of Nos. 10, 15, 17, 20, 28 and 29. Of course, shares in the building may have been transferred to these 6 plaintiffs recently.Also, it is not easy to identify a number of names as the romanized spelling on Exs. E and W varies. However, Mr. Zimmern did notmake an issue of this; and he was prepared to accept that the 2nd plaintiffs were all unit holders. Indeed, Huen Kwok Chai producedtwo extracts from the books of the 3rd defendants. The first (Ex. HHH) is a list of 16 of the 2nd plaintiffs who are in arrears withthe payment of management fees! The record (Ex. III) is a list of 10 of the 2nd plaintiffs who are now putting their units to industrialuse! Ex. HHH reads:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">"<u>Names of Plaintiffs</u></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote"><u>Units</u></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">Outstanding<u><br>			Management Fee</u></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">Joseph Albert Gutierrez</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote">Flat A12 16 F.</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">1/68 - 2/70</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">Wong Shoot Yan</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote">Shop 40 G/F</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">4/67 - 2/70</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">Wong Shoot Yan</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote">Shop 45 G/F</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">4/67 - 2/70</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">Lie Pea Ying</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote">Shop 44 1/F</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">4/67 - 2/70</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">Sung Tsen Young</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote">Shop 43 G/F</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">4/67 - 2/70</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">Mohammed Hassan Sedick</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote">Shop 27 2/F</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">4/67 - 2/70</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">Shzu Tsucy</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote">Flat B2 12/F</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">6/68 - 2/70</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">Chan Yu Ceng Nguk</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote">Shop 58 2/F</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">4/67 - 2/70</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">Chen Chong Sung</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote">Flat B1 12/F</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">9/68 - 2/70</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">Chan Kwai Ying</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote">Flat B5 7/F</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">6/69 - 2/70</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">Patrick Go</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote">Shop 59 2/F</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">4/67 - 2/70</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">Hau But Hing</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote">Flat A14 3/F</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">10/69 - 2/70</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">Chan Lai Fat</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote">Flat C4 5/F</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">4/67- 2/70</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">Tsui Wan Shan</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="29%" class="quote">Flat A3 3/F</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="29%" class="quote">6/68 - 2/70</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="38%" class="quote">G.

From an examination of Ex. W it would appear that 33 of the 2nd plaintiffs and 113 defendants are, between them,the "owners" of 258 units in Mirador Mansion. Deducting 258 from 752 leaves 494.

Ellis</u> <sup>(6)</sup>, in particular upon the following passage from the judgment of Lord Macnaghten at pp 7/8:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In considering whether a representative action is maintainable, you have to consider what is common to the class, not what differentiatesthe cases of individual members - - - - - - - - - - - - under the old practice the court required the presence of all parties interestedin the matter in suit, in order that a final end might be made of the controversy. But when the parties were so numerous that younever could 'come at justice', to use an expression in one of the older cases, if everybody interested was made a party, the rulewas not allowed to stand in the way. It was originally a rule of convenience : for the sake of convenience it was relaxed. Givena common interest and a common grievance, a representative suit was in order if the relief sought was in its nature beneficial toall whom the plaintiff proposed to represent."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p273" class="pseudopara" id="p273">273.</a> Of course the vital factor is common interest. Is the relief sought in its nature beneficial to all whom the 2nd plaintiffs proposeto represent? Undoubtedly the original building scheme was: a shopping arcade on the ground, 1st and 2nd floors, residential flatson floors Nos. 3 - 16 with a carport in the basement. The developer certainly altered that scheme by letting out the basement forpurposes other than as a carport for the use of residents in the upper floors of the building. But there has been no complaint aboutthat during the 10 years that the building has been in existence; and it is not an issue in this case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p274" class="pseudopara" id="p274">274.</a> As I have said, the 1st defendant did not assign any portion of the building for industrial use; but I have no doubt that he waswell aware that a very considerable number of the co-owners of units on floors Nos. 3 - 16 were using the flats for industrial purposes.As a co-owner (certainly till 1967 if not up till the present) he took no action to put a stop to such unlawful user; and neitherdid any of the other co-owners do so until the institution of this action.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p275" class="pseudopara" id="p275">275.</a> What has been the general attitude of the great body of co-owners involved in this unlawful user of the building? One of the mostsignificant pieces of evidence in this case emanated from the lips of a Mr. Advaney who was called by the plaintiffs. He said thathe managed all the property in Hong Kong owned by the Sitlanis (2nd and 3rd named of the 2nd plaintiffs).

Considering the purchase price of these units, theSitlanis have, of course, made a magnificont investment. Mr. Advaney was being cross-examined about the fact that the Sitlanis appearedto be making a handsome profit out of the letting of flat F.4 on the 8th floor, having purchased the flat for $52,160 and rentingit out for $8,400 per year! He said (as if by way of justification) :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If one rented F.4 for industrial purposes one could get $1,200 - $1,500 per month rent!"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">How many of the "absentee" 74% of the co-owners of Mirador Mansion are collecting and for years have been collecting, rents of thisorder by letting out their units for industrial purposes? I visited the premises. I have no reason to disagree with the estimateof 200 units being used for industrial purposes. How many of the 200 shops in the ground, 1st and 2nd floors heartily approve ofhaving cutting establishments and jewellery repair workshops near to their retail establishments? Mr. Mirchandani frankly admittedthat it suited his purpose. None of these co-owners could have come into this court and justified such breaches of the Conditionsof Regrant and the assignments. But I am considering common interest and mutual benefit at the moment.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p276" class="pseudopara" id="p276">276.</a> The impression I have got in this case is that the great majority of the co-owners wish things to remain as they are; they wouldnot welcome losing a lucrative sourse of revenue from the industrial lettings; but there is a minority who, for various reasons,wish to put the clock back to 1959 and to make the 1st defendant pay for it.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p277" class="pseudopara" id="p277">277.</a> All co-owners hold their shares in the building subject to the Conditions of Regrant which prohibit industrial user. Under Clause11(c) of the Deed of Mutual Covenant, each party covenanted not to use "his part" for any unlawful purpose. But, in my view, a verylarge number of the owners of units on the upper floors (who do not live in the building themselves) have, in breach of special condition(b) of the Conditions of Regrant permitted industrial user of those units; and this user very probably has the tacit approval ofthe co-owners or tenants of many of the shops on the ground, 1st and 2nd floors. If the truth were known, probably a comparativelysmall number of co-owners disapprove of such user.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p278" class="pseudopara" id="p278">278.</a> I am well aware that in a representative action, the representatives do not need to have the consent of those whom they purport torepresent. But in view of the apparent attitude of the great body of co-owners so far as that has been disclosed to me by the meagreevidence called, I am not prepared to permit the 2nd plaintiffs to sue in a representative capacity. But, of course, as co-owners,they are quite entitled to sue each on his own behalf.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p279" class="pseudopara" id="p279">279.</a> But, how many defendants have these plaintiffs succeeded in bringing before the court? Mr. Bernacchi submitted that in February 1969Huggins J. did not give conditional leave to amend the statement of claim; that he gave leave to amend and then proceeded to orderthat the amended writ and re-amended statement of claim should be re-served on all defendants; that the fact that this order wasnot carried out simply means that the defendants have disobeyed the judge's order; but that it does not affect my jurisdiction togive judgment against 77 defendants; that it is in the discretion of this court to do so; and that having regard to the fact thatall the major amendments to the writ affected the first three defendants only and that the plaintiffs' case against the occupiersof illegal structures and co-owners and tenants using their premises for industrial purposes was not materially changed, that noinjustice would be done if reliefs were granted against all 77 defendants although only 25 were served with the re-amended statementof claim.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p280" class="pseudopara" id="p280">280.</a> Of course, it has to be remembered that the figures 77 and 25 include several defendants in the group 6 - 59; and the only apparentreason for joining this group of defendants was the fact that they did not join with the plaintiffs in the institution of this action(paragraph 7 of the statement of claim). In February 1968, Hastings &amp; Co., representing the 7th, 14th and 39th defendants wroteto the plaintiffs' solicitors (Ex.C12) requesting particulars of the allegation that their clients were liable to the plaintiffsfor damages in tort. On 29th February 1968, the plaintiffs solicitors replied as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"- - - - - - no claim for damages is made against 7th, 14th and 39th defendants. They were included as defendants solely because theyhad not indicated to our clients that they were prepared to join as plaintiffs".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Chan Pui Kee (12th defendant till the beginning of this action) received a similar letter. Edmund Cheung &amp; Young (acting for the28th defendant) received this letter dated 4th April 1968 from the plaintiffs' solicitors (Ex.C16):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"- - - - - - The reason why he is joined as a defendant is that he is a co-owner of the building and is therefore a necessary party,inter alia, to an order that the management of the said building be made over to the plaintiffs - - - - - - "</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">If that is so, one wonders why the other 250 co-owners were not made defendants or plaintiffs. Be that as it may, why these solicitorsdid not apply to have the names of their clients struck out of the writ long ago, I do not know. Anyway, I shall not grant any reliefsagainst defendants 6 - 59.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p281" class="pseudopara" id="p281">281.</a> In <u>Jamaica Railway Co. v. Colonial Bank</u><sup>(7)</sup> Stirling LJ said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"- - - - - when an application is made for amendment, it is the duty of the judge to consider the nature of the amendment which isproposed, and if he finds that the alteration proposed, either in the constitution of the suit by the addition of parties, or inits character by the alteration of the endorsement, is such as to introduce a substantially new case which would not naturally bebrought to the notice of the absent defendant by the original writ, it would be right for him to impose, as a term of granting leaveto make the amendment, the condition that the amended writ should be personally served on the absent defendant".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Huggins J. had no reason to suspect that the original writ had only been served on 91 defendants. No doubt he thought that it hadbeen served on all 174. Admittedly he did not say in the order that he was granting leave upon condition that the re-amended writwould be re-served; but clearly this was his intention. It certainly would have been my intention if I had been in his position.Not only was the very much amended writ of June 1968 not served on any of the defendants; but on the re-amended writ of February1969 there was an entirely new group of plaintiffs.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p282" class="pseudopara" id="p282">282.</a> No relief is sought against defendant No. 75. The action has been discontinued against a number of other defendants; and, apart fromdefendants Nos. 1 - 5, this action now concerns 51 defendants as follows:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="5%">(1)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="94%">defendants Nos. 60-68, 70-74, 178 and 179 ("illegal shops and stalls") (Total 16).</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="5%">(2)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="94%">defendants Nos. 77, 78, 80, 82, 84, 85, 88, 90, 91, 95, 101, 106, 108, 111, 112, 119, 122, 128, 131, 136, 137, 141 (1st named), 143,144, 145, 146, 147, 149, 150, 155, 157, 160, 167, 168, and 177 ("workshops") (Total 35).</td>        </tr>    </table>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The 77 defendants served with either the original writ or the re-amended writ and re-amended statement of claim include the above51 defendants</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p283" class="pseudopara" id="p283">283.</a> The 25 defendants served with the re-amended writ and re-amended statement of claim include 16 defendants as follows:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="5%">(1)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="94%">Nos. 60, 62, 63, 64, 66, 178 and 179 ("illegal shops and stalls") (Total 7)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="5%">(2)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="94%">Nos. 77, 95, 141 (1st named), 143, 144, 145, 146, 167, and 177 ("workshops") (Total 9).</td>        </tr>    </table>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p284" class="pseudopara" id="p284">284.</a> Therefore so far as the reliefs claimed against the defendants concerned with the "illegal shops and stalls" and "workshops" areconcerned the question is whether 16 or 5 ...(illegible) defendants were served - not whether 25 or 77 were served.

There is an endorsement by Lo and Lo on the re-amended writ that they accepted service on behalfof these 5 defendants. As regards the remainder, no difficulty arises in regard to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 who were represented by Mr. Zimmernat the trial. The 95th and 143rd defendants appeared in person and gave evidence. There is an endorsement by Stewart &amp; Co. onthe re-amended writ to the effect that substituted service, as ordered, was effected on defendants numbers 5, 20, 21, 28, 37, 77and 143. The 144th defendant filed a defence on 2rd April 1969 i.e. six weeks after the order of 21st February 1969. But no affidavitof service of the re-amended writ on the 41st, 141st(1st named), 145th 146th, 167th, 177th, 178th, or 179th defendants has been filed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p286" class="pseudopara" id="p286">286.</a> Therefore I suppose that, in strictness, the only defendants against whom any reliefs could be granted are Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 20, 21,28, 37, 60, 62, 63, 64, 66, 77, 95, 143, and 144 (Total 17).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p287" class="pseudopara" id="p287">287.</a> How on earth all this was not spotted upon the hearing of the Summons for Directions passes my comprehension.

Nothing else seemed to matter to them.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p289" class="pseudopara" id="p289">289.</a> The statement of claim in this case was very badly drafted in the first place. It would have been far better to have redrafted itentirely in 1968 instead of attempting to amend it. This process of amendment continued till the very last day of the trial; andI say, without hesitation, that the statement of claim is one of the most confusing pleadings I have ever had the misfortune to haveto deal with.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p290" class="pseudopara" id="p290">290.</a> The reliefs claimed occupy some 8 pages (pages 12-20). Quite a number of the prayers were framed in such broad terms that no onecould say with certainty to which allegations they referred. On the last day of the trial, Mr. Asome clarified the plaintiffs' attitudeconsiderably. A number of reliefs were struck out altogether and others were explained.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p291" class="pseudopara" id="p291">291.</a> Even now there appears to be a great deal of repetition; and instead of dealing with each subject (for example "the workshops") inone section, there are groups of prayers pertaining to particular groups of defendants. Some confusion appears to have resulted fromthe plaintiffs' fear at the commencement of the proceedings in 1967 that the 1st defendant might endeavour to throw the blame onthe 2nd and 3rd defendants. In fact he did nothing of the kind. His attitude throughout was that the 2nd and 3rd defendant companiesare entirely under his control. I do not propose to say any more than that. It is quite unnecessary to make formal declarations assought in prayer (a) "as against the 2nd defendants" and prayer (b) "as against the 3rd defendants" on the lower half of p.17 ofthe statement of claim.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p292" class="pseudopara" id="p292">292.</a> For the same reason, it is pointless to consider further prayer (d) at the top of page 18; and all the reliefs set out on pages 12-16can be taken together.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p293" class="pseudopara" id="p293">293.</a> The first prayer (a) on pages 12/13 is for a declaration that the appointment by the 1st defendant of the 2nd defendants to the managementof Mirador Mansion was wrongful. The plaintiffs say it was wrongful because they were not consulted and because they were shown "theout-of-date schedule" attached to the Deed of Mutual Covenant. I have already dealt with paragraph 11 of the statement of claim;and I do not propose to elaborate further here. I see nothing wrongful in the fact that the 2nd defendants were appointed to carryon the management until the co-owners themselves chose to put clause 15 of the Deed of Mutual Covenant into operation. I refuse tomake the declaration sought.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p294" class="pseudopara" id="p294">294.</a> The next prayer (b) at the top of page 13 is for</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="5%" class="quote">"(b)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="93%" class="quote">a declaration that the collected amounts of annual premium by the 1st defendant are in excess of that demanded by Government in respectthereof."</td>        </tr>    </table>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">From the summary attached to page 1 of Ex.W and page 11 of Ex.D, it is clear that the premium collected by the 1st defendant is $512.95in excess of the $140,995 which he was obliged to pay annually to Government under the Conditions of Regrant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p295" class="pseudopara" id="p295">295.</a> The next prayer (c) on page 13 reads:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="5%" class="quote">"(c)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="94%" class="quote">That accounts for the 6 years immediately preceding the issue of the writ herein be ordered to show in what manner the said annualpremium has been apportioned between the units of the said building, and to show what sums have been collected in excess of thosedemanded by Government."</td>        </tr>    </table>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">What purpose would an order for accounts serve?

In view of this prayer, one might have expectedthat the auditor would have been asked to check whether Mrs. Sibal had paid any premium since 1960. But I do not see how it couldbe otherwise.

As soon as the owners temselves invoke clause 15 of the Deed of MutualCovenant, the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd defendants will be duty bound to hand over the management to whatever body has been legally appointed.They shall have no choice in the matter.

It is refused; and it follows that no orders are called for in regard to prayers (k) and (1) on page 14.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p304" class="pseudopara" id="p304">304.</a> Prayer (m) reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A declaration that their actions in respect of the said building have been in fraud of the plaintiffs including the co-owners whomthey represent or are otherwise wrongful."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">I had no idea what this referred to until Mr. Asome in his closing address said that this claim was limited to the alleged fraudulentcollection of over $42,000 referred to in paragraph 17 of the statement of claim.

The co-owners clearly approved of the appointment of Chan Kin as their cleaningcontractor and they dealt with him direct for 10 years. The defendants charged him $12,000 for putting the cleaning contract in hisway; but according to the auditor, the money was spent on the building and they have accounted satisfactorily for it. If the co-ownersare dissatisfied with Chan Kin's work they can terminate his services at any time. It is up to them to hold meetings and pass thenecessary resolutions. The remedy lies in their own hands.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p310" class="pseudopara" id="p310">310.</a> These co-owners paid Chan Kin only $8 per month to do all the cleaning and removal of garbage. It is unthinkable that any court would,after 10 years, order that his accounts be investigated. What did these co-owners expect for $8 per month?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p311" class="pseudopara" id="p311">311.</a> The next group of reliefs with which I shall now deal concern the "workshops"; and, as I have said, this does not now concern the1st defendant because on the last day of the trial, upon the application of Mr. Asome, the third line from the bottom of page 16was amended by the deletion of the words "1st defendant". The reliefs therefore concern only defendants 76-78, 80-96, 98-115, 117-124,126-132, and 134-177.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p312" class="pseudopara" id="p312">312.</a> If there is any merit in this largely misconceived and badly-drafted statement of claim, it lies in the reliefs sought against the"workshops". At the invitation of counsel for the plaintiffs I visited Mirador Mansion at the commencement of the trial. It is reallyan awful "shambles". I see no reason to doubt the evidence of Mr. Paulie or the statements he has made in letters over the yearsin regard to the state of the building. The general impression one gets is that a fair proportion of the flats on the upper floorsare being used for industrial purposes - many tailor's cutting establishments with large numbers of sewing machines in operation;jewellery workshops involving the constant use of small hammers and blowlamps or such-like instruments; large numbers of fokis employedby each workshop, many of whom live as well as work in the flats, sometimes sleeping in the passageways in hot weather and sometimescooking there. I saw 2 units which were clearly brothels. Quite a number of restaurants of a kind are operated in the passagewaysto provide meals for this mass of working humanity. The passageways and stairs are damaged and the walls are tawdry as a result ofthe sheer volume of traffic - industrial traffic, trolleys etc. - to and from units used as godowns and workshops. The toilet facilitieswere never designed to cope with this mass of humanity.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p313" class="pseudopara" id="p313">313.</a> Industrial user of this sort results in far more refuse than domestic user - tailor's cuttings, refuse from the restaurants, andso on. I do not see how any cleaning contractor could have kept the stairs and passageways in a condition such as one would expectfor say middle class domestic user - certainly not for $8 per month; and if $250,000 were to be spent now on a general clean-up,the condition of the building would be as bad as it is now in 3 months time if industrial user on the present scale were permitted.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p314" class="pseudopara" id="p314">314.</a> In my view, all Mr. Paulie's troubles, or the majority of them, stem from the fact that a large number of "absentee" co-owners lettheir units for industrial use. What do these absentees care if they can continue to draw fat rents every month? After all, the purchaseprices of the majority of the flats were very low - a magnificent investment for these co-owners; and, of course, it suits the shopsin the arcade to have jewellery and tailors' cutting establishments upstairs, so conveniently situated to their retail shops. Nowonder none of these people have come to court to complain.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p315" class="pseudopara" id="p315">315.</a> Mr. Zimmern submits that this court should do nothing about the "workshops". He says that this building supplied a very real needin the Tsim Sha Tsui area during the period 1959 to date, and that it still does with tourism increasing; that Mr. Paulie and a fewpeople whom he has managed to get to support him are in a small minority and that the wishes of the vast majority of the co-ownersare that the status quo should remain undisturbed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p316" class="pseudopara" id="p316">316.</a> Mr. Bernacchi endeavoured to give me the impression that the Crown were about to re-enter at any moment because the co-owners werein breach of special condition (b) of the Conditions of Regrant. I do not think that there was any evidence to support this. Theonly scintilla of evidence to which the plaintiffs could point was the routine letter dated 23rd May, 1961 from the Crown lands &amp;Surveys Office (Ex.C1). The fact that the Labour Department have registered a number of "factories" does not indicate that the Crownare about to descend upon the co-owners at any moment. But, in any event, I am not concerned with what the Crown intends to do vis-a-visthe 1st defendant; and the 1st defendant can not be held responsible to his co-owners for all this industrial user. As a co-ownerhe could have taken action to enforce the Conditions of Regrant; but as a co-owner his right to do so was no greater than that ofany other co-owner; and the fact that he declined to take any action at the invitation of Mr. Paulie is neither here nor there. Inany event, the plaintiffs themselves, at the end of the day, now acknowledge that the 1st defendant can not be held responsible forall this industrial user. The fault lies in the great body of co-owners themselves.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p317" class="pseudopara" id="p317">317.</a> On the other thand, this does not preclude the plaintiffs from coming to court and asking for injunctions to prevent the continuedbreach of special condition (b); and the fact that some of the plaintiffs themselves do not come into court with clean hands, shouldnot prejudice the claims of the others. Furthermore, I do not see why an injunction should not issue against "absentees", who areclearly liable for the acts of their tenants under the proviso to clause 13 of the Deed of Mutual Covenant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p318" class="pseudopara" id="p318">318.</a> The first group of prayers for relief against "the workshops" appear at (a) (b) (c) (d) and (e) on the top half of page 17 of thestatement of claim:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">"(a)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%" class="quote">A declaration that they and each of them are in breach of the said Deed of Mutual Covenant.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%" class="quote">A declaration that they and each of them are in breach of the said Conditions of Regrant.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(c)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%" class="quote">Injunctions to restrain them, whether by themselves, their agents or servants, from further breach of the said Deed of Mutual Covenantand of the Conditions of Regrant.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(d)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%" class="quote">Mandatory injunctions to compel them not to continue to do anything in breach of the said Deed of Mutual Covenant and/or in breachof the said Conditions of Regrant.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(e)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%" class="quote">A declaration that the plaintiffs including the co-owners whom they represent are entitled to damages for the said breaches of thesaid Deed of Mutual Covenant and of the said Conditions of Regrant."</td>        </tr>    </table>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Prayer (f) was abandoned by Mr. Asome.

In regard to prayer (d) at the top of p.20 and prayer (e) in the middle of page17, the plaintiffs do not represent anyone but themselves. Mr. Asome said in regard to each prayer:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The damage to the plaintiffs may be nil. But we do ask for a declaration. If the Crown re-enter, this declaration may be very useful."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">So far as the evidence goes the damage to the plaintiffs is nil; and I do not propose to make the declaration sought in prayer (e)or to make any order under prayer (d) above.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p320" class="pseudopara" id="p320">320.</a> I suppose it was because it was realised that prayers (a) (b) (c) and (d) on page 17 were so badly drafted that it was decided toadd prayers (a) and (b) at the foot of page 19. No court makes general declarations or grants omnibus injunctions of the kind soughtby the prayers on page 17. The plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration in terms of prayer (a) and injunctions in terms of prayer(b) at the foot of page 19.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p321" class="pseudopara" id="p321">321.</a> But against whom are these reliefs to be granted? Firstly I do not like Ex.L at all. Apart from the peculiarities to which I havedrawn attention, surely the plaintiffs could, at least, have called a witness to say: "I walked round the building yesterday, andI noted down all the units which are still being operated as tailors workshops, jewellery workshops" and so on; I would then havehad an up-to-date picture of the state of the building. It is perfectly obvious that a large number of units are being used for industrialpurposes; but can I be sure that all the units mentioned on Ex.L are <u>now</u> being so used? The evidence which the 95th and 143rd defendants gave is such that I do not think that the plaintiffs have provedanything against them.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p322" class="pseudopara" id="p322">322.</a> Therefore if 17 defendants are before the court, relief may be granted against Nos. 77 and 144 only!

But, as I say, all that mattered to these plaintiffs was that as much mud as possible should be flungat the 1st defendant; and they went to trial alleging that he had "sold or let off" portions of the building for industrial purposes(paragraph 22) well knowing that they did not have a scrap of evidence to support this allegation. Indeed their one and only witness(Paulie) gave evidence contrary to this allegation.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p323" class="pseudopara" id="p323">323.</a> I propose to take a rather unusual course.

Of course, noone has suggested that the co-owners are obstructed in the use of the escalators and lifts etc. All we know is that certain smallareas have been built upon; and the architect has given the exact measurements of the structures, which I have quoted above.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p331" class="pseudopara" id="p331">331.</a> In deciding whether to make the orders sought by the plaintiffs, I have to consider the history of this building; that a large numberof co-owners began, illegally, to use their premises for industrial purposes; that, as a result, conditions deteriorated, and manyco-owners refused, and still refuse, to pay a cent in management fees, that until these workshops disappear and perhaps new tenantstake over, the building has to be managed somehow; the accounts show clearly that the management is costing the 1st defendant a veryconsiderable sum of money; if he did not get the $50,000 or $60,000 rent from the "illegal shops and stalls" he would presumablystop managing the building immediately because clearly he could not carry on without losing money very heavily; and he is not undercontract to manage Mirador Mansion. At most, he is nothing more than collecting agent for the co-owners in respect of various amountsunder clauses 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Deed of Mutual Covenant. If the co-owners will not pay so as to enable him to manage this buildingsatisfactorily, there is no obligation upon him, legally or morally, to carry on.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p332" class="pseudopara" id="p332">332.</a> It is also of the greatest importance to remember that not one plaintiff or any co-owner other than Mr. Paulie has come to say thathe was inconvenienced or obstructed in getting to the lifts or escalators or that he could not walk up or down the stairs at anytime of the day or night.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p333" class="pseudopara" id="p333">333.</a> I do not think it would be right for me at this stage to order that these "illegal" structures be demolished. This does not meanthat the matter is res judicata. In any future proceedings, the facts might be quite different. Certainly I would hope that any tribunalthat may be seized of the issue would be better served in the matter of evidence than I have been in this case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p334" class="pseudopara" id="p334">334.</a> As regards the potential obstruction of the 4 fire escapes, I am content to leave this aspect to the appropriate Government departmentconcerned. If at any time the condition of these staircases is such as to constitute a fire risk, it is the duty of Government, upona proper complaint, to take appropriate action. Surely there is a simpler procedure than rushing to the Supreme Court for an injunction.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p335" class="pseudopara" id="p335">335.</a> At page 15, there is a prayer (w) for relief against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants which reads:-</p>    <blockquote>		"(w) Injunctions against the permitting of obstructions in the common passageways and corridors of the said building."</blockquote>    <p align="left">I refuse to grant this prayer. The 1st defendant and his companies are merely the agents of the co-owners for certain purposes. Theyare under no duty to see to it that the common passageways are not obstructed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p336" class="pseudopara" id="p336">336.</a> The final claims appear at page 20.

But in any event no court could or would make orders such as are sought.If the co-owners hold the appropriate meetings under clause 15 of the Deed of Mutual Covenant and a simple majority vote that thebuilding be managed by the 1st plaintiff association no order of court appointing the association as managers is called for, andthe court will grant immediate relief if the 1st, 2nd or 3rd defendants should refuse to co-operate in the handing over.
