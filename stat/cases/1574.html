I also made a similar rulingwith regard to certain pleadings regarding allegations of dishonesty or fraud.  These are the reasons for those rulings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  I shall also dispose of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs application to strike out some other paragraphs in those pleadings with regard to rescission and pecuniary rescission.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  I would mention at the outset that I am indebted to Mr McGhee QC and Mr Jarvis QC for guiding me through these applications.  Neitherof them were involved in this action before Waung J gave judgment on liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Relevant history of the action</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The background of the case is set out in the judgment of Waung J of 19 July 2005 [âthe Liability Judgmentâ].  I see no needto repeat the same here.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  However, in order to understand my reasons, it is necessary to recite some history of these proceedings.  The Writ in this actionwas issued on 3 November 1994.  At that stage, there were four defendants, including Bethleham Management Limited [âBMLâ], thepurchaser of the Property in question under the sale and purchase agreement of April 1987.  The relief claimed include general damages,and three declaratory relief, one of which is a claim for declaration against BML that the assignment of the Property is void andof no effect.  In substance, it sought to set aside that transaction vis-Ã -vis BML.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Shortly after the commencement of the action, the Defendants applied for the striking out of the claim.  From the affirmations filedin support of BMLâs application, BMLâs case was that it was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice and whatever wrongdoingalleged against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants could not affect BML.  The application succeeded on 17 May 2005 before Master Jones.  There was no appeal against thatorder.  BML ceased to be a party to this action.  Whilst the Master also struck out the Statement of Claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup><sup> </sup>Defendants, leave was granted to the Plaintiff to file a new Statement of Claim against them within 42 days.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  A new Statement of Claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was filed on 27 June 1995.  The prayers included claims for an order that the sale be rescinded or alternatively a declarationthat the sale ought to be rescinded and further if such rescission was not possible, damages in lieu of rescission.  In addition,there was a claim for general damages.  As mentioned, BML was no longer a party and the claim for rescission was not a claim forsetting aside the transaction as between the Plaintiff and BML.  I shall explain later how Mr McGhee argued on behalf of the Plaintiffthat it would still be meaningful to advance a claim for rescission in these circumstances. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Mr Javis submitted that a claim for general damages is inconsistent with rescission plus damages in lieu of rescission.  The Plaintiffshould therefore be required to elect from them.  He also submitted that an election had indeed been made at the next version ofthe Statement of Claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On 16 November 1998, the Plaintiff amended the new Statement of Claim.  The only substantive relief claimed were damages or inquiryinto what damages Electronics has suffered by reason of the Bankâs breach of the fiduciary duty and by reason of the undue influenceand/or economic duress exerted by the Bank.  The claim for rescission and damages in lieu of rescission disappeared, hence Mr Javisâcontention of election.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  By then, the Plaintiff was represented by the same firm of solicitors as it is today.  Mr McGhee was unable to give this court specificreason for such amendments apart from suggesting that it might be due to a new perception of the case by a new team of lawyers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Further amendments to the Statement of Claim were made on 17 September 2001.  Those amendments added (1) a claim for damages orinquiry into damages for concealment of the Bankâs association with or connection to BML and the Ho family; and (2) a claim foraggravated damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Finally, on 3 December 2002, another set of amendments deleted the general claim for damages and inquiry as to damages altogether.In its place, there were two claims for specific amount by way of damages for loss of rise in value of the Property and loss of netincome from the Property by reference to different dates.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  This final version was the version that was before Waung J when the order for split trial was made on 15 January 2004.  The Trialon Liability was also conducted by reference to this final version.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  As Mr Javis submitted, throughout the history of the pleadings prior to the Liability Judgment, there had not been any allegationsof fraud or dishonesty pleaded against the Bank or any of its officers.  Neither had there been any claim for exemplary damages. The only claim the Bank faced at the beginning of the trial was one for damages specifically pleaded and aggravated damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The question of split trial was first raised by Waung J at the pre-trial review in December 2003.  There was no application fortrial of preliminary issues.  Waung J ordered trial on liability in advance of the trial on quantum.  Given the prayers in the finalversion of the Statement of Claim, the question of quantum was primarily a question of assessment although Mr Fok for the defenceraised the possibility of statutory insolvency set off (see Paragraph 7 of the Judgment of 15 January 2004).  There was nothing beforeWaung J to suggest that the Plaintiff would seek to extend the scope of its claims to ask for exemplary damages or pecuniary rescission. Nor was there any suggestion that fraud and dishonesty would be relied upon at the assessment of quantum.  It is to be noted thatby then parties should have filed all evidence on quantum since the matter was originally listed for trial of everything startingin February 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  However, in the Liability Judgment, the split has been changed.  It became a split between Liability on the one hand and Remediesand Relief on the other. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Further, instead of sticking to the original pleadings, further pleadings were filed for the Trial on Relief and Remedies pursuantto the directions of Waung J on 12 September 2005.  The further pleadings filed by the Plaintiff raised substantial new heads ofclaims.  These are the pleadings that form the subject matter of the present strike out applications.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The way in which the matter have proceeded led to two problems that I have raised with counsel in the course of hearing,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Whether it is permissible for the Plaintiff to extend the scope of the claims substantially in the Statement of Damages and Reliefwithout any amendments to the Statement of Claim; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">If leave to amend is required by way of adding the new claims to the Statement of Claim, one highly relevant consideration is litigationprejudice that would be suffered by the Defendant if leave were granted.  For that consideration, it is important to identify theprecise limits to which the findings, observations and comments by Waung J in the Liability Judgment are binding or even if not binding,how relevant they were to Stage II of the trial.  As there is no clear dichotomy between the issues of liability and that of reliefand remedies, this present a problem.  To an extent, due to developments after the Liability Judgment that could not have been contemplatedby Waung J when the order for split trial was made, Stage I has become a trial on preliminary issues without having the issues preciselyformulated. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The need to plead the allegations in the Statement of Claim and the Plaintiffâs failure to do so</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The answer to the first question lies with the rules relating to pleadings.  Order 6 Rule 2 requires a writ be endorsed either witha statement of claim or a concise statement of the nature of the claim made or the relief or remedy required.  Order 18 Rule 15 requiresa statement of claim to state specifically the relief or remedy which the plaintiff claims.  Further it cannot raise a cause of actionnot mentioned in the writ nor arises from facts giving rise to the cause of action so mentioned.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Thus, it is not appropriate to raise in the reply a new cause of action (see <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2006</i> Paragraph 18/3/2).  A plaintiff who wishes to pursue an additional or alternative cause of action should do so by amending the statementof claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  This is not simply a technical rule.  A defendant to an action is entitled to know from the writ and statement of claim what arethe precise limits of claims he is faced with.  He should focus on the same and then put forward his case in his defence and preparefor the evidence accordingly.  He should be able to conduct the litigation and arrange his affairs on the basis that all the reliefand remedies claimed against him have been set out in the statement of claim, subject to any amendments that might be made to thatdocument.  He could, for example, consider whether to make any payment into court or any offer for settlement based on this.  Hecould also decide what is the proportionate time and costs that he should spend on the litigation by reference to those claims. A reply (or any subsequent pleadings) is not the right place for new claims to be put forward as it does not contain any prayersand a defendant does not have any automatic right to file any pleadings subsequent to reply (see Order 18 rule 4).  It would alsobe confusing for new claims to be buried amongst other positive allegations made in genuine reply to a defence.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In the present case, the trial on liability was conducted on the basis of claims pleaded in the final version of the Statement ofClaim.  Although the rules permit the court to grant leave for further pleadings to be filed after the reply (Order 18 rule 4) andsuch further pleadings could encompass pleadings for inquiry as to damages, such leave cannot negate the requirement under Order18 Rule 15.  I have not been taken to the rationale behind the directions of Waung J on 12 September 2005.  There is however nothingbefore me that suggests Waung J intended to give the Plaintiff an opportunity to expand on their existing claims pleaded in the finalversion of the Statement of Claim or to add new claims to the action by giving such directions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In my judgment, if the Plaintiff wishes to claim any relief or remedies that have not been included in the final version of Statementof Claim, it has to apply for leave to amend the same instead of pleading those in the Statement for Relief and Damages.  Mr McGheeindicated in his written submissions that the Plaintiff would ask for leave to amend if the court considers such a course necessary.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  At the outset of the hearing, in the light of Mr McGheeâs position, I indicated that I would proceed as if an application forleave to amend was before me by way of alternative to the primary resistance to the application for striking out.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Exemplary damages are clearly new claims that have not been advanced in the final version of the Statement of Claim.  It has tobe specifically pleaded (see <i>Jacob &amp; Goldrein, Pleadings: Principle and Practice</i> at p.90; Order 18 Rule 8(3)).  Even in a split trial situation, it should be pleaded at the outset in order to enable the judge whotried liability to form a view on the flagrancy of the defendantâs wrongdoing so that appropriate directions could be given tothe master or the judge who conducted the inquiry as to quantum.  The reason why such a task has to be performed by the judge whotried liability is that in most cases, the evidence relating to such flagrancy is the evidence that the judge would assess in relationto liability.  If no direction is given and if the issue of flagrancy turns on the same evidence, there is a risk of inconsistentfindings at different stages.  The existence of such a risk may militate against ordering a split trial and the judge should takethis into account.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In Paragraph 23 of the Re-Amended Statement of Relief and Damages the Plaintiff sought exemplary damages by reason of (a) the Bankacted in cynical disregard of its fiduciary duties to Electronics and Electronicsâ right not to sell the Property and likely adverseeffect of the sale on Esquire; and (b) the Bank was motivated by the desire to secure for itself the net proceeds of sale and/orthe desire to procure the transfer the Property to BML to further its good relationship with the Ho Family.  Particulars of theseallegations were given on 20 December 2005.  Several senior officers of the Bank were implicated.  These allegations were intimatelyconnected with the allegations of deliberate concealment put against the Bank at the trial on liability but they were expanded toa substantial degree.  One can see that there would be substantial overlapping in the evidence and the issues are intertwined.  Inmy judgment, all these have great significance in the consideration of litigation prejudice that I will consider below.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Rescission and pecuniary rescission are again nowhere to be found in any of the prayers in the final version of the Statement ofClaim.  If the Plaintiff wishes to seek relief by reference to the equitable doctrine of rescission or pecuniary rescission, it shouldbe pleaded in Statement of Claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The allegations of fraud and dishonesty are slightly different.  Mr McGhee was at pains to highlight that the Plaintiff is not advancingfraud and dishonesty as a cause of action.  However, the Plaintiff did use the words âfraudâ and âdishonestâ in its pejorativesense to describe the wrong committed by the Bank.  The purposes of the Plaintiff in advancing such serious allegations are threefolded,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">To persuade this court to adopt a less stringent test of causation: the Plaintiff will contend that the âbut-forâ test shall notbe applied by reason of the fraudulent and dishonest conducts on the part of the Bank; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">To persuade this court to adopt a wider test of remoteness which is not limited to foreseeability; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">To persuade this court to award compound interest. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Counsel had an interesting debate at the hearing on the utility of these three propositions on the facts of the present case.  Forreasons that would become apparent, I do not find it necessary to rule on the same.  Suffice to say by reference to the authoritiescited by Mr McGhee and his oral submissions, the Plaintiff intends by these serious allegations to impute a very high degree of moralturpitude against the Bank officers concerned.  The Plaintiff is not content with merely relying on a case of equitable fraud.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  By way of illustration, the Plaintiff wishes to rely on the approach on remoteness of damages applied in <i>Smith New Court Securities v Citibank</i>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20AC%20254" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] AC 254</a> regarding fraudulent misrepresentation and extended the same to the equitable wrongs and breach of fiduciary duties committed bythe Bank.  <i>Doyle v Olby</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%202%20QB%20158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 2 QB 158</a> was endorsed by the House of Lords as correctly stating the law regarding the measure of damages for fraudulent misrepresentation. Of the four points regarded as established in that case by Lord Browne-Wilkinson (p.264H to 265C), the relevant one for our purposesis the principle that damages for deceit are not limited to those which were reasonably foreseeable.  Further down at p.265G, HisLordship referred to measure for fraud as being treated as one in a special category.  At p.279 to 282, Lord Steyn explained thejustification for distinguishing between deceit and negligence in the measure of damages.  The Plaintiff now wishes to say that thisspecial rule applies and pleads fraud and dishonesty to support the same even though the liability of the Plaintiff was not establishedon the basis of fraud.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Putting aside the question whether it is permissible to rely on this rule without advancing a cause of action based on fraud forthe time being, it is beyond dispute that the Plaintiff is alleging that the Bank officers are guilty of conducts which are as morallyreprehensible as fraud in order to justify the application of the rule by way of analogy or extension.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Allegations of fraud and dishonesty are not to be pleaded lightly.  Although there would be cases where such allegations could havebeen properly introduced with adequate explanation by way of amendments, it must be extremely rare that the court can permit suchallegations to be raised for the first time after judgment on liability has been given.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Mr Jarvis submitted that all litigators treat allegations of these sorts quite differently from other allegations of civil wrongs. The whole preparation leading to trial would be quite different in terms of the resources and the level of representation to beengaged as well as the witnesses to be called and the conduct of the cross-examination.  Counsel asked rhetorically if the Plaintiffconsidered that a case on fraud and dishonesty was warranted on the same set of facts, why was it not pleaded in the pleadings beforethe court at the trial on liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  On the other hand, Mr McGhee invited this court to examine the allegations in the final version of the Statement of Claim and certaindocuments exhibited at the trial on liability.  It is submitted that the Bank should know very well that serious allegations weremade against it and its officers.  My attention was also drawn to some allegations put to the Bankâs witnesses at the trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  I do not think Mr McGhee provided any satisfactory answer to the rhetorical question posed by Mr Jarvis.  No explanation has beenoffered on behalf of the Plaintiff as to why there was no plea of fraud and dishonesty in the final version of the Statement of Claimor the Reply to put the Defendants on notice that such allegations would be made against them in this action.  It does not lie inthe mouth of the Plaintiff to say parties contemplated that these could be raised in the second round of pleadings since there wasa split trial.  As stated above, the order for split trial was made at the pre-trial review.  The idea of having a split trial wasfirst suggested by the judge, not the parties.  Prior to that, parties were proceeding on the basis that there would be a trial ofall the issues and pleadings were closed and evidence was prepared and filed on that basis.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The only difference between the position prior to the trial on liability and the filing of the Statement of Relief and Damages allegingfraud and dishonesty for the first time is the Judgment on Liability.  The connection between the judgment and the plea of fraudand dishonesty is blatantly obvious from the Plaintiffâs own pleadings.  Paragraph 8 of the Re-amended Statement of Relief andDamages is the paragraph providing the substance of the Plaintiffâs allegation of fraud and dishonesty.  I quote,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">The Bankâs conduct in inducing the sale of the Property was dishonest and/or fraudulent.  In support of this averment the Plaintiffwill rely on paragraphs 86, 101, 185, 187, 188 and 234 of the judgment herein.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">I should mention this is not the pleading of Mr McGhee and counsel did say if the court thinks such a plea is defective in form, thePlaintiff would do an amendment giving all necessary and proper particulars.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Putting aside the question of the adequacy of particulars for the time being, I must say this is a most extraordinary way of pleadingfraud and dishonesty.  It tantamounts to saying that even though fraud and dishonesty were not pleaded as an issue before Waung J,the findings of the learned judge in those paragraphs in his judgment had established fraud and dishonesty on the part of the Bankand therefore the court should consider the relief and remedies accordingly.  In other words, the Bank has been condemned withoutknowing that the Plaintiff is going to advance a case of fraud and dishonesty against it.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Whilst Mr McGhee may be correct in saying that the allegations raised in the final version of the Statement of Claim were seriousas far as a banker of the standing like the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants is concerned, there is still a considerable gap between such allegations and allegations of fraud and dishonesty.  In<i>Three Rivers DC v Bank of England (No 3)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 2 AC 1</a> at p.291, Lord Millett made some observations regarding a partyâs duty in pleading fraud and dishonesty at Paragraphs 184 to 189. At Paragraph 185, His Lordship said,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦ The function of pleadings is to give the party opposite sufficient notice of the case which is being made against him.  If thepleader means âdishonestlyâ or âfraudulentlyâ, it may not be enough to say âwilfullyâ or ârecklesslyâ.  Such languageis equivocal.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Four causes of action were pleaded against the Defendants.  Waung J found liability in respect of three of them established,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">breach of fiduciary duty; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">economic duress;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">undue influence.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The breach of fiduciary duty as found by the judge revolved around the conflict of interests, the concealment of the associationwith BML and the haste by which the sale was completed.  Even taking into account of the assertion of the interest and desire ofthe Bank in procuring a quick sale of the Property beneficially in favour of BML in the context of conflict of interest, I do notthink a reasonable pleader would regard these allegations as serious as allegations of fraud or dishonesty.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  One must not lose sight of the fact that at the material time, Esquire was heavily indebted to the Bank and the Bank could haveexercised its power of sale as mortgagee.  Waung J held that this did not exonerate the Bank in terms of liability as it chose proceedto achieve the sale by another route (see Paragraph 80 of the judgment).  But that must have some bearing in considering whetherthe Bank officers were acting fraudulently or dishonestly.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The crucial findings of Waung J on breach of fiduciary duties are in Paragraphs 83 to 86 of the judgment.  To summarize it in anutshell, using some of the terminology of Waung J solely for the purpose of convenience, the judge held that a senior partner hasno business selling his principalâs property to his junior partner with undue haste in a rising market without disclosing its associationwith the junior partner to the principal.  The Defendants had some objections to the description of BML as a junior partner of theBank.  The judge had rejected a submission from the Plaintiff that BML and the Bank were associate or connected party in Paragraph81.  In my view, the findings of the judge against the Bank cannot be read as equivalent to an imputation of fraud or dishonesty. If a case of fraud and dishonesty based on the relationship between the Bank and BML had been advanced, I agree with Mr Jarvis thatthe Bank would probably have adduced much more evidence on the point.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Regarding the causes of action based on economic duress and undue influence, they were pleaded together in some rolled up pleasin Paragraphs 11 to 14 of the final version of the Statement of Claim.  The most serious allegation is the concealment regardingthe $30 million discrepancy in the account.  There was actually no concealment about the $30 million discrepancy.  Esquire knew aboutit and in fact brought this up for discussion with the Bank.  What the Plaintiff really complaint about is the failure of the Bankto admit the same, the concealment from Esquire that the Bank knew it was a mistake on its part and used this to exert pressure onEsquire (see in particular Paragraph 12(2A) and (3) of the Statement of Claim).  It was pleaded that the threats by the Bank wereunwarranted, improper and unreasonable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  These pleas have to be considered against the background that the overall indebtedness owed to the Bank was about $270 million andthe Bank had a power of sale under the Mortgage.  Exerting undue pressure is one thing.  To elevate that to a case of fraud and dishonestyis quite another matter.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  In my judgment, the pleadings before the court up to the trial on liability fail to assert unequivocally a case of fraud and dishonestyagainst the Bank or its officers.  Given that the trial had been conducted on the basis of those pleadings, the Bank did not envisagethat fraud and dishonesty would be raised against it in this action.  In such circumstances, even if fraud and dishonesty were notrelied upon as a cause of action, the court should examine with care whether there would be any prejudice caused to the Defendantsthat could not be compensated by an order for costs before allowing the Plaintiff to raise such serious allegations for the firsttime at such late stage without any cogent explanation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Litigation prejudice occasioned to the Defendants if these allegations were allowed to be raised for the first time after the LiabilityJudgment</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Some very strong languages were used by Waung J against the Bank in the Liability Judgment.  By way of illustration, Paragraph 234of the judgment, being one of those relied upon by the Plaintiff to assert fraud and dishonesty in Paragraph 8 of the Statement ofRelief and Damages, criticized the Bank severely.  ââ¦ the Bank taking advantage of its ascendancy and dominion over Esquire,by unfair and improper means, coercive and overreaching and deceiving, secured the sale of the Property.  Misrepresentations weremade by the Bank.  Lies were told by the Bank.  Threats were uttered by the Bank.  Unilateral actions were taken by the Bank.  Infact the Bank was aware of the impropriety of what it was doing â¦â</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  This brings us to the very difficult question of the status of these comments in Stage II of the Trial.  To what extent are theybinding on this court and even if they are not binding, what weight could the court give to those criticisms? The answers to thesequestions have a direct bearing on the issue of litigation prejudice.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  At the hearing, in order to deal with the problem identified in Paragraph 18(b) above, Mr McGhee promised to produce a List of Findingsin the Liability Trial setting out the issues that the Plaintiff said the Liability Judgment has conclusively determined betweenthe parties. As it turned out, it was not an easy exercise and the List was only produced in the late afternoon of 7 June 2006. It pinpointed a number of conclusions reached by Waung J in his Liability Judgment with cross-references to the pleadings beforethe court at that stage.  The Plaintiff contends that these conclusions, subject to the outcome of any appeal, will be binding onthe parties (and hence this court) at Stage II.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Apart from these conclusions, Mr McGhee submitted that the other comments or remarks by Waung J in the Liability Judgment were alsorelevant at Stage II of the trial although this court, after giving due regard and weight to the same, could properly depart fromsuch comments if the evidence at Stage II could justify such departure.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Mr Jarvis submitted that the position is much more complicated bearing in mind the doctrine of issue estoppel.  Not only would theconclusions be binding, counsel submitted, all necessary steps leading to a particular conclusion would also be binding.  Counselsaid it is impossible to draw the line bearing in mind the allegations in the new cases and their interaction with the issues alreadydecided in the Trial of Liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  For present purposes, I do not think I need to express any final view on what are binding and what are not.  Even on the List submittedby Mr McGhee and his submission on the relevance of the other parts of the Liability Judgment, I am satisfied that if the questionsof exemplary damages and fraud and dishonesty were permitted to be raised at Stage II, the Defendants would suffer prejudice thatcannot be compensated by costs and it would not be fair to allow such issues to be canvassed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The conclusive findings in Mr McGheeâs lists include,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The Defendant had deliberately preferred the interest of the Ho Family over its duty to the Plaintiff; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The Defendant had deliberately concealed from the Plaintiff its relationship with BML and the Ho Family; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The Defendant deliberately did not reveal to the Plaintiff that BML was a Ho Family company; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(d)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The Defendant deliberately did not reveal to the Plaintiff that the sale was to the family company of the Ho Family, its junior partner;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(e)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The Defendant deliberately did not reveal to the Plaintiff that the sale was conducted in undue haste without the Property being fullymarketed; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(f)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The Defendant knew that the breach of fiduciary duty was unlikely to be discovered for some time and this was the reason for the concealment;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(g)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The Defendant deliberately concealed its knowledge that it was not entitled to the $30 million overcharge from the Plaintiff. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Deliberate concealment was raised as an issue before Waung J in the context of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>.  The Plaintiff sought to rely on it to overcome the time bar imposed by the Ordinance.  I agree with Mr Jarvis that the implicationof such a plea for the Defendant is substantially different from a plea of deliberate concealment in the wake of allegations of fraudand dishonesty and allegations of cynical disregard of the Plaintiffâs rights.  To permit the Plaintiff to run a case of fraudand dishonesty and a case of exemplary damages with the benefit of these conclusive findings as to deliberate concealment is equivalentto giving the Plaintiff a head start in proving their new cases which should have been advanced in the original pleadings.  Conversely,the Defendant is prejudiced in the defence to these new claims as it had to resist them saddled with the burden of these findingsthat could have some significance as to the overall assessment of the other allegations pertaining to fraud and dishonesty and exemplarydamages.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Finding (f) stated above could also have impact on the claim for exemplary damages.  With (f) established, it would be easier forthe Plaintiff to prove that the Defendantsâ conduct has been calculated to make a profit for the Bank which may exceed the compensationpayable to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  It is no answer to say the Defendants could adduce further evidence at Stage II.  These findings are said to be conclusive.  Evidenceinconsistent with them would not be admissible.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  In addition, there are problems as regards the weight and relevance of the other parts of the Judgment.  Reverting back to the exampleby reference to paragraph 234 of the judgment which is now relied upon by the Plaintiff as particulars of fraud and dishonesty, whatevidence does the Defendants need to adduce in order to sway this court from the conclusions of Waung J that lies were told, deceptionpractised, misrepresentations made and the Bank was aware of its wrongdoing in the course of its commission?  Do these remarks createsome initial hurdle for the Defendants to overcome?  If so, has the burden of proof been reversed?  If the Defendants were to adducenew evidence shedding light on these matters, should they be required to explain by evidence why such evidence was not tendered beforeWaung J?  As Mr Jarvis submitted, why should the Defendants be put into such a disadvantageous position when the Plaintiff couldand should have pleaded all these matters in the original round of pleadings?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  I also accept the submission of Mr Jarvis that had the Defendants been told in the original round of pleadings that the Plaintiffhad a case of fraud and dishonesty and exemplary damages in the pipeline, the trial on liability would have been conducted quitedifferently with more witnesses being called.  Whether Waung J would come to the same conclusions as in his Liability Judgment issomething one cannot speculate. The way in which the Plaintiff had pleaded its case had deprived the Defendants of that opportunity.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  To provide one illustration, Waung J made some strong findings against Mr Pullen in his Liability Judgment.  Mr Pullen did not giveevidence at the Trial on Liability.  There was no hint in the pleadings to suggest that Mr Pullen would be implicated with orchestratinga fraudulent or dishonest scheme against the Plaintiff.  This is the case the Plaintiff now intends to run as shown by the particularsfurnished by the Plaintiff under Paragraph 22(1) of the Statement of Relief and Damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Mr McGhee reminded this court that the memo of 20 March 1987 had been referred to in Paragraph 12(3) of the final version of theStatement of Claim and at the Liability Trial, allegations implicating dishonesty on the part of Mr Pullen were put by way of cross-examinationon Day 18 at p.52-60 of the Transcript.  All these should have given sufficient warning to the Bank that Mr Pullen was an importantwitness at the Liability Trial.  Counsel also referred to Paragraphs100 to 103 of the witness statement of Mr Gurdas to highlightthe Plaintiffâs case as to the Bankâs awareness of the $30 million overcharge at the material time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  With respect, I do not agree that a fair warning of a case of fraud and dishonesty orchestrated by Mr Pullen had been given by thePlaintiff.  Notably, Paragraph 12(3) of the Statement of Claim and in paragraphs 100 to 103 of the statement of Mr Gurdas containedno reference to the memo of 23 October 1986.  Yet, it was the endorsement put by Mr Pullen in that memo that was relied upon at thetrial to put forward some very serious allegations against Mr Pullen, which the judge ultimately accepted and adopted in his LiabilityJudgment.  Further, at the highest, the case put forward in the pleadings and witness statement of the Plaintiff was awareness bythe Bank as to the overcharge.  The Plaintiff had never gone beyond asserting undue influence and economic duress in the originalround of pleadings.  There was no suggestion whatsoever in the pleadings or the witness statement that the Plaintiff asserted MrPullen to be the driving force behind a deception perpetuated against Esquire.  Knowledge about an error in the account and continuallyexerting pressure despite such knowledge is one thing.  Acting dishonestly with a fraudulent intent to deceive is quite another. As observed by Lord Millett, if the real case of a party is fraud and dishonesty, he should plead it unequivocably.  A case of fraudshould never be allowed to be slipped in by some pleas of less serious nature.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  The cross-examination on Day 18 does not assist the Plaintiff in this regard.  It took place after the close of the Plaintiffâscase.  The allegations of dishonesty were put to another officer of the Bank and the Plaintiff did not make any application to amendthe Statement of Claim based on such cross-examination.  Nor did it give any warning that a case of fraud and dishonesty was beingconsidered.  In any event, by then it was probably too late to expect the Defendant to call evidence from Mr Pullen for the purposeof the Trial on Liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Had Mr Pullen been told about these serious accusations against him from an early stage of the action, it is most likely that hewould come to testify in the witness box and no-one can speculate whether Waung J would reach the same conclusion.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  I cannot help from observing that the allegations of fraud and dishonesty and those of exemplary damages were so intertwined withthe evidence on liability that had been adduced before and assessed by Waung J that had His Lordship been told of the Plaintiffâsintention to advance these new cases, it is most unlikely that a split trial would be ordered.  The Defendant would probably opposeto such a course.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  The Defendant had applied for leave to amend its Defence in January 2004 to put forward new matters justifying the $30 million. Leave was refused by Waung J.  However, if the Plaintiff had applied to advance a new case of fraud and dishonesty basing on the$30 million overcharge at the same time, it is difficult to see how the learned judge could properly allow the Plaintiffâs amendmentwithout granting leave to the Defendant.  It is equally difficult for me to see how the Plaintiff could end up in a better positionwhen the allegations of fraud and dishonesty were added at an even later stage after they had secured some advantages in the findingscontained in the Liability Judgment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  I also bear in mind that the sale in question took place in April 1987.  The action was commenced in 1994.  It took the Plaintiffalmost 20 years to plead fraud and dishonesty for the first time notwithstanding having its claim considered by several teams ofexperienced counsel and solicitors with several versions of the Statement of Claim being put forward.  Most of the Bankâs witnesseshad retired and the lapse of memories of these people is certainly a prejudice that I should take into account. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  The Plaintiff did not proffer any explanation why these new matters were not pleaded in the original round of pleadings.  It isquite plain to me that to allow these new matters to be canvassed at Stage II in these circumstances would inevitably bring aboutserious litigation prejudice to the Defendants that goes way beyond any implications for costs.  The prejudice would be so greatthat I would say the Defendants could legitimately complain that it could not have a fair trial of the issues of fraud and dishonestyand exemplary damages.  In my judgment, it is sheer forensic opportunism that the Plaintiff is trying to engage in.  Given the disadvantageand injustice that such conduct would occasion to the Defendants, the court should regard these new cases as vexatious and prejudicethe fair trial of the action or otherwise an abuse of its process.  They were therefore struck out accordingly and leave would notbe granted for the same to be put into the Statement of Claim by amendments.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Lack of reasonable argument for rescission or pecuniary rescission or custodial fiduciary</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Turning to the claims formulated as rescission and pecuniary rescission, I do not find the same sort of litigation prejudice vis-Ã -visthese claims as in the case of fraud, dishonesty and exemplary damages.  The striking out application is primarily based on the lackof reasonable arguability.  The main contention of Mr Jarvis built on the premise that by reason of the striking out of the claimagainst BML, rescission and damages in lieu of rescission (or pecuniary rescission) are not open to the Plaintiff and the most thatthe Plaintiff could claim for is equitable compensation. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  I bear in mind that in an application of this nature, the court should only strike out a pleadings in a plain and obvious case. As stated in Paragraph 18/19/4 of <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2006</i>, the claim must be obviously unsustainable, the pleadings unarguably bad and it must be impossible, not just improbable, for theclaim to succeed before the court will strike it out.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Although the summons to strike out refers to a number of paragraphs, the crucial points revolve around the legal viability of thepropositions in Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Statement of Relief and Damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Paragraph 3 is as follows,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">Where one person (A) enters into a transaction by reason of the breach of fiduciary duty, economic duress and/or undue influence ofanother person (B), A is entitled as against B to rescission of the transaction and accordingly to require B to restore to him <i>in specie</i> any asset which was disposed of by A pursuant to the transaction of, if that is not possible, to require B to restore to him thevalue of the lost asset.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Two cases were cited for this proposition: <i>McKenzie v McDonald</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1927%5d%20VLR%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1927] VLR 134</a>; <i>Mahoney v Purnell</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%203%20All%20ER%2061" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 3 All ER 61.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  On its face, this proposition merely sets out the legal analysis for rescission or, if that is not possible, damages in lieu ofrescission.

BML).  Notwithstanding that, it claims it is still entitled to requirethe wrongdoer, viz. the Bank, to restore to it the value of the lost asset.  In his very helpful Written Submissions of 9 June 2006,Mr McGhee put the point succinctly in Paragraph 5.  Counsel supported his argument by two Australian cases: <i>Ballantyne v Raphael</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2015%20VLR%20538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 15 VLR 538</a>; <i>Curwen v Yan Yean Land Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281891%29%2017%20VLR%20745" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1891) 17 VLR 745.</a>  Counsel very properly told this court that there is an Irish authority against him: <i>Northern Bank Finance Corp Ltd v Charlton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20IR%20149" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] IR 149.</a>  If the extension cannot be sustained, Paragraph 3 is not relevant to the Plaintiffâs claim herein. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  As none of the cases cited are binding on me, I propose to consider the matter on principle first before I come to the cases.  <i>Snellâs Equity</i>  31<sup>st</sup> Edn. defined rescission as follows,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">Rescission is the non-consensual un-picking of a transaction: the setting-aside of the agreement and restoration of the parties (moreof less) to the position they would have been in had the transaction never been made.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The Plaintiffâs argument on rescission seems to focus on rescission of the sale of the Property to BML.  The Bank was not a partyto that transaction.  There cannot be any restoration of the position of the parties to that transaction.  The Plaintiff would notget the Property back from BML nor could it pay the purchase price back to BML.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  There was another transaction to which the Bank and Esquire were immediate parties.  That was the Esquire Agreement dated 26 April1987.  Under that agreement, Esquire appointed the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as agent to sell the Property.  It was agreed that the net sale proceeds shall be applied towards the satisfaction of theproperty portion of the debt due from Esquire to the Bank.  Conditional upon receipt of that net proceeds, the Bank agreed to waiveand release some of the debts due.  The Plaintiff had the benefit under that agreement in terms of the reduction of its indebtednesstowards the Bank by the waiver and the net proceeds.  There are other provisions under the agreement that were implemented (restructuringof loans, extension of facilities etc.).  The Plaintiff did not seek rescission in respect of this agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  By the plea in Paragraph 3 of the Statement of Relief and Damages, the Plaintiff wishes to seek monetary redress from the Bank byreference to the value of the lost asset.  In so saying, I have not overlooked Mr McGheeâs submission that the Bank might wellbe able to procure the re-transfer of the Property back from BML to the Plaintiff.  With respect, given the evidence leading to thestriking out of the claim against BML, any suggestion that the Bank has any power to procure the same is simply unreal and fanciful.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  If it is a true restoration of the parties to the position they would have been in had the transaction never been made, and in orderto be equitable, one would have expected the Esquire Agreement be rescinded as well.  I simply cannot see how it can be arguablethat equity would grant relief to the Plaintiff without any regard to the benefit obtained by Esquire under the Esquire Agreement. In substance, the sale of the Property was the implementation of one aspect of the Esquire Agreement. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Analysing the position from another angle, even assuming that for the purpose of this plea it is legally viable to treat the salein isolation from the other aspects of the Esquire Agreement, there could not be any restoration of the position of the parties unlessthe Plaintiff (as successor of Esquire) shall pay back the sale proceeds to BML.  There must be mutuality in rescission.  This isthe rationale for the requirement of <i>restitutio in integrum</i>.  But Esquire had already utilized the sale proceeds to reduce its indebtedness towards the Bank and it has since been wound up. <i>Restitutio in integrum</i> is impossible.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Subject to one rider, I agree with the helpful analysis of three different scenarios in Paragraph 8 of Mr Jarvisâ submission inreply to Mr McGheeâs supplementary submissions.</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote">(1)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="94%" valign="top" class="quote">If A sells a property to B and equitable fraud has been committed by B inducing the sale, then <i>prima facie</i>, A is entitled to have the transaction set aside and rescinded. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote">(2)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="94%" valign="top" class="quote">If A sells a property to B and equitable fraud has been committed by B inducing the sale, but B has transferred the property to C,an innocent purchaser for value, then A can no longer have the transaction set aside and rescinded because it is impossible to restorethe parties to their original status.

There is no un-picking of the transactionand the positions of the immediate parties to the transaction thereunder remain intact.  A has no remedy against C.  All that A wishesto seek is redress from a wrongdoer who is not a party to the transaction.  In my judgment, the proper remedies available to A insuch circumstances should either sound in equitable compensation or common law damages.  One can no more seek rescission againsta party not to the contract than one seeks specific performance of a contract against a non-party.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  The only rider I wish to add is that as far as the measure of equitable compensation is concerned, I will leave it open for argumentat this stage whether such compensation should be confined to reparative compensation as opposed to substitutive compensation.

The reason is that, in such circumstances,as between the agent-adviser and the purchaser there is no form of rescission and restitution which could restore, even substantially,the <i>status quo ante</i> --- being the respective positions of the parties before the fraudulent misrepresentation was act acted on to the purchaserâs detriment. An order such as was made in this case â¦ so far from restoring the <i>status quo ante</i> results in a situation which never before existed.

Hodges J clearly saidthat rescission of the contract could not be given.  The learned judge then considered what were the available options in achievingpractical justice between the parties, see p. 555-6,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">It seems to me only another way of assessing the damages, and a more certain and sure way.

The resultant position was said by the Chief Justice to be the following,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">But while the contract, so far as the company is concerned, remains, the same contract, so far as the person deceived is concerned,is rescinded, the wrongdoer being compelled to accept the shareholdersâ obligations to the company, and being permitted, if hepleases, to become the holder of the shares in the substitution for the original holder.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  With great respect, such a result would be wholly repugnant to the requirements of <i>restitutio in integrum</i> and mutuality in granting rescission.  The unraveling of the contract for one party but not the other is not a restoration of theparties to their respective positions prior to the contract.  It is a rewriting of the contract.  The other contracting party (vis-Ã -viswhom the contract is not rescinded) is forced to have a contract with a new party (namely the wrongdoer who is ordered to take upthe obligation of the plaintiff) with whom he had not entered into an agreement.  This is not rescission.  Whilst I have no doubton the facts of that case the remedy granted did achieve practical justice, I cannot agree with the legal analysis.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Paragraph 4 of the Statement of Relief and Damages pleads,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">Further or alternatively, where a fiduciary, in breach of his fiduciary duty to his principal, has procured the transfer of one ofthe principalâs assets to a third party, the principal is entitled to require the fiduciary to restore to him the asset <i>in specie</i> or, if that is not possible to restore to him the value of the lost asset.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  I accept Mr McGheeâs submission that this paragraph does not depend upon the concept of rescission or pecuniary rescission.

For reasons explained above, given that the sale to BML cannot be rescinded, the only remediesavailable to Esquire against the Bank are those sound in damages or equitable compensation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  The title of the Property had never been passed to the Bank.  The sale proceeds were paid to the Bank pursuant to the Esquire Agreementfor reduction of the Esquire indebtedness.  The Bank had never received any property of Esquire in its capacity as agent under thePower of Attorney.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  In such circumstances, there is no proper basis for applying the principle in <i>Re Dawson</i> as this is plainly not a case of custodial fiduciary relationship.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  I agree with Mr Jarvis that Paragraph 4 of the Statement of Relief and Damages cannot be justified by an application of <i>Re Dawson</i> by analogy.  Since this is the only basis advanced by the Plaintiff to sustain that paragraph, it follows from my conclusions thatthe paragraph ought to be struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Results</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  The Defendants succeed in the striking out applications.  However, the precise extent of the pleadings to be struck out should beprecisely identified in the order.  I direct the parties to attempt to agree on that by reference to these Reasons for Decision andsubmit an agreed draft order for approval.  If no agreement is reached within 14 days, this court shall list the matter for argument.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  I also make an order <i>nisi</i> that the Plaintiff shall pay the Defendantsâ costs of the application in any event.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(M H Lam)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance<br />            High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr John McGhee, QC, Mr Martin Lee, SC, Paul Harris, SC and Mr Newman Lam, instructed by Messrs Ho, Tse, Wai &amp; Partners, for thePlaintiff</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr John Jarvis, QC, Mr Joseph Fok, SC and Mr Eugene Fung, instructed by Messrs Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master, for the 1st &amp; 2ndDefendants</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2006/668.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
