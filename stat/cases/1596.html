The company concerned is Chime Corporation Limited(âChimeâ).  It is a company within the well-known Chinachem Group.  Like the group as a whole, Chime had been controlled by thelate Mr T.H. Wang.  On 10 April 1990 Mr Wang was abducted for ransom.  Sadly he later died at the hands of his captors.  In thisappeal his widow is the appellant.  I will refer to her as âthe widowâ.  The administrators <i>pendente lite</i> of Mr Wangâs estate are the respondents to the appeal.  For reasons which will appear in a moment, I will refer to them as âthepetitionersâ.  And from now on my references to ârespondentsâ will be to respondents to the petition.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> On 31 July 2001 the petitioners presented this <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s168a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.168A</a> petition seeking (i) the setting-aside of the allotments of shares in Chime made to the widow after Mr Wangâs abduction and (ii)the repayment of dividends paid on the shares so allotted.  They allege that the widow, to benefit herself at Mr Wangâs expense,took control of Chime by diluting his shareholding through those allotments. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> As can be seen, the loss complained of in the petition as originally presented is loss suffered directly by a shareholder, namelyMr Wang whose administrators <i>pendente lite</i> now petition.  Originally the petition was presented against five respondents, the widow being the first and Chime the second.  On30 May 2002 the petitioners took out a summons for leave to amend the petition by joining another four respondents and adding furtherallegations and prayers for relief. </p>    <p class="heading">In the courts below</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> On 6 May 2003 Kwan J permitted the joinder and some of the other amendments sought but disallowed the rest of them.  Then on 20 February2004 the Court of Appeal (Ma CJHC and Stone J) permitted the amendments which she had disallowed.  For the reason which will be madeapparent by the next sentence, I will call the amendments which Kwan J had disallowed but the Court of Appeal permitted âthe CALamendmentsâ. The gist of the allegations made by the CAL amendments is that the widow had improperly procured Chime to advanceloans totalling approximately $4.5 billion to Chinachem Agencies Limited (âCALâ), a company in which she is beneficially interested. And the relief sought by the CAL amendments is that the widow be ordered to procure CAL to repay those loans to Chime or, furtheror alternatively, that the Chime directors be themselves ordered to pay to Chime whatever is outstanding under those loans.  TheChime directors are the widow and the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> respondents.</p>    <p class="heading">Appeal against the CAL amendments</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> By leave of the Court of Appeal, the widow now appeals to us against their judgment permitting the CAL amendments.  Granting hersuch leave under the âquestion of law of great general or public importanceâ limb of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.22(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484" class="autolink_findacts">Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484">Cap 484</a>, the Court of Appeal said this as to why they permitted the CAL amendments:</p>    <blockquote>        â In so doing, this court held as a matter of principle that a shareholder was able to present [a s.168A petition] on thebasis of wrongs directly committed against the company (but only indirectly committed against him) and claim for financial reliefin relation to the damage suffered by the company even though he himself had not suffered any direct loss.  It was a part of ourjudgment that, as a matter of law, section 168A permitted relief to be claimed in the form of financial compensation in favour ofthe company.â    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Whether the CAL amendments should have been permitted gives rise to a question of law.  Before stating that question, I propose toset out certain provisions of s.168A in full.  The section begins by providing as follows in subsection (1):</p>    <blockquote>        â  Any member of a company who complains that the affairs of the company are being or have been conducted in a manner unfairlyprejudicial to the interests of the members generally or of some part of the members (including himself) or, in a case falling withinsection 147(2)(b)<i>,</i> the Financial Secretary, may make an application to the court by petition for an order under this section.â    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Subsection (2), dealing with what the court can do on a petition presented under the section, provides that:</p>    <blockquote>        â  If on any petition under this section the court is of opinion that the company's affairs are being or have been conductedin a manner unfairly prejudicial to the interests of the members generally or of some part of the members, whether or not such conductconsists of an isolated act or a series of acts, the court may, with a view to bringing to an end the matters complained of -   </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">(a)</td>                <td width="94%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">make an order restraining the commission of any such act or the continuance of such conduct;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>                <td width="94%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">(b)</td>                <td width="94%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">order that such proceedings as the court may think fit shall be brought in the name of the company against such person and on suchterms as the court may so order;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>                <td width="94%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">(ba)</td>                <td width="94%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">appoint a receiver or manager of the whole or a part of a company's property or business and may specify the powers and duties ofthe receiver or manager and fix his remuneration;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>                <td width="94%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">(c)</td>                <td width="94%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">make such other order as it thinks fit, whether for regulating the conduct of the company's affairs in future, or for the purchaseof the shares of any members of the company by other members of the company or by the company and, in the case of a purchase by thecompany, for the reduction accordingly of the company's capital, or<sub>.</sub> otherwise.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Question of law</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The question of law is whether there is jurisdiction to make, on an unfair prejudice petition presented by a shareholder, an orderfor the payment of damages or compensation, or for the grant of restitution, to the company itself. </p>    <p class="heading">Jurisdiction in the practical sense</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Whenever a question of jurisdiction arises, it is to be remembered that the jurisdiction of a court or tribunal can mean either oneof two things.  This was pointed out by Sir Richard Scott VC (as Lord Scott of Foscote then was) in <i>Edge v. Pensions Ombudsman</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20Ch%20512" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] Ch 512</a> at p.519 B-C.  Jurisdiction can be a reference to âthe type of case that the court or tribunal is capable of entertainingâ. Or it can be a reference to âthe circumstances in which it is proper for [the court or tribunal] to entertain a case or to makea particular orderâ.  I would describe the first as jurisdiction in the theoretical sense and the second as jurisdiction in thepractical sense.</p>    <p class="heading">Cases on the inter-relationship between unfair prejudice petitions and derivative actions</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Both Mr Robin Potts QC for the widow and Mr Robert Hildyard QC for the petitioners have helpfully addressed us on a number of caseson the inter-relationship between unfair prejudice petitions and derivative actions.  I will not discuss all the cases.  But I willdiscuss those which, in my view, best inform, in one way or the other, the answer to be given to the question of law identified above.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> In <i>Re Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%202%20MLJ%20227" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 2 MLJ 227</a> the Privy Council was concerned with s.181 of the Malaysian Companies Act 1965.  Under that section shareholders could seek reliefwhere the affairs of a company were being conducted in a manner oppressive to them or in disregard of their interests.  Their Lordshipsâadvice was delivered by Lord Wilberforce.  He said (at p.229 G-H, first column) that âif a case of âoppressionâ or âdisregardâis made out, the section applies and it is no answer to say that relief might also have been obtained in a minority shareholdersâactionâ.  As it happens, however, the claim in that case failed because none of the complaints were substantiated.  So it was unnecessaryfor their Lordships to say anything more about the inter-relationship between such petitions and such actions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> <i>Re a Company</i> <i>(No. 005287 of 1985)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%201%20WLR%20281" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 1 WLR 281</a> was a case of a petition presented under s.459 of the Companies Act 1985.  At p.284 D-H Hoffmann J (as Lord Hoffmann then was) said:</p>    <blockquote>        âIt is accepted that on the facts alleged in the petition, the truth of which, of course, remains to be tried, the petitionerswould be able to mount a derivative shareholders' action of the kind exemplified by <i>Wallersteiner v. Moir</i> [1974] 1 W.L.R.991 against H. in order to require him to account for such of the company's assets as he may have disposed of withoutauthority. But it is said that such an action should be commenced separately by writ and that it would not be proper to seek theequivalent relief within a petition under section 459.        <p>Looking at the matter from a practical point of view that does not seem to me to be very convenient. It would mean separate proceedingshaving to be commenced by writ and separate pleadings delivered in respect of matters which would very substantially overlap, ifnot duplicate, the issues canvassed in the petition and affidavits under section 459. It would then be necessary for both sets ofproceedings to be heard together. I would be reluctant to come to the conclusion that this form of duplication was necessary unlessit was clear that the jurisdiction under sections 459 and 461 did not permit the whole matter to be dealt with upon the petition.It seems to me that although it is true that section 462(2) shows that the normal order under section 461 will be an order againstthe company or another member, there is no reason why the words of section 461(1) should not be given their full effect and allowthe court to give relief in respect of a complaint that the company's affairs have been conducted in a manner unfairly prejudicialto the interests of members, even when this would involve giving relief against a respondent who is no longer a member. For thatreason, I am not willing to strike out H. as a party to the petition.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">As can be seen, that was said in the context of a refusal to strike out.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Eight months later Hoffmann J decided <i>Re Posgate &amp; Denby (Agencies) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20BCLC%208" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] BCLC 8</a>, a motion for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the disposal of a substantial part of the companyâs business until the hearingof a s.459 petition which sought a final injunction to restrain such disposal until the transaction had been approved by shareholders. Dismissing the motion, Hoffmann J said this (at p.15d):</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âOne cannot literally ask whether damages would be an adequate remedy because s.461 does not provide for an award of damages atcommon law.  But the section allows the court to order various forms of financial compensation.  For example, respondents can beordered to buy the petitionerâs shares at a price which reflects the value they would have had if the unfairly prejudicial conducthad not taken place.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Further down same page at h, he expanded upon the nature of such financial compensation, saying:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âIf I refuse the injunction and the transaction turns out on the hearing of the petition to have been unfairly prejudicial to thepetitioner, he can in my judgment be fully compensated by orders which enable him to receive the value his shares would have hadif the transaction had not taken place.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Hoffmann Jâs decision in <i>Re a Company</i> <i>(No. 005287 of 1985)</i> was discussed by Millett J (as Lord Millett then was) in <i>Re Charnley Davies Ltd</i> <i>(No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20BCLC%20760" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] BCLC 760</a>, a case of a petition presented under s.27 of the Insolvency Act 1986.  As one sees at pp783i-784a, Millett J shared Hoffmann Jâsview that the availability of a derivative action did not bar s.459 relief, but added this (at p.784a-b):</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âThe very same facts may well found either a derivative action or a s.459 petition. But that should not disguise the fact that thenature of the complaint and the appropriate relief is different in the two cases. Had the petitioners' true complaint been of theunlawfulness of the respondent's conduct, so that it would be met by an order for restitution, then a derivative action would havebeen appropriate and a s 459 petition would not.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Millett Jâs decision is identified in <i>Gower and Davies: Principles of Modern Company Law</i>, 7<sup>th</sup> ed. (2003) at pp 513-514 as an attempt to address a difficult problem.  On the one hand, there are the cases in which the courtshave refused to accept that the availability of a derivative action bars an unfair prejudice petition.  But, on the other hand, thereare the policies underlying the standing requirements for shareholders to bring derivative actions.  Do these policies fall awaywhen a shareholder presents a petition instead of issuing a writ?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> In <i>Kumagai Gumi Co.

They held that that section was wide enough to cover an order to make good loss suffered bythe company.  Looking in particular at p.318 F-G, this conclusion appears to be based essentially on the view that the section isâvery wideâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> To be contrasted with that conclusion is the one to which the Supreme Court of Ireland came in <i>Irish Press plc v.

And the price, it was ordered, would beascertained on the basis of certain accounts having been taken and the amounts found due having been paid to the company.

There a shareholder petitioned under s.459 against the managing director seekingrepayment by him to the company of allegedly unauthorised salary, bonus, redundancy and other payments totalling over Â£100,000. The first instance judge refused relief, holding that the respondent had acted in good faith and that, even if his conduct had beenunlawful to any extent against the company, it did not follow that the petitioner had been treated unfairly.  He also said that thecorrect procedure would have been a derivative action.  The petitioner appealed in respect of the redundancy payment.  By a 2:1 majority,his appeal succeeded to the extent of Â£20,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> One of the appellate judges was firmly of the view (as appears at p.196H) that âeven where the facts would readily have warranteda derivative action, a petition under s.459 is not barredâ. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> But the other appellate judge forming the majority was more guarded in his view on the point, saying this (at p.200 A-C):</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âNo question, in my view, arises about the competency of the petition. The remedies provided by secs 459 and 461 of the 1985 Actare, however, discretionary and a question may arise as to the appropriateness of granting the prayer of the petition. It was onthat basis that the Lord Ordinary indicated that, even if he had been satisfied that the payments in question demonstrated unfairness,he would not have been inclined to grant any order under sec 461. While it may be (though there are arguments either way) that thepetitioner could effectively have used other means, including invoking internal company mechanisms, to advance the matters complainedof, this petition proceeded without challenge to a proof before answer at which these matters were addressed in evidence and submission.It would, in my view, be highly unfortunate if at that stage (and <i>a fortiori</i> after the hearing of a reclaiming motion) the court were to refuse a remedy simply because alternative mechanisms might have beeninvoked.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">And the dissenting appellate judge said this (at p.202 A-D):</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âBefore turning to the issue of unfairness, I should say that in my opinion this is not a case in which recourse to sec 459 of the1985 Act, or an order under sec 461, can be regarded as appropriate. If the petitioner considered that the payment of Â£50,000 (orat least Â£20,000 thereof) was unlawful, I see no reason for his not having attempted to have proceedings brought by the companyfor recovery of the sum in question. Even if one assumes that Mrs Hogg would wish her husband to receive the Â£50,000, and wouldvote accordingly, I see no basis for assuming that the other shareholder, Mrs Scrimgeour, owning 25 per cent of the shares, wouldprefer that Mr Hogg should keep the Â£50,000 in full: like Mr and Mrs Anderson, she might well prefer that sum to be restricted,so that more would remain for herself as a shareholder. In my opinion, these are matters which ought to be tested by ordinary means,before recourse to the courts under secs 459 and 461 of the 1985 Act. While I think it worthwhile to mention these matters, and indeedto note that the petition was not even served upon Mrs Scrimgeour or the other shareholders, I do not think it necessary or appropriateto go so far as to hold that the petition is incompetent.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> This brings me to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Clark v.

At all material times, they were also the onlydirectors of the company. The judge found that, without Mr Clark's knowledge, Mr Cutland had misappropriated from the company sumstotalling Â£517,734. The exact method of his misappropriation is not material for present purposes. When the misappropriation cameto light, Mr Clark commenced a derivative action on behalf of the company against the trustees to recover the moneys which had beenmisapplied. Later he commenced unfair prejudice proceedings under s 459 of the 1985 Act. The derivative action was in due courseconsolidated with the unfair prejudice proceedings but it was in the latter proceedings that relief was ultimately granted.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Although Arden LJ spoke in that passage (and also elsewhere in her judgment) of the s.459 petition and the derivative action havingbeen âconsolidatedâ, I think that what might really have happened is that they were ordered to be tried at the same time.  Butthat would not detract from the point which I understand her to have been making.  This is that it was material that there was aderivative action as well as a s.459 petition.  Thus she pointed out (at p.397 e-f) that the trial judge had</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âconcluded that it was appropriate for him to treat the petition as if it were a derivative action, particularly as there was aderivative action in the background with which the petition had been consolidatedâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Where an unfair prejudice petition and a derivative action have been tried at the same time, no one is likely to achieve anythingof substance by complaining on appeal that the trial courtâs formal order had been drawn up in a form which grants the companyrelief in the petition rather than in the action.  Even if the appellate court were willing to entertain such a complaint, I cannotenvisage it doing anything more than simply varying the form without disturbing the substance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Finally in this discussion of the cases, I turn to <i>Atlasview Ltd v.

One was a petition presented under s.459of the Companies Act 1985 and s.27 of the Insolvency Act 1986.  And the other was an action for breach of contract.  In the courseof deciding against the respondentsâ application to have the petition struck out on the basis that it sought to recover reflectiveloss, Deputy Judge Crow said this (at p.208 c-d):</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âIt would also fly in the face of common sense to suggest that the court, in exercising its discretion under s 459, would necessarilydecline any relief in such a case, and would require the minority shareholders instead to bring a derivative action, seeking paymentto be made to the company in respect of the entire loss it had suffered: by that route, the defendant transferees would be havingto make a payment to the transferor company, the bulk of which they would then recover in their capacity as majority shareholders.That hardly seems like a desirable route for compensating those who have in fact suffered the loss.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">That, if I may say so without any disrespect whatsoever to the learned Deputy Judge, may go to show that serious problems can resultfrom impatience with a call for resort to a derivative action as well as or in lieu of an unfair prejudice petition.  When Mr Hildyardshowed us that statement by the learned Deputy Judge, the problem with it was immediately pointed out by Lord Scott of Foscote NPJ. What about the companyâs creditors and, indeed, the revenue if money due to the company by-passes its coffers and goes straightinto the shareholdersâ pockets instead?  No satisfactory answer was forthcoming.</p>    <p class="heading">Foss v. Harbottle</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> So far I have not made express reference to <i>Foss v.

As to the operation of that rule in a context like the present, the following observation is made in<i>Palmerâs Company Law</i>, 25<sup>th</sup> ed. (July 2004), Vol. 1, p.8199, para. 8.904:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âIf, as seems to be the case, the courts are committed to the principles underlying the rule <i>in Foss v.

Harbottle</i> by the inappropriate use of an unfair prejudice petition, I need say no more than that I agree with what is said in the judgmentprepared by Lord Scott which I have had the advantage of reading in draft. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Answer to the question of law</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Having noted the observations in <i>Gower and Davies</i> and in <i>Palmer</i> cited above and having examined the foregoing cases, I now answer the question of law in this appeal.  Is there jurisdiction to make,on an unfair prejudice petition presented by a shareholder, an order for the payment of damages or compensation, or for the grantof restitution, to the company itself?  I would not say that there is no such jurisdiction in the theoretical sense of the type ofcase that the court is capable of entertaining.  And even in the practical sense of the circumstances in which it is proper for thecourt to entertain the case or to make a particular order, I stop short of saying that there is absolutely no such jurisdiction. I would not rule out the possibility of circumstances in which it can be seen that such an order could properly be made.  But suchcircumstances, even if they can arise, would in any case of complexity be rare and exceptional.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  No such circumstances have arisen in the present case.  Quite apart from anything else undesirable, pursuing relief in respect ofthe CAL loans by way of an unfair prejudice petition rather than by way of a derivative action would entail the risk of the respondentsor one or more of them facing a claim for such relief in a derivative action after the petitioners had failed to obtain the samein the petition.  I hold that the CAL prayers for relief should not have been permitted.  The CAL allegations, however, were rightlypermitted.  They are relevant on the question of whether there has been unfairly prejudicial conduct.  As we have seen, one of thethings which a court hearing a s.168A petition is expressly empowered by the section to do is to order that proceedings be broughtin the name of the company.  As it happens, the petitioners have taken the precaution of issuing and then re-newing a protectivewrit for a derivative action.  The court hearing the s.168A petition in the present case could, if it appears appropriate to do so,order that the CAL relief be pursued in that derivative action.</p>    <p class="heading">The real dispute and management of the petition</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> I am in complete agreement with what Lord Scott says as to what is the real dispute between the parties and the management that thispetition requires. </p>    <p class="heading">Result</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> For the foregoing reasons and those given by Lord Scott, I would allow the appeal so as to:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)    disallow the CAL prayers for relief (i.e. prayers 3.2 to 3.5 inclusive) while leaving the CAL allegations (i.e. paras 44.1to 44.5 inclusive) undisturbed; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(b)    substitute for the order as to costs made by the Court of Appeal an order <i>nisi</i> leaving the parties to bear their own costs here and in the courts below. </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">I would direct: (i) that the order <i>nisi</i> become absolute 21 days after the handing down of judgment in this case unless before then the Registrar of this Court has receiveda written submission containing full reasons seeking some other order as to costs; and (ii) that if such a written submission isso received, procedural directions on how the costs concerned are to be dealt with be made by the Registrar, subject to her discretionto refer the question of such directions to a single Permanent Judge. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b>Mr Justice Chan PJ:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> I agree with the judgment of Mr Justice Bokhary PJ and the judgment of Lord Scott of Foscote NPJ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b>Mr Justice Ribeiro PJ:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> I agree with the judgment of Mr Justice Bokhary PJ and the judgment of Lord Scott of Foscote NPJ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b>Mr Justice Mortimer NPJ:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> I agree with the judgment of Mr Justice Bokhary PJ and the judgment of Lord Scott of Foscote NPJ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p><b>Lord Scott of Foscote NPJ:</b></p>    <p class="heading">The background</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> This appeal, notwithstanding that it is merely an interlocutory appeal against an order giving leave to amend a pleading, has raisedan issue both of general importance and of difficulty.

The proposed amendment, refused at first instance by Kwan J but allowed by the Court of Appeal (Ma CJHC with whose judgmentStone J agreed), sought an order requiring a monetary payment (some $4.5 billion) to be made to the company, Chime Corporation Ltd(âChimeâ) by the principal respondent to the petition (Mrs Wang) and other respondents.  Chimeâs affairs, so it is alleged,are being or have been conducted in a manner unfairly prejudicial to the interests of Mr Wang (now presumed to be dead) or of thosenow entitled to succeed to his interests. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The issue has been formulated by Mr Potts QC, in his written skeleton submissions to this Court on behalf of Mrs Wang, as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        âwhether [s. 168A] confers jurisdiction upon the Court to make â¦ an order for the payment of damages or compensationor for the grant of restitution by a respondent to the petition to the company.âã    </blockquote>    <p>Mr Hildyard QC, for the petitioners, the joint administrators <i>pendente</i><i>lite</i> of Mr Wangâs estate, broadly accepted this formulation of the issue.  But I would, for my part, express it rather differently. The issue in this case is not, I think, whether the court, in exercise of its <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s168a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.168A</a> jurisdiction, can order a respondent to make a monetary payment, or to make some other form of restitution, to the company, but,rather, whether the court can, on a <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s168a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.168A</a> petition, deal with and dispose of a cause of action for damages or restitution that is vested in the company and, if it can do so,in what circumstances it should do so. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> There are three allegations, and consequential claims for relief, to be found in the petition that raise this issue.  Only one isthe subject of this appeal but the point at issue needs to be considered in relation to each of them. </p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(i)   It is alleged that a loan of some $4.5 billion was procured by Mrs Wang and her co-directors of Chime to be made by Chime toChinachem Agencies Ltd (âCALâ) at some time between 1990 and 2000.  This loan was, it is alleged âmade for a collateral and/orimproper purpose and/or was not made in the best interests of Chime and/or was made in breach of the directorsâ fiduciary dutiesto Chimeâ.  This is a clear and unequivocal allegation of a wrong to Chime that, if the allegation is well-founded, would entitleChime to a cause of action for damages against the delinquent directors.  If CAL had been complicit in the breach of duty, Chimewould have a cause of action also against CAL.  And, in any event, Chime could claim repayment of the loan from CAL and sue CAL onthe debt.  But the petition seeks anorder that MrsWang, and the other directors, âbe ordered jointly and severally to pay to Chimethe $4.5 billion loanâ as well as to pay, in effect, damages to Chime for loss caused to Chime by the making of the loan (see paras(3.2) and (3.3) of the amended petition).  Leave to amend the petition so as to make this allegation and claim the relief to whichI have referred was refused by Kwan J but granted by the Court of Appeal. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"> (ii)  An amendment allowed by Kwan J, whose order to that effect of 6 May 2003 was not appealed, alleges that MrsWang and her co-directorsof Chime had improperly caused Chime to incur legal costs in participating in the interlocutory proceedings in the petition âbeyondthat which is necessary or expedient in the interest of Chime as a wholeâ.  It is alleged that in consequence they, the directors,âare liable to repay to Chime the costs incurred by Chime by reason and/or on account of such improper participationâ.  This,too, is an unequivocal allegation of a breach of duty owed by the directors to Chime and a request that the directors be orderedto pay to Chime the loss thereby caused. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(iii)  An amendment allowed by Kwan J by an order of 17 June 2004, made in reliance on the principles expressed by Ma CJHC in hisinterlocutory judgment of 20 February 2004 which is now under appeal, alleged that in the period 1990 to 2000 excessive directorsâremuneration waspaid to MrsWang and other directors not only by Chime but also by five specified subsidiaries of Chime.  It is allegedthat these payments constituted âa misappropriation of assets to which Chime (directly or through its subsidiaries) was entitledâ¦â.  The relief claimed includes an order that the recipients of the allegedly excessive remuneration âbe ordered to repayto the said companies such portion of the remuneration which is found to have been paid and/or received â¦ which the court considersto have been excessive or otherwise unfairly prejudicialâ.  This amendment, too, asserts breaches of duty to the respective companiesand seeks orders for compensatory payments to be made to the companies. </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> There are a few other features of the petitionin its current state to which I should draw attention.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(i)     The main allegation in the petition in its original form was that MrsWang had utilized the control of Chime that in her husbandâsabsence she had been able to exercise, first, by bringing about the passing of resolutions at general meetings of Chime the effectof which was to dilute Mr Wangâs shareholding in Chime from 56.67%to 0.09% and to increase her own shareholding correspondinglyand, second, by then bringing about the payment to herself of very substantial sums in the form of dividends from Chime attributableto the increased shareholding that she had obtained for herself.  The allegation is that this allotment of shares to herself wasnot only unfairly prejudicial to Mr Wang but was also unlawful in being in breach of Chimeâs Articles of Association, in particularArticle 35 of Table A under which a similar number of shares should have been offered also to Mr Wang.  It is to be noted that, accordingto para. 31 of the petition,MrsWang paid Chime a total sum of $1.5 billion for the allotment of the shares.  So, whatever the rightsor wrongs of the allotment as between the shareholders, the allotment constituted a substantial injection of additional share capitalinto Chime. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(ii)     The petition, as amended pursuant to Kwan Jâs order of 17 June 2004, sought an order against CAL for repayment to Chimeof the $4.5 billion loan.  But CAL is not a party to the petition.  Moreover, theeffect the repayment would have on the businessof the Chinachem group as a whole and whether, objectively speaking, the repayment would be in the interest of Chime is not known.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(iii)     None of the five subsidiaries, whichallegedly paid excessive remuneration to directors and to whichrepayment of the excessiveamount is sought, is a party to the petition.  None is a party to the proceedings in which misappropriation of its assets is allegedand repayment to it of the amount of the misappropriation is sought. </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> There is some associated litigation that warrants mention</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(i)     At the time of Mr Wangâs disappearance, 19,998 âAâ shares in Chime stood in the name of Mr Tai Ching Ping (âMr Taiâ). Shortly thereafter Mr Tai transferred the shares to Mrs Wang.  There is a current issue as to whether Mr Tai held the shares ontrust for Mr Wang or for Mrs Wang.  This issue is the subject of a separate action between the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s168a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.168A</a> petitioners and Mrs Wang.  But the issue is raised also in the petition in which the transfer of the shares to Mrs Wang is pleadedas an example of her conduct unfairly prejudicial to Mr Wang.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(ii)    On 31 July 2003 the petitioners issued a writ (HCA 2836 of 2003), by way of derivative action, making the same allegationsagainst Mrs Wang regarding the loan to CAL as those alleged in the amendments allowed by the Court of Appeal.  The writ has not beenserved.  It has been described as a âprotectiveâ writ, intended to be proceeded with only if this appeal should succeed.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(iii)    And, finally, I should mention the probate proceedings instituted by Mrs Wang for the purpose of obtaining probate of analleged will of Mr Wang under which she is named as the beneficiary entitled to his estate.  Under an earlier will Mr Wangâs father(Mr Wang Snr) is named as the sole, or main, beneficiary of the estate.  At first instance and in the Court of Appeal Mrs Wang failedto establish her will.  But an appeal is, as I understand it, due to be heard in this Court sometime next year. </p>    </blockquote>    <p>I can now return to the main issue on this appeal. </p>    <p><b><i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s168a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 168A</a></i></b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> There is no doubt about the width of the statutory language of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s168a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.168A(2).</a>  The court may, with a view to bringing to an end the matters complained of, grant an injunction (para.

Lindsay J said that the history of the legislation, from s.210 of the Companies Act 1948 down to ss 459 and 461 of the1985 Act, was :</p>    <blockquote>        ââ¦ at least consistent with there having been engendered in the legislature by 1985 a sense that the thing to do wasto give a very wide jurisdiction and to let the courts get on with it.âã    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">The same could perhaps be said of s.168A. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> The fact, however, that the terms of a statute create or confer a jurisdiction in very wide terms does not necessarily mean thatthe courts have an unlimited jurisdiction to make any orders that are within the wide statutory terms.  This point was made by PickfordLJ in <i>Guaranty Trust Company of New York v Hannay</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1915%5d%202%20KB%20536" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1915] 2 KB 536.</a>  The point arose out of an issue as to whether the court had jurisdiction to grant an injunction to restrain the institution or continuanceof proceedings in a foreign court (see p.556).  At p.563 Pickford LJ said this</p>    <blockquote>        âThe word âjurisdictionâ and the expression âthe Court has no jurisdictionâ are used in two different senses whichI think often leads to confusion.  The first and, in my opinion, the only really correct sense of the expression that the Court hasno jurisdiction is that it has no power to deal with and decide the dispute as to the subject-matter before it, no matter in whatform or by whom it is raised.  But there is another sense in which it is often used, i.e., that although the Court has power to decidethe question it will not according to its settled practice do so except in a certain way and under certain circumstances.â ã    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">The same point was made by Diplock LJ in <i>Garthwaite v. Garthwaite</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20P%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] P 356.</a>  He referred at p.387 to the distinction drawn by Pickford LJ.  He said :</p>    <blockquote>        âIn its narrow and strict sense, the âjurisdictionâ of a validly constituted court connotes the limits which are imposedupon its power to hear and determine issues between persons seeking to avail themselves of its process by reference (1) to the subject-matterof the issue or (2) to the persons between whom the issue is joined or (3) to the kind of relief sought, or to any combination ofthese factors.  In its wider sense it embraces also the settled practice of the court as to the way in which it will exercise itspower to hear and determine issues which fall within its âjurisdictionâ (in the strict sense) or as to the circumstances in whichit will grant a particular kind of relief which it has âjurisdictionâ (in the strict sense) to grant, including its settled practiceto refuse to exercise such powers, or to grant such relief in particular circumstances.â ã    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> It goes without saying that, unless under s.168A the courts have jurisdiction, in the strict sense, to entertain complaints of conductwhich constitutes common law or equitable wrongdoing against the company and to grant the company the remedy to which it would beentitled if it had sued the wrongdoer for the wrongdoing in question, the prosecution of such a complaint in a s.168A petition inorder to obtain such a remedy should not be allowed.  But the converse does not necessarily follow.  It should not be enough, inmy opinion, to show that the court has jurisdiction in the strict sense.  It should be necessary also to show that the claim forthe remedy in question is one that, as a matter of proper practice, the court should, if the relevant underlying allegations aremade good, grant.  <i>Edge v Pensions Ombudsman</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%20Ch%20602" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] Ch 602</a> is illustrative of the point, s.146(1) of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 conferred on the ombudsman power to âinvestigate and determine<i>any complaint</i>â made to him by, among others, members of occupational pension schemes and to âinvestigate and determine <i>any dispute of fact or law</i> which arises in relation to such a schemeâ (emphasis added).  On an appeal to the High Court from a determination made by the pensionsombudsman under the section one of the issues that arose was whether the ombudsman had had jurisdiction to determine the particulardispute that had been referred to him and to make the particular order thereon that he had made.  The Court of Appeal at p.643 citedwith approval the following passage from the judgment which I had given at first instance in allowing the appeal from the ombudsman:</p>    <blockquote>        âIn its strict sense a reference to the jurisdiction of a court or tribunal is a reference to the type of case that thecourt or tribunal is capable of entertaining.  A reference to the jurisdiction of a court or tribunal is, however, often a referenceto the circumstances in which it is proper for a tribunal to entertain a case or to make a particular order.âã    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">The Court of Appeal held that the investigation and determination that the ombudsman had embarked upon was one that, properly advised,he should not have undertaken.  They said :</p>    <blockquote>        âWe do not hold that, in the strict sense, there was absence of jurisdiction to entertain the complaint; rather, that theombudsman, in the exercise of his discretion, should have declined to do so.â  (p.642H)ã    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Whether or not a court hearing an âunfair prejudiceâ petition has jurisdiction in the strict sense to order a respondent againstwhom a breach of duty to the company has been established to pay compensation, or to make restitution, to the company, there is nodoubt at all that in many cases the jurisdiction to do so has been assumed, that many orders of that sort have been made and thatit is highly convenient that they should have been made.  A good example is in <i>Re A Company (No. 005287 of 1985)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%201%20WLR%20281" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 1 WLR 281.</a>  The company was a family company the shares in which were held by members of the family.  One of them, H, acquired a controllinginterest and, according to the other shareholders, conducted the companyâs affairs in a manner unfairly prejudicial to their interests. They said he had made, or had caused to be made, various payments of the companyâs money to himself without authority and in breachof his duty to the company.  A s.459 petition was launched.  The relief sought included an order that H repay to the company thepayments that had been made to him without authority.  The judge, Hoffmann J (as he then was), referred to s.461(1) under which thecourt if satisfied that the petition is well founded, may make âsuch order as it thinks fit for giving relief in respect of thematters complained ofâ and commented that :</p>    <blockquote>        âThose words appear to give the widest possible discretion.âã    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Hoffmann J noted also that the facts alleged in the petition would, if true, have enabled the petitioners to mount a derivative actionin the companyâs name for the repayment of the companyâs money that had been paid to H without authority and commented on theargument that the petitioners should have sought the order for repayment in a separate derivative action rather than in the unfairprejudice petition.  He said :</p>    <blockquote>        âLooking at the matter from a practical point of view that does not seem to me to be very convenient.  It would mean separateproceedings having to be commenced by writ and separate pleadings delivered in respect of matters which would substantially overlap.â (p.284)ã    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> In para. 9.40 of the United Kingdom Law Commissionâs Consultation Paper on Shareholdersâ Remedies (Paper No. 142) the authorsnoted that :</p>    <blockquote>        âA number of successful cases have been brought under section 459 on the basis that there has been a deliberate diversionof a companyâs business by those in control to another business owned by them, or that there has been misappropriation of companyassets.  These cases illustrate the fact that proceedings are brought under section 459 to obtain a personal remedy for what areeffectively breaches of fiduciary duty.â    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">A footnote to this paragraph gives the interesting statistic that â41% of 156 petitions filed in 1994-1995 involved such allegationsâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> A few other recent cases are worth mentioning.  <i>Lowe v Fahey</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20BCLC%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 BCLC 262</a> was a s.459 case in which one of the allegations was that the allegedly delinquent directors had diverted the companyâs businessand assets to another company in which they were interested.  The relief sought included an order that the directors and their companybe ordered to repay to the victim company âall sums that might be found to be due to it and/or â¦ damagesâ.  An applicationwas made to strike out the petition on the ground that it was being used as a vehicle to bring a derivative action.  The strike outapplication was dismissed.  Charles Aldous QC, sitting as a deputy judge in the Chancery Division of the High Court, said this :</p>    <blockquote>        ââ¦ where for example the unfairly prejudicial conduct involves the diversion of company funds, a petitioner is entitledas a matter of jurisdiction to seek an order under s.461 for payment to the company itself not only against members, former membersor directors allegedly involved in the unlawful diversion, but also against third parties who have knowingly received or improperlyassisted in the wrongful diversion.  This is not to say that in a case where the only substantive relief being sought was a claimon behalf of the company against such a third party that a claimant could always proceed by petition instead of derivative action.â    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> <i>Clark v Cutland</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%202%20BCLC%20393" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 2 BCLC 393</a> is a decision of the Court of Appeal in England in which an order appears to have been made in a s.459 petition for the repaymentto the company of money improperly misappropriated.  The value of the case as an authority on the jurisdiction point is, however,reduced by the circumstance that a derivative action in the name of the company for the recovery of the money had also been commencedand had been, as Arden LJ put it, âconsolidated with the unfair prejudice proceedings â¦â.  But the order for repayment had,she said, been granted in the s.459 proceedings (see para. 2 of her judgment).  Arden LJ is highly experienced in the company lawfield and it is noteworthy that she plainly thought that it did not matter in the least whether the order for repayment to the companyhad been made in the derivative action or in the s.459 proceedings. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> <i>Atlasview Ltd v Brightview Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%202%20BCLC%20191" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 2 BCLC 191</a> was a case in which both a s.459 petition and a breach of contract action with identical factual allegations had been instituted. Mr Jonathan Crow, sitting as a deputy judge in the Chancery Division, held that although a shareholder in an ordinary action fordamages could not recover his âreflectiveâ loss as a shareholder that had been caused by a wrong to the company in which he heldthe shares (see <i>Prudential Assurance Co. Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd (No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20Ch%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 Ch 204)</a>, that loss could be recovered via a s.459 petition.  He said :</p>    <blockquote>         âThe fact that the impugned conduct might give rise to a cause of action at the suit of the company does not mean thatit is incapable also of giving rise to unfair prejudice : nor does it necessarily preclude the court from awarding financial compensationto the petitioners in satisfaction of their claim.â    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">He went on :</p>    <blockquote>        âIn deciding on the appropriate form of relief, the trial judge will no doubt be astute to ensure that the B shareholdersdo not achieve double recovery by receiving financial compensation directly from the A shareholders and also retaining their B sharesin Brightview in circumstances where the company is able (if it is) to recover in respect of the same loss.â  (para. 63 of hisjudgment)    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">The deputy judge was plainly of the view that it was obvious that the courtâs jurisdiction on a s.459 petition would enable thecourt to order payment to the company of the compensation to which the company would at law have been entitled in a derivative action. Whether the judge was right in holding also that s.459 enabled an order to be made for the payment by the wrongdoers of part ofthat compensation to the petitioners seems to me, if I may say so, highly questionable.  An order for payment or transfer of a partof the companyâs assets to the petitioning shareholders is, I would think, an order that could only properly be made in a winding-upof the company, or as a distribution of the companyâs profits, or as part of a reduction of the companyâs capital (see s.168A(2)(c)). Otherwise the interests of the companyâs creditors would be at risk.  However, it is not necessary for present purposes to decidethat point and the deputy judgeâs judgment certainly stands as yet another authority for the width of the courtâs jurisdiction,in a strict sense, on a s.168A petition.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Mr Potts QC, submitting on behalf of the appellants that the courtâs jurisdiction under s.168A ought not to be held to enable apetitioning shareholder to obtain an order for compensation to be paid to the company, relied very heavily on the decision of MillettJ (as he then was), in <i>Re Charnley Davies Ltd (No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20BCLC%20760" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] BCLC 760.</a>  Millett J was concerned to distinguish between proceedings where the complaint was of unfairly prejudicial conduct of the companyâsaffairs and proceedings where the complaint was of breaches of duty to, or other misconduct actionable by, the company.  The distinction,he said, âdoes not lie in the particular acts or omissions of which complaint is made, but in the nature of the complaint and theremedy necessary to meet itâ.  He went on :</p>    <blockquote>        âIf the whole gist of the complaint lies in the unlawfulness of the acts or omissions complained of, so that it may beadequately redressed by the remedy provided by law for the wrong, the complaint is one of misconduct simpliciter.  There is no needto assume the burden of alleging and proving that the acts or omissions complained of evidence or constitute unfairly prejudicialmanagement of the companyâs affairs.  It is otherwise if the unlawfulness of the acts or omissions complained of is not the wholegist of the complaint, so that it would not be adequately redressed by the remedy provided by law for the wrong.  In such a caseit is necessary to assume that burden, but it is no longer necessary to establish that the acts or omissions in question were unlawful,and a much wider remedy may be sought.â  (p.783)    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">As Hoffmann LJ (as he then was) was later to say in <i>Re Saul D Harrison &amp; Sons plc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20BCLC%2014" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 BCLC 14</a> at p.19 :</p>    <blockquote>        âNot only may conduct be technically unlawful without being unfair : it can also be unfair without being unlawful.â     </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Millett J in <i>Re Charnley Davies</i> concluded that the essence of the petitionersâ complaint was not the unlawfulness of the respondentâs conduct, but its unfairnessand its prejudicial disregard of their interest.  They wanted to be bought out, not to achieve payment of compensation to the company: âThey wanted relief from mismanagement, not a remedy for misconductâ (p.784).  Millett J did not question the courtâs jurisdictionalability on an unfair prejudice petition to make an order for payment of compensation, or for restitution to be made, to the company. What he did question, and in my respectful opinion rightly so, was the propriety of seeking such an order on an unfair prejudicepetition if the essence of the complaint was not of mismanagement of the company but of misconduct by the director.  In such a case,a derivative action was, in his view, the appropriate vehicle for relief. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Mr Hildyard QC, for the petitioners, respondents to this appeal, was, in my opinion, correct in submitting that Millett Jâs judgmentin <i>Re Charnley Davies</i> did not support the proposition that the court on a s.168A petition lacked jurisdiction, in the strict sense, to make an order forpayment to the company of compensation that could have been obtained by the company in a derivative action.  But I think Mr PottsQC was correct in submitting that if the essence of the complaint being made was of directorâs misconduct, rather than of directorâsmismanagement, Millett Jâs judgment stands as authority for the proposition that the proper vehicle for seeking and obtaining suchrelief would be a derivative action, rather than a s.168A petition.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> On these authorities, as well as a matter of principle, I conclude that there would be jurisdiction, in the strict sense, on thehearing of this s.168A petition for the court to grant the relief sought under the amendments regarding the CAL loan that were allowedby the Court of Appeal.  But I do not regard that conclusion as disposing of the issue raised by this appeal.  The issue is whetherit would proper for the court on this petition to try, in effect, whatever cause of action Chime might have against Mrs Wang andthe other directors for causing Chime to make the $4.5 billion loan to CAL and, if the allegations of their wrongdoing are established,to order them to make the payments to Chime that are due in respect of that cause of action. </p>    <p><b><i>The facts as pleaded and the nature of this petition</i></b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> The facts regarding the loan to CAL are at this stage unclear.  This Court can do no other than to proceed on the basis of the factsalleged in the petition, as at present pleaded, and such other facts as are undisputed or indisputable.  The loan was, it is pleaded,made in the period between 10 April 1990, the date of Mr Wangâs disappearance, and 30 June 2000.  The petitioners, or their predecessorsin office, were appointed to represent Mr Wangâs estate on 15 March 2000.  In the period preceding their appointment Mrs Wang hadpurported to act on Mr Wangâs behalf by virtue of a power of attorney dated 7 November 1963.  Under an order granted by Yam J on22 September 1999 Mr Wang was to be presumed to be dead.  The efficacy of the power of attorney, assuming its prior validity, wouldthereupon have come to an end. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The $4.5 billion loan by Chime to CAL is pleaded to have been interest free and unsecured.  The pleading says that the loan was :</p>    <blockquote>         ââ¦ a disproportionate sum to lend unsecured and without interest or defined repayment terms and was made for no properor any commercial purpose.â  (para. 44.4.3 ibid)    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> A decision as to whether the making of this very substantial loan was a breach by the directors of their duty to Chime would requirean investigation by the court into the following matters, as well no doubt as into others -</p>    <blockquote>        (i)   the relationship between Chime, CAL and the other companies in the Chinachem group whose activities may have been fundedby these funds;        <p>(ii)   the actual use to which the funds were put by CAL;</p>(iii)  the interest of Chime, directly or indirectly, in the commercial success of CAL or the companies whose activities were thusfunded;        <p>(iv)  the financial and/or commercial policy of Chime which led to the making of this loan for the purposes for which it was in theevent used by CAL.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> The cost of litigation in which the investigation of such matters is necessary in order to resolve the issues that arise, and itseffect on the day to day management of Chime and the Chinachem group, will be, and probably already has been, horrendous.  An independentboard of directors of Chime â if there were one â might very plausibly complain that the pursuit of Chimeâs alleged cause ofaction against its directors for their alleged misconduct in procuring or allowing this loan to be made would be highly damagingto Chime and to the commercial and financial health of the Chinachem group.  So, on what basis can it be contended that the amendmentsare proper ones to be allowed to be included in the petition? </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> Mr Hildyard QCâs answer is that the advancing of the funds to CAL is an important part of the unfairly prejudicial conduct of MrsWang and the other directors in their management of Chime on which his clients, the petitioners, rely in their s.168A petition. Since they cannot be barred from relying on that conduct as part of their case, and since a judicial investigation of that conductmay show that breaches of duty to Chime in the advancing of the funds were indeed committed, they are, submits Mr Hildyard QC, entitledto ask the court to exercise the jurisdiction, in the strict sense, that it has by making the orders sought. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> I am in profound disagreement with that approach.  First, this dispute between the petitioners and Mrs Wang is not, in my judgmenta dispute, primarily, if at all, about management of Chimeâs affairs.  It is primarily a dispute about proprietary rights.  Thepetition itself is topsy-turvy.  It is based on the proposition that the various things that have happened and that are complainedabout were unfairly prejudicial to Mr Wangâs estate.  Mrs Wang, it is said, was concerned to âadvance her own interest at theexpense of the Estateâ (para. 26 of the Re-Amended Petition).  But what is âthe Estateâ?  The petitioners themselves have nobeneficial interest in the âEstateâ.  They are merely administrators <i>pendente lite</i>.  The current probate proceedings will in due course decide to whom âthe Estateâ belongs.  There are two, and as I understandit only two, possible results of those proceedings.  One possible result is that Mrs Wang will be established as the beneficial ownerof the estate.  In that event the proposition that she was concerned to advance her own interest at the expense of the estate willbecome meaningless.  The s.168A petition will be pointless and an inexcusable waste of money, time and the judicial resources ofHong Kong.  The other possibility is that Mr Wang Snr will be established as the beneficial owner of the estate.  He will have becomethe testamentary successor to Mr Wangâs interests in Chime and the Chinachem group.  Let me, therefore, consider the s.168A petitionon that hypothesis. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> The first relevant allegation in the petition relates to the 19,998 Aâs shares in Chime that were vested in Mr Tai and, after MrWangâs disappearance, were transferred to Mrs Wang.  As I have explained, a separate action is on foot to determine whether MrTai held the shares on trust for Mrs Wang or for Mr Wang.  This action, too, will be pointless if Mrs Wang is entitled to Mr Wangâsestate but at least the issue is a narrowly defined one that can be resolved reasonably quickly and conveniently in the existingaction.  The issue about the beneficial ownership of the âAâ shares has nothing whatever to do with the management of Chime. If Mrs Wang fails in that action, she will have to transfer the relevant âAâ shares to the petitioners â or to whoever becomethe personal representatives of Mr Wangâs estate â and will be accountable to the estate for the benefits she has derived fromthe shares since their wrongful transfer to her.  There is nothing here that should concern a s.168A petition. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Next there is the allegation that Mrs Wang unlawfully procured the issue to herself of 15 million âBâ shares in Chime, therebydiluting Mr Wangâs shareholding and correspondingly increasing her own.  On the hypothesis on which I am proceeding, namely, thatit is Mr Wang Snr who is entitled to succeed to Mr Wangâs shareholding in Chime, there seems to me no prospect whatever of MrsWang retaining against him all the 15 million shares.  If the allotment is not set aside it seems to me quite obvious that she wouldhave to transfer to him one-half of the shares on payment by him to her of one-half of the sums paid by her to Chime on the allotment. She would likewise be accountable for one-half of the dividends she had received in respect of those shares but would be entitledto be credited with a commercial rate of interest on the allotment moneys that, on this hypothesis, she had paid on shares to theallotment to which Mr Wang was entitled.  I think it is reasonable to represent the complaint relating to the allotment of the âBâshares as a complaint about unfairly prejudicial management of Chime.  It is the question of remedy that may be problematic and difficult. The allotment took place in August 1990 some four or five months after Mr Wangâs disappearance.  In the trauma of the kidnappingand its aftermath the conduct of the affairs of Chime and the Chinachem group obviously had to go on.  The allotment representedan injection of new share capital into Chime of $1.5 billion.  The pleaded complaint about the allotment was not that Chime and itsgroup had no commercial need for the money or that the money was not used for genuine commercial purposes.  It is that the allotmentshould not have been made so as to alter the control, as between Mrs Wang and Mr Wang, of Chime.  That is a complaint that does notnecessarily require the allotment to be set aside and it may be contrary to the interests of Chime (and therefore contrary to theinterests of Mr Wang Snr) that it should be set aside. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Then there are the allegations about misappropriations from Chime and its specified five subsidiaries said to be constituted by thepayment of excessive remuneration to Mrs Wang and the other directors.  The relief sought asks the court to rule as to the amountof remuneration that the directors ought to have been paid and to order them to repay the excess.  Whether these claims are properlyincluded in the petition is not before this Court on this appeal but it seems to me very clear that the resolution of the issue shouldawait a determination in the probate proceedings as to who is entitled to succeed to Mr Wangâs interests in Chime. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> Finally there is the allegation that the directors have committed breaches of their duty to Chime in causing Chime to participateactively, and it is said unnecessarily, in the interlocutory proceedings in the petition.  This is a bit rich.  The petitioners havetaken it upon themselves to assert in the petition allegations that, if true, would establish breaches of duty by Mrs Wang and otherdirectors to Chime and to claim payment to Chime of the compensation attributable to those breaches of duty and therefore said tobe due to Chime.  The petitioners are, in effect, using the petition in order to prosecute derivative actions allegedly vested inChime.  They are doing so without any apparent regard to the damage that the litigation and its huge complexity may cause to Chimeand its business.  And at the same time they are complaining that Chime is not adopting a neutral stance in the litigation. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> If the petition is looked at in the round its topsy-turvy nature becomes apparent.  Chime and the Chinachem group, of which CAL isa part, is like the goose that lays the golden eggs.  The real issue in this litigation is who owns the goose.  Once it is knownwho owns the goose it will be known who is entitled to the golden eggs.  This petition is asserting, in effect, that Mrs Wang hasappropriated to herself some of the golden eggs.  That may turn out to be true, but whether it matters depends on who owns the goose. The dispute has been dressed up as a dispute about how the goose has been managed.  But the real dispute is not about managementof the goose.  It is about ownership of the goose and its golden eggs. </p>    <p><b><i>The amendments regarding the CAL loan</i></b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Although for the reasons I have given the court has jurisdiction, in the strict sense, to make the orders sought (other than theorder against CAL which is not a party to the petition) it would not, in my opinion, be proper for the court on this petition toentertain what would, in effect, be Chimeâs action against the directors for their breach of duty in causing the loan to be made. If there is misconduct it can be established in a derivative action.  If the court, on hearing the petition, thinks that a derivativeaction prosecuting this alleged misconduct should be brought, it can make an order to that effect under s.168A(2)(b).  It could also,if persuaded it were a convenient course to adopt, order that the petition and the derivative action be tried together. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> As a general rule, in my opinion, the court should not in a s.168A petition make an order for payment to be made by a respondentdirector to the company unless the order corresponds with the order to which the company would have been entitled had the allegationsin question been successfully prosecuted in an action by the company (or in a derivative action in the name of the company).  Ifthe order does not so correspond then, either the company will have received less than it is entitled to, in which case it will beentitled to relitigate the issue in an action against the director for the balance, or the company will have received more than itwas entitled to, in which case a clear injustice to the director will have been perpetrated.  Nor, in my opinion, should the courtallow a prayer in the petition for payment by the respondent director of compensation or of restitution to the company to stand unlessit is clear at the pleading stage that a determination of the amount, if any, of the directorâs liability at law to the companycan conveniently be dealt with in the hearing of the petition.  In any other case, in my opinion, if the allegations against thedirector are proper to be relied on as evidence of unfairly prejudicial conduct, the appropriate relief to be sought would be anorder under s.168A(2)(b) for a derivative action to be brought for the recovery of the sum legally due.  It would be proper for thecompany to express its views as to whether it would be in its interests for such an action to be brought. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> Moreover, the use of a s.168A petition in order to circumvent the rule in <i>Foss v Harbottle</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281843%29%202%20Hare%20461" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1843) 2 Hare 461</a> in a case where the nature of the complaint is misconduct rather than mismanagement is, in my opinion, an abuse of process.  In <i>Prudential Assurance Co. Ltd v. Newman Industries Ltd (No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20Ch%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 Ch 204</a> a personal action by a shareholder against the allegedly delinquent directors for the diminution in the value of the shareholderâsshares attributable, it was said, to the loss that had been caused to the company by the alleged wrongdoing, had been commenced. In the personal action the same allegations were made against the directors as were made in the accompanying derivative action broughtby the same shareholder in the name of the company to recover for the company the amount of its loss.  The Court of Appeal said this,at pp 223-224 :</p>    <blockquote>         âThe plaintiffs in this action were never concerned to recover in the personal action.  The plaintiffs were only interestedin the personal action as a means of circumventing the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i>.  The plaintiffs succeeded.  A personal action would subvert the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> and that rule is not merely a tiresome procedural obstacle placed in the path of a shareholder by a legalistic judiciary.  The ruleis the consequence of the fact that a corporation is a separate legal entity.â    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">In expressing their conclusions on the many issues raised by the <i>Prudential</i> case the Court of Appeal said that :</p>    <blockquote>        âThe problems involved in this case were caused by the fact that the Prudential [The shareholder] were the wrong plaintiffs.â (p.225)    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"> The circumvention of the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> by the inappropriate use of an unfair prejudice petition would be open to the same objections.  In <i>Re Saul D Harrison &amp; Sons plc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20BCLC%2014" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 BCLC 14</a> at p.18, Hoffmann LJ said that :</p>    <blockquote>         âEnabling the court in an <i>appropriate</i> case to outflank the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> was one of the purposes of [s.459].â  (emphasis added)    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"> The outflanking would not, in my opinion, be appropriate unless the criterion suggested in para. 62 were met. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> The criterion suggested in paragraph 62 for allowing derivative action relief to be claimed in a s.168A petition cannot be met inthe present case at least so far as the CAL loan relief is concerned.  So I would disallow the amendments in paras 3.2, 3.3, 3.4and 3.5 of the prayer for relief in the petition as amended pursuant to the order of the Court of Appeal. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> As to the amendments in the body of the petition relating to the CAL loan, i.e. paras 44.1 to 44.5 inclusive, I regard these amendmentsas permissible on the footing that they relate to management conduct that, if it is true that the $4.5 billion was used for the benefitof companies in which Mrs Wang but not Mr Wang was interested, could be represented as conduct unfairly prejudicial to the interestsof Mr Wang or, now, his estate. </p>    <p><b><i>Management of the petition</i></b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> This petition cries out for firm and effective case management.  For the reasons I have given, sensible case management decisionscannot be come to until it is known to whom the estate of Mr Wang belongs.  If it turns out that it belongs to Mr Wang Snr, Mrs Wangwill have to take a decision as to whether she can resist a demand by Mr Wang Snr to be placed in the same shareholding positionrelative to Mrs Wang as Mr Wang was in prior to his being kidnapped.  Mr Wang Snr will have to take a decision whether he wants toreverse the additional capitalisation of Chime that the allotment of the âBâ shares represented.  He will not wish, I imagine,to adopt a course which would be damaging to Chime.  And he must realise that if he presses for the allotment to be reversed Chimewill have to repay the $1.5 billion allotment consideration that was paid by Mrs Wang. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> Moreover, the prosecution of the complaint relating to the CAL loan, whether done via a derivative action or in the petition, wouldinvolve an expenditure in time and resources for the parties, including Chime, of a quite exorbitant extent.  It would also makedemands on the judicial resources of Hong Kong that it would be unreasonable for any litigant to expect to be met unless it wereplainly necessary in the interests of justice for that to be done. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> In these circumstances, in my opinion, there is everything to be said for a stay of the petition until the probate proceedings havereached a conclusion.  At that point, and not until that point, sensible conclusions about the progress of the petition can be reached.</p>    <p><b><i>Conclusion</i></b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> In the circumstances, and for the reasons I have tried to explain, I would allow the appeal to the extent indicated in paragraph64 above.  I would set aside the order for costs made by the Court of Appeal and make the order <i>nisi</i> and the directions proposed by Mr Justice Bokhary PJ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b>Mr Justice Bokhary PJ:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> We are unanimous.  The appeal is allowed so as to:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)    disallow the CAL prayers for relief (i.e. prayers 3.2 to 3.5 inclusive) while leaving the CAL allegations (i.e. paras 44.1to 44.5 inclusive) undisturbed; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)    substitute for the order as to costs made by the Court of Appeal an order <i>nisi</i> leaving the parties to bear their own costs here and in the courts below. </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">It is directed: (i) that the order <i>nisi</i> become absolute 21 days after the handing down of judgment in this case unless before then the Registrar of this Court has receiveda written submission containing full reasons seeking some other order as to costs; and (ii) that if such a written submission isso received, procedural directions on how the costs concerned are to be dealt with be made by the Registrar, subject to her discretionto refer the question of such directions to a single Permanent Judge. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Kemal Bokhary)</td>            <td width="34%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Patrick Chan)</td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(R.A.V.
