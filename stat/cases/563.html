He suffered a fracture of the right temporal bone and a traumatic perforationin his right ear as a result.  Jack, through his mother and next friend, commenced this action against the Defendant for damagesfor personal injuries and other loss and damage. </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The Defendant is the owner of Coco.  Coco was about 2 years old and weighed about 25 kg at the time of the incident.  Both liabilityand quantum are disputed.</p>    <p class="heading">Preliminary matters</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Before I embark on a discussion on liability and quantum, I need to deal with two matters that arose in the course of the trial.</p>    <p class="heading">(a)    Admissibility of Ms. Skellhamâs witness statement</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  First, the Plaintiff applied to admit the witness statement of Ms. Skellham as evidence without calling her.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Ms. Skellham is a witness for the Plaintiff.  Her statement was served on the Defendant in last September.  Ms. Skellham has sincereturned to the United States.  Jackâs mother said she had intended to call Ms. Skellham to testify at trial but was only informedrecently that the witness could not return to Hong Kong because her husband was away and she needed to look after the children. So, the Plaintiff served a hearsay notice on the Defendant two days before the trial was due to commence intending to adduce Ms.Skellhamâs statement as hearsay evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Defendant objected to the admission of Ms. Shellhamâs statement.  Both counsel invited me to defer argument to accommodatethe busy schedule of the other witnesses.  After hearing submission at the conclusion of the proceeding, I excluded Ms. Skellhamâsstatement on the ground that it was hearsay.  I said I would give my reason for the ruling in this judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The starting point of the consideration lies in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 47</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a>.  That section provides that evidence in civil proceedings shall not be excluded on the ground that it is hearsay unless:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)         a party against whom the evidence is to be adduced objects to the admission of the evidence; and</p>        <p>(b)        the court is satisfied, having regard to the circumstances of the case, that the exclusion of the evidence is not prejudicialto the interests of justice.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s49.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 49</a> then sets out the considerations relevant to weighing of hearsay evidence.  Although that section primarily deals with the weightto be given to hearsay evidence, it does have an indirect bearing on the assessment as to whether the exclusion of a piece of hearsayevidence would be prejudicial to the interests of justice: <i>per</i> Lam J in <i>Cheung Wei Man Vivien v. Centaline Property Agency Ltd.</i>, HCA 286/2000, para.12.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Defendant has objected to Ms. Skellhamâs statement.  So, I need to consider whether I am satisfied that its exclusion is notprejudicial to the interests of justice.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Ms. Skellham states in her statement that she witnessed the collision.  There are other witnesses from both sides (namely, Ms. Menziesfor the Plaintiff, and Ms. Samija and Mr. Burden for the Defendant) who can testify in this regard.  The exclusion of this aspectof the statement will not, in my view, prejudice the interests of justice. </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  There is, however, more to Ms. Skellhamâs statement.  It is stated that Ms. Skellham approached the Defendant after the collisionand:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAt that time, [the Defendant] told me that she would take responsibility of the accident.  However, I believe that she was justtrying to impress on me that she was concerned about Jackâs injury.  [The Defendant] in fact claimed to me that âmy dog ran intokids all the timeâ.  Perhaps, this is the reason why she looked rather nonchalant to the incident which was quite terrifying tome.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Defendant strenuously denies having made the alleged admission.  Counsel for the Defendant objects to the statement principallyon the ground that the Defendant will be deprived of an opportunity to test such evidence by means of cross-examination if the statementwere to be received as hearsay evidence. </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Ms. Skellhamâs statement is dated 22<sup>nd</sup> August 2007, some 15 months after the incident.  It does not appear that Ms. Skellham has made a more contemporaneous statement. The only reason put forward by the Plaintiff for not producing Ms. Skellham as a witness is Ms. Skellhamâs own family reason. The Plaintiff is not otherwise suggesting that it is not reasonable or practical to call her.  The Plaintiff does not offer to takeMs. Shellhamâs evidence by video-link or apply for an adjournment to enable her to attend. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In my view, there are very pertinent and legitimate questions which the Defendant is entitled to ask Ms. Skellham.  The Plaintiffâscounsel does not dispute that.  He, however, suggests that I can first examine the Defendantâs denial and then go on to considerMs. Skellham evidence if I have decided to reject the denial.  I do not think that is desirable.  Both Ms. Skellham and the Defendantare referring to the same conversation.  It is not practicable to assess the Defendantâs denial without reference to Ms. Skellhamâsevidence.  The Defendant will be prejudiced if she were deprived of an opportunity to cross-examine Ms. Skellham.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Given its controversial character, I am satisfied that the exclusion of Ms. Skellhamâs statement is not prejudicial to the interestsof justice.   I therefore excluded Ms. Shellhamâs statement.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In any event, I would have given no weight to Ms. Shellhamâs statement for the reasons stated above even if I had ruled it in. So it really makes no difference at the end of the day.</p>    <p class="heading">(b)    Admissibility of a video recording filmed in December 2007</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Secondly, there was the Defendantâs application to adduce a video recording in the form of a DVD. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  On the third day of the trial, the Defendant sought to adduce a video recording through her last witness Mr. Burden.  The Plaintiffobjected to such evidence on the ground that the DVD had not been disclosed before.  The Plaintiffâs counsel submitted it was aclassic case of ambush.  After hearing submission, I excluded the DVD.  Again, I said I would explain my ruling in this judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Mr. Burden went to Discovery Bay in December 2007 to film Jack.  According to him, the recording shows how well Jack was at thattime.  The Defendantâs counsel said a decision had been made in a conference with the Defendant that the recording would only beproduced if the Plaintiff adduced evidence on any residual effect suffered by Jack. </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In my view, the conduct of the defence in relation to the DVD is unacceptable. </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  It is clear from the Revised Statement of Damages that the Plaintiff is claiming damages for loss of earning capacity and futuremedical expenses.  The claim for future medical expenses was only abandoned on the first day of the trial.  It should also be apparentfrom the witness statement of Jackâs mother that she will testify as to some residual effect Jack is suffering.  So the Defendantknew all along that Jackâs present condition and whether the collision has had any residual effect on Jack would be live issuesat the trial. </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The defence is suggesting that it was a conscious decision on the part of the defence to withhold such evidence.  The only discernablereason for such a tactical move was a desire to trap Jackâs mother in what the Defendant perceived to be lies. </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  In a similar case <i>Cheung Wei Man Vivien v Centaline Property Agency Ltd.</i>, HCA 286/2000, the plaintiffs there had chosen to withhold some taped recordings and to administer interrogatories regarding matterswhich were evidenced by those tapes with a view to discredit the defendant by answers inconsistent with the tapes. </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Lam J has this to say about such conduct at paragraph 28 of his judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe Plaintiffs had attempted to explain the late discovery as a tactical move to expose what they perceived to be the lies of theDefendants.  It was a deliberate decision and regrettably a solicitor was said to be involved.  In my judgment, this is not an acceptableexcuse.  Concealment of documents would not assist the court in making a fair assessment of a witness.  A party is entitled to conductlitigation on the basis that his opponent gives proper discovery as required by the rules.  All litigants and those advising themshould familiarize themselves with the duty relating to discovery.  Any forensic manoeuvre that smacks of ambush has no place inmodern litigation and this court will not hesitate in voicing a strong disapproval for such conduct.  A witness should have the chanceto consider the relevant documents before he reduces his evidence into witness statement.  The duty of discovery requires full discoverybeing given and withholding materials with a view to gain some forensic advantage in terms of trapping the opponents is an abuseof process.  This court must take a firm stance to discourage such improper conduct of litigation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In my view, what was said by Lam J in <i>Cheung Wei Man Vivien</i> applies equally to this case.  It matters not that the Defendant only came into possession of the DVD after Jackâs mother had alreadyreduced her evidence into a witness statement. </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Jackâs recovery is a continuing process.  The DVD came into being last December.  By Mr. Burdenâs account, the DVD containsrelevant evidence on Jackâs condition.  There is a continuing obligation on litigants under Order 24, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 1</a> of the Rules of the District Court to disclose all relevant documents: see <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2008</i>, para.24/2/16.  The meaning of âdocumentsâ is not restricted to paper writings, and video recordings of evidence are clearlycovered: see <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2008</i>, para.24/2/2.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Instead of disclosing the DVD as soon as it came into the Defendantâs possession, the Defendant elected to conceal it.  Worsestill, the DVD was not put to Jackâs mother during cross-examination.  She was not offered an opportunity to explain any inconsistencythere may be between her testimony and what is recorded in the DVD. </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Most regrettably, as in <i>Cheung Wei Man Vivien</i>, the Defendantâs counsel hinted that the decision to withhold such evidence was made with the benefit of legal advice.  I thinkit is high time that legal practitioners pay heed to the stern warning of Lam J and to familiarize themselves with their duty relatingto discovery.  The courts will not tolerate such improper conduct.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  For the above reasons, I refused the Defendantâs application to adduce the DVD into evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">Liability</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  I now turn to the question of liability.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Ms. Menzies for the Plaintiff, and Ms. Samija and Mr. Burden for the Defendant all claim to have witnessed the collision.  However,their accounts of how Jack came to collide with Coco are very different.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Both counsel agree that the main focuses on the question of liability are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)         Whether Coco was on leash at the time of the incident?</p>        <p>(b)        Whether the Defendant threw a tennis ball towards the open area for Coco to retrieve?</p>        <p>(c)         How did Jack collide with Coco?</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(a)    The Plaintiffâ case</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Jackâs mother and Ms. Menzies testified for the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  According to Jackâs mother, she took Jack and Jackâs friend Andrew to a movie in Tung Chung on the day in question.  After themovie, they returned to Discovery Bay to meet up with Andrewâs mother Ms. Skellham.  The boys had bought toys at the cinema andwere playing in the open area of Discovery Bay Plaza when Jackâs mother and Ms. Skellham were talking to each other at the perimeter.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Ms. Skellham complained about some irritant in her eyes and Jackâs mother was looking at it when they suddenly heard Jack screaming. Jackâs mother then had her back towards the open area and so did not see what happened.  When she turned, she saw Jack stood up,wobbled and was screaming. </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Jack was holding his head and ear.  When Jackâs mother checked on him, she saw blood gushing out from his ear.  Ms. Skellham gotsome ice from Solid Rock CafÃ© nearby and put it on Jackâs head.  Jack did not calm down but continued crying.  Jackâs motherand Ms. Skellham then took Jack to Discovery Bay Medical Centre for preliminary treatment and then to Canossa Hospital.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Ms. Menzies was present at Discovery Bay Plaza and witnessed the incident.  She did not know Jackâs mother or Jack at that time. She and Jackâs mother have a common friend called Kathy.  After the incident, Ms. Menzies told Kathy about it and Kathy relayedto Jackâs mother.  Eventually, Jackâs mother asked the Plaintiffâs solicitors to take a statement from Ms. Menzies after confirmingwith Ms. Menzies that she was willing to testify. </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  According to Ms. Menzies, she first noticed the Defendant and Coco on the day in question as she was walking past Solid Rock CafÃ©with her partner and their 5 to 6 months old baby boy.  She noticed the Defendant and some people sitting at a table outside thecafÃ©.  She saw Coco approaching the Defendant with a tennis ball in her mouth.  She then saw the Defendant throwing the tennis balltowards the centre of the open area for Coco to retrieve.  Coco was not on a leash. </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  After Ms. Menzies was seated, she saw the Defendant throwing the tennis ball towards the open area again for Coco to retrieve. Jack and another child were running about in the open area.  As Coco was running towards the open area for the ball, she collidedwith Jack.  Ms. Menzies can no longer recall how exactly they collided with each other.</p>    <p class="heading">(b)    The Defendantâs case</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The Defendant, Mr. Burden and Ms. Samija testified at the trial.  They say they were having brunch with some other friends at atable outside Solid Rock CafÃ© at the time of the incident.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Coco was lying under the table beside the Defendant.  They say Coco was on a leash and the Defendant was holding the leash withher left hand.  Suddenly, something caught Cocoâs attention.  She got up and trotted towards the open area.  Mr. Burden immediatelywent after her.  The Defendantâs view towards the open area was blocked, but Mr. Burden and Ms. Samija were able to see what happened.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  According to Mr. Burden and Ms. Samija, Mr. Burden called to Coco when she was about halfway across the open area.  Coco turnedand trotted back.  Jack was then running backwards in the open area and he fell over Coco.  Jack seemed all right after the collision. He got up and went to other children nearby.  Mr. Burden checked on Cocoâs hip as Coco was suffering from hip dysplaxia.  He noticeda ball in Cocoâs mouth and ordered her to drop it before they returned to the table.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Twenty to thirty minutes later, a lady came over to their table and asked for Cocoâs owner.  The Defendant acknowledged that shewas the owner and the lady told them Jack had been taken to hospital.  The Defendant asked if a report should be made to the policebut the lady said that was not necessary.  The Defendant then volunteered her name and telephone number to the lady and asked thelady to tell Jackâs parents to call her.  The lady then left without giving her name.</p>    <p class="heading">(c)    Finding of fact</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  I find the Defendantâs case artificial and not believable.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)         The Defendant and her two witnesses are adamant that the Defendant was holding Cocoâs leash with her left hand whilsteating with her right hand.  However, they had somehow all omitted to mention this important fact in their respective witness statement,which were taken by lawyers.</p>        <p>(b)        The Defendant demonstrated at the trial how she had held Cocoâs leash.  There was a loop at the end of the leash.  Sheput the loop around her writ and was also holding the leash with her left fist.  I do not think the Defendant has offered a satisfactoryaccount as to how the leash could have slipped out of the her hand if she had indeed hold the leash in the way alleged.  Coco couldnot have dashed off as, according to the defence, Coco has hip problem.  So it is not the Defendantâs case that the lead was pulledoff by sudden force.</p>        <p>(c)         The Defendant said all Cocoâs leashes were about 60 in long.  It is the Defendantâs case that the open area was verycrowded at the time, with adults, children and dogs.  Mr. Burden even said he had to go round a few people in order to get to Coco. Under those circumstances, it was rather unlikely for Coco (with a loose 60-inch lead attached to her) could have trotted half wayacross the open area without inconveniencing others.</p>        <p>(d)        Mr. Burden had just witnessed Jack falling over Coco.  It is unbelievable that he would still order Coco to drop the ballin the open area, leaving it to be stepped on by other children. </p>        <p>(e)         The Defendant has emphasized how much she cares for Coco.  On the day in question, she had meant to keep Coco under controlbut Coco still managed to break loose.  However, she did not follow Coco with her eyes but had to require Mr. Burden later to tellher about the collision.  The Defendant tries to explain that there were many people moving about in the open area and there wasa tree in front of their table blocking her view.  However, Ms. Samija, who was just sitting beside the Defendant and facing thesame direction, had no difficulty in observing what happened.  In my view, it is artificial to truncate the incident into segmentsand asking the Defendant to testify as to what happened before and after the collision, but leaving it to Ms. Samija and Mr. Burdento account for the collision.  Having seen the Defendant testifying, I think it is fair to say that she did not perform well as awitness.  Even her counsel describes her as an âemotional ladyâ with some of her responses in cross-examination âargumentativeand not quite to the pointâ.  I cannot help but think that it was a deliberate decision to leave it to Ms. Samija and Mr. Burdento talk about the collision.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Both the Defendant and Mr. Burden say they always put Coco on a leash when they take her out for a walk and the only time they wouldtake the leash off is when Coco does her toileting.  However, this is contradicted by the video recordings adduced by the Plaintiff,which show the Defendant and Mr. Burden respectively walking Coco without a leash.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The Defendant relies on some veterinary records and claims that Coco has been suffering from hip dysplaxia.  She suggests that Cocowas so disabled at the time of the incident that she could not have run to retrieve the tennis ball as described by Ms. Menzies. However, the video recordings adduced by the Plaintiff confirm that Coco was quite capable of running, playing around and even jumpingover a low fence.  There is no sign of any disability.  All witnesses confirm that there was not much difference in Coco as seenon 1<sup>st</sup> May 2006 and on the video.  Whether Coco could have run as fast as other golden retrievers of her age is beside the point.  I amleft in no doubt that Coco was capable of going after and retrieving the tennis ball in the way described by Ms. Menzies.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Ms. Menzies demonstrated the Defendant throwing the tennis ball over her shoulder for Coco to retrieve.  The Defendant says sheis suffering from a bad shoulder and was unable to throw a tennis ball as demonstrated.  No medical evidence is adduced to confirmthe Defendantâs shoulder problem.  The Defendant is a flight attendant by profession.  Given her duties as a flight attendant,I find it unlikely that she could not lift her arm just to throw a tennis ball. </p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  The Plaintiff puts forward Ms. Menzies as an independent witness.  The defence has submitted that she is a dishonest witness deliberatelytailoring her evidence to help the Plaintiff.  None of the arguments put forward by the defence, however, has cast any doubt on Ms.Menziesâ credibility. </p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)         Ms. Menzies was cross-examined on her identification of the Defendant as the ball-thrower.  Ms. Menzies says she firstnoticed the Defendant throwing a tennis ball for Coco to retrieve when she walked past Solid Rock CafÃ©.  She says she was concernedand later remarked to her partner that an accident was about to happen.  She says after she and her partner were seated, she wasable to observe the Defendantâs face clearly as she had meant to go over to speak to her, but was told by her partner to mind herown business.  So, Ms. Menzies did not just have a fleeting glance of the Defendant.  She had observed the Defendant for some timeand had her reasons for doing so.  I think it was natural for her to feel concerned as a mother, as she was with her own baby atthe time.  I am satisfied with her identification of the Defendant as the ball thrower.   </p>        <p>(b)        Ms. Menzies was also challenged on her ability to observe what had happened from where she was seated.  Ms. Menzies sayswhen she was seated she was facing the centre of the open area, which was about 30 m away.  The distance between her and where theDefendant was seated was about 40 m.  Ms. Menzies does not wear corrective lens.  According to her, it was a fine day and there wereonly about 10 odd people spreaded out in the open area.  Photographs adduced at the trial show that trees were sparsely planted inthat area.  In those circumstances, there is really nothing to cast doubt on her ability to see what she said she saw. </p>        <p>(c)         Ms. Menzies was criticized for not going over to Jackâs mother immediately after the collision to tell her what hadhappened.  But Ms. Menzies did not know Jackâs mother then.  She did not realize then that Jackâs mother had not seen the collision. And she had just been told by her partner to mind her own business.  In those circumstances, it is understandable that Ms. Menziesdid not approach Jackâs mother there and then.</p>        <p>(d)        Ms. Menzies was also criticized for not making a contemporaneous note of the incident.  It was a public holiday for Ms.Menzies and her partner, and they were strolling with their baby.  I would be very surprised if they had brought along pen and paperas if they had anticipated an accident.  After the collision, Ms. Menzies did not know she would have anything further to do withthe incident, not until she was approached by Jackâs mother for assistance.  Jackâs mother told Ms. Menzies that the Plaintiffâssolicitors would take a statement from her (as opposed to asking Ms. Menzies to write down what she saw).  All these explain whythere is not a more contemporaneous account of the incident and why Ms. Menzies cannot now recall some of the details (e.g. how Jackactually collided with Coco) given the time elapsed.  If Ms. Menzies had been so eager to help the Plaintiff as alleged, Ms. Menzieswould have memorized her statement by heart and regurgitate such evidence at the trial.</p>        <p>(e)         The Defendantâs counsel submitted that Ms. Menzies changed her evidence several times and he quoted a number of examples. It is said that Ms. Menzies has omitted to mention in her witness statement that her partner had asked her to mind her own businesswhen she told him that an accident was about to happen.  Ms. Menzies was examined and cross-examined at length.  She was led to recallthe incident frame by frame.  I am not surprised that she could recall the conversation.  The Defendantâs counsel also said thatMs. Menzies stated in her statement that Jack and Andrew were âstrollingâ across the open area, whereas she testified in courtthat they were ârunningâ just like little boys would.  But it is common ground that Jack was indeed ârunningâ in the openarea.  The difference between the parties is whether Jack was running forward or backward.  The Defendantâs counsel has also cross-examinedMs. Menzies on the choice of the word âfreneticallyâ in her statement.  The witness statement was drafted by the Plaintiffâssolicitors based on Ms. Menziesâ account of the incident.  So it was the lawyerâs choice of word.  In my view, whether Coco wasârunning fastâ or âfrenetically runningâ is immaterial.  I do not regard such semantic difference as significant so as todiscredit Ms. Menzies.  All in all, I consider Ms. Menziesâ testimony in court as consistent with her statement.</p>        <p>(f)          Mr. Burden is the Defendantâs fiancÃ©.  Ms. Menzies was cross-examined on a dispute between her partner and Mr. Burden. The Defendant is hinting that Ms. Menzies may bear a grudge against the Defendant and Mr. Burden.  However, this has been deniedby Ms. Menzies and the facts of that dispute have never been established by the defence.  There is no basis to suggest that Ms. Menzieshas her own axe to grind in testifying against the Defendant.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  There is a letter from the police confirming what Jackâs mother had told the police when she filed a report of the incident on16<sup>th</sup> May 2006.  The Defendantâs counsel noted from the letter that Jackâs mother had not mentioned any ball throwing activity to thepolice.  He submits that the Plaintiff must have then taken legal advice and Ms. Menzies evidence is calculated to meet the legaltest of negligence.  I do not think this criticism is justified.  It has all along been the testimony of Jackâs mother that shedid not witness the collision.  That explains why she did not mention any ball throwing to the police.  She only came to know aboutMs. Menzies afterwards through their common friend.  She then asked the Plaintiffâs solicitors to take a statement from Ms. Menzies. Ms. Menziesâ statement is dated 14<sup>th</sup> September 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  For the above reasons, I consider the Plaintiffâs case more believable and find that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)         Coco was not on a leash at the time of the incident.</p>        <p>(b)        The Defendant did throw a tennis ball towards the open area for Coco to retrieve.</p>        <p>(c)         Jack collided with Coco as Coco was retrieving the ball thrown by the Defendant, although how exactly Jack collided withCoco has not been clearly established by evidence adduced by the parties.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(d)    The Defendantâs liability</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The Plaintiffâs counsel submits that the Defendant is liable on four distinct bases:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)         strict liability under the scienter rule;</p>        <p>(b)        negligence;</p>        <p>(c)         nuisance; and</p>        <p>(d)        breach of duty imposed by regulation 9 of the Dangerous Dogs Regulations.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He is no longer relying on the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>.  I shall now discuss each of these bases in turn, based on my above findings.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The Plaintiff has not succeeded in establishing liability based on scienter.  The owner or keeper of an animal is strictly liablefor the injury caused by the animal:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)         if the species of animal is classified as dangerous (<i>ferae naturae</i>); or</p>        <p>(b)        if the species of animal is classified as tame (<i>mansuetae naturae</i>) but the individual animal has a mischievous propensity known to the keeper, and damage is caused by the animalâs propensity.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>See <i>Tort Law and Practice in Hong Kong</i> (2005), Chapter 8, para.8.4.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  It is not the Plaintiffâs case that Coco, a golden retriever, belongs to a species of animal classified as dangerous.  Rather,the Plaintiffâs counsel is relying on the second limb.  He submits that the Defendant is liable because the Defendant knew Cocohad the propensity to retrieve things, such as the tennis ball thrown by the Defendant.  In my view, it is not enough to rely onthe ordinary nature of golden retrievers.  In order to establish liability, the propensity being relied upon must be one that isreally likely to be dangerous and involves the idea of an attack: see <i>Tort Law and Practice in Hong Kong</i>, <i>supra</i>, para.8.14. </p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  At common law, ââ¦ quite apart from the liability imposed upon the owner of animals or the person having control of them by reasonof knowledge of their propensities, there is the ordinary duty of a person to take care either that his animal or his chattels isnot put to such a use as is likely to injure his neighbour â the ordinary duty to take care in the cases put upon negligenceâ:<i>per</i> Lord Atkin in <i>Fardon v. Harcourt-Rivington</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281932%29%2048%20TLR%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1932) 48 TLR 215</a> at 217.  This much is admitted by the Defendant: see Amended Defence, para.4.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  By bringing Coco to the open area of Discovery Bay Plaza, the Defendant owed a duty of care to the people there to put Coco underproper and effective control so as not to allow Coco to cause injury to them.  This is particularly so where there are children playingin that area.  That is why the Discovery Bay City Rules provides that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âDogs must be kept under strict control at all times in public and residential areas.  They must not be left unaccompanied in publicareas.  No dogs are permitted at any time anywhere within school site, childrenâs play area, on Tai Pak beach or along the beachpromenade.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>There are also brackets installed on the walls in Discovery Bay Plaza for use by pet owners.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  The Plaintiff says Coco knocked Jack down as she was retrieving the ball: see Amended Statement of Claim, para.5(d).  The Defendantsays Jack fell over Coco as he was running backwards: see Amended Defence, para.10.  I have rejected the accounts of Ms. Samija andMr. Burden as to what happened.  Ms. Menzies cannot remember how Jack collided with Coco.  So it is not clear from the evidence howexactly Jack collided with Coco.  In my view, it does not matter whether Jack was knocked down by Coco or fell over Coco.  The damagecaused by the collision was a foreseeable consequence of the Defendant sending Coco into the open area to retrieve the tennis ball.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  1<sup>st</sup> May 2006 was a public holiday.  It was a sunny day and there were adults and children making use of the public area.  The Defendantdid not just fail her duty as a dog owner to take reasonable care to control Coco.  The Defendantâs conduct in throwing a tennisball into the open area for Coco to retrieve when she knew or ought to have known that there were children playing in that area is,in my view, most negligent.  She is therefore liable.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The Plaintiffâs counsel has also relied on <i>Pitcher v Martin</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%203%20All%20ER%20918" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] 3 All ER 918</a> and submitted that the Defendant is liable on nuisance.  In the case cited, the owner was held liable for the nuisance created byallowing a dog with a 50-inch long loose lead running about in the streets of London.  In the present case, I have found as a factthat Coco was not on a leash at the material time.  That authority would have been relevant if I had found for the Plaintiffâsalternative case that Coco was on a leash but the Defendant failed to exercise proper control over Coco.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  The Plaintiffâs counsel also submits that the Defendant was in breach of regulation 9(1) of the Dangerous Dogs Regulations whichgives rise to a separate cause of action.  Regulation 9, insofar as it is relevant to this case, provides that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1)    No person shall cause, suffer or permit a large dog to enter or remain in a public place unless the dogâ</p>    </blockquote>    <table width="85%" border="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="8%"> </td>            <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td width="90%" valign="top" class="quote">is being securely held on a leash of not more than 2 m in length by a person; or</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="8%"> </td>            <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td width="90%" valign="top" class="quote">is securely tied to a fixed object on a leash of not more than 1.5 m in length in a manner that does not pose a danger to public andanimal safety, and welfare of the dog.â</td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) â¦</p>        <p>(3) A person who contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine at level 4 and to imprisonmentfor 3 months.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  The Defendant admits that Coco is a âlarge dogâ and that the open area is a âpublic placeâ within the definition of theregulation.  However, the Defendant denies that a breach of the regulation would give rise to any civil liability.  The Defendantâscounsel cites <i>Li Yuk Lan v Lau Kit</i> Ling, CACV 133/2988, 10/2/1989, Court of Appeal (Cons VP, Hunter JA, &amp; Mortimer J), and <i>Tang Lo Lai-chun v Yim Ho Wai-lin alias Ho Wai-lin</i>, HCA 2017/1972, 20/11/1975 (Cons J) in support of his contention.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Given my above ruling that the Defendant is negligent, it is not necessary for me to decide whether a breach of regulation 9 wouldgive rise to any civil liability.  However, I will still express my view since this issue has been argued.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  <i>Li Yuk Lan</i> and <i>Tang Lo Lai-chun</i> were both concerned with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/167A/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 19(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/167A" class="autolink_findacts">Dogs and Cats Regulations</a>, made pursuant to the then <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/167" class="autolink_findacts">Dogs and Cats Ordinance</a>.  The said ordinance has since been overhauled and that particular regulation repealed.  Since the Plaintiff is relying on a differentregulation which is not discussed in the cases cited, those cases afford no direct authority on the issue under consideration andwe must turn to the basics.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  The basic proposition is the general rule reasserted by Lord Diplock in <i>Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No.2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%20173" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] AC 173</a> at 185 that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ where an Act creates an obligation, and enforces the performance in a specified manner â¦ that performance cannot be enforcedin any other manner â¦ Where the only manner of enforcing performance for which the Act provides is prosecution for the criminaloffence of failure to perform the statutory prohibition for which the Act provides, there are two classes of exception to this generalrule.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The first exception is where on the true construction of the Act it is apparent that the obligation or prohibition was imposed forthe benefit or protection of a particular class of individuals.  The second exception arises where the statute creates a public rightand a particular member of the public suffers particular direct and substantial damage other and different from that which was commonto all the rest of the public.  See <i>Clerk and Lindsell</i>, 19<sup>th</sup> Edition (2006), para.9-12.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Regulation 9(3) creates a criminal offence for the contravention of regulation 9(1).  The regulation does not provide for any civilremedy for its breach. </p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  The Dangerous Dogs Regulations were made under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/167/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/167" class="autolink_findacts">Dogs and Cats Ordinance</a>.  The said ordinance is enacted to âprovide for the keeping, regulation and control of dogs and cats, for the prohibition of theslaughter of dogs and cats, and for related mattersâ: see the preamble.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/167/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3</a> provides that the Chief Executive may by regulation provide for, <i>inter alia</i>, âthe control of dogs and catsâ, âthe classification of dogsâ, âthe keeping of any dog or class of dogs under effectivecontrolâ, and âthe control of the bringing of any dogs or class of dogs into any specified placeâ.  In moving the regulationsin the Legislative Council, the Secretary for the Environment and Food explained that the regulations aimed to safeguard the publicfrom attacks by dangerous dogs through more focused control.  The regulations suggested that dangerous dogs be classified into threecategories, namely, âfighting dogsâ, âknown dangerous dogsâ and âlarge dogsâ and stipulated the control measures to beapplied to each of these categories.  See p.6472 of the official record of LegCo proceedings on 17<sup>th</sup> May 2000.  In my view, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/167/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 9</a> is designed to control âlarge dogsâ for the protection of the general public.  It is not designed for the benefit or protectionof any particular class of individuals. </p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Anyone who is aggrieved by a breach of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/167/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 9</a> may seek compensation by an action in negligence.  The existence of this common law remedy also weighs against the creation of apublic right.  In any event, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/167/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> does not empower the Chief Executive to make regulations conferring private right of action.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The only remedy afforded by the ordinance for breach of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/167/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 9</a> is the criminal process.  It cannot be enforced in any other manner.  The Plaintiff has not succeeded in bringing himself withinthe exceptions. </p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  I now turn to the defence alleged.  The Defendant says the Plaintiff was also negligent.  I do not agree. </p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  The Defendantâs counsel submits that Jack was obviously at some risk of harming himself by running around, probably sometimesturning and running backwards and screaming occasionally.  I have rejected the evidence of Ms. Samija and Mr. Burden and there isno other evidence to show that Jack was running backward.  Even if Jack was running backwards as alleged, he was merely playing ina way a 4 year-old child would.  I do not think Jack was of such an age at the time of the incident as would reasonably be expectedto take precautions for his own safety: see <i>Clerk and Lindsell</i>, <i>supra</i>, para.3-55.  The collision was caused by the Defendantâs negligence and Jack cannot be guilty of contributory negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The Defendantâs counsel has also criticized Jackâs mother for not paying attention to Jack at the material time.  I do not thinkthe criticism is justified.  Jack was playing in a public area which is free of vehicular traffic.  Jackâs mother was merely astone throw away.  There was simply nothing that should raise her concern about Jackâs safety.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  The Plaintiff has withdrawn the claim for future medical expenses and the claim for the costs of the cancelled airplane tickets.

Dr. Patty Yuen packed Jackâs right ear canal with normalsaline soaked gauze to try to stop the bleeding.  As his right ear canal continued to bleed, Jack was referred to Canossa Hospitalfor further treatment.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  When Jack was examined by Dr. Kenneth Tsui at Canossa Hospital, his right ear was still bleeding and he was found to be drowsy andnauseating.  The attending nurse noted the presence of pain.  CT scan of the brain and skull showed right temporal bone fracture. Examination by ENT surgeon Dr. Martin Pak revealed small traumatic perforation in Jackâs right ear and continuous oozing of freshblood from the perforation.  The diagnosis was traumatic drum perforation of the right ear and right temporal bone fracture.  Jackâsear was gently cleansed and the bleeding was controlled.  Oral antibiotics and analgesics were given.

He relies on <i>Leung Fun Hing</i>, HCPI 57/2001, 24/9/02 (Burrell J); <i>Ng Ka Ho</i>, DCPI 28/2004, 4/5/05 (Deputy District Judge P Li); <i>Lee Yuk Man</i>, DCPI 1988/2006, 6/6/07 (Deputy District Judge K Lo); <i>Wong Fung Nui</i>, DCPI 455/2006, 2/11/07 (HH Judge Chow); and <i>Tse Parc Ki</i>, DCPI 1981/2006, 11/12/07, my judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  The Defendantâs counsel, on the other hand, relies on <i>Mak Kwong</i> Woo, HCA 1777/1981, 17/5/94 (Mantell J); <i>Ng Kam</i>, HCA 4882/1981, 27/3/85 (Penlington J); <i>Lee Chung</i>, HCA 2764/85, 6/11/85 (Master Suttill); <i>Chan Tsz Sing</i>, CACV 176/04, 31/1/05 (Woo VP, Cheung JA &amp; Stone J); <i>Wong Shing Kam</i>, DCPI 171/2005, 24/1/06 (Deputy District Judge ST Poon); and <i>Limbu Saram Kumar</i>, HCPI 382/2003, 4/4/06 (Deputy High Court Judge Gill) and pitches the award at $30,000.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  I do not derive much assistance from the cases cited.  Some of these cases relate to injuries of a different nature and some relateto injuries which are much more serious.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) The plaintiff in <i>Leung Fun Hing</i> sustained a severe blow on the side of his head with his right eardrum damaged.  That had resulted in tinnitus and moderate right-sideddeafness.  PSLA was agreed at $350,000.</p>        <p>(b) In <i>Ng Ka Ho</i>, the plaintiff was diagnosed by experts to have suffered from Post Traumatic Distress Symptoms and subjective memory loss.  The accidenthad also aggravated the symptoms of âPervasive Developmental Disorders Not Otherwise Specifiedâ albeit not substantially.  Thelearned Judge awarded PSLA at $250,000. </p>        <p>(c) In <i>Lee Yuk Man</i>, the plaintiff slipped with the right side of his body landing on his right wrist.  The learned Judge awarded $160,000 for the rightchest contusion injury and the fracture of the triquetrum of the right wrist with residual pain.</p>        <p>(d) In <i>Wong Fung Nui</i>, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant strongly slapped on the plaintiffâs left face.  The learned Judge found that the plaintiff suffered tinnitus in her leftear, vertigo and headache and adjustment disorder as a result of the assault, and awarded $80,000 for PSLA.</p>        <p>(e) In <i>Mak Kwong Woo</i>, the plaintiff was awarded $5,000 in 1984 for a cut lip and grazed cheek resulting from the frightening experience of the collisionbetween the plaintiffâs pillion and the defendantâs motorcycle. </p>        <p>(f) In <i>Ng Kam</i>, the learned Judge awarded $15,000 in 1985 to the plaintiff for what he described as âsome pain and general inconvenienceâ asa result of a traffic accident.</p>        <p>(g) The plaintiff in <i>Lee Chung</i> was awarded $4,000 in 1985 for unconsciousness, a 1 cm cut over his forehead and tenderness over his left shoulder as a result ofthe traffic accident.</p>        <p>(h) In <i>Chan Tsz Sing</i>, the Court of Appeal awarded $70,000 for the facial scarring suffered by the plaintiff.</p>        <p>(i) In <i>Wong Shing Kam</i>, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was awarded $25,000 for a 1 cm laceration over his lower gum region, right elbow bruising, swollen right face and bleedingof the mouth.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff was awarded $30,000 for neck sprain and bruises on the legs.</p>        <p>(j) In <i>Limbu Saram Kumar</i>, the learned Judge said he would have awarded plaintiff not less than $50,000 for headaches, dizziness and residual back pains resultingfrom an accident at work had he found for the plaintiff on liability.</p>        <p>(k) The plaintiff in <i>Tse Parc Ki</i> suffered avulsed nail and bleeding from the nail bed in her right middle finger and I awarded $40,000 for PSLA. </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Although Jackâs mother has suggested that Jack is still suffering from some residual effect of the collision, such condition isnot confirmed by medical evidence.  Dr. Tsui observed Jack to be drowsy with nausea at the immediate aftermath.  However, the neurologistDr. Chan noted Jack to be active and alert at the consultation on 12<sup>th</sup> May 2006.  Dr. Chan eventually discharged Jack on 13<sup>th</sup> June 2006 without the need for medication and with favourable prognosis for complete recovery.  In any event, there is nothing toestablish the casual link between any such condition and the collision.  I will not take that into consideration when assessing PSLA.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  The injuries suffered by Jack is not trivial.  He sustained fracture of the right temporal bone and perforation in his right ear. He was clearly in agony and pain after the collision.  He was hospitalized for two days.  It took some time for Jack to recoveralthough the recovery was thankfully uneventful.  Having regard to all the circumstances, I think a fair award would be $80,000.</p>    <p class="heading">(b)    Loss of earning capacity</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  An award for loss of earning capacity is intended to cover risks that at some future date during the plaintiffâs working life,he will lose his employment and will then suffer financial loss because of his disadvantage in the labour market.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  As there is no evidence to suggest that Jack has sustained permanent injury which will affect his employment in future, no awardis made under this head.</p>    <p class="heading">(c)    Travelling expenses</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  There is a claim of $2,101 on traveling expenses.  The Defendant is agreeable to $705 based on the receipts adduced.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  Jack and his family reside at Discovery Bay on Lantau Island.  Other than Dr. Yuen from Discovery Bay Medical Centre, all otherdoctors who treated Jack have their clinics either on the Hong Kong Island or the Kowloon peninsular.  Someone had to take Jack tothese treatments.  They had to take a ferry to Central before commuting with land transportation.  I think a reasonable compensationfor the traveling expenses for Jack and an accompanying adult to attend those medical treatments would be $1,500.</p>    <p class="heading">(d)    Jackâs cancelled activities</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  There is a claim of $3,640 for the cost of cancelled summer activity classes booked for May and June 2006.  Both entitlement andquantum are challenged.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  Jack had enrolled in music and movement classes before the incident.  A receipt for the sum of $1,170 was produced to evidence thetuition fee paid.  According to Jackâs mother, Jack refrained from attending those classes on doctorâs advice.  A letter fromDr. Pak was produced to confirm that Jack had been advised to refrain from taking up vigorous physical activities and attending classesthat would involve movement, jumping and running for at least 2 months. </p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  The Plaintiff also produced two receipts for the artworks classes which Jack had attended in May and June 2006.  Jackâs motherexplains that she enrolled Jack in these classes (which did not involve vigorous physical activities) so as to provide him with someactivities.  This is a sensible decision but I do not think the Defendant should be responsible for such expenses.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  Based on the evidence adduced, I would only allow $1,170 under this head.</p>    <p class="heading">(e)    Tonic food</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  The Plaintiff is claiming $3,000 for tonic food.  According to Jackâs mother, the doctors have recommended high-calcium diet forJack, and the family spent about $3,000 on high-calcium food and vitamin supplements for at least 6 months. </p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  The amount claimed is an estimate and is not supported by receipt.  Be that as it may, courts are usually prepared to award a reasonableamount for tonic food depending on the circumstances of each case. </p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  High-calcium diet was indeed recommended by Dr. Chan.  Jack was hospitalized for two days only and the recovery was speedy and withoutcomplication.  I think a reasonable award in the circumstances of this case should only be $500.</p>    <p class="heading">(f)     The cost of the airplane ticket for Jackâs grandmother to fly to Hong Kong</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  According to Jackâs mother, the family would have traveled to the United States to visit Jackâs grandmother but for Jackâsinjury.  Eventually, Jackâs grandmother flew to Hong Kong to see Jack.   The Plaintiff is claiming US$1,434.68 for Jackâs grandmotherâsairplane ticket.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  Under cross-examination, Jackâs mother agrees that there was no medical or compelling reason why Jackâs grandmother should flewto Hong Kong.  She came because she was close to Jack and was concerned about him.  In my view, the Plaintiffâs claim for the costof the airplane ticket is too remote and should not be allowed.</p>    <p class="heading">(g)   &amp; The value of the service of Jackâs mother</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  It is the Plaintiffâs case that Jackâs mother had to spend extra time to deliver extra care and services to Jack by reason ofthe injury.  There is therefore a claim for the value of the services rendered by Jackâs mother at $400 per hour and for 3 monthsat 3 hours a day.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  The Defendantâs counsel observed in his closing submission that the family already had a domestic helper to assist in caring forthe child, and the Defendant is willing to pay the cost of extra care at $400 per hour for 2 weeks at 1 hour per day.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  Although Jackâs mother was not working at the material time, she could have spent the extra time she looked after Jack on somethingelse.  I think the Defendantâs offer is reasonable and sufficient to compensate for the service of Jackâs mother.  I thereforeaward $5,600 under this head.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  The Defendant is liable to the Plaintiff for the collision on 1<sup>st</sup> May 2006.
