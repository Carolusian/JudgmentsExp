The Plaintiff is a company registered in Indonesia having its legal domicilein Bali. It provides management services for high quality villa developments in Bali by which the owners of such villas appoint itto let out their villa for them and to manage the letting by providing staff for the villa such as butlers, cooks, drivers, maidsand security staff. In effect, the Plaintiff provides the staff and service that will create the luxurious ambience which enhancesa residentâs stay at the villas.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  This case relates to Pantai Lima, a development of five luxury villas on the west coast of Bali which cost between US$3.7 millionand US$3.4 million to buy and will let for between US$1,400 and US$2,200 a night depending on the time of year.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The 2nd Defendant has been sued together with three other Defendants, all of whom are owners of a villa at Pantai Lima, for breachof a management agreement in writing, in the 2nd Defendantâs case, dated 13 March 2008. The agreement is at B/1-19. It is a comprehensiveagreement, professionally prepared, no doubt by lawyers, on the Plaintiffâs behalf and proffered by it to the Defendants for theiragreement and signature. The agreement is there to be read. Suffice it to say that in painstaking detail, it sets out the partiesârights and obligations in which the Defendant has entrusted the management of his villa to the Plaintiff. Clause 13, which is offundamental relevance to this application, relates to the governing law and dispute resolution in the event of any differences betweenthe parties leading, as has now happened, to litigation between them. It says this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Indonesia and the parties submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of</i> Denpasar, Bali for dispute resolution provided that the parties shall use their best endeavours to resolve disputes amicably beforeresorting to court action.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Clause 14.1 says that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>â¦ this Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of the Agreement â¦</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The statement of claim [A/5-25] pleads in great detail, the terms of the Agreement relied on by the Plaintiff and particularisesthe breaches complained of against all four Defendants. In essence, and I need not go further than this, the Plaintiff is suing forunlawful termination of the Agreement by the Defendants because they failed to give the length of notice required under the Agreementand in any event because there is no justification for such termination. There is also a claim in tort for damages for wrongful interferenceby the Defendants with the Plaintiffâs business, who are said to have induced the mass resignation of 46 of the Plaintiffâs employeeswho have been re-employed by another company doing the same work at the villas as they had done when the Plaintiff employed them.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Defendants say that the termination of the Agreement by them was both justified and necessary due to the Plaintiffâs bad managementof the villa development. A trial of the action will therefore require a careful examination of the conduct of the Plaintiff in itsperformance of the Agreement and of its management of the Defendantsâ villas under the Agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Plaintiffâs claim, although substantial and to a great extent as yet unquantified because its alleged losses with requirefurther investigation, is unlikely to be particularly large given the finite nature of the Agreement. It will largely be based onloss of income under the Agreement in terms of loss of fees and commission as well as damages to be assessed for wrongful interferencewith the Plaintiffâs business in the way that is alleged and which I have described in paragraph 4.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Before I turn to the issues, it is worth observing that of the four Defendants only this, the 2nd Defendant, has been served withthe writ. He has a home in Hong Kong and lives here for as much as half of the year. The nature of his work is that he is requiredto travel frequently and extensively. Of the other Defendants, and this appears in the writ [A/1], the 1st Defendant has a Hong Kongaddress, which is an industrial unit which he owns at Chai Wan; the 3rd Defendant is resident in Bali; and the 4th Defendant livesin London. Insofar as this aspect may have any significance, I will return to it presently.</p>    <p class="heading">The Argument</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Mr Yuen, SC in submitting that the action should be stayed in favour of the court at Denpasar contends that in the circumstancesof this case, Clause 13 <i>supra</i> is to be construed as an exclusive jurisdiction clause by which the parties have agreed to resolve their differences only in thatcourt and in accordance with Indonesian law. Mr Maurellet submits that on a plain and sensible reading of this clause, all that theparties had agreed to was a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause which would enable the party to proceed, if it was so disposed to do,in any other court which had competent jurisdiction over the other party to the action. In this case, the 2nd Defendant has beenserved in Hong Kong where he maintains a home and where he chooses to live for much of the year, in which case the Plaintiff is beforethe court as of right and from which it is not to be lightly removed.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  As the authorities show, if an applicant for a stay can demonstrate that the parties had agreed to an exclusive jurisdiction clauseelsewhere then, in the absence of very good reason to do otherwise, they will be required to litigate in the jurisdiction which theyhave contracted for. That this is so is amply demonstrated in the judgment of Brandon J (as he then was) in <i>The Eleftheria</i> [1970] P94 at 99G-100C:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>The principles established by the authorities can, I think, be summarised as follows:  (1) Where plaintiffs sue in England in breachof an agreement to refer disputes to a foreign court, and the defendants apply for a stay, the English court, assuming the claimto be otherwise within its jurisdiction, is not bound to grant a stay but has a discretion whether to do so or not.  (2) The discretionshould be exercised by granting a stay unless strong cause for not doing so is shown.  (3) The burden of proving such strong causeis on the plaintiffs.  (4) In exercising its discretion the court should take into account all the circumstances of the particularcase.  (5) In particular, but without prejudice to (4), the following matters, where they arise, may properly be regarded:</i><i>â (a) In what country the evidence on the issues of fact is situated, or more readily available, and the effect of that on the relativeconvenience and expense of trial as between the English and foreign courts.  (b) Whether the law of the foreign court applies and,if so, whether it differs from English law in any material respects.  (c) With what country either party is connected, and how closely. (d) Whether the defendants genuinely desire trial in the foreign country, or are only seeking procedural advantages.  (e) Whetherthe plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue in the foreign court because they would:  (i) be deprived of security for theirclaim; (ii) be unable to enforce any judgment obtained; (iii) be faced with a time-bar not applicable in England; or (iv) for political,racial, religious or other reasons be unlikely to get a fair trial.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In the later case of <i>The El Amria</i> [1981] 2 Lloyds Reports119 at 123-124, Brandon LJ (as he had become) re-stated and adopted what he had said in â<i>The Eleftheriaâ.</i></p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Rightly, in my judgment, Mr Maurellet accepts that if Mr Yuen is right and Clause 13 is an exclusive jurisdiction clause, he hasvery real difficulties in resisting a stay.</p>    <p class="heading">Is This An Exclusive Jurisdiction Clause</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Mr Yuen says that it is notwithstanding that the word âexclusiveâ has not been used in Clause 13. The failure to use the wordâexclusiveâ is not fatal in any sense. In this regard, Mr Yuen has referred to two Hong Kong cases, <i>Yu Lap Man v Good First Harvest Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20HKC%20622" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 HKC 622 (C.A.)</a> and <i>T&amp;K Electronics Ltd v Tai Ping Insurance Co. Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20HKLRD%20172" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 HKLRD 172 (Stone</a> J) which have considered how the court should approach the question of whether a jurisdiction clause is exclusive or non-exclusive.In both of these cases reference was made to the judgment of Staughton LJ in <i>Sohio Supply Co. v Gatoil (USA) Inc</i> [1989] 1 Lloyds Reports 588 at 624E-F. At page 591, Staughton LJ said that the matter had to be approached as:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>â¦ one of the construction of this contract and nothing more.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He referred to and approved of the passage in <i>Dicey and Morris</i>, <i>The Conflict of Laws</i> referred to by Stone J in <i>T&amp;K Electrons Ltd v Tai Ping Insurance Co. Ltd supra.</i> at 174H-J:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>It is a question of interpretation, governed by the law applicable to the contract, or more accurately, the law governing the jurisdictionagreement, whether a jurisdiction clause is exclusive or non-exclusive, ie whether it requires proceedings to be brought in a particularforum, or simply confers jurisdiction on the courts of a particular country without requiring proceedings to be brought there.  Someauthorities suggest that the clause must provide in terms that the jurisdiction of the chosen court be exclusive, but it is submittedthat the question is whether on its true construction the clause obliges the parties to resort to the relevant jurisdiction, irrespectiveof whether the word âexclusiveâ is used.  It is also a question of interpretation whether the claim which is the subject matterof the action falls within its terms.  If there is no express choice of the law to govern the contract, the law of the country ofthe chosen court will usually, but not invariably, be the applicable law.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Mr Yuen submits that overwhelmingly, given all the circumstances of this case, the parties must have agreed to confer exclusivejurisdiction on the court at Denpasar. For this he puts forward three factors. Firstly, the legal relationship between the Plaintiffand the 2nd Defendant has come about as a result of this management agreement which is the basis of the action. Secondly, the subjectmatter of the dispute derives from the Plaintiffâs management of the 2nd Defendantâs villas. Mr Yuen submits that since the villais located in Bali and the Plaintiff is incorporated in Indonesia and legally domiciled in Bali and the parties have chosen Indonesianlaw to resolve their disputes and have expressly submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of Denpasar, Bali, it was quite unnecessaryto have gone further and say that the Balinese courts had exclusive jurisdiction. That exclusiveness is so obvious in all of thesecircumstances that it did not require the parties to go any further than they did in Clause 13. The agreement being one preparedby the Plaintiff and proffered by it, it would have served the Plaintiffâs interests to keep the legal jurisdiction âin houseâ,as it were, in the local court. Put another way, the Plaintiff in wishing to protect itself would not have been interested or wishedto be taken to litigation by one of its clients, who are almost exclusively expatriates, to some far-off jurisdiction. As it happenson this occasion, it is the Plaintiff that has decided to go âoff-shoreâ and sue in Hong Kong because this happens to suit itspurposes on this occasion where the 2nd Defendant resides and has property against which any judgment that the Plaintiff may obtainagainst him in this court can conveniently be enforced. That this has happened after the event is perhaps not something that it wouldhave anticipated as likely to happen. Thirdly, and I have already referred to this â Mr Yuen reinforces his point that the courtin Bali is to be seen as the court with exclusive jurisdiction because the parties have agreed that Indonesian law is to apply inresolving their dispute and it would be a court in Indonesia, at Denpasar in this case, which would be best placed to apply Indonesianlaw.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  It seems to me that Mr Yuenâs analysis is the correct one. Where everything about this dispute points to Bali, I am driven tothe conclusion that by Clause 13, the parties had agreed to confer exclusive jurisdiction on the court at Denpasar. This is a BalimesePlaintiff, performing a contract to manage a property in Bali, agreeing to nominate Indonesian law in a contract proffered by itidentifying the court in Bali as the one to whose jurisdiction the parties have agreed to submit. It seems to me inconceivable thathad they been asked about it at the time that they had entered into their agreement that they would have said: âOh yes, but wecan also litigate any dispute that may arise between us in such other courts in overseas jurisdictions that are able to accept jurisdictionin our dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Given my finding that this is an exclusive jurisdiction clause, I need to apply the approach that I have already identified as expressedin â<i>The Eleftheria</i>â and in â<i>El Amria</i>â <i>ibid</i> which is that although I continue to retain a discretion as to whether to refuse a stay in favour of the court at Denpasar, I shouldonly do so if there is âstrong causeâ for doing so.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In this regard, Mr Maurellet accepts that where the court finds that another court has exclusive jurisdiction, this court does nothave to apply the three stage examination that is required of it in <i>forum non-conveniens</i> applications, as has been set out by the House of Lord in â<i>The Spiliada</i>â  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%203%20WLR%20972" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 3 WLR 972</a> and adopted in Hong Kong by the Court of Appeal in cases such as <i>The</i> <i>Adiguna Meranti</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20HKLR%20904" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] HKLR 904.</a></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  This having been said, Mr Maurellet has referred to a number of features, which he submits would provide âstrong causeâ forrefusing a stay in the face of exclusive jurisdiction vested in a court elsewhere. These are points which clearly overlap and extendinto an analysis of the situation where the court finds that there is a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause. I need to refer to themat this stage as well.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  He really starts from the position that the main witnesses will give their evidence in English. The Agreement itself and the otherdocuments in the case such as invoices, correspondence, advertisements and the like are in English. A trial of this action in Baliwould require the added expense of translation of documents into Indonesian and interpretation of the evidence of the main witnesseson both sides. In addition to which the main witnesses would not understand their own lawyersâ submissions to the judge and <i>vice versa</i>. Mr Yuenâs response to this is that such a problem is by no means insurmountable. It is right to say that trials in Hong Kong frequentlycreate precisely these sort of problems which are very adequately resolved by translations and interpretations and so I do not considerthis feature to provide any meaningful obstacle to a trial at Denpasar. Additionally, Mr Yuen says that in terms of the convenienceof witnesses, there are about 46 local Balinese staff who left the Plaintiffâs employment and they are the subject matter of theclaim for interference of the Plaintiffâs contractual relationships. Mr Yuen does not suggest that the 2nd Defendant is going tocall all 46, but a number will be called. It is far more convenient and cheaper to have these witnesses give evidence in their localcourt and in their local language rather than to have to fly them to Hong Kong and accommodate them here. The force of that pointis obvious and similar considerations apply to the evidence of the two Indonesian law experts having to come to Hong Kong. Presumably,they would not be needed for a trial in Bali.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Mr Maurellet has also highlighted two other features of Indonesian law which he says should be taken into account. Firstly, andboth experts are agreed on this, there is no formal discovery process in Indonesia although the Defendantâs expert points out thata party is able to review its opponentâs case and ask the judge to call for the production of documents. Mr Maurellet is concernedthat in considering the Plaintiffâs damages claim, the Indonesian legal system would not be equipped procedurally to ensure thatall relevant documents are before it. Mr Yuen submits that it should not be forgotten that our adversarial common law system is verydifferent in its approach to the litigation process to that adopted by the inquisitorial civil code practised in Indonesia whichis based on Dutch law. Notwithstanding those differences, there is no evidence to suggest that the court at Bali cannot do substantialjustice to these parties in applying its own substantive law and its inquisitorial procedures.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  A further objection raised by Mr Maurellet is that Indonesian law does not provide remedies for the Plaintiffâs head of claimbased on the economic tort of interference with the Plaintiffâs contractual relations. Again whilst the Defendantâs expert recognisesthat there is no exact parallel to this in Indonesian substantive law, the courts there are able to do justice between the partiesby giving redress in a much broader, perhaps less refined, way than our courts are able to on a plea of interference with contractualrelations. Mr Yuen responds by saying that substantial justice and overall recompense would be available to the Plaintiff if it wereto succeed.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Finally, attention has been drawn to the slowness of the legal system in Indonesia but Mr Maurellet has rightly not pressed this.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Whilst there are considerable differences of approach and I suspect that the court at Denpasar is less used to substantial litigationthan our Court of First Instance, Mr Maurellet has not been able to persuade me that substantial justice could not be done there.Mr Yuen submits that in any event, the parties must be taken to have assumed all of these difficulties in procedural and substantivelaw in Indonesiaâs courts when they agreed to vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Bali and in my judgment that is a correctsubmission.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  This being my view, I hold that the parties should be required to litigate at their nominated exclusive jurisdiction applying thelaws of Indonesia. There are in this case no compelling reasons to exercise my discretion differently and so I propose to grant the2nd Defendant his stay.</p>    <p class="heading">Alternative case</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  For the sake of completeness and if it is found that I had erred in saying that Clause 13 is an exclusive jurisdiction provision,I will now investigate the matter on the basis described by Lord Goff of Chievely in â<i>The Spiliada</i>â. The single question to be answered is whether there is some other available forum having competent jurisdiction which is theappropriate forum for the trial of the action, that is, in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all partiesand for the ends of justice. In considering this question I propose to adopt the process adumbrated by Hunter JA in <i>The Adiguna Meranti supra.</i> at 907E:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>(I) Is it shown that Hong Kong is not only not the natural or appropriate forum for the trial, but that there is another availableforum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Hong Kong?  The evidential burden is here upon the applicant.  The emphasisis upon âappropriateâ rather than âconvenientâ because this is not simply a matter of practical convenience.  The purposeis to identify the forum âwith which the action has the most real and substantial connectionâ per Lord Keith in the Abidin Daver <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] AC 398.</a>  Failure by the applicant at this stage is normally fatal.</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>(II) If the answer to (I) is yes, will a trial at this action forum deprive the plaintiff of any âlegitimate personal or juridicaladvantagesâ?  The evidential burden here lies upon the plaintiff.</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>(III) If the answer to (II) is yes, a court has to balance the advantages of (I) against the disadvantages of (II), Abidin Daver perLord Brandon at p.419.  Deprivation of one or more personal or juridical advantages will not necessarily be fatal to the applicantprovided that the court is satisfied that notwithstanding such loss âsubstantial justice will be done in the available appropriateforumâ.  The court must try to be objective.  Proof of this, which can fairly be called the ultimate burden of persuasion, restsupon the applicant for the stay.  By these means he establishes that on balance the other forum is more suitable âfor the interestsof all the parties and the ends of justiceâ.  This may be another way of saying that the plaintiffâs choice of forum has beenshown to be so inappropriate as to deserve the pejorative description of âforum shoppingâ and to be restrained accordingly, cp.Lord Reid in The Atlantic Star  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20436" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] AC 436.</a></i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  It needs to be remembered that the Plaintiff is here as of right and that it is not to be removed and forced to litigate elsewherelightly. The burden therefore lies on the Defendant in seeking a stay to show that Hong Kong is not only not the natural or appropriateforum for the trial but that Denpasar is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Hong Kong. To use the words of Lord Keith in<i>The Abidin Daver</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] AC 398</a>, what need to be done is to identify the forum with which the action has the most real and substantial connection.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In this regard, Mr Yuen has drawn attention to the connecting features of this case with Bali and the lack of any real connectingfeatures with Hong Kong save for the appearance in the Hong Kong edition of the Tatler magazine of an article about this villa developmentand of course, the fact that the 2nd Defendant has a home here and spends an appreciable period of time in Hong Kong during whichhe was served with the writ. As Mr Yuen has correctly submitted, this is a Bali agreement in writing, for performance in Bali, relatingto a property in Bali, in accordance with Indonesian law and, for the purposes of this part of the judgment, a submission to thenon-exclusive jurisdiction of the court at Denpasar, Bali. The Plaintiffâs witnesses reside in Bali, although will willingly travelto Hong Kong to give evidence. The experts reside in Indonesia and will have to come here to give evidence and the Defendant wouldhave to bring to Hong Kong several of the staff at the villa complex who reside in Bali to give evidence on the issue of staff performanceand presumably, on the issue of interference with the Plaintiffâs contractual relations with them.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Resoundingly, and on any basis of looking at this matter, this case and its trial is distinctly more closely related to Bali thanit is to Hong Kong. The connection with Hong Kong is in my view entirely fortuitous by virtue of the 2nd Defendantâs residencehere. This can be further underlined by the fact that although one other Defendant has an address, a commercial unit in Chai Wan,the other two live in Bali and London respectively. As to the Defendant living in Bali, it cannot possibly be said that there isa more closely connected jurisdiction for the trial against him than in Bali and for the London-based Defendant, I presume that ifserved with the writ in London, the Plaintiff would have to contend that the trial should take place there and fly out the expertsand all the other witnesses to give evidence in the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  This all serves to demonstrate, in my judgment, that the Plaintiff is doing no more than forum shopping, it having decided thatit can do much better here in terms of enforcing any judgment that it might obtain against the 2nd Defendantâs home in DeepwaterBay.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Where the Plaintiff must be held to have failed badly at this first crucial hurdle, it seems to me that it ought to be obliged tolitigate in Bali which is where and what this case is all about. Mr Maurellet must now, at stage two, try to show that in Bali hisclient will be deprived of legitimate personal or juridical advantages. I have already considered this aspect in the earlier partof the judgment when deciding whether the Plaintiff had shown good cause for my not exercising my discretion in his favour in circumstanceswhere I had held that Clause 13 was an exclusive jurisdiction clause. It may well be that the common law adversarial system offersadvantages over a continental inquisitorial one, but it can equally be said that such a conclusion is only arrived at by lookingat the two systems subjectively through the eyes of a common lawyer. The fact is that the court in Bali is well able to deliver substantialjustice between these parties in respect of a quintessentially Bali-based dispute. And so, even if the Plaintiff is able to showthat at a trial in Bali, it will be deprived of some legitimate personal or juridical advantages which therefore require me to goto stage three and balance the advantages of my stage one conclusion against the disadvantages of two, I have to say that the courtat Denpasar will be able to deliver substantial justice to the parties.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  It is plain that these four Defendants are mobile targets for this litigation and that the Plaintiff has sought, by dint of somehighly persuasive submissions from Mr Maurellet, to bring this Defendant to trial here for a case that has no connection with thisjurisdiction. I have no doubt that had the 2nd Defendant resided for part of the year and owned a valuable home, for instance inSingapore or for that matter elsewhere in Asia with an effective and efficient legal system, he would have suffered the same fatethere. The Plaintiff must be restricted to litigating in the jurisdiction where this case belongs which is Bali. On either basisof an exclusive or a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause, the Plaintiff must fail. This in my judgment has been a more obvious caseof forum shopping. The stay therefore will now go together with an order <i>nisi</i> that the Plaintiff must pay the Defendantsâ costs to be taxed on a party and party basis.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(Ian Carlson)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Jose-Antonio Maurellet, instructed by Messrs Oldham, Li &amp; Nie for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Rimsky Yuen SC, instructed by Messrs F.
