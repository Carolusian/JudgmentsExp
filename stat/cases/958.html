It is further not disputed that shortly thereafterthe Defendant and his family commenced residing on the Lot, and continued to do so, while at the same time conducting various farmingactivities on it, without interruption until its resumption by the Government on 2 December 1991.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The history of the title to the Lot thereafter is reflected in the official records of the District Lands Office as follows. On 3May 1963, the Defendant mortgaged the Lot to the Canton Trust and Commercial Bank Limited ("the Bank") to secure a loan of $2,000from the Bank which was repayable on 2 November 1963. This transaction was duly registered at the District Lands Office in a Memorialdated 3 May 1963 which was signed by the Defendant and by two signatories on behalf of the Bank, and by the Assistant Land Officer,New Territories ("the Assistant Land Officer").</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> There is no dispute that the Defendant duly repaid that loan to the Bank, and the mortgage was redeemed on 1 April 1964, which Redemptionwas registered at the District Lands Office in a Memorial of the same date which was signed on behalf of the Bank and again by theAssistant Land Officer.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The next development as reflected in the records of the District Lands Office was that on 19 May 1964 the Defendant again mortgagedthe property to the Bank, this time to secure a loan of $5,000 from the Bank, repayable on 18 May 1965. This mortgage was apparentlyduly registered in a Memorial executed on the same date, signed by the Defendant and by two signatories on behalf of the Bank, andalso by the Assistant Land Officer.</p>    <p>(The Defendant categorically denies that he ever entered into this further mortgage in 1964, as is elaborated hereinafter.)</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The next and final development prior to the resumption of the Lot, as reflected in the records at the District Lands Office, wasthat on 8 July 1977 the Bank (in liquidation) acting by the Official Receiver as liquidator, in its capacity as mortgagee sold andassigned to the Plaintiff twelve lots in the New Territories, including the Lot in question, for the sum of $121,000. A Conveyanceon Sale was signed by the Official Receiver and on behalf of the Plaintiff, and duly registered at the District Lands Office by aMemorial of the same date, which was signed by the parties and by the Assistant Land Officer.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The Defendant, in the meantime, continued to live with his family on the Lot, blissfully unaware, he says, that it had been soldover his head to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On 2 September 1991, the Resumption of the Lot was duly Gazetted; on 30 September 1991, the Buildings and Lands Department, DistrictLands Office, Yuen Long wrote to the Plaintiff to inform it that since it was the registered owner of the Lot according to the recordskept at the District Land Registry, it was entitled to claim compensation upon the resumption of the Lot, and offering to pay thesum of $517,492.80 by way of such compensation. The Plaintiff duly accepted the offer and applied to be paid the compensation inthat sum.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> On 18 December 1991, the Defendant's solicitors notified the District Lands Office that the Defendant had only recently become awareof the fact that the Lot had been resumed when Government officers had visited him for the purpose of registering the occupants ofthe property; that a subsequent land search revealed that the Plaintiff had "purportedly" become the registered owner of the Lotunder a purported exercise of a right of sale by the liquidator of the Bank in its capacity as mortgagee; that the Defendant hadnever in fact executed any further mortgage of the property after the 1963 mortgage which had been duly redeemed, and had never borrowedany further money from the Bank; that on being shown the Memorial of the 1964 mortgage the Defendant maintained that the signaturepurporting to be his was not in fact his signature, and that the Memorial thus appeared to be a forgery; and that the Defendant remainedthe true and rightful owner of the Lot and was therefore entitled to be paid the compensation upon its resumption.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> On 16 January 1992 the District Lands Office notified the Plaintiff that since there were rival claims to the compensation and anallegation of fraud in relation to the 1964 mortgage, the Registrar General was not satisfied with the Plaintiff's title, and theprocessing of the payment of compensation would have to await the resolution of these issues. After protracted correspondence betweenthe Plaintiff's solicitors and the Building and Lands Department, and conflicting indications from the latter as to how it intendedto proceed in the light of the competing claims to the compensation, the Plaintiff finally on 10 June 1994 applied for Judicial Reviewof the Government's refusal to pay it the compensation in question. That hearing was adjourned and subsequently resumed on 13 December1994, when Mayo J. (as he then was) ordered that the proceedings were to continue as if begun by Writ, which resulted in the presentproceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The Plaintiff and the Defendant each allege that they were respectively the rightful owner of the Lot at the material date, and theonus is upon each of them respectively to establish such.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> No oral evidence was led on behalf of the Plaintiff, since its case is contained in the aforesaid records of the Lands Registry,which were put in by consent.</p>    <p class="heading">The System of Land Registration in Hong Kong : Deeds Registration</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> It is important to keep in mind that the system of land registration in Hong Kong is a system of deeds registration, not title. Thepurpose of it is to facilitate the tracing of title, not to confer title in itself, as is clearly apparent from the relevant provisionsof the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128" class="autolink_findacts">Land Registration Ordinance</a>.</em> Registration does not confer title, nor is it the test of ownership, but it provides <em>prima facie</em> evidence of ownership :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It does not exclude enquiry into the underlying transaction which is the subject matter of the registration. The validity and effectivenessof such transactions depend upon the results of such enquiry independently of the fact of registration."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(See <strong>Financial and Investment Services for Asia Limited v. Baik Wha International Trading Company Limited</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20HKLR%20103" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] HKLR 103</a> at 113, <em>per</em> Hunter J.) As the learned judge indicated, if a challenge is made to the validity of any of the underlying transactions, such challengehas to be investigated and the matter ruled upon, whether the challenge alleges fraud or mistake. If fraud is revealed and proved,the deed which was registered ceases to have any effect at all. The possibility of mistake also cannot be excluded : mistakes bythe parties or their advisors in the Registry may lead to a completely mistaken registration, which will also be void <em>ab initio</em>.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The registered documents in the Lands Registry in the present case constituted clear <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the Plaintiff was the registered owner of the Lot at the material time. The onus is on the Defendant to displace such<em>prima facie</em> evidence of ownership.</p>    <p class="heading">The Defendant's Case</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Although the Defendant initially denied his signature upon the Memorial of the 1964 mortgage, and persisted in such denial in theJudicial Review proceedings, subsequently by a Notice of Admission dated 14 June 1996 he admitted the authenticity of his signaturein the Mortgage dated 19 May 1964 and the Memorial thereof. (That admission as to the authenticity of his signature in the 1964 Mortgageis not consistent with the Answers to Interrogatories which he gave on 2 December 1966, which answers accurately stated his caseas it was presented in these proceedings :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"25. Not having seen the 1964 Mortgage, I cannot tell if my signature did appear thereon.</p>        <p class="quote">26. I do not know what signature appear on the 1964 Mortgage but I am positive that even if I did sign on the 1964 Mortgage and/orsigned on the 1964 Memorial, I did not know or understand that they or any of them was/were relating to the mortgage or other disposalof Lot No.4170A in D.D.116 by me, whether by way of security or otherwise.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">27. I believe that (1) I signed the 1964 Memorial; and (2) if I did sign the 1964 Mortgage (which is not admitted), I did so afterhaving been misled into thinking that they were part of the formalities for my transactions with the Bank relating to redemptionof the 1963 Mortgage but definitely not relating to any specific borrowing from or security to be furnished by me to the Bank afterredemption of the 1963 Mortgage.")</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The Defendant gave evidence. It transpires that he suffered a stroke about ten years ago which has clearly affected his faculties: he walks with some difficulty, his speech and most importantly his memory have clearly been affected. For example, he denied thathe had ever applied for legal aid in connection with these proceedings, stoutly maintaining that he could well afford to pay forhimself and did not need any assistance, whereas it was common ground that he had in fact applied for and been granted legal aidon 10 June 1992.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> He was, however, able to give intelligible evidence. By consent, I ordered that his witness statements should stand as his evidence-in-chief;he confirmed that what he had told his solicitors resulting in such statements was true. He stated that he had received the Lot asa gift from his father-in-law in 1962, and that he and his wife had shortly thereafter moved onto the Lot and lived on it continuouslyuntil its resumption by the Government, for a large part of that time together with their four children (who were all brought upthere) and three grandchildren. He built a two-storey house on it , and also pig sties and chicken sheds which were scattered allover the Lot.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> His evidence and that of his son in this respect was not challenged, and I have no hesitation in accepting it as true. Indeed, heproduced many documents which substantiated his evidence, including receipts from utility companies in relation to the supply ofservices to the Lot and addressed to him there; receipts for the payment by him of Crown Rent in respect of the Lot in December 1969and October 1970; and receipts for the payment by him of Modification of Tenancy Permit Fees to the Government throughout the period1972 to April 1991. I note that in terms of the Crown Lease the Defendant was given permission to erect agricultural structures only,which were not permitted to be used for human habitation.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> He confirmed that in 1963 he had borrowed $2,000 from the Bank in order to start up a restaurant, that he had mortgaged his propertyto the Bank to secure such loan, and in furtherance of the mortgage had handed to the Bank the Deed of Assignment in terms of whichhis father-in-law had assigned the Lot to him in 1962. When he repaid the loan, the Bank gave him a receipt and returned to him suchDeed of Assignment. He said that as he was ignorant of the necessary procedures, he did not ask the Bank to execute any documentto discharge the mortgage. (It will be recalled that the records reflect that a Memorial of the Redemption of such mortgage, executedby the Bank, was duly registered on 1 April 1964.)</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> He categorically denied that following the redemption of the 1963 mortgage he had ever borrowed any further money from the Bank,or executed any further mortgage of his Lot in its favour. He said that at the request of the Bank he had, at the time of the negotiationsconcerning the 1963 loan and mortgage, signed several documents at the Bank, and that he believed that his signature on the Memorialof the 1964 mortgage must have been unlawfully obtained by a dishonest member of staff of the Bank, which person must also have dishonestlymisappropriated the HK$5,000 which had purportedly been loaned by the Bank to the Defendant in terms of such 1964 mortgage deed.He had never received any notice from the Bank demanding repayment of the alleged loan of $5,000, nor any notice indicating the Bank'sintention to sell the Lot in order to realize its security as mortgagee under the purported 1964 mortgage transaction.</p>    <p class="heading">The Defendant's Signature on the 1964 Mortgage Memorial</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The general rule is that a person is estopped by his signature on a deed from denying his consent to be bound by the provisions containedin that deed. In exceptional circumstances, however, a plea of <em>non est factum</em> is available to the signatory on the basis that his mind did not accompany his signature, thus rendering his consent to the provisionsin the deed a nullity. Such plea can only rarely be established by a person of full capacity; he must show that in signing the documenthe acted with reasonable care, and he must establish that there is a fundamental difference between what he actually signed and whathe thought he was signing.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Mr Chong, who appears for the Defendant, has identified a number of features which support the Defendant's denial that he ever enteredinto the 1964 mortgage with the Bank :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The original Deed of Assignment which he and his father-in-law had executed in 1962 in terms of which his father-in-law assignedthe Lot to him (which Deed, it will be recalled, he had handed to the Bank to secure the 1963 mortgage, and which had been returnedto him by the Bank upon the redemption of such mortgage) remained in his possession throughout thereafter. It was indeed the Defendantwho produced such Deed as an exhibit in these proceedings.</p>        <p>If he had executed a further mortgage of the Lot in favour of the Bank in 1964 as alleged, he would have been required to hand oversuch Deed to the Bank at that time, and it would have remained with the Bank since it was common ground that he had failed to repaythe $5,000 loan which he had allegedly obtained on that occasion;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) There is no evidence to show that the Bank took any steps at all between 1964 and 1977 to assert its rights as mortgagee and assigneeof the Defendant's title in the Lot, most particularly its right, upon the Defendant's failure to repay the alleged loan, to quietlyenter into, hold and enjoy the Lot without interruption by any person. It will be recalled that the Defendant remained in undisturbedoccupation of the Lot throughout that period, and indeed right up until it was resumed in December 1991.</p>        <p>(In considering this aspect, it must be borne in mind that the Bank had gone into liquidation on 15 May 1965. The Plaintiff's solicitorswrote to the Official Receiver on 24 February 1995, inter alia requesting him to furnish them with full information and all the relevantdocuments in respect of the 1964 loan made by the Bank to the Defendant, and also the notices from the Bank demanding repayment ofthe loan and informing the Defendant of the intended exercise of the Bank's power of sale. The Official Receiver replied on 6 March1995 to the effect that the Bank had been dissolved on 8 January 1988 and was therefore no longer in existence; that all the booksand records of the Bank had been destroyed under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s283.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.283</a> of the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a></em>, so that the solicitors' request for documents could not be fulfilled; and that the Official Receiver had been released as liquidatorof the company by order of court on 3 December 1985 under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s205.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.205(3)</a> of the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a></em>);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) The signatures on the 1963 and 1964 mortgage memorials (Memorial No.150425 and Memorial No.153539) appear to be identical in formand signed in the same ink and with the same pen, which Mr Chong submitted supports the Defendant's contention that he signed bothsignatures on the same occasion when he was asked to sign several documents in connection with the 1963 mortgage;</p>        <p>(4) The address of the Defendant which is stated in the Memorial dated 19 May 1964 is the Defendant's old address at 24, Chong HongThird Street, Yuen Long - the same address which was recorded in the 1963 mortgage Memorial whereas by April 1964 he was living onthe Lot in question. Mr Chong submitted that this also supports the suggestion that the Defendant's address and all the other detailsin the disputed 1964 Memorial were simply typed in afterwards and copied from the documents already in possession of the Bank inrelation to the 1963 mortgage.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> This is not the usual case of <em>non est factum</em>, in that it is not his signature to the 1964 mortgage deed which the Defendant is trying to avoid : no such mortgage deed has beenproduced. (A director of the Plaintiff swore a statutory declaration on 10 December 1991, stating that he had made a diligent searchamong the Plaintiff's records in order to ascertain the whereabouts of such a mortgage deed, was unable to find it and verily believedthat it had been lost.) It is his signature in the Memorial of the 1964 mortgage that the Defendant attempts to explain away, suchmemorial being no more than <em>prima facie</em> evidence that such a mortgage deed had indeed been entered into by the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> By reason of the Defendant's disability, I have not found it possible to make any truly informed judgment as to his credibility;what I can say is that he conducted himself with dignity, and came across as an entirely respectable gentleman, and that there wasnothing in his demeanour which led me to suspect that he was not telling the truth.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> I have given anxious consideration to the aforesaid features relied upon by Mr Chong as supporting the Defendant's case that he didnot execute the 1964 mortgage in favour of the Bank, since they are not without some substance. Looking at the matter as a whole,however, the Defendant has not, to my mind, discharged the onus upon him of establishing on the probabilities that he did not dulyexecute the 1964 mortgage of his Lot in favour of the Bank.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The Memorial of the 1964 mortgage is in the standard form, headed :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A Memorial required to be registered in the New Territories Administration, at Hong Kong according to the provisions of the LandRegistration Ordinance(<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128">Cap.128</a>) and the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97">Cap.97</a>);"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I note that it was apparently witnessed by the same person who had witnessed the Memorial of the 1963 mortgage, since the signaturesappear to be identical; and furthermore, both Memorials were signed by the same Assistant Land Officer, New Territories, who in bothdocuments certified that it was "a correct Memorial according to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.23</a> of the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97">Cap.97</a>)</em> .....".</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> [I should add that it is not entirely clear to me what certification "as a correct Memorial according to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.23</a> of the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories Ordinance</a></em> ....." means, since <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.23</a> does not make provision for certification of any kind : the gist of what it provides is that "a conveyance of any land subject tothe provisions of this Ordinance may be made in one of the forms set out in the Schedule subject to such variations as circumstancesmay require ....."; and goes on to provide that the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a> of the <em>Ordinance</em> which relate to conveyances shall apply only to conveyances as are made in one of the forms set out in the Schedule or in such otherform as may be prescribed by the Land Officer; further that a conveyance need not necessarily be made in one of the forms set outin the Schedule; and that no conveyance shall be invalid by reason solely that it was not made in one of the forms specified in theSchedule.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Section 19 of the <em>Ordinance</em>, on the other hand, does provide for certification of Memorials, and I note that the final document produced by the District LandOffice in these proceedings, namely the memorial of the 1977 Conveyance on Sale (of the Lot to the Plaintiff) was "certified as acorrect memorial according to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19</a> of the<em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories Ordinance</a></em> ...."</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Counsel for both parties submitted that certification of the Memorial "according to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.23</a> of the <em>Ordinance</em>" meant that the mortgage had been executed in terms of Statutory Form B, as provided for by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.25</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">30</a> of the <em>Ordinance</em>.]</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> In any event, in all the circumstances the Defendant's signature on the Memorial of the 1964 mortgage which was drawn up in due form,duly witnessed and signed by the Assistant Land Officer, New Territories, constitutes cogent evidence that he did execute such mortgagein favour of the Bank in a mortgage deed executed in due form, the particulars of which are set out in the Memorial.

Since it is not disputed that the Defendant and his family remained in continuous possession of the Lot between 18 May 1965 and2 December 1991, and since the 20 year period laid down by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a> of the <em>Ordinance</em> expired at midnight on 17 May 1985, the Plaintiff was precluded by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7(2)</a> of the <em>Ordinance</em> from bringing any action to recover the Lot after 18 May 1985 upon which date, in terms of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17</a> of the <em>Ordinance</em>, the Plaintiff's title to the Lot was extinguished and the Defendant had in effect acquired a possessory or squatters title to theLot. The intervening sale of the Lot by the Bank to the Plaintiff in 1977 did not affect the running of time under the <em>Ordinance</em> since it is common ground that notwithstanding the sale, neither the Bank nor the Plaintiff entered into possession of the Lot orinterrupted the Defendant's continued occupation of it.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Mr Pirie submitted that up until the sale of the Lot to the Plaintiff in 1977 the Defendant had both title and possession of it,and his possession could not therefore, as a matter of law, be "adverse" possession for the purposes of the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a></em>, since possession cannot be adverse if it is referable to lawful title. On this basis, putting the Defendant's case at its highest,time could only have started to run at the earliest with effect from 8 July 1977, when the Lot was sold to the Plaintiff, with theresult that in terms of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a> of the <em>Ordinance</em>, the Plaintiff had until 7 July 1997 to bring any action to recover the Lot, and its title had not therefore been extinguished atthe material date (when the Lot was resumed on 2 December 1991) and it was not out of time in lodging the present proceedings on10 June 1994.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> He submitted that on the facts the Defendant's case cannot be put even that high, since even after the sale of the Lot to the Plaintiffin 1977 the Defendant continued to occupy the property until the resumption of it on 2 December 1991 in the continuing belief thathe was the owner of it - it will be recalled that he maintained that he was completely unaware that the Lot had been sold to thePlaintiff, and he remained all along in possession of the original Deed of Assignment in terms of which the property had been assignedto him in 1962. In these circumstances, it was argued, he lacked the necessary mental intention to constitute adverse possession,which necessarily requires an intention to dispossess the true owner. Time has therefore never started to run for the purposes ofthe <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>.</em></p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Mr Chong submitted that it was not necessary for the Defendant to know that he was in wrongful occupation of another's land, andthe fact that he mistakenly believed that he was in occupation of his own land when in fact it belonged to another did not detractfrom his adverse possession of the land : the only <em>animus</em> required of him for the purposes of the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a></em> was the <em>animus possidendi</em>, which he clearly had at all material times.</p>    <p class="heading">The Legal Bases of the Defendant's Occupation</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Prior to the 1964 mortgage of the Lot the Defendant occupied it as owner, having obtained the assignment of it by way of a gift inDecember 1962. In terms of the 1964 mortgage in Form B of the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97">Cap.97</a></em>, he assigned the Lot to the Bank "for the residue of the term of years created by the Crown lease thereof ... for securing paymenton 18 of May 1965.....". The Defendant thus conditionally assigned to the Bank the whole of his legal interest in the Lot, retainingonly his equity of redemption. In terms of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.25(1)(c)</a> of the <em>Ordinance</em> the Defendant as mortgagor covenanted "that the property conveyed may after default of payment of the monies intended to be securedby the mortgage be quietly entered into, held and enjoyed by the mortgagee without any interruption by any person". Subsequent tothe mortgage agreement, pending any such "default in payment of the monies intended to be secured by the mortgage", the Defendantremained in occupation of the Lot, notwithstanding his assignment to the Bank of his legal interest in it.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> It will be recalled that the factual basis on which the Limitation point arises for consideration necessarily includes the premisethat the Defendant was in default of his obligation to repay the loan on 18 May 1965, since it was only in those circumstances thatthe Bank (in liquidation) had the right as mortgagee to sell the property to the Plaintiff in July 1977. It follows that with effectfrom 19 May 1965 the Bank had the right to quietly enter into, hold and enjoy the property without interruption by any person, onaccount of the Defendant's breach of the condition for repayment : in other words, a right of action accrued to the Bank on thatday to recover the Lot, in terms of the mortgage agreement and, importantly, for the purposes of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.11</a> of the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a></em>.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> The Bank never exercised such right and the Defendant remained in occupation of the Lot without interruption until the Bank as mortgageesold it to the Plaintiff on 8 July 1977. Even then the Bank did not enter into possession of it : the Defendant remained in undisturbedpossession, unaware that such sale had taken place.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Mr Chong submitted that with effect from 19 May 1965 the Defendant's continued occupation of the Lot in the face of the Bank's rightto quietly enter into possession of it and hold it without any interruption thenceforth, constituted adverse possession for the purposesof <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13</a> of the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>.</em> Mr Pirie on the other hand submitted that the Defendant's continued occupation of the Lot after 19 May 1965 was by virtue of an impliedlicence granted to him by the Bank, and did not therefore constitute adverse possession for the purposes of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13</a> of the <em>Ordinance</em>, since possession under licence cannot in law amount to adverse possession.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> It is trite law that possession under a license cannot constitute adverse possession. The learned authors Clerk and Lindsell on Torts,17th Edition, paragragphs 17-74, page 878 state as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Time cannot run ...in favour of a licensee, and therefore he has no adverse possession. Nevertheless certain recent decisions hadadopted, in cases where the owner had retained title with a view to some future utilisation for a specific purpose, a quite generaldoctrine of implied licence from the owner to the squatter without any specific factual basis for such an implication.... But thisapproach is difficult to reconcile with the very purpose of the Limitation Act, for as Sir John Pennycuick said in <em>Treloar v. Nute</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%201%20WLR%201295" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 1 WLR 1295</a> at 1300, 'if a squatter takes possession of land belonging to another and remains in possession for 12 years to the exclusion ofthe owner, that represents adverse possession and accordingly at the end of the 12 years the title of the owner is extinguished.That is the plain meaning of the statutory provisions....' "</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Whether or not a licence was given is a pure question of fact. The mere failure by the Bank to exercise its right to enter into possessionof the property did not per se constitute an implied licence to the Defendant to continue occupying it. On the facts of the presentcase, bearing in mind particularly that the Defendant's occupation was quite inconsistent with the Bank's present or future enjoymentof the land, there is no basis for finding that the Bank, either expressly or impliedly, granted a licence to the Defendant to continueoccupying the property.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> The question whether an occupier's occupation of the land constituted adverse possession for the purposes of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> is one to be determined on the peculiar facts of each individual case.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> Mr Pirie cited various authorities in support of his submissions, including most particularly <strong>Hyde v. Pearce</strong> [1982]1 AER 1029, Court of Appeal. In that case the occupier went into occupation of the property following his purchase of it undera contract of purchase and sale which, in the event, was never completed; the Court held that he was to be regarded as a licenseeof the vendor. This case does not assist the Plaintiff in my view since the basis upon which the Court found against the occupierthat his possession after his license to occupy had been terminated was not adverse for the purposes of the <em>Ordinance</em>, was a factually complex one which has no parallel in the present case. (See in particular the judgment of Templeman, L.J. at 1036J-1038J).</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> In <strong>Wallis's Holiday Camp v. Shell-Mex and B.P. Ltd.</strong> (Court of Appeal) [1975]1 QB 94 the Court held that the plaintiff occupier's acts of possession constituted but a trivial trespassupon the defendants' land to which the defendants would have readily agreed, had they been asked, and that this did not amount toadverse possession against the defendants. The plaintiff's acts were not inconsistent with the enjoyment of the land by the defendants(at 116G - 117). This is in stark contrast with the facts of the present case, where the Defendant's occupation and use of the landwas extensive if not complete, and at all times inconsistent with the enjoyment of the land by the Bank and latterly the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> In <strong>Ho Hang-wan v. Ma Ting-cheung, personal representative of Ma Sz-tsang, deceased</strong> [1990]1 HKLR 649, the occupier of the land had entered into possession as a licensee, which licence had subsequently terminated uponthe death of the licensor, whereafter the occupier remained in possession for a period in excess of 20 years, and the question waswhether her possession thereafter was "adverse" for the purposes of the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a></em>. It was argued on behalf of the Defendant, who claimed to be the true owner of the land, that since the occupier was unaware of thedeath of the licensor she would notionally have had to concede, if challenged, the right of the licensor to terminate the licenceand demand possession at some future date and that such state of mind, whether actual or as on the facts of that case attributed,did not reflect the necessary <em>animus</em> to constitute adverse possession, which necessitates an <em>animus</em> to dispossess the licensor (at page 652G). The Court of Appeal rejected that argument, holding that it did not reflect the true significanceof <em>animus possidendi</em>, and that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(1) the test of intention is objective ...;</p>        <p class="quote">(2) "what is required ... is not an intention to own or even an intention to acquire ownership, but an intention to possess" (<em>per</em> Hoffman, J. in <em>Buckinghamshire County Council v. Moran</em> (1988)86 LGR 473 and [1989]3 WLR 152, Court of Appeal, approved by Slade, L.J. at p.168);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3) the intent need not be hostile or aimed at the owner ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The <em>animus possidendi</em> "is necessarily established by unequivocal evidence of exclusive physical possession" (at 654D). On the facts of that case the plaintiffoccupier had covered the site with structures and used it as a store and a residence, and "could not more plainly have demonstratedexclusive physical possession to the world" (at 652F).</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> On the facts of the present case there is no doubt that the Defendant had taken exclusive physical possession of the Lot : he builta two-storey residence upon it large enough to accommodate his wife and four children and, at times, various grandchildren; and hehad in addition erected pig sties and chicken sheds which were scattered all over the Lot. He also "could not more plainly have demonstratedexclusive physical possession to the world", which effectively and unequivocally dispossessed the Bank and subsequently the Plaintiff,as well as all other persons.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> In my view the Defendant was in adverse possession of the Lot with effect from 19 May 1965, on which day a right of action to recoverit accrued to the Bank for the purposes of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.11</a> of the <em>Ordinance</em>. From that day onwards the Defendant had no enforceable right to occupy the Lot. Time therefore started to run in terms of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7(2)</a> of the <em>Ordinance</em> with effect from 19 May 1965, at that stage as against the Bank until it sold the Lot to the Plaintiff on 7 July 1977; and sincethe Defendant remained continuously in adverse possession of it thereafter until the Government resumed it on 2 December 1991, timecontinued to run under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7(2)</a> of the <em>Ordinance</em> until the date of resumption. The sale of the Lot to the Plaintiff did not affect the running of time since it is clear that neitherthe Bank nor the Plaintiff at any time entered into possession of the Lot or interrupted the Defendant's continued adverse possessionof it.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> In these circumstances, in terms of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17</a> of the <em>Ordinance</em>, the Plaintiff's title to the Lot was extinguished as at 18 May 1985, since 20 years had by then expired since the date upon whichthe right of action to recover the land had accrued to the Plaintiff's predecessor-in-title, the Bank. The Defendant had, in otherwords, acquired a possessory title to the Lot with effect from 18 May 1965.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> It follows that the Defendant was the owner of the Lot when it was resumed by the Government on 2 December 1991, and is thereforeentitled to the compensation payable by the Government consequent upon such resumption. He is accordingly entitled to the declarationswhich he seeks, which I grant in the following terms :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1) the Defendant had acquired a good possessory title to Lot 4170A in D.D.116 Yuen Long, New Territories prior to and at the timeof its resumption by the Government under the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/370" class="autolink_findacts">Roads (Works, Use and Compensation) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/370">Cap.370</a></em>, on 2 December 1991;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2) the Defendant is entitled to the compensation payable by the Government consequent upon such resumption.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> The Plaintiff's claims are dismissed, and I make an order <em>nisi</em> that the Plaintiff is to pay the Defendant's costs of these proceedings.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="30%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="70%">(Bernard Whaley)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="30%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="70%">Deputy Judge of the Court of First Instance, High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Nicholas Pirie, inst'd by M/s John Ip &amp; Co., for Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr K.M.
