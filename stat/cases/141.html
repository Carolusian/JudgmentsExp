This consolidated actionarose from a series of loans which were made to the First and Second Defendants, for the most part, commencing in 1984 or thereafter.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Order 14, summary judgment, proceedings were taken at the commencement of the actions and the Master gave leave to defend in fourof the actions and subsequently, on appeal, Rhind J. gave leave to defend in the fifth action as well. In view of the Judgment ofRhind J. of the 13th August, 1986 it is unnecessary for me to do more than to refer to his Judgment and I will not repeat the factsset out therein. At the conclusion of the hearing Rhind J's Order included the provision that the Plaintiff had leave to furtheramend the Statement of Claim within 3 weeks. This was in its terms a general order to amend but as Mr. Mills-Owens, who appearedfor the Plaintiffs, frankly agreed with Mr. Bernacchi, who appeared for the Defendants, it was not in the contemplation of any ofthe parties that the amendment would be other than to incorporate into the Statement of Claim the facts relating to the action inrespect of which Rhind J. had allowed the appeal from the Master. It was common ground between the parties before me that it wascertainly not in the contemplation of the parties at that stage that an amendment to plead fraudulent conspiracy would be made. Indeedit would be surprising if such an amendment had been contemplated, in view of the provisions of Order 14 rule 1, which excludes fromorder 14 applications claims based upon an allegation of fraud.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> After Rhind J.'s Order it appears that investigations were carried out by the Commercial Crimes Bureau in respect of the matterswhich give rise to this consolidated action and on the 12th September, 1986 a raid was carried out. It is self evident that criminalinvestigations must have been carried out thereafter because in December of that year the Second Defendant was charged with conspiracy,in March of this year he was tried and convicted and in October the conviction was quashed on appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Given that state of affairs the Plaintiff, in 1986, deemed it appropriate not to proceed with the action. As set out in paragraph5 of the Affirmation of Winnie Lun:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p> </p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"After having consulted their legal advisers, the Plaintiffs chose to wait for the outcome of the prosecution against the 2nd Defendantbefore deciding on the further conduct of the proceedings".</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The Plaintiffs' position was further expanded in the course of argument by Mr. Mills-Owens and I accept that for a number of reasons,which are valid, the Plaintiff chose not to take any further steps in this action until after the criminal trial had taken place.Whilst I have no doubt that the decision was a perfectly proper decision it was nevertheless one taken without a formal stay of theproceedings and the inevitable consequence of it was that the leave to amend the Statement off Claim was, in the circumstances, deliberatelyallowed to lapse.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> After the conclusion of the trial in the criminal proceedings, the Plaintiffs sought to amend the Statement of Claim by includingan allegation of fraudulent conspiracy. Initially the Plaintiffs sought to plead the criminal conviction but now, naturally, thathas had to be removed from the proposed draft.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Before the Master, the Plaintiffs sought to effect the amendment by obtaining an extension of time of the 3 week period granted bythe order of Rhind J. in August, 1986.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In my view the Master correctly refused such an extension of time. In the first place, as I have indicated, the Plaintiffs deliberatelyallowed the order of Rhind J. to lapse. Whereas that action is acceptable, it was nevertheless not an instance of the Plaintiffsattempting to comply with the order and being unable to do so nor was it a case of inadvertence but it was a case of a deliberatedecision. Furthermore, in my view the proceedings had reached a fundamentally new stage in March and April of this year when thePlaintiffs began to revive them and it was then right and proper for the Court to review the whole case including the state of thepleadings and it would not be right simply to revive an order which had been deliberately allowed to lapse.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Mr. Bernacchi raised strong objection to the extension of time on the grounds of delay. Whilst I consider that much of the delaywas as a result of the decision to allow the action to lie fallow, there have been periods of delay beyond what was necessary andthe overall delay in any event was substantial. Nevertheless I base my decision in the first place upon the fact that the Plaintiffspurposely chose not to take the benefit of their original order and the delay can be seen as a background to that.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> In the second place, and separately, it seems to me wrong in principle to extend a period of time for making an amendment which isundoubtedly fundamentally different from the amendment which was contemplated by the parties, and therefore one must assume contemplatedby the Court at the time when leave to amend was given. It is unusual for the Court to give unqualified leave to amend and it wouldbe even more remarkable if the unqualified leave to amend were supposed to be to add a claim for fraudulent conspiracy in a pleadingwhich hitherto contained no hint of fraud. What the Court should do now is to consider whether the new amendments are proper andnot to extend time for doing something which was, in reality, only a small part of what the Plaintiffs now wish to do.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Mr. Bernacchi launched a strong argument that the proper construction of Rhind J's order was that the amendment was simply consequentialupon the consolidation of the actions and the leave to defend given to the Defendants in respect of the fifth of the original actions.Whereas I see difficulty in implying limitations into what are otherwise broad terms of the order I consider it is quite a separatematter for a party to come to Court to seek the Court's discretion to extend time for taking some step under an order when that partyis now intending to do something under the extended order which it was clearly not contemplated would be done under the originalorder. I therefore have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that it would be a wrong exercise of the Court's discretion toextend time in these circumstances.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Mr. Mills-Owens in arguing that the Court's discretion to extend time should be exercised says that the power is liberally exercisedexcept in case where the parties cannot be compensated by an award of costs. He further goes on to say that what the Plaintiffs wereseeking to do was quite clear and whether they achieved the amendment by applying for a new amendment or by extending time underthe previous order did not matter since the principles were the same, the Defendants could he protected in the same way by ordersof costs and the result achieved would be the same. In my view this argument is wrong because it ignores the fact that the discretionto extend time is a different discretion from the discretion to allow an amendment. It may wel1 be that the result in the end islittle different but it seems to me that the judicial approach to the discretion must, if strictly exercised, be different and onlyif the Court were to blur the edges of the distinction and in effect to exercise its discretion to allow an amendment whereas inpractice actually exercising a discretion to extend time could the result be achieved. Moreover, if a Court is to permit an amendment,which if it had been incorporated in the original pleadings might have prevented a particular course of action, such as the takingof Order 14 proceedings, then it may be appropriate for the Court to require certain undertakings from the Plaintiffs for examplenot enforcing any orders as to costs in respect of the failed Order 14 proceedings if ultimately successful at trial.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The order of the Master of the 15th August, 1988 only recited the application made in respect of the extension of time and the refusalof that extension. The Notice of Appeal also seeks to appeal the Master's refusal to allow an amendment under Order 20 rule 5. AsI understood it, oral application to make such amendment was made but the Master refused to hear it saying that a separate applicationshould be launched in the proper manner it way purely an informal application and no order has been drawn upon in respect of it.Although, as I have been reminded, an appeal to the Judge in Chambers is a matter of rehearing this matter is far more a matter ofthe Master's control of the proceedings before him. I would be far more reluctant to hold that a Master had been wrong in such amatter of procedure and particularly proper control of proceedings before him than in a matter of substance. However in this respectagain I consider that the Master was clearly right. He in effect said that the application should be properly launched and properlymade and should come back on another occasion. In view of the fact that the Master would, even if he had allowed the applicationto proceed, have most likely ordered an adjournment so that the matter could be argued and evidence if necessary considered and filed,I consider that the Master acted quite correctly in refusing the informal application and requiring the application to be made inthe ordinary way.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> I turn then to the question of whether the Re-Amendments are allowable. The Re-Amendments now sought fall into two main categories.There are first of all some minor Amendments to the body of the Amended Statement of Claim to which no objection is take. The Re-Amendments in paragraphs 2, 6 and 19 of the Draft are therefore allowed. The Re-Amendments in paragraphs 26A-D are not objectedto either and in the circumstances these are allowed. The Re-Amendments which cause difficulty however, are those from paragraph28 onwards and the consequential amendments in the prayer for relief.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The Re-Amendments in paragraphs 28 to 31 of the Draft Re-Amended Statement of Claim are typical of the Re-Amendments sought in thatthe Re-Amendments fall into groups which correspond to the loans and claims pleaded earlier in the Statement of Claim. I will thereforeconfine my observations to paragraphs 28 to 31, but what is said would apply to the corresponding subsequent paragraphs in the pleading;indeed this is the manner the matter was argued before me by both parties.</p>    <blockquote>        <p> </p>        <p>        Paragraphs 28 of the Draft Re-Amendment pleads that:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">"On or about 6th February, 1984, the Second Defendant and one Albert Kwok who was the Chief Manager, Deputy Chairman and a directorof the First Plaintiff and a director of the Second Plaintiff at the material time and now deceased unlawfully and fraudulently conspiredto defraud, inter alios the First Plaintiff by dishonestly causing and/or permitting the First Plaintiff to extend an existing overdraftfacility in respect of the said account (number stated) afforded to the Second Defendant by $3,000,000. 00 such extension being inadequatelysecured, inadequately guaranteed, without proper provision for payment of interest and the true nature and purpose of the same beingconcealed from the First Plaintiff".</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Paragraph 29 of the Draft Re-Amendment pleads various overt acts these included:-</p>    <table cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align:right" class="quote">"(i)</td>            <td width="85%" valign="top" align="left" class="quote">                The Second Defendant and Albert Kwok caused the agreement dated the 6th February, 1984 referred to in paragraph 5above to come into existence to give the false impression that the true borrower was the Second Defendant himself and that he wastaking upon himself the responsibilities of repaying the loan.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align:right" class="quote">(ii)</td>            <td width="85%" valign="top" align="left" class="quote">That Albert Kwok caused the First Plaintiff to advance the sum of $3,000,000. 00 to the Second Defendant under his said account No,308-003-004992on 6th February, 1984.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align:right" class="quote">(iii)</td>            <td width="85%" valign="top" align="left" class="quote">The Second Defendant immediately on the same day issued a cheque drawn on the said account in the sum of $3,000,000. 00 in favourof Manifest Underwriters.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align:right" class="quote">(iv)</td>            <td width="85%" valign="top" align="left" class="quote">The said sum of $3,000,000. 00 in the account of Manifest Underwriters with the 1st Plaintiff was then utilised by Manifest Underwritersand/or Alben Kwok.

In the second place he allegesthat the amendments alleging fraudulent conspiracy should not be allowed because none of them disclose a cause of action, in particularhe relies upon the following 3 grounds:-</p>    <p>        (a)     the Plaintiffs have not pleaded that the Second Defendant's intention was to injure the Plaintiffs, thus it showsno cause of action in conspiracy;</p>    <p>        (b)     the Plaintiffs have in fact pleaded that the purpose of the alleged conspiracy was to make funds available to ManifestUnderwriters (and in the corresponding subsequent paragraphs of the pleading other entities); and</p>    <p>        (c)     that the pleading in paragraph 31 by placing reliance on the Affirmation of the Second Defendant as admission of theconspiracy pleaded confounded the issue because that Affirmation shows that the Second Defendant's intention was not to injure thePlaintiffs but indeed to assist them and the Wing On Group of Companies in general.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Dealing with the matter of delay first, it seems to me that there should be no objection on the grounds of delay and that if anyamendment whether it be pleaded as fraud, conspiracy or any other cause of action is a valid amendment then it should be allowedto go forward; in fact delay was only lightly argued on this aspect of the case.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> It was agreed by both Counsel that the basis upon which I should approach the issue as to whether the draft Amendment disclosed acause of action was same as that which applies in applications to strike out pleadings. In summary, the approach which I take isthat the pleading will only be struck out if the case is plain and obvious. Before embarking upon an analysis of the arguments Ishould mention that my attention was directed to the well known case of<em>Philipps v, Philipps</em> 4 O. B. D 139 and the well known passage therein particularly of Bramwell and Brett L. JJ. and also to the case of <em>Bruce v. Odhams Press Limited</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1936%201%20KB%20697" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1936 1 KB 697</a> and in particular to the passage Judgment of Scott L. J. where he expands upon the meaning of the word <em>material</em> in the context in which it is used in the rules relating to pleadings as being necessary for the purpose of formulating a completecause of action and draws the distinction between <em>material</em> facts which must be pleaded and matters which are proper subject matter for particulars. I would add that the observations of LordEdmund-Davies in <em>Farrell v. Secretary of State for Defence</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1980%201%20W%20L%20R%20172" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1980 1 W. L. R. 172</a> @180 to the effect that it is bad law and bad practice to shrug off a criticism as a mere pleading point apply, in my view, particularlypoignantly to pleadings alleging fraud and conspiracy where clearly the Defendant is entitled to be told in clear and specific termsprecisely what allegations are being made against him. Indeed, it is in this context, that I regard the caution which the Courtsused to approach amendments alleging fraud still has force, namely the Courts will not overlook <em>material</em> deficiencies in a pleaded case.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Mr. Bernacchi on behalf of the Defendant raises objection to the pleading as formulated on the footing set out above and bases hissubmission on the proposition that the tort of civil conspiracy is only maintainable when the Defendant's sole or primary intentionis to injure the Plaintiff, That proposition derives for its support passages in the decision in <em>Lonrhe Limited v. Shell Petroleum Co Ltd.</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1982%20AC%20173" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1982 AC 173.</a> The speech of Lord Diplock was adopted by the whole House and therefore commands even greater respect. In that case, having heldthere was no action in tort or beach of contract, Lord Diplock went on to consider the question as to whether an intent by the Defendantto injure the Plaintiff is an essential element in the civil tort of conspiracy, even where the acts agreed to be done by the conspiratorsamounted to a criminal offence under a penal statute. Lord Diplock held that the highly anomalous cause of action of civil conspiracycould not be constituted in such circumstances. It is important however that at page 189D Lord Diplock said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"My lords, in none of the judgments in decided cases in civil actions for damages for conspiracy does it appear that the mind of theauthor of the damage-causing acts although neither done with the purposes of injuring the plaintiff <em>nor actionable at his suit if they had been done by one person alone</em>, were nevertheless a contravention of some penal law. " (My emphasis added)</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> From that statement I derive the clear implication that if the damage causing acts were actionable if committed by one person alonethen the civil tort of conspiracy can be constituted if two or more persons agree to embark upon a course of action to act in furtheranceof that conspiracy and the acts cause damage to the Plaintiff. This was the conclusion reached by Gatehouse J. in <em>Metall and Rohstoff v. Donaldson Lufkin</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1988%203%20WLR%20548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1988 3 W.L.R. 548</a> @556-7 Gatehouse J. derived assistance from a number of cases, the significance of one of which, <em>Hadmor Production Limited v. Hamilton</em> 1983 A. C.191, 228-9 seems to be not beyond doubt, the case of <em>Lintas N. Z. v. Murphy</em> 1986 and N.Z.Co. Reports 31 has not been located despite the efforts of Counsel and the Court and the case of <em>Canada Cement La Farge Limited v. B. C Lightweight Aggregate Limited</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1983%20145%20DLR%20%283d%29%20385" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1983 145 D.L.R. (3d) 385</a> is an authority upon which I would hesitate to place reliance in view the fact that it was a decision of the Supreme Court of Canadawhich set out on the basis that the Court was not disposed to follow the <em>Lohnro</em> decision. In coming to his conclusion Gatehouse J. felt constrained to disagree with the Judgment of Hirst J. in <em>Allied Arab Bank Limited v. Hajjar</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1988%203%20WLR%20533" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1988 3 W.L.R. 533.</a> Hirst J. came to the clear conclusion that the tort of conspiracy applied exclusively to cases where the predominant purpose, ofthe Defendants' agreement was to injure the Plaintiff's interests see page 545 D. There is, however, considerable force in what HirstJ. states in the remainder of that paragraph on page 545, since if it is to be assumed that the civil tort of conspiracy is constitutedwhere there is no predominant purpose to injure the Plaintiff but where there is an agreement to commit an act or acts which areotherwise actionable in the civil law, it is, perhaps difficult to foresee what additional benefit the action in the civil tort ofconspiracy bestows upon the Plaintiff. There are, possibly, situations where the extra cause of action may be of same advantage tothe Plaintiff litigant but I need not decide that. Furthermore, even if I had not construed Lord Diplock's speech in the way I hadI consider that I would nevertheless have been constrained not to decide in a manner contrary to Gatehouse J. in view of the conflictingdecisions in the face of which the matter should be properly ventilated at trial.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> In the course of argument Mr. Mills-Owens placed strong reliance upon the overall picture which he painted of the Plaintiffs beingfinancial institutions and $20,000,000. 00 to $25,000,000.00 worth of the Plaintiffs' funds representing money deposited by the publicbeing spirited away in a scheme to which and Second Defendant was knowingly a party. He relied upon the submission that the truerule in the tort of civil conspiracy was that there should agreement which would result in an act which would be actionable if doneby one of the conspirators alone. He put forward as part of his submission that paragraph 28 did not go so far as to plead that thepredominant purpose of the Defendants was to injure the Plaintiffs and indeed he made it part of his submission that, of course,the predominant purpose upon his submission, was for the conspirators to benefit themselves or at least one of them. Mr. Mills-Owens'major attack upon the Defendants' objection was that the Defendants had failed to appreciate the distinction on the one hand betweenconspiracy to injure and on the other a conspiracy to defraud. I have already noted the fact that Mr. Mills-Owens relied upon thefact that all that need be pleaded is a conspiracy to commit an act which is actionable and in answer to a question from the CourtMr. Mills-Owens readily accepted that what was intended to be pleaded was a conspiracy to defraud.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> As I have already indicated I consider if behooves a Plaintiff in framing a pleading involving an allegation of fraud to make clearand precise allegations. In so far as the present proposed pleading relies upon the allegation of conspiracy there is no attemptto pray in aid a conspiracy to commit an actionable matter other than fraud. For an action of fraud there must be the following factors:-the Defendant must have stated as a matter of fact what is untrue, knowing such statement to be untrue (or reckless as to its truth)with intent to induce the Plaintiff to act upon it, and has thereby induced the Plaintiff to act upon it to his loss, see e.g. <em>Smith v. Chadwick</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1884%209%20AC%20187" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1884 9 App. Cas 187</a>, 200. When turning to the present proposed pleadings the false statement is alleged in paragraph 29(1) in terms of the loan agreementwhich came:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"into existence to give the false impression that the true borrower was the Second Defendant himself and that he was taking upon himselfthe responsibility of repaying the loan. "</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> I have considerable doubt as to whether this is a sufficient allegation of misrepresentation but consider that the Defendants arein a position to require sufficient particulars of the Plaintiffs that the matter could go forward.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> I have been far more troubled as to whether there is a sufficient allegation that the Plaintiff relied upon the false statement bythe Second Defendant. When I put the question to Counsel for the Plaintiffs I was told that that allegation was to be implied fromthe fact that the loan was granted. I consider that in a case where fraud is the underlying basis of the claim an allegation thatthe Plaintiff relied upon the statement is a <em>material</em> fact within the meaning of Order 18 as expounded by Scott L. J. I do not consider in pleading fraud it is right to leave such anallegation to be a matter of mere implication. It is possible that, as a matter of evidence, the fact of mispresentation having beenmade and the course pursued into which that mispresentation was calculated to mislead, is prima facie evidence that the Plaintiffwas misled by it see e.g. <em>Watson v. Charlemont</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=12%20QB%20856" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">12 Q.B. 856</a> and <em>Arnison v. Smith</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=41%20Ch%20D%20348" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">41 Ch. D. 348</a> @369 but I do not consider that the pleading may leave that all important <em>material</em> allegation to be left to an inference from the pleading. The Defendant is entitled to know the way in which the case is put againsthim for example whether there was a deliberate and positive act of reliance or whether the matter is to be inferred simply from thesurrounding circumstances; he will be entitled to particulars and to discovery in respect of the allegation and if he is to plead,particularly in the circumstances of a case such as this where clear allegations are made by the Plaintiffs that there were othercausative factors in the Plaintiffs making the loans, the pleading of the defence may, it seems to me, take different forms. I woulddraw attention paragraph 29(ii) in which it is alleged that Albert Kwok caused the First Plaintiff to advance the sum of $3,000,000.00 This, without saying more, raises a considerable inquiry as to what was the true operating factor in the Plaintiffs making theadvances the subject to this action. Moreover the statement by the Second Defendant that he considered that he was acting in thePlaintiffs' best interests, cannot be lost sight of.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> The Defendants further raised strenuous objection to paragraph 31 of the Draft Re-Amended Statement of Claim in that it alleges thatthe Plaintiffs will rely on the Affirmation of the Second Defendant of the 12th April in High Court Action No. A1120 as evidenceor evidence of admission of the conspiracy without identifying what in the Affirmation will be relied upon. This Affirmation is notinsignificant, running to over 7 pages, and it includes, the Second Defendant inter alia, at paragraph 5 of the Affirmation statingthat he was asked by Mr. Kwok to render assistance to the Wing On Group and the Plaintiff Bank in particular by applying for thesaid loans which is further explained in paragraph 6. Mr. Mills-Owens' answer to Mr. Bernacchi's objection in respect of this isthat the Plaintiff was, of course, only relying upon those matters which support the conspiracy alleged but not relying upon "self-servingstatements" by the Second Defendant. I consider that the Defendants are entitled to know precisely what in the Affirmation the Plaintiffsare pleading will be relied upon as evidence of the admission and precisely what they are not, whether those statements be categorisedas self-serving statements, matters of fact or whatever. This form of pleading is in my view imprecise and embarrassing and thereis no reason why the pleading should not spell out what will be relied upon with adequate precision.  I would note that even if thatwere done, it may as a matter of evidence be difficult to divorce one matter from the rest of the Affirmation, but again that ismatter for trial.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> In the circumstances apart from the amendments allowed which I have referred to above I feel constrained to refuse the amendmentssought making it clear that this decision is no bar to the Plaintiffs seeking to effect further amendments which cure the defectswhich I have held exist. I therefore make an order that the amendments in paragraphs 2, 6, 19 and 26A, B, C, and D in the Draft Re-AmendedStatement of Claim submitted be allowed with consequential Amendments to the prayer of Statement of Claim and an Order Nisi thatthe costs of and occasioned by the Amendments and the hearing before me be to the Defendants in any event.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">Anthony Rogers, Q.C.<br />                Deputy Judge of High Court</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Richard Mills-Owens Q.C. and Mr. Patrick Fung instructed by Messrs Oscar Lai &amp; Ho for the Plaintiffs</p>        <p>Mr Brook Bernacchi Q.C. and Mr. Robert Whitehead instructed by Messrs Chan &amp; Wan for the Defendants</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/1988/336.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
