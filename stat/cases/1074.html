First, they claim, that the occasion of publication was one of qualified privilegein that they were under a social, moral and religious duty, or any one of those duties, to publish the views of Muslim correspondentsto the Muslim community in Hong Kong whose members had a like duty and interest to receive them. In this connexion the defendantscontend that the Koran states that Muslims have a religious duty to expose munafiqin.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Secondly, they claim that some of the words in the passage complained of are allegations of fact that are true in substance and infact.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Thirdly, they claim that other parts of the passage consist of expressions of opinion that are fair comment published in good faithand without malice on matters of public interest.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In claiming that the word 'munafiq' means 'hypocrite', Mr. Chan for the plaintiff was at pains to distinguish between this meaningand that contended for by the defendants, namely, "one who simulates religious virtue".</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The Shorter Oxford English dictionary defines 'hypocrite' as "one who falsely professes to be virtuously or religiously inclined;one who pretends to be other and better than he is; hence a dissembler, pretender".</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The word "hypocrite" is not an obscure word. I am satisfied that the average person who read the article would have understood itto mean what the dictionary says it means.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> There is no dispute that the word "Ummah" means the Muslim community and that the expression "Jama'at salat" means an occasion whenMuslims gather together and pray. At such times they are normally led in their prayer by someone who is usually an Immam.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The first matter that I have to decide is whether the passage is defamatory. Both counsel agree that defamation is the publicationof a statement which reflects on a person's reputation and tends to lower him in the estimation of right thinking members of societygenerally or tends to make them shun or avoid him.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Thus an article that disparages a man in the eyes of a particular section of the community or discredits him with one special classof persons is not defamatory unless the average right thinking man in society in general would take the same view.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Mr. Barlow, for the defendants, contends that the average man would have difficulty in understanding what the passage means, particularlysince the writer employed Arabic words, such as "munafiq" and "Ummah" and sentences such as "He was so daring to claim he was sentby Allah to manage the Kowloon Mosque" and "He claimed and is claiming himself the leader of Muslims in Hong Kong so as to justifyhis status to make alliance with the pagans and infidels in the name of Islam in the so called Six Religions Alliance".</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Whilst I accept that it is probably true that few persons in society generally would understand what some of these words mean, Ihave no doubt that on reading the first paragraph of the passage complained of any average right thinking member of society in generalwould conclude that it was alleged that the plaintiff is a brazen hypocrite who, whilst affecting to be motivated by highly commendablereligious considerations, is in truth actuated by personal ambition and material greed, and that in pursuit of those selfish interestshas made and continues to make false claims as to his status in the Muslim community.  The reader would also understand the articleto allege that the plaintiff has consciously used his wealth in some unspecified manner to influence ignorant Muslims to vote himinto office as Chairman of the Muslim Association, so that he could then exert influence over various Muslim institutions and usethe power so acquired to promote his business interests.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The first sentence in the second paragraph of the passage complained of clearly alleges that the plaintiff imposes a racial policy<u>for</u> the Association. It is important to note, however, that it does not allege that he imposes a racist policy. In my judgment becauseof the use of the preposition 'for' instead of 'on', the ordinary reader would understand this to mean that the plaintiff lays downor enforces on behalf of the Association a policy of restricting its membership to persons of Chinese race.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> It is common knowledge that many associations restrict their membership to persons of particular race. Although this practice mightnot meet with universal approval, I do not think that the plaintiff's reputation would be lowered in the eyes of the average rightthinking member of society generally by the mere fact that he carried out a policy of restricting membership of the Association toChinese.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Mr. Barlow, for the defendants, submitted that it is plain from a reading of the entire article that the authors did not intend toconvey the meaning that naturally arises from the use of the words "in order to" in the last sentence of the passage complained of,but that they intended to and did convey the meaning that the effect of the plaintiff seeking to establish a firmer friendship withthe communists would be to create a threat to the Muslims in Hong Kong. In other words the authors did not intend to convey the meaningthat it was the plaintiff's intention and purpose to threaten the Muslims in Hong Kong but that his actions would have the consequenceof creating a threat to them.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Although I accept that it is probable that the authors' first language is not English and that therefore there is every possibilitythat an unintended misuse of words might give rise to an equally unintended meaning, the sentence as composed bears a perfectly sensiblemeaning and, whilst it may not immediately be apparent to the average reader how the plaintiff could realise his alleged objectiveof threatening the Muslims in Hong Kong by establishing a firmer friendship with the communists, I have no doubt that he would under-standthe sentence to bear that meaning.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Thus the allegation goes beyond asserting that the plaintiff is a hypocrite who cynically abuses his office in a religious associationto further his personal and business ambitions. He also seeks to threaten the very community of which he claims to be the leader.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Paragraph 4(k) of the statement of claim, which appears to relate specifically to this part of the article, does not state that itinvolves an assertion that the plaintiff's purpose was also to threaten the Muslims in Hong Kong. However, paragraph 4(b) pleadsthat the words in the entire passage meant and were intended to mean that "the plaintiff used his position in the Muslim communityin Hong Kong and as Chairman of the Management Committee of the Kowloon Masjid (Mosque) contrary to the interests of and so as topresent a threat to the Muslim Community in Hong Kong".</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> I am therefore of the view that the pleadings are wide enough to include the meaning that the plaintiff "prepared to sell the Association'spremises" not only for the sake of establishing a firmer friendship with the communists but also with the object of threatening theMuslims in Hong Kong.  In this connexion I should add that Mr. Barlow did not contend that the plaintiff's pleadings were insufficientlywide to cover this point.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> In my view the passage complained of is clearly defamatory in that it portrays the plaintiff as a contemptible hypocrite. It reflectson his character and tends to lower him in the estimation of right thinking members of society generally.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Only three witnesses gave testimony. They were the plaintiff and the two defendants. I propose dealing with the material aspectsof their evidence during the course of the following analysis of the defences raised by the defendants.</p>    <p class="heading">Qualified Privilege</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The class of statement in respect of which the defendants claim qualified privilege is that made in the discharge of a public dutyconcerning a matter in which they have a legitimate interest.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Plainly it is in the public interest that persons should be permitted to speak freely on occasions when it is their duty to speakand to tell all they know or believe. This public convenience outweighs considerations of injury caused to private citizens as aresult of the publication of a charge that is untrue. Public convenience prevails over private interests provided the person makingthe publication does so honestly and without malice.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> The defendants claim that they were under a social, moral and religious duty or any one of those duties to publish the views of Muslimcorrespondents, including the words complained of, to the Muslim community in Hong Kong who had a like duty and interest, or both,to receive them. They claim that it is an express teaching of the Koran to expose munafiqin.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Mr.Chan submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that there is no authority for the proposition that the duties recognised by law extendto religious duties.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The principle enunciated by Parke B in <u>Toogood v Spyring</u> (1834) 1 CM &amp; R at p. 193 is that:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In general, an action lies for the malicious publication of statements which are false in fact, and injurious to the character ofanother, and the law considers such publication as malicious, <u>unless it is fairly made by a person in the discharge of some public or private duty whether legal or moral</u>, or in the conduct of his own affairs, in matters where his own interest is concerned. If fairly warranted by any reasonable occasionor exigency, and honestly made, such communications are protected for the common convenience and welfare of society." (my emphasis).</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> No doubt many a religious duty is also a moral duty but it does not follow that it is always so. For example, the average memberof society does not regard a religious duty not to eat meat on Fridays to be a moral duty applicable to society at large. Unlesstherefore the religious duty also happens to be a generally recognised legal or moral duty it is not one which receives the protectionof the law for the purpose of qualified privilege.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> It is true that the author of the 11th edition of Winfield and Jolowicz on Tort expressed the following view at page 326:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It would seem, although the English authorities are somewhat discordant, that a clergyman who prays for, or preaches at, anotherperson for some sin which the clergyman expressly or impliedly alleges against him, has no privilege. No doubt all men are sinners,but an admission of general iniquity is one thing, an accusation of personal sin is quite another, and the proper way for a pastorto rebuke it is in private and not in the pulpit, unless indeed public admonition of sin is one of the tenets of the particular formof worship which he professes <u>and</u> the plaintiff has become a member of his congregation on that understanding." (My emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The author does not cite nor has counsel for the defendants been able to find any authority for the last proposition in this passage.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Reference was made during the course of evidence to various verses and footnotes in an English translation of the Koran, and particularreliance was placed on verses 60 to 62 in aura XXXIII at page 1127 of the translation and on footnote 3768. There reference is madeto hypocrites, whom the footnote refers to as "men who pretended to be in Islam but whose manners and morals were anti-Islamic":</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We shall certainly stir thee up against them. Then will they not be able to stay in <em>[</em>the City<em>]</em> as thy neighbours for any length of time."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The city referred to is stated in the footnote to be the Prophet's City.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> I am asked to accept that these verses operate as a general injunction to all Muslims, wherever they may be, to expose hypocrisy,and presumably, if they are followed to the letter, as a command to seize and slay all hypocrites.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> The 1st defendant claims to understand that the Koran enjoins all Muslims to expose munafiqin and that he conceives it to be a religiousduty to do so. The plaintiff testified, that he was unaware of any such duty having been imposed by the Koran. He readily agreed,however, that if he were satisfied that a person was truly a munafiqin he would first seek to persuade him to see the error of hisways and to desist from being munafiqin, and that if that person failed to do so, the plaintiff would expose him.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Although I approach the interpretation of the Koran with trepidation and circumspection, I find myself unable to extract from thepassages cited to me a religious injunction as general as that for which the defendants contend. Certainly the seizure and slayingof hypocrites does not seem to be, nor has it been proved to be, a religious command of general application. If it were, it wouldclearly be contrary to public policy and indefensible in the eyes of the law. Nor indeed has it been proved to me that the apparentcommand to drive hypocrites out of the Prophet's City is of any general application.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> What remains is a supposed inference that it is a religious duty for all Muslims to expose hypocrites. Although it is a fair inferencefrom these verses that the Koran approves of the exposing of hypocrites, I am far from satisfied that it asserts it to be a positivereligious duty to do so. Moreover, notwithstanding the opinion expressed in Winfield and Jolowicz, I am unable to accept the propositionthat a duty recognised by the law may be a religious duty as distinct from a legal, social or moral duty.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> In <u>Stuart v Bell</u> <em>[</em>1891<em>]</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20QB%20341" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 QB 341</a> and <u>Adam v Ward</u> <em>[</em>1917<em>]</em> AC 309 it was accepted that the duty may be legal, social or moral. It is equally clear from the cases that not only must there bea duty cast on the defendant to make the communication but that the person who receives it must have an interest in hearing it. Thatinterest must be one which is a matter of substance apart from its mere quality as news. It must not arise simply as a matter ofgossip or curiosity. Moreover, it does not avail a defendant that he honestly and reasonably believed that he was under a duty tomake the communication or that the person to whom he made it had an interest in the subject matter, if in fact he was not under aduty to do so or the other person did not have an interest in receiving the communication.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> It follows that where the communication is unnecessarily made to persons beyond those who have an interest the defence of qualifiedprivilege fails. Thus it is incumbent on a person who seeks to exercise the privilege to take all necessary or reasonable means toensure that the publication does not go beyond the exigency of the occasion. If he does so and the mode of publication is shown tobe reasonable in all the circumstances of the case, the defence will not fail simply because the libellous matter was also communicatedto persons not included within the privilege.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Assuming that the defendants were under a legal, social or moral duty to communicate the information in the article complained of,the question would then arise whether they were justified in publishing it in the manner in which they did.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> The defendants do not claim that the public at large had an interest in receiving the communication. Their pleading specificallyconfines the category of persons having an interest or duty to receive it as being the people of the Muslim community in Hong Kong.Indeed Mr.Barlow accepts that only in the rarest of cases would the privilege extend to publication of libellous matter in a newspaper.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> That this is so was made clear as early as the case of <u>Brown v Croome</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281817%29%202%20Stark%20301" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1817) 2 Stark 301</a> where Lord Ellenborough stated that unless it could be shown that publication in a newspaper was "the only possible means" "the onlyeffectual mode" of communicating the information the defence of qualified privilege would fail.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> As Slesser LJ said in <u>Chapman v Ellesmere</u> <em>[</em>1932<em>]</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20KB%20431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 KB 431</a> at 467:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I am unable to find in the authorities any reason to suppose that the law has protected a general publication in cases where thereis only a sectional interest and a consequential duty to inform only a part of the public.

These are strong arguments.But though the vehicle of the public Press has been held to be a proper and protected one, so as to defeat a claim for libel, whereit has been used 'as the only effective mode' to answer a charge which had already received as wide a circulation (see <u>Adam v.Ward</u> and <u>Brown v. Croome</u>), there is no authority which protects the statement in the newspaper, where it is made not in answer, but as a fresh item on whicha general interest, as distinguished from a particular interest already aroused, prevails."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>         </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="9%"></td>            <td width="91%">                At page 474 Romer LJ had this to say:                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"So far as regards the Times Publishing Company, it may in one sense be true to say that they owe a duty to their readers to publishany and every item of news that may interest them.

Such a duty has been held to exist on special facts, but there is no general 'media privilege' at commonlaw."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> There is however a distinction between a newspaper available to the public generally and one which is available only to a particularclass of persons. This was clearly stated by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in <u>Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Ltd.</u> <em>[</em>1977<em>]</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20NSWLR%20755" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 NSWLR 755</a> at 779:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It must be emphasized that it is with publication to the public at large that the present appeal is concerned. There can be put toone side publications in newspapers which are truly enlarged circulars, not available to the public generally, but only to particularclasses of persons. Different considerations apply to these publications. Thus, in <u>Wells v. Croskery</u>, allegedly defamatory material was published in a newspaper circulated to members of a trade union, and in reprinted form was publishedto other union officials and members. The plaintiff claimed that the defamatory material referred to him and would be so understood,but he was defeated by a plea of qualified privilege. In such a case, it is not necessary to consider whether the duty or interestrequired to be established related to the whole community; it is sufficient if it is shown to exist in respect of the persons towhom the publication is made. Those persons are identified, and the necessary duties or interests can be looked for with some feelingof confidence. This is not so where the newspaper is on sale to the public generally, whether the newspaper has a very limited circulationor a very wide circulation: see, e.g. <u>Standen v. South Essex Recorders Ltd</u>; <u>Cutler v. McPhail.</u>"</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> The last case cited in the above extract concerned two letters written by a ratepayer about a member of a borough council which thelatter alleged were defamatory of him in his office of councillor. One of the letters was sent to another member of the council andthe other to the editor of a local magazine which was the official organ of a voluntary association of residents in the area andwas on sale to the public at bookstalls within that area. In holding that the publication of the letter to the magazine was not privilegedSalmon J, as he then was, said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In my judgment, the letter written to Edward Buckle is privileged. I think that the defendant had an interest in writing to him;he was a councillor and was obviously interested in the same topic as the defendant, namely, building development in the Pinner area.In my view, however, the letter published in 'The Villager' is not privileged because the publication is too wide. So far as I know,there is no authority in which a letter published in the press has been held to be privileged, except when it was published as amatter of duty, as in the case of Adam v. Ward, or where it is published by a defendant in answer to a public attack which had beenmade upon him.</p>        <p class="quote"> </p>        <p class="quote">It is no doubt true that all the members of the Pinner Association, whose journal 'The Villager' is, were deeply interested in thesubject-matter of the defendant's letter, as he was himself; but this publication, according to the evidence, is on sale at the book-stallsin Pinner and Harrow - anyone can buy it, and I do not consider that such a publication is privileged; no doubt it does concern amatter of public interest and accordingly fair comment, if made out, would be a good defence.</p>        <p class="quote"> </p>        <p class="quote">As for the publication to the editor, since it was clearly intended to be republished in 'The Villager' and put on sale to the public,I think that the privilege which might otherwise attach is destroyed: no doubt fair comment may also be a good defence to this publication.'</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> The 1st defendant testified that the Herald was strictly limited in its circulation to Muslims in Hong Kong and overseas, and thatit was posted only to those who applied to have their names placed on a mailing list and whom the 1st defendant was satisfied wereMuslims. The remaining copies for distribution were placed in areas of the mosques in Hong Kong to which only Muslims had access.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> Daring the course of the 1st defendant's evidence the plaintiff applied for an order that the defendants give discovery of the Herald'smailing list. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that the plaintiff might somehow make improper use of the list.They were content, however, to hand it to the plaintiff's legal advisors on an undertaking that they would not show it to the plaintiff.This offer was clearly impractical as the plaintiff's advisors would thus have been unable to take instructions on the list. I thereforeordered that the defendants give discovery of the list without any condition that it be withheld from the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Having thus obtained the list counsel for the plaintiff cross examined the 1st defendant on its contents. It was clear that the 1stdefendant was unable to explain satisfactorily how he could identify the persons on the list as being Muslims. When confronted withentries on the list that showed that the Herald was sent to the South China Morning Post, H.K.T.V.B. News Department, Pakistan InternationalAirlines and Director of Student Activities of the Chinese University as well as to named persons, the 1st defendant gave a mostimplausible explanation. He said that two Muslims, one of whom was employed by the South China Morning Post and the other by theHKTVB News Department, had requested him to send the Herald to them at those places without specifying their names on the wrappers.When questioned as to how in these circumstances each monthly issue would reach them, the 1st defendant replied that both personshad told him that the staff at their respective workplaces would know for whom it was intended.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> An examination of the mailing list reveals that wherever a private address is given, the name of the occupant is also provided. Wherethe name of an intended receipient does not appear on the wrapper, it seems far more likely that the contents would reach him ifposted to his residential address rather than to his place of work. It is therefore remarkable that both Muslims who allegedly requestedthat the Herald be sent to them at their place of work should also have given instructions to the 1st defendant to omit any referenceto their names on the wrappers. I do not accept that it was sheer coincidence that both persons happened to be employed by an organof the news media.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> As to the Pakistan International Airlines, the 1st defendant testified that the manager had requested him to place only the nameof the airline on the wrapper. He added that the manager would not permit distribution of the newspaper because not only did it containa prayer timetable which he would need but it might also feature an article that was critical of the Pakistan Government. His explanationas to why the Herald was sent to the Director of Student Activities of the Chinese University was that a group of Muslim studentsfrom Malaysia who were studying at the University had asked him to send them one copy of each edition by addressing it to the Director.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> I find these explanations and the manner in which the 1st defendant gave them to be totally unsatisfactory. I do not believe him.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> Moreover, I am unable to find any good reason why the 1st defendant should restrict the circulation of the Herald to Muslims. Therewas evidence that when non Muslims visited a mosque in Hong Kong they received preaching on the Muslim religion. Notwithstandingthe 1st defendant's view that tours of non Muslims to the prayer hall of a mosque was unacceptable he did not convey the impressionthat he was opposed to the proselytising of non Muslims.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> I am completely satisfied that the 1st defendant was at pains to assert that the Herald was circulated only to Muslims so that hewould not lose the protection of qualified privilege. He gave me the distinct impression that he was tailoring his evidence not onlyto fit the defences he was endeavouring to set up but also to overcome difficulties with which he was occasionally confronted incross examination.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> In my judgment the communication of the article complained of is not protected by qualified privilege. There was no legal, socialor moral duty on the defendants to publish it nor was the publication restricted to such persons or group of persons who had a dutyor interest to receive it. The defendants intended that the Herald be circulated beyond the Muslim community in Hong Kong and Muslimsubscribers overseas to non Mulsims in Hong Kong and, as the evidence disclosed, did in fact so circulate it.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> I have little doubt that they had hoped that at least some articles in the Herald, particularly those of local flavour and of a provocativenature would be published by the South China Morning Post and HKTVB News Department and thus achieve a breadth of publication andimpact for greater than could be attained by the Herald itself.  I also think it likely that the 1st defendant sent it to the Directorof Student Activities in the hope that he might make use of it in such a way that Islamic views, particularly those held by the defendants,would be communicated to students in general at the University.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> The reason for the publication to Pakistan International Airline is not so apparent but I have no doubt that the Herald was not sentthere for the sole use of the manager but was intended for general circulation.</p>    <p class="heading">Justification</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> In order to consider the defence of justification it is necessary first to analyse the passage complained of and to isolate the statementsof fact from the commetns. In so doing I bear in mind that where the defendants have pleaded that a particular statement is one offact, they may not rely on it as a comment even though it might appear to be such.</p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="84%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>            <td width="11%" valign="top">(a)</td>            <td width="79%" valign="top" class="quote">"Indeed, 'Munafiq Wilson-kazim' is a real danger to our Ummah."</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>            <td width="90%" valign="top" colspan="2">                                 <p>Both parties agree, that this is comment.</p>                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>            <td width="11%" valign="top">(b)</td>            <td width="79%" valign="top" class="quote">"He was so daring to claim that he was sent by Allah to manage the Kowloon Mosque."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> The defendants pleaded that with the exception of the words "was so daring to" this sentence is a statement of fact.

Again I think that this is a comment.I am of the view that a reader would understand these words to be an expression of the writer's opinion as to the reason why theplaintiff made the various claims previously referred to and did what is stated in the previous sentence which reads as follows:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"He also pretended to be the Hong Kong leader and 'represented' Hong Kong Muslims to attend the Sino-British Joint Declaration officialceremony at Peking."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> Mr. Barlow observed that it is somewhat strange that having alleged that the earlier passage "he claimed and is claiming himselfto be the leader of Muslims in Hong Kong" is defamatory, the plaintiff has not alleged that this subsequent passage is likewise defamatory.There is, of course, a distinction between claiming and pretending. Claiming requires a positive assertion whereas pretending doesnot necessarily involve making an assertion but may be the passive acceptance by the pretender of another person's mistaken viewthat his status is more elevated than it really is. The distinction, however, is subtle.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> When asked in cross examination why he had not complained of that sentence, the gist of the plaintiff's reply was that he consideredit impractical to complain of every matter on which he considered complaint to be justified and that he had sought to confine hiscomplaint to a few important issues. When it was then suggested to him that in reality there was virtually no distinction betweenthe word "claimed", to which he had objected, and the word "pretended", to which he had not objected, the plaintiff replied thathe had not made so detailed an analysis of the matter.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> Throughout the course of his evidence, the plaintiff impressed me as a sincere and truthful witness. It is true that on occasionhe tended to ramble but I took this to be a genuine attempt by him to express his feelings and to convey his bewilderment and outrageat having been made the subject of such an article. I accept his testimony and am not disposed to attach any sinister significanceto the matter raised by Mr.Barlow.</p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="84%">        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>            <td width="10%" valign="top">(f)</td>            <td width="79%" valign="top" class="quote">"He uses his wealth to lure a group of ignorant Muslims in the Chinese Muslims Association to put him up as Chairman of the Association."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> The defendants pleaded that this is comment. Mr. Chan contends, and I agree with him, that it is a statement of fact. No previousfact is alleged upon which it can be said that this is a comment. In this connexion the example given in paragraph 702 of Gatleyis useful:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"To write of a man that he is 'a disgrace to human nature' is a defamatory allegation of fact. But if the words were, 'He murderedmy father, and therefore is a disgrace to human nature', the latter words appear from the context to be merely comment."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> The defendants have not truly stated or clearly referred to any fact upon which it could be said that this sentence is based.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> Moreover, the sentence goes beyond merely asserting that the so called ignorant Mulsims in the Association "put him up as the Chairman"because they were allured or fascinated by his wealth. The average reader would understand that to be an expression of opinion. However,the use of the words "He uses his wealth to lure" clearly conveys the meaning that the plaintiff did not adopt a passive role buthad taken some unspecified affirmative action to induce the "ignorant Muslims to put him up as the Chairman". In my judgment a readerwould understand the sentence to be a statement of fact.</p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="84%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>            <td width="10%" valign="top">(g)</td>            <td width="78%" valign="top" class="quote">"so as to secure full control of the properties of the Association including its premises and three schools."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> The defendants pleaded that this is comment.

According to the 1st defendantthis immodesty on the part of the plaintiff had aroused considerable anger in the Muslim community.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> Since the 1st defendant accepts that "if something happens it is clear to a Muslim that it is in accordance with the will of Allah",it is difficult to follow his logic that the plaintiff had no right to guess that it was Allah's will that he had been chosen tobe chairman of the committee. I consider that this explanation was no more than an attempt on the part of 1st defendant to overcomethe problem that no witness had testified that the plaintiff had claimed that he had been sent by Allah. I accept the plaintiff'sevidence that there is a clear distinction between "being sent by Allah" and" the will of Allah" and am satisfied on the evidencethat there is no truth in the assertion that the plaintiff had claimed to have been sent by Allah.</p>    <p class="heading">Paragraph (c)</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> In relation to the statement of fact that the plaintiff had claimed and is claiming to be the leader of the Muslims in Hong Kong,the defendants principally relied upon several newspaper articles, a, report of the Chairman of the Incorporated Trustees of theIslamic Community Fund of Hong Kong and evidence that the plaintiff had attended various functions with officials of the PeoplesRepublic of China.</p>    <p>the Management Committee of the Kowloon Mosque:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I believe it was Allah's will that I was elected Chairman of the Management Committee."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is immediately apparent that what the plaintiff actually said in the letter is not what the article complained of alleges thathe claimed.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> The plaintiff frankly admitted that he had verbally expressed to others his belief that his election to the office of Chairman wasthe wish of Allah. It was not disputed that Muslims believe that the last person with the right to claim that he had been sent byAllah was the Prophet Mohammed. Thus to a Muslim it would be a monstrous untruth and a supreme act of arrogance for someone to claimthat he had been sent by Allah.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> The plaintiff testified that all events are predetermined by Allah and that every good Muslim would accept that this is so. Indeed,the 1st defendant's evidence was to the effect that apart from sin, which occurs as a result of the exercise by man of his free will,all events happen in accordance with the will of Allah.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a> According to the 1st defendant, however, there is no distinction between "sent by Allah" and "Allah's will", and that no Muslim wouldclaim that his own personal achievement was due to Allah's will. Instead it is customary before the achievement is attained to say"Inshallah", which means, "If Allah is willing". After the event has occurred it would be appropriate to say "Praise to Allah" or"Thanks to Allah". Thus to say "It is Allah's will" for having received some favour is highly immodest, and by using this expressionthe plaintiff had sought to elevate himself to the level of a prophet.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> In none of these newspaper articles is it stated that the plaintiff claimed to be the leader, or even a leader, of the Muslims inHong Kong. I do not propose to give a detailed account of the various references to him in these articles. Suffice it to say thathe is referred to in terms that make it clear that those responsible for the articles considered him to be either the leader or aleader of the local Muslim community.  No doubt this was due to the fact that the articles were mainly concerned with the activitiesof a group comprised of representatives of six major religions in Hong Kong of which, apart from the plaintiff, most, if not all,are accepted to be the leaders of the religions they represent. Apparently the Muslim community in Hong Kong does not have an officialleader. Whilst he accepted that this is so, the 1st defendant claimed that if anyone could be called a leader it would be the threelocal Immams.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> The plaintiff testified that these articles related to the Secretariat of Six Religious Leaders Colloquium. He said that he had beeninvited to attend the meetings of the Secretariat in his capacity as Chairman of the Chinese Muslim Cultural and Fraternal Associationand that the object of the meetings was to examine ways in which assistance might be given to various groups in society such as theaged and the youth of Hong Kong. Matters of religious doctrine were not discussed.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> In the letter to the Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong, its Chairman, who had visited Peking and hadmade a courtesy call on a person described as the Deputy Director of International Department of China Islamic Association, reportedthat he had been informed by him that "Mr. Kassim Tuet (the plaintiff) in his capacity as the leader of the Muslims in Hong Konghad visited Beijing a few months ago."</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> I see no reason to disbelieve the plaintiff's evidence that he had been invited to attend the meetings of the Secretariat as Chairmanof the Chinese Muslim Cultural and Fraternal Association. If, as the 1st defendant agrees, there is no formal leader of the Muslimcommunity in Hong Kong, it is not surprising that the Secretariat would invite the plaintiff to join its discussions. Likewise itis not surprising that the press would conclude that because the other religious groups in the Secretariat were represented by theirleaders, the plaintiff was the leader of the Muslims in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> I do not think that a statement in a report by the Chairman of the Incorporated Trustees to his Board of what he had been told concerningsomeone else's perception of the role in which the plaintiff had visited Peking takes the matter any further. The fact is that thereis no evidence that the plaintiff had actually made the claim alleged. I note also that there is nothing in the report that suggeststhat it was inappropriate to refer to the plaintiff in such a capacity.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> Indeed the plaintiff readily conceded that many people con-sidered him to be the leader of the Muslims in Hong Kong and surmisedthat this may have been due to his activities on behalf of the Muslim community. He even expressed the hope that those who were awareof his work would consider him to be a leader. He emphatically denied, however, that he had ever claimed to be a leader.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> I do not consider that it was incumbent on the plaintiff to take steps to remedy any false impression that people might have gainedfrom reading the newspapers that he had claimed to be the leader or a leader of the Muslim community. Since nowhere was it statedthat he himself had made such a claim, there was nothing for him to correct. By saying that he was the leader of the Muslims thenewspapers were merely expressing their own opinion. I do not think that it would be reasonable to expect the plaintiff to have takenaffirmative action to dispel this view.</p>    <p class="heading">Paragraph (f)</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a> Although there was evidence that the plaintiff had held office as the Chairman of the Chinese Muslim Cultural and Fraternal Associationfor more than twenty years there was no evidence to suggest that he had in any way made use of his wealth to gain office, let aloneused it to "lure ignorant Muslims to put him up as Chairman". This is nothing more than a wild allegation completely unsupportedby any tangible evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">Paragraph (i)</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="pseudopara" id="p93">93.</a> There is also no evidential foundation for the allegation that the plaintiff always claims to be a "Successful Man". He is undoubtedlywealthy and has been highly successful in business. He has, no doubt, acknowledged this fact. The clear meaning behind the allegation,however, is that the plaintiff constantly boasts of his business achievements.</p>    <p class="heading">Paragraph (j)</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="pseudopara" id="p94">94.</a> The articles of Association of the Chinese Muslim Cultural and Fraternal Association provide that membership is restricted to personsof Chinese race.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="pseudopara" id="p95">95.</a> I accept the evidence of the plaintiff that this was one of the rules of the Association both before it was incorporated and beforehe became a member. The fact that he was unable to produce those earlier rules does not suggest to me that he has not told the truthabout this matter. What is important is that there is no evidence to show that he <u>imposes</u> the racial policy for the Association. The mere fact that he has been Chairman of the Association for many years does not justifysuch a conclusion.</p>    <p class="heading">Paragraph (k)</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="pseudopara" id="p96">96.</a> As to the allegation that "once upon a time <em>[</em>the plaintiff<em>]</em> even prepared to sell the Association's premises to a communist news agency", the defendants seek to rely upon minutes of meetingsof the Association and on something that the 2nd defendant had been told.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a> The plaintiff testified that in 1981 the Committee of the Association decided that because the Association's premises were too small,steps should be taken to redevelop the site together with the adjacent site owned by the New China News Agency with a view to erectinga 23 storey building. In furtherance of the project an architect drew up plans of the proposed redevelopment. Minutes of a meetingof 13th February 1981 disclose that the plaintiff as Chairman had made a report concerning redevelopment of the two sites and thathe had had a consultation with the Property Manager of the New China News Agency who had basically accepted the proposal. Followingthis an architect was engaged, and it is plain from a document prepared by him that his understanding was that the proposal involveda joint development and the total floor area <u>to be retained</u> by each party would be as set out in a list which he had prepared.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="pseudopara" id="p98">98.</a> Minutes of a meeting of 12th June 1981 chaired by the plaintiff disclose that "it was declared that this Association was a non profitmaking organisation and hoped that the government could exempt us from paying tax so as to reduce the burden of the Association."</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="pseudopara" id="p99">99.</a> It was suggested to the plaintiff in cross examination that if there had been no intention to sell the premises to the New ChinaNews Agency, there would have been no need for the Association to consider the matter of paying tax. He denied that there had beenany intention to sell the premises but was unable to recall the context in which the possible payment of tax had been considered.He conceded, however, that the possibility that the Association might make a profit from the redevelopment could have been discussed.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="pseudopara" id="p100">100.</a> In re-examination his own counsel, having asked him whether he had been aware at the time that stamp duty would be payable in respectof the redevelopment, then proceeded to ask him whether he could recall what tax had been under consideration at the meeting. Notwithstandingthe obvious opportunity thus offered to him to say that the tax referred to was not a profit tax but stamp duty, he candidly respondedthat he had no recollection of the matter.  I accept his testimony.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="pseudopara" id="p101">101.</a> The 2nd defendant testified that many years ago he had been told by two elders of the Chinese Muslim Cultural and Fraternal Association,both of whom are now deceased, that "there was the intention of selling the premises."</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="pseudopara" id="p102">102.</a> At the time this testimony was given no objection was made as to its admissibility. Apart from this, however, it was plain that the2nd defendant was unable to indicate when this incident occurred. I am not prepared to assume that it was contemporaneous with theredevelopment project to which the minutes of meetings referred. More to the point is the fact that, whatever may have been discussedat meetings, there was no evidence to suggest that the plaintiff himself "had prepared to sell the Association's premises to a communistnews agency". He had undoubtedly been present at meetings and had participated in discussions concerning the redevelopment of thesite, but even assuming that at these meetings suggestions had been made to offer the site for sale to the New China News Agency,there is no evidence that the plaintiff, who was only one member present, advanced or supported any such suggestion, let alone "preparedto sell" the premises.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="pseudopara" id="p103">103.</a> Thus the defendants have failed completely in their defence of justification. There is no evidence that I accept that establishesany one of the statements of fact to which they have pleaded justification.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="pseudopara" id="p104">104.</a> As none of the statements of fact on which the comments purport to have been made has been proved, the defence of fair comment mustalso fail. It is therefore unnecessary to make a specific finding on the allegation of malice in relation to these comments. However,I think I should make it clear that I am satisfied that none was made maliciously.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="pseudopara" id="p105">105.</a> The 1st defendant gave me the distinct impression of being a religious zealot and I have no doubt that he genuinely, even if mistakenly,believed that the statements of fact in the article were true and that the comments based on them were entirely justified. It seemsto me that he disapproved of what he conceived to be the high profile assumed by the plaintiff both in Muslim affairs and affairsgenerally. He readily concluded from newspaper reports that the plaintiff had been making immodest claims as to his position in theMuslim community. It seems likely that because his views on Muslim affairs diverged from what he conceived to by those held by theplaintiff, he all too readily interpreted the plaintiff's actions in an unfavourable light.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="pseudopara" id="p106">106.</a> Although I am sure that the 1st defendant genuinely held the views expressed in the article complained of, I have the gravest doubtthat the letter he said he had published had in fact ever existed.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="pseudopara" id="p107">107.</a> His testimony in this regard was most unsatisfactory. He claimed that he would not publish a letter unless he was satisfied thatit had been composed by a Muslim, and that to this end he required the sender to supply his or her name and address. However, heinsisted that he did not require these details for the purpose of reference back to the writer in the event that the content of theletter was challenged. He claimed that he would judge whether the writer of a letter was a Muslim from the name supplied. Accordingto him he would publish the letter if the name appeared to be a Muslim name and the contents of the letter concerned Muslim affairsand did not arouse his suspicion that they had been composed by someone other than the purported author. He also claimed that theletter in question had been signed in English script by two persons whose names he could recall and by three others whose names appearedto be written in either Arabic or Urdu, neither of which scripts he was able to understand. He could remember that the senders suppliedan address in Wanchai Road, Wanchai, but was unable to recall the actual street number.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="pseudopara" id="p108">108.</a> The 1st defendant also explained that because of shortage of storage space and the fact that he was not a professional newspapereditor, he disposed of all letters received from correspondents after he had proof read the issue of the Herald in which they wereto be published. Moreover, he had thrown away the letter with which this action is concerned just before it had been published inthe Herald, but, somewhat surprisingly, had retained material which he claimed its authors had sent with it and which he used tosupport his defence.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="pseudopara" id="p109">109.</a> I do not accept the 1st defendant's testimony on these matters. It seems quite likely that the letter did not originate from thefive persons whom he claimed had sent it, but that he had composed it himself as a genuine reflection of his own views and perhapsthose of some others in the Muslim community.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="pseudopara" id="p110">110.</a> The 2nd defendant can neither speak nor read English and I am satisfied that, apart from being registered as the publisher of theHerald and performing menial tasks to assist in its publication, he played no part in making editorial decisions and may have beenunaware of what articles would appear in each edition of the newspaper. In view of his inability to read English I am not persuadedthat by leaving editorial decisions to the 1st defendant he acted recklessly. I therefore conclude that he published the letter inquestion without malice.</p>    <p class="heading">Damages</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="pseudopara" id="p111">111.</a> The Herald has a small circulation in Hong Kong. According to the defendant there were 287 names on the mailing list in January 1985and the total number of copies printed for that edition was 3000, of which he retained approximately 10. There was no evidence nordid there seem to be any inherent likelihood that the libel had been published to any person other than members of the local Muslimcommunity and overseas Muslims whose names appear on that list.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="pseudopara" id="p112">112.</a> I bear in mind, however, that publication of a libel to members of a small community within which the victim has achieved prominenceand with whom it would be reasonable to assume he was closely connected, might well bring greater humiliation and discomfort to himthan would a much wider publication of a libel bring to a less prominent man.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="pseudopara" id="p113">113.</a> The plaintiff expressed the view that although the article would have had little effect on those people who knew him well, it wouldhave adversely influenced those who were not so well acquainted with him.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="pseudopara" id="p114">114.</a> There was no specific evidence as to what proportion of the Muslim community knew him well but I think that it would be fair to assumethat because of his long tenure of office as chairman of the Association and the active part he has played in community affairs,he would be widely known in that circle and that of those who read the Herald there may be many who, whilst familiar with his nameand activities, did not know him personally and might therefore have formed an unfavourable view of him as a result of the article.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="pseudopara" id="p115">115.</a> He claimed that although in 1985 there had been no decline in the number of people who visited him in his capacity as chairman, noone had so visited him in 1986 and 1987. Since the article was published in January 1985 I am not disposed to draw any firm conclusionfrom this. The period between publication and the fall off in the number of visitors is so long that it is likely that this was dueto other reasons.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="pseudopara" id="p116">116.</a> The plaintiff is a successful businessman and a member of the Basic Law Consultative Commission. As such he is a reasonably wellknown figure outside Muslim circles. There can be no doubt that his feelings have been deeply wounded by the article and that hemust have suffered anxiety in bringing this action to clear his name and rectify the damage to his reputation. Moreover, the defendantshave persisted in their defence of justification when it should have been plain to them at least at an early stage of the hearingthat there was no concrete evidence to support this defence.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="pseudopara" id="p117">117.</a> Since no witness was called to testify that the plaintiff had claimed to be the leader of the Muslims in Hong Kong, it seems clearthat the defendants were content to cling to their belief that because press articles had stated that he was the leader, he musthave actually claimed to be such. Notwithstanding that Mr. Barlow conducted his cross examination of the plaintiff in a scrupulouslyfair manner and studiously avoided making wounding allegations, the conduct of the defendants in seeking to justify the libel isa matter for aggravation of damages.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="pseudopara" id="p118">118.</a> There are very few cases in Hong Kong from which I am able to draw assistance in deciding the appropriate level of award in the presentcase. Bearing in mind all the factors to which I have referred I conclude that a sum of $50,000 would be an adequate solatium andat the same time take into account the conduct of the defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="pseudopara" id="p119">119.</a> Accordingly I give judgment for the plaintiff in that sum.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">                (Neil Macdougall)                <p style="text-align:center">Judge of the High Court</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr. K.S.
