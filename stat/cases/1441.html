name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>   The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff is a company listed in the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs are subsidiaries of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff. At all material times, the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants were respectively the managing director, chairman and executive director of the Plaintiffs. The 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Defendants were property developers of a property at 28 Marble Road, North Point (âBuildingâ). The 6<sup>th</sup> Defendant was the financier for the Plaintiffs in respect of the purchase of the basement of the Building (âBasementâ). Vigerswas a professional property valuer instructed by the Plaintiffs to give an opinion on the open market value of Shops 5 and 6 on theground floor and the 7<sup>th</sup> floor of the Building on 27 February 1997 and of the Basement on 9 May 1997.</p>    <p class="heading">The background</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>   The parties have no dispute about the following factual background leading to this litigation.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>   The Building is known as 28 Marble Road. It is situated at the junction of Shu Kuk Street and Marble Road, which runs parallelto and is a few minutes walk from the busy Kingâs Road. The locality is an old urbanized area in North Point with multi-storeyresidential and commercial buildings. On the northern side of Marble Road opposite the Building are fixed pitch stalls. The Buildingrests on a floor plate of about 15,000 square feet gross area. It was designed and built as a modern high class commercial buildingwith glass curtain wall. The Basement, ground and first floors are shop premises. The 2<sup>nd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> floors are car parks, the 6<sup>th</sup> floor is a service floor for mechanical plant and the 7<sup>th</sup> to 32<sup>nd</sup> floors are office floors. There are no 4<sup>th</sup>, 14<sup>th</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup> floors in the Building. It is, nevertheless, a small commercial building with office and shops.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>   The main entrance of the Building is at Marble Road which serves as the office entrance lobby. There are seven shop spaces in theground floor. There is a side entrance at Shu Kuk Street with a pair of escalators leading to and from the lobby to the 1<sup>st</sup> floor shopping arcade of 7,534 square feet saleable area and another pair of escalators leading to and from the lobby to the Basement.The Basement has direct access to the MTR North Point Station via Exit A4. That exit used to serve residents of the then existingNorth Point Estate until the estate was demolished in 2003. The Basement occupied a gross area of 1,463.04 square metres or 15,748square feet. The office floors are much smaller, of about 10,000 square feet gross area. There are altogether twenty-seven car parkingspaces on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> floors and five lorry parking spaces and some loading areas on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor. At the material time, the Building was still under construction. The occupation permit was not issued until 28 August 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>   On or about 20 January 1997, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff which was then the sole subsidiary of Fei Wang Incorporated (âFei Wangâ) entered into three agreements to purchaseShops 5, 6 on the ground floor and the 7<sup>th</sup> floor of the Building from the 5<sup>th</sup> Defendant for a total consideration of $108 million. The property formed the sole asset of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff and hence of Fei Wang.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>   On 26 February 1997, on the instructions of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff Joseph Leung of Vigers prepared a valuation report of Shops 5 and 6 on the ground floor and the 7<sup>th</sup> floor of the Building. On the following day, Joseph Leung issued a valuation report for the property at a total value of $142.5 million.On the basis of that valuation, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff acquired the entire issued share capital of Fei Wang on 11 March 1997 at $140.175 million. Since then, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff became a subsidiary of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>   On a day before 9 May 1997, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant orally instructed Joseph Leung to prepare a valuation report of the Basement. On the same day, Joseph Leung went to theBuilding to have an outside inspection. On 9 May 1997, he sent a valuation letter (âVigers Valuation Letterâ) giving a valueof $470 million for the Basement. On 12 May 1997, Joseph Leung issued a valuation report consisting of eight pages and a coveringletter valuing the Basement at $470 million (âVigers Reportâ). The valuation given in the Vigers Valuation Letter and the VigersReport were stated to be âfor finance purposeâ.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>   On 13 May 1997, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants held a board of directors meeting of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and passed a resolution to approve the acquisition of the Basement. On the same day, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant signed the sale and purchase agreement on behalf of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to purchase the Basement from the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant at a consideration of $470 million (âPrincipal Agreementâ). Under the Principal Agreement, half of the consideration(i.e. $235 million) was to be paid by cash and the other half by issue and allotment of shares of and in the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff in favour of the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant (âConsideration Shares Arrangementâ).</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>   On 14 May 1997, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff published an announcement of the purchase of the Basement in newspapers calling for a special general meeting of shareholderson 11 June 1997 to approve the purchase.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>   On 26 May 1997, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff issued a circular to shareholders (âCircularâ) annexing the Vigers Report as Appendix III. Shortly prior to that, atthe request of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, Joseph Leung had given his consent for the Vigers Report to be included in the Circular.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>   On the same day, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants held a board of directors meeting of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiff and approved its sub-purchase of the Basement from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff. They also signed the sub-sale and purchase agreement in respect of the Basement at $470 million respectively on behalfof the 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiff as sub-purchaser and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff as vendor/confirmor.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>   On 11 June 1997, the shareholders of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff approved the Principal Agreement and the Consideration Shares Arrangement.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>   On 22 July 1997, the 6<sup>th</sup> Defendant issued the 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiff a facility letter offering credit facilities of $235 million to provide the cash required for the purchase under the PrincipalAgreement. The loan agreement was signed on 11 August 1997. Previously, the 6<sup>th</sup> Defendant had obtained a valuation report from Midland Surveyors Limited valuing the Basement at $420 million (âMidland Reportâ)and a valuation report from Richard Ellis Ltd valuing the Basement at $315 million (âRichard Ellis Reportâ).</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>   Then between 7 August and 31 December 1997, the 5<sup>th</sup> Defendant entered into three further sale and purchase transactions with subsidiaries of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff in respect of other floors in the Building.

The only outstanding action is against Vigers.</p>    <p class="heading">The parties' case</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>   The parties have no dispute about the above factual background leading to this litigation.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>   The Plaintiffs are not pursuing the allegation of conspiracy against Vigers. The Plaintiffsâ claim is just for damages for breachof contract and/or breach of duty of care as a professional property valuer, arising out of its valuation of the Basement on 9 May1997 at $470 million. The first thrust of the Plaintiffsâ case is that instead of properly valuing the Basement as a professionalvaluer should, Vigers gave a valuation which was exactly the same as the previously agreed consideration of $470 million which Vigershad been informed beforehand and that valuation was grossly inflated. They called the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant as a factual witness as if she were an immunity witness in a criminal action. She gave evidence that of a conversationbetween her and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant which suggests that Vigers was to fix up the valuation. The second thrust of the Plaintiffsâ case is that the valuationwas indeed substandard and grossly out of line with the true valuation. The Plaintiffs called Mr Cullen who is a professional surveyoras expert witness to give expert opinion of the valuation of the Basement and professional practice in making valuation. Mr Cullenis of the opinion that the open market value of the Basement on a vacant possession basis as at 9 May 1997 was $108 million.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>   Vigers denied the allegation of fixing the valuation or that they had been negligent. They called one factual witness, namely JosephLeung who was the director in charge of commercial valuation department of Vigers and who prepared the valuation of the Basementcomplained of by the Plaintiffs. They also called a professional valuer Mr Rock Tsang as expert witness to support the reasonablenessof the valuation. Mr Tsang is of the opinion that the open market value of the Basement on a vacant possession basis as at 9 May1997 was $439 million.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>   Mr Lai, counsel for Vigers, seized on the Plaintiffsâ allegation of conspiracy in their statement of claim as excusing Vigersfrom liability being an innocent instrument of the fraud of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants. He also seized on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantâs defence to the conspiracy allegation that the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants saw the Basement as a good investment as a break in the chain of causation and raised the defence of contributory negligenceon the part of the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>   Given the nature of the dispute, the single and most crucial issue is whether Joseph Leung was negligent in making the valuation.If he was, regardless whether there was any agreement between him and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to fix the valuation, Vigers will be liable. If he was not negligent and his valuation was within the bracket of what wasconsidered reasonable, even if there was an agreement to fix the valuation, Vigers will not be liable. I shall therefore begin withinvestigating the issue whether Vigers were negligent in the valuation. I shall then investigate the allegation of fixing the valuationfor the purpose of dealing with the issues of causation and contributory negligence in case the valuation was negligently made.</p>    <p class="heading">The law</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>   Counsel have no dispute that the nature of Vigersâ contractual duty under the oral retainer was no different from its commonlaw duty of care in tort. Hence, it is immaterial that the Plaintiffs did not adduce any evidence of the content of the oral retainergiven to Vigers. The legal principles in relation to surveyorsâ negligence is well-established and are accurately summarised inparagraph 10-062 in <i>Jackson</i> <i>&amp; Powell on Professional</i> <i>Liability</i>, 6<sup>th</sup> edition as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe onus of proof rests âfairly and squarelyâ upon the claimant in an action for professional negligence against a surveyor.It is not enough to prove that he was wrong. Negligence must be distinctly proved. It may even be difficult to prove he was wrongby showing that the defendantâs valuation was significantly higher or lower than another surveyorâs valuation or the price actuallyachieved or that his estimate of individual items making up the calculation was on the high side. It must be shown that his valuationand calculations were such that they could not have been arrived at by the exercise of reasonable care and skill. Although it issometimes stated that the onus of proof in a professional negligence action is a heavy one, the standard is no more than that applicableto civil actions generally, namely proof on a balance of probabilities.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The above passage as it then existed in the 4<sup>th</sup> edition of <i>Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional Liability</i> was approved by Stuart-Smith LJ in <i>Watts v Savills</i>, CA, 16 June 1998 at paragraph 38.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>   The <i>locus classicus</i> of the test whether a person professing to exercise some skill or competence is that set out in the direction to the jury given byMcNair J in <i>Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee</i>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1957%5d%201%20WLR%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1957] 1 WLR 582</a> at 586-587. There McNair J said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe test is the standard of the ordinary skilled man exercising and professing to have that special skill. â¦ A man need not possessthe highest expert skill; it is well established law that it is sufficient if he exercises the ordinary skill of an ordinary competentman exercising that particular art. â¦ I myself would prefer to put it this way, that he is not guilty of negligence if he has actedin accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular art. â¦ Puttingit the other way round, a man is not negligent, if he is acting in accordance with such a practice, merely because there is a bodyof opinion who would take a contrary view.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The <i>Bolam</i> test has been sanctioned by long usage. It is of general application to any person exercising or professing a particular skill andis not confined to the medical profession which was at issue in that case. The application of the standard requires there to be abody of professional practice or opinion to which to refer in assessing the conduct of the defendant criticised. The test as adaptedto the surveying profession has been stated by Stephen Brown LJ in <i>Nye Saunders &amp; Partners v Alan E Bristow</i>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2037%20BLR%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 37 BLR 97</a> at 103 to be whether there was evidence that at the time a responsible body of surveyors would have taken the view that the way inwhich the subject of the inquiry had carried out his duties was an appropriate way of carrying out the duty and would not hold himguilty of negligence merely because there was a body of competent professional opinion which held that he was at fault. If thereare conflicting opinion from different bodies of the profession and if the surveyorâs way of carrying out the duty accords withthe opinion of one of those bodies, he is absolved of liability.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>   In course of time, the courts have made inroads into what used to be the exclusive realm of the professionals. In <i>JD Williams &amp; Co Ltd v Michael Hyde &amp; Associates Ltd</i> [2000] Lloydâs LR 823, after reviewing the authorities, Ward LJ held at 830 that the <i>Bolam</i> test has been held not to apply under three circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>   Firstly, in <i>Bolitho And City and Hackney Health Authority</i>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%203%20WLR%201151" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 3 WLR 1151</a>, Lord Browne-Wilkinson stressed that the court has to be satisfied that the exponents of the body of opinion relied upon can demonstratethat such opinion has a logical basis. If it can be demonstrated that the professional opinion is not capable of withstanding logicalanalysis, the judge is entitled to hold that the body of opinion is not reasonable or responsible.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>   Secondly, in <i>Nye Saunders &amp; Partners</i>, Stephen Brown LJ held that where the evidence of the expert amounted to no more than an expression of his personal opinion as towhat he would or would not have done in the circumstances, the judge was entitled to take the view that such evidence falls shortof constituting evidence of a responsible body of architects: see also <i>Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd and another v Hett, Stubbs &amp; Kemp (a firm)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%203%20WLR%20167" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 3 WLR 167.</a> In effect, in such a case, the initial criteria for the application of the <i>Bolam</i> test are not met.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>   Thirdly, in <i>Gold v Haringey Health Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20QB%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] QB 481</a> at 490, Lloyd LJ held that if the giving of advice required no special skill, then the <i>Bolam</i> test should not apply. In order words, where it is not necessary to apply any particular expertise to decide whether the defendanthas failed to exercise the skill and care expected of an ordinary member of the surveying profession, there is no room for applicationof the test.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>   Nowadays, the courts are more cautious in accepting expert opinion in deciding issues of professional negligence. Before applyingthe <i>Bolam</i> test, the courts have to be satisfied that the circumstances are such that expert opinion is called for, that the expert opinionpresented to the court has a local basis and that it represents the opinion of the appropriate body of professionals and not justthe personal opinion of the expert testifying in court.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>   As the plaintiff bears the legal burden of proving negligence, the practice is for the plaintiff to adduce such expert evidenceas to show what the practice of the profession was and that the defendantâs conduct fell short of that standard. Then the defendantwould adduce evidence of a different practice by another competent body of the profession. If such contrary practice is proven tothe satisfaction of the court and if the defendantâs conduct conformed to that contrary practice, he is absolved of liability.However, the ultimate question, as King CJ of the Supreme Court of South Australia put it in <i>F v R</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2033%20SASR%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 33 SASR 189</a> at 194 is:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ not whether the defendantâs conduct accords with the practices of his profession or some part of it, but whether it conformsto the standard of reasonable care demanded by the law. That is a question for the court and the duty of deciding it cannot be delegatedto any profession or group in the community.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>   Before admitting evidence of expert witnesses, the court must first decide whether expert opinion is necessary in respect of theconduct complained of. Then, in admitting evidence of expert witnesses, care must be exercised in distinguishing between evidenceof the practice of the profession and expression of the expertâs personal opinion of what he would or would not have done in thecircumstances of the subject under criticism. Evidence of the latter is irrelevant. In respect of the former, the court must be satisfiedthat there is a logical basis for the expertâs opinion.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>   As for the standard of care and skill required of a surveyor, it is that standard possessed by a person of ordinary competenceexercising the same calling. The standard of reasonable care and skill is usually established by reference to the general practiceof the surveying profession. While evidence of such practice may assist the court, it is not decisive of what is required to dischargethe standard of reasonable care. It is for the court to decide having regard to the particular circumstances of the case what thatstandard is. A surveyor whose conduct is called in question need not possess the highest expert skill. It is well established lawthat it is sufficient if he exercises the ordinary skill of an ordinary competent man exercising that particular profession. Wherea profession embraces a range of views as to what is an acceptable standard of conduct, the competence of the surveyor is to be judgedby the lowest standard that would be regarded as acceptable. But a court should be slow to find a professionally qualified man guiltyof a breach of his duty of skill and care towards a client without evidence from those within the same profession as to the standardexpected on the facts of the case and the failure of the professionally qualified man to measure up to that standard: <i>Sansom &amp; Another v Metcalfe Hambleton &amp; Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20PNLR%20542" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] PNLR 542</a> at 549, per Butler-Sloss LJ.</p>    <p class="heading">Credibility of witnesses</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>   The crucial issue in this case is whether in assessing the value of the Basement, Joseph Leung lived up to the standard of theordinary skilled surveyor exercising and professing to have that special skill. In reaching that conclusion, the Court is to be largelyguided by the expertsâ evidence of professional practice. As such, credibility of the factual witnesses is of relatively minorsignificance compared with reliability of the experts, especially as the factual background in this case is not in dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>   The Plaintiffsâ expert witness was Mr Ian Cullen. He had given expert evidence in the courts and his evidence had been acceptedby the courts. He was well qualified to give expert evidence and understood that as an expert witness he owed primary duty to assistthe Court rather than to advance his clientâs case. Mr Lai suggests that Mr Cullen is the typical English gentleman of SavilleRow with cultured speech and refined attire but is unfamiliar with Hong Kong situation. Mr Cullen has lived and worked in Hong Kongfor almost the entirety of his professional life. He is thoroughly familiar with Hong Kong at least insofar as is required of hisexpertise as a surveyor. He gave evidence in a most professional, unbiased and forthwith manner. His evidence was very solid andcapable of withstanding logical analysis. I accept his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>   Mr Rock Tsang was called by Vigers as their expert witness. He was also well qualified to give expert evidence and had given evidencein the courts before. In answer to my question, he told me that his evidence had been accepted by the courts. According to his evidence,he had given evidence once in the High Court and twice in the Lands Tribunal. As revealed in the course of cross-examination, thecourts commented on him adversely. He was commented by the judge in High Court Miscellaneous Proceedings No 531 of 1989 as the leastreliable of the three expert witnesses called and as appearing somewhat partisan. The judge commented on his stubborn insistenceon the irrelevant and obviously totally inadequate model which would create more problems than it solved. His methodology was rejectedby the Lands Tribunal. Mr Sarony SC, counsel for the Plaintiffs, referred to numerous instances which he submits show that Mr Tsangwas not acting impartially as an expert. I agree with Mr Sarony SCâs comments. I do not find it necessary to refer to those instancessave for some major ones, such as his choice of comparables and his rejection of Mr Cullenâs comparables from which lack of impartialitycould be readily inferred. Mr Tsang did not impress me as an impartial expert witness. His evidence was not capable of withstandinglogical analysis. He stubbornly insisted on irrelevant comparables. He was more of an advocate advancing the case of his client whoinstructed him than an independent expert witness with a view to assist the Court. As I shall demonstrate, some of his opinions werejust nonsense. I do not accept his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>   Each side called one factual witness. The Plaintiffs called the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, Ms Kwok, as their witness of fact. She is a solicitor and a director of a listed company. Her evidence was capable ofbelief but was contradicted by her defence and some company documents of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff. Having regard to the totality of the evidence and the inference to be drawn from the other facts which have been provento my satisfaction, I do not consider her credible and her evidence reliable.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>   Vigers called Joseph Leung as their factual witness. His evidence was inconsistent with his witness statements. He admitted thathe made various mistakes in his witness statements. He explained that was due to his emotional upset. He was cross-examined on whyhe had not made an internal inspection of the Basement even though he normally would have gained access to the building to be valuedaccording to his witness statement. He gave a convoluted explanation that he did not wish to ask for consent from the 1<sup>st</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> Defendants because it would cause problem or trouble. When pressed further, he said he would not go into most sites under constructionin Hong Kong for fear that he might get into trouble though he had no such problem in China. Then he changed and became adamant thathe never entered any building under construction at all. This may have little bearing in the issues in dispute. However, his demeanourdemonstrated that he was not serious or sincere in his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>   His evidence was even more convoluted when questioned why he did not state the saleable area in the Vigers Report. He replied thatit was because the saleable area had not been confirmed and that if he was not certain he would not put it in. When it was suggestedthat he could have added a rider that the saleable area was subject to confirmation, he responded that he would not write it thatway. But, elsewhere, he relied on the fact that the saleable area was mentioned in the Vigers Valuation Letter. Then when questionedabout the manuscript calculations of the saleable area on one of the documents, he said that they were records of the measurementstaken of the area. He said that he did not do the calculations but was only taking measurements to get the area. He changed and saidit was one of his colleagues who did the calculation which was contrary to his evidence that the handwriting was his own. Then hechanged again by saying he meant he counterchecked the calculation. His evidence was incomprehensible. Vigers had not done any landsearch by that stage. The only plan Joseph Leung had at that stage was the floor plan which was not to scale and had only one linearmeasurement marked on it. No one had entered the Building and no physical measurements could have been taken. It was just impossibleby relying on the floor plan he or anyone from Vigers could have come up with the precise figure of 11,388 square feet saleable area.While these instances have little bearing in this case, Joseph Leungâs demeanour demonstrated that he was not a responsible witness.He was simply not telling the whole truth.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>   In his witness statement dated 23 July 2004, he mentioned that he had made a mental note that the Basement had a direct link tothe MTR North Point Station which gave it a very unique feature like the Prudential Centre in Jordan Road. Then in his witness statementdated 17 October 2005, more than a year later, he picked this up and produced rental data of a shop in Prudential Centre in October1994 from Vigersâ research department and his calculation from those data of the capitalised value of the Basement for cross referencinghis valuation based on the seven comparables he used (Exhibit D-3). He said that Exhibit D-3 was a contemporaneous document. Indeed,the calculations were done on the back of a printed document the content of which included reference to the exchange rate of Reminbeiin 1997 and there were rust stains on the document. Exhibit D-3 must have been filed together with the worksheet on which he madethe valuation and which was produced in Court. If at the material time Joseph Leung had done the cross checking with the rental datafrom Prudential Centre and had filed that document in the valuation file of the Basement, one wonders why he did not mention in hiswitness statement of 2004 that he had carried out such an important cross checking process. I think his evidence about having cross-checkedhis valuation with the rental data from Prudential Centre is an afterthought and Exhibit D-3 is a concocted document.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>   I do not consider Joseph Leung a credible witness.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>   I shall next take an overall view of the reports of the experts of both parties and then deal with the issues in dispute betweenthe experts. I shall form my view of what is a reasonable valuation of the Basement and then consider if Joseph Leung and, hence,Vigers were negligent in preparing the valuation of the Basement.</p>    <p class="heading">The Cullen Valuation Reports</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>   The Plaintiffsâ valuation expert is Mr Ian Cullen of Ian Cullen &amp; Associates.

He produced four reports on behalfof the Plaintiffs dated 2 May 2003, 18 January 2006, 30 November 2007 and 12 May 2009 (âCullen Report I, II, III and IVâ respectively).Cullen Report I is a report on the valuation of the Basement. Cullen Reports II and III are replies to the reports prepared by Vigersâexpert. Cullen Report IV is a report on the present valuation of the Basement, which is not relevant for the present purpose.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>   In paragraph 1.1 of Cullen Report I, Mr Cullen stated the terms of his instruction under the retainer as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe instructions which have been received from Messrs Andrew Lam &amp; Co Solicitors, are for the preparation of a survey reportand the assessment of the open market value of the subject premises captioned on a vacant possession basis as at 9<sup>th</sup> May 1997 (hereafter âthe Valuation Dateâ) for reference in legal proceedings and an action for damages.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>   In paragraph 6.3.1 of Cullen Report I, he noted that the saleable area of the Basement by reference to the Principal Agreementwas 1,057.963 square metres or 11,388 square feet. By reference to architectural floor plans, he assessed the saleable area to be11,250 square feet. As that is within 1% of the above quoted area, he adopted the saleable area as 11,388 square feet for the purposeof preparing the valuation.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>   Mr Cullen assessed the value of the Basement by direct comparison method. As large basements were not common in North Point andhence not frequently transacted, he chose large podium level floor space of similar size as comparables for the purpose of assessingthe open market value of the Basement. The four comparable transactions chosen by Mr Cullen are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse">            <tr>                <td class="quote" width="131" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">Property</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="93" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">Date of transaction</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="103" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">Saleable area</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="131" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">Consideration</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="112" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">Unit rate per square foot</p>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td class="quote" width="131" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:left">1<sup>st</sup> floor of   the Building</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="93" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">16/09/97</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="103" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">7,534 sq ft</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="131" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">$93.02 million</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="112" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">$12,347</p>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td class="quote" width="131" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:left">1<sup>st</sup> floor of  Roca Centre   at King's Road</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="93" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">29/11/96</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="103" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">12,402 sq ft</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="131" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">$80.97 million</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="112" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">$6,529</p>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td class="quote" width="131" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:left">2<sup>nd</sup> floor of Fortress Tower at King's Road</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="93" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">28/11/97</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="103" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">15,672 sq ft</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="131" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">$95.617 million</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="112" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">$6,101</p>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td class="quote" width="131" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:left">1<sup>st</sup> floor of Tanner Garden at Tanner Road</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="93" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">26/06/97</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="103" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">8,623 sq ft</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="131" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">$41.8 million</p>                </td>                <td class="quote" width="112" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:center">$4,848</p>                </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>   Mr Cullen calculated the transaction price per square foot or unit rate in those four comparable transactions. He then made adjustmentson the unit rates for (1) time lag between the transaction dates of those four comparables and 9 May 1997 (âValuation Dateâ)by reference to the Jones Lang Wootton statistics on retail capital value index movement (âJLW Indexâ); (2) location or tradingpotential; (3) size; (4) signage or visibility; (5) accessibility; and (6) age, condition and building type. Having regard to thesimilarities and hence compatibility of the comparables to the Basement, he applied a weighting factor to the unit rates and arrivedat a valuation for the Basement. The weighting factor and adjustments other than that for time lag are subjective, being based onMr Cullenâs personal experience or intuition. Using the above method, he arrived at a unit rate of $9,500 per square foot saleablearea at Valuation Date and a valuation of $108 million for the entire Basement.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>   Mr Cullen then cross-checked his valuation by reference to the rental receipt of the Basement. The Basement was first let out asa whole on 16 August 1999 at a monthly rental of $238,000 exclusive of rates and management fee for a three year fixed term. By referenceto JLWIndex, the rental levels were approximately 55% higher at the Valuation Date in comparison to the actual date of commencementof the lease. He arrived at the rental adjusted to the Valuation Date to be $370,000 exclusive per month. After allowing for 3% governmentrent and 2% sinking fund for repairs, the net monthly rental at Valuation Date was $351,500. According to the Rating and ValuationDepartment Private Property Market Yields, the yield of retail premises at Valuation Date was circa 4.6% per annum, while the yieldsuggested by Jones Lang Woottonâs commentary was 4% per annum yield for prime premises. Applying a capitalisation factor of 301for yield at 4% per annum, he calculated the capital value of the Basement to be $105,801,500 or say $106 million. The valuationobtained by rental capitalisation supports the valuation obtained by use of comparables.</p>    <p class="heading">The Lanbase Reports</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>   Vigersâ expert is Mr Rock Tsang of Lanbase Surveyors Limited. Mr Tsang was elected as a Professional Member of the Royal Institutionof Chartered Surveyors in 1985. In 1990, he was elected a Professional Associate of Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors. He became aRegistered Professional Surveyor (General Practice). He produced a letter dated 5 July 2005 commenting on the Vigers Valuation Letter,Vigers Report, Midland Report, Richard Ellis Report and Cullen Report I (âLanbase Letterâ). He also produced three reports dated5 July 2005, 24 October 2005 and 4 September 2007 (âLanbase Report I, II and IIIâ respectively). Lanbase Report I is a valuationof the Basement prepared by Mr Tsang. Lanbase Report II is a supplemental report to support Joseph Leungâs use of a transactionin the Prudential Centre as a comparable for his valuation. Lanbase Report III is a reply to Cullen Reports II and III.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>   In the Lanbase Letter, Mr Tsang commented that Vigers Valuation Letter served as an indication of value only and would be subjectto a final valuation report. He considered the format of the Vigers Report reasonable and acceptable and that Joseph Leung as a valuerhas acted reasonably in preparing the valuation. I shall deal with those comments in greater detail when I analyse the Vigers Report.He considered the Midland Report and Richard Ellis Report up to the standard as normally required by the profession, despite thelack of comparable/analysis and information about the saleable area. As for Cullen Report I, he considered the format up to the standardrequired by the profession, but criticised the comparables as inappropriate.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>   In Lanbase Report I, Mr Tsang quoted his instructions in paragraph 3 of the report as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âLanbase Surveyors Limited has been appointed by Vigers Hong Kong Limited to prepare a valuation report on the open market valueof the subject property as at 9<sup>th</sup> May 1997 for legal proceedings.</p>        <p class="quote">As the subject property was under construction, we are instructed to assess the value of the subject property on the assumption thatit has been completed as the date of valuation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>   Mr Tsang prepared a valuation of the Basement by direct comparison method.

Based on that adjusted unit rate, he valued the Basement at $439 million as at 9 May 1997. He did not use any weightingfactor. It was unnecessary as all the comparables were within the Building.</p>    <p class="heading">The Midland Report</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>   The Midland Report was obtained by the 6<sup>th</sup> Defendant, presumably in connection with the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs loan application. It is not clear who was the maker of the report. I assume it was made by the person who signed thereport on behalf of Midland who claimed to be a chartered surveyor and registered professional surveyor. The instruction given toMidland as stated in the report was to conduct an open market valuation of the Basement as at the date of the report, i.e. 15 July1997. The report quoted the gross floor area of the Basement was 15,748 square feet, without mentioning the saleable area. Midlandvalued the Basement at $420 million as at 15 July 1997. No comparable was quoted by Midland. It is not clear on what basis the valuationwas made. The maker of the report was not called. In the circumstances, the report is worthless for the purpose of this litigation.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>   Mr Tsang argued in Lanbase Report I that in commenting the valuation in the Vigers Report it was preferable (under cross-examination,he changed âpreferableâ to âhelpfulâ) to make reference to other valuation reports prepared at the same period of time becausethose reports reflected the same market atmosphere and made in the same physical environment. Mr Cullen was of a different opinion.His opinion was that value is reflected by actual sales and lettings in the property market and valuation reports were clearly justthe valuerâs interpretations of such data. He also argued that market atmosphere was more usually referred to as âtimeâ orâtime lagâ which can be adjusted using data from the Rating and Valuation Department or well established surveyors such as JLWIndex. He agreed that environments change over time but argued that unless a major land use change had occurred, referring to evidencesix or nine months from a Valuation Date should adequately reflect the environment. I prefer Mr Cullenâs opinion as being morelogical. Actual transactions must have reflected the market atmosphere. Besides, what is fatal to Mr Tsangâs argument is the absenceof information about what comparables were used by the valuer in arriving at the valuation in the Midland Report. I reject Mr Tsangâsargument.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>   I note that the valuation given in the Midland Report was as at 15 July 1997 which was two months after the Vigers Report. Thevaluer must have conducted a land search or otherwise been informed of the transaction price of the Basement. Despite that knowledgeand despite the fact that the market was still on the rise in July 1997, the valuer gave a valuation which was more than 10% lowerthan that in the Vigers Report. That reflects the valuerâs feeling of unreality of Joseph Leungâs valuation.</p>    <p class="heading">The Richard Ellis Report</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>   The Richard Ellis Report was also requisitioned by the 6<sup>th</sup> Defendant. According to the report, Richard Ellisâ instruction was to advise on the open market value of the Basement. The valuationdate was not mentioned. I assume its instruction was to advise on the open market value as at the date of the report which was 24July 1997. The valuer or writer of the report was not identified. I assume he was a professional surveyor. Unlike the Midland Report,it quoted the net area of the Basement as 10,942 square feet. It valued the Basement at $315 million, but no comparable was quotedin the report.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>   I repeat my observation that the absence of information about the comparables used for the purpose of preparing the valuation renderedthe valuation worthless. For the same reason, I also reject Mr Tsangâs argument that in considering the valuation in the VigersReport it is preferable or helpful to make reference to this report. But of course, I also note that despite the valuer probablyhad knowledge of the transaction price of the Basement and despite the rising market in July 1997 as compared with that in May 1997,the valuer gave a valuation which was only two-thirds of Joseph Leungâs. That valuation reflects even greater the feeling of unrealityin Joseph Leungâs valuation by members of his profession at the material time.</p>    <p class="heading">The Vigers Report</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>   The Vigers Report was prepared by Joseph Leung. Joseph Leung received his training in Vigers and qualified as a chartered surveyorin 1993. He became the head of the valuation department of Vigers since 1996. He left Vigers in the end of November 2002 to practiceon his own in China.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>   According to Joseph Leung, a day or so before 9 May 1997, he received urgent oral instructions over the telephone from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to give a valuation on the Basement for the purpose of obtaining financing from a bank. Though the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff was a retained client of Vigers, Joseph Leung had never seen the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in person. He had only communicated with him over the telephone. He noted the essential information about his conversationin his notebook and printed some comparables from Vigersâ data bank. He visited the Building the same day with his notebook andprinted comparables. From the comparables, he prepared a handwritten list which was a worksheet on which he did the valuation (âWorksheetâ).He worked late into the early hours of the following day and valued the Basement at $470 million. He issued the Vigers ValuationLetter and then the full Vigers Report a few days later. He had thrown away his notebook and the printed comparables in course oftime, but a handwritten list of the comparables with his calculations was kept in Vigersâ files.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>   In paragraph 4 of the Vigers Report, Joseph Leung described the location of the Basement as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âNo. 28 Marble [Road] is situated in a corner site bounded by Marble Road in the north and Shu Kuk Street in the west within theNorth Point district of Hong Kong Island. The locality is a mixed user area comprising medium-rise tenement buildings, high-risecomposite buildings and high-rise commercial buildings of various ages and design. Public and shopping and catering facilities suchas Urban Services Complex, shopping arcades and restaurants are readily available along Marble Road, Java Road and Kingâs Road.This section of Marble Road is the traditional market area of North Point.

In paragraph 7, he mentioned that according to the developer,the gross floor area of the Basement was 1,463.04 square metres or 15,748 square feet.

In his evidence in Court, Joseph Leung referred to his Worksheet which containeda list of seven comparables. Three of the comparables were Shops 2, 5 and 6 on the ground floor of the Building and the other fourwere small ground floor shops in Marble Road. The gross floor areas of Shops 2, 5 and 6 are respectively 188, 490 and 889 squarefeet. Though they are located in the Building, on the basis of the expert evidence which I accept, they cannot be regarded as similarcommercial premises in view of the great disparity in size.

and size and calculated an adjusted unit rate of $40,228 per square foot. He roundedthat up to $41,000 per square foot because he said he did not like the figure â40â and normally would not issue valuation reportusing â4â or â40â. This was extremely arbitrary, unscientific and bizarre to come from the mouth of a professional surveyorwhose duty was to give a fair open market value of the property he was instructed to survey on a professional basis. Then based ona saleable area of 11,388 square feet, he reached a valuation of $466,908,000 which he further rounded up to the nearest ten millioninstead of to the nearest million and reached a valuation of $470 million. This ultimate valuation also has a figure â4â.</p>    <p class="heading">The choice of comparables and the MTR effect</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>   Before dealing with the comparables, I shall first address Mr Laiâs opinion about the difference in value between ground floorand basement or podium floor by suggesting that there is no industry prescribed impediment and that such property all fall into onecategory. He says it is one manâs word against another on their respective subject views on the matter. He says the differenceis small on just one narrow point, but the mathematical consequence is tremendous. The crux of this case is the correctness of thechoice of comparables by Joseph Leung, Mr Tsang and Mr Cullen. Certainly, the wrong choice of comparables will lead to great disparityin valuation. That is a matter for the experts. Mr Laiâs view that the ground floor, basement or podium floor all fall into onecategory is contrary to those of Mr Cullenâs and are not even supported by Vigersâ expert. He is trespassing the territory whichbelongs exclusively to the experts. I reject his submission.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>   From the Cullen Reports, Lanbase Reports and Vigers Report, it can be seen that Mr Cullen, Mr Tsang and Joseph Leung all used thedirect comparison method in assessing the value of the Basement. Mr Cullen also used the capitalised rental income method to countercheckhis valuation. So did Joseph Leung, according to his evidence. Mr Tsang had no dispute that such countercheck was appropriate. Asexperts, Mr Cullen and Mr Tsang were in agreement that the direct comparison method is an appropriate method for assessing the valueof the Basement. Mr Cullen also used the reduced zoning method to question the correctness of Mr Tsangâs valuation. The applicabilityof the reduced zoning method to Hong Kong is criticised by Mr Lai. The expertsâ dispute is in respect of their choice of comparablesand the extent of the beneficial effect of the direct link to MTR North Point Station (âMTR Effectâ). They also differ as regardsthe adjustments to be made to the comparables. Mr Lai also challenged the applicability of the reduced zoning method.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>   It is the common opinion of Mr Cullen, Mr Tsang and Joseph Leung that the larger the floor area of the property, the lower is itsunit rate. Mr Cullen and Mr Tsang are in agreement that large commercial premises such as supermarkets, schools and churches commandlower unit rate than small Ginza style shops in a shopping arcade. Hence, it is Mr Cullenâs opinion that to value the Basementwhich has a saleable area of 11,388 square feet, it was necessary to look for transactions in commercial properties of comparablesize located in similar locations in North Point. I accept this as the proper professional practice in looking for comparables. Aslarge basements were not common in North Point and not frequently transacted, Mr Cullen turned to transactions of large podium levelfloors in North Point. He is of the opinion that podium floor properties being one level up from ground level offered the next mostappropriate properties for comparison with the Basement which is one level down from ground level. He concedes that adjustments shouldbe made for signage and visibility in addition to time lag, building age/condition, trading potential etc. Mr Tsang has no disputewith these broad principles in selection of comparables, but he rejects the comparables chosen by Mr Cullen.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>   Based on those principles, Mr Cullen chose (1) the entire 1<sup>st</sup> floor of the Building; (2) the entire 1<sup>st</sup> floor of Roca Centre; (3) the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor of Fortress Tower; and (4) the entire 1<sup>st</sup> floor of Tanner Garden as comparables. These were 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> floor commercial properties with a comparable floor plate of 7,534 to 15,672 square feet. I have been shown those four propertieson a site visit. I agree that the character of the environment of Fortress Tower and Tanner Garden was more residential and differentfrom that of the Building such that adjustments to be made to those comparables may not be meaningful. I ignore those two comparables.That said, it has little effect on Mr Cullenâs valuation because Mr Cullen gave a very low weighting to those two comparables andin any event the unit rate of those two comparables were within the range of the other two comparables chosen by Mr Cullen.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>   Mr Tsang criticises the use of the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of the Building as a comparable for two reasons. Firstly, the sale and purchase agreement of that property was executed on16 September 1997 which was after the date of the Vigers Report and such information was not available to Joseph Leung. Mr Cullenthought otherwise. He considers it the benefit of post valuation date analysis in that data after the valuation can be referred to.Though such data were not available to Joseph Leung at the time, they serve as a check whether a valuation made just prior to suchsale was out of line with the market reality. Of course, the non-availability of the data might have a bearing on my assessment asto whether the standard of care was properly discharged in the circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>   Secondly, Mr Tsang argues that the transaction was not a genuine transaction as it was subsequently cancelled and hence shouldnot be used as a comparable. Mr Cullenâs opinion is that the transaction was a genuine, though not a full or completed transaction.Indeed, the courts have seen many armâs length transactions agreed just prior to the property market crash in October to November1997 were subsequently cancelled because buyers were desperate to exit unprofitable acquisitions. Excuses based on defective titlewere often successfully argued to avoid an otherwise valid and binding sale and purchase agreement. As the documents show, the buyersought extension of time to complete and eventually forfeited $9 million in having the sale and purchase agreement cancelled. Thatwas a genuine transaction. The price was reached at armâs length based on the then market condition. I agree with Mr Cullen thathad the property market not collapsed towards the end of 1997, that transaction would have in all likelihood been completed and thattransaction was a reliable indicator of pre-crash price and had factored in âfrothy pricesâ in a speculative market in the thirdquarter of 1997. The 1<sup>st</sup> floor of the same Building which was comparable in size to the Basement and was of same user makes it an excellent reality checkpiece of evidence. It was the most appropriate comparable to be used in valuing the Basement.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>   The second comparable chosen by Mr Cullen was the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of Roca Centre which was at the junction of Kingâs Road with Shu Kuk Street. It was located at a comparable location oneblock south of the Building. Unlike the Building, Roca Centre was a composite building with residential towers over a commercialpodium. The current user of the 1<sup>st</sup> floor is a restaurant. It has a saleable area of 12,402 square feet which is nearly the same as the Basement. It has escalator accessfrom the main entrance of the shopping arcade at ground level just beside a main MTR exit. It was ten years older than the Building.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>   Mr Tsang considers Roca Centre as not a suitable comparable for two reasons. Firstly, he considers the character of the area inwhich Roca Centre is located different from that of the Building. He argues that the Building is located close to a wet market inJava Road and fixed pitch stalls on Marble Road where people would carry out their daily shopping activities whereas the localitywhere Roca Centre is located is occupied by restaurants and banks. I have visited Roca Centre and the Building. By the age and lookof the buildings thereat, the two locations do not appear to me to be any different now from 1997, except that the nearby North PointEstate had been demolished. I agree with Mr Cullen that in every respect, the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of Roca Centre is in a superior position than the Basement. It has access via a pair of escalator located at the main entranceof the building just opposite the pedestrian crossing. It has open visibility and good accessibility. The 1<sup>st</sup> floor, whether used as a restaurant as it now is, or as a small shopping arcade as the Basement was intended to be, is simply invitingto pedestrians. The fact that Roca Centre is located among other restaurants and banks means the pedestrian traffic there is heavierthan that at the Building. The 1<sup>st</sup> floor of Roca Centre has a notably superior trading potential. Mr Tsangâs argument is very strained and his opinion lacks logic.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>   In line with Mr Tsangâs opinion, Mr Lai suggests that the Building is a very high class commercial building and a promise ofthe future while Roca Centre is something of the past. He argues that purchasers of units in the Building are buying a dream. AsMr Cullen rightly points out, that suggestion is just marketing gimmicks and glamour of the sales brochure. The brochure depictedthe shopping area of the Building as a high class shopping arcade with a bank, motor car show room and boutique shops. The prudentpurchasers should take a cold hard look at the Building, its vicinity and the market. This is more all the so for the professionalproperty valuer. The Building is a small building with seven small shop spaces on the ground level, another seven shop spaces onthe 1<sup>st</sup> floor and the Basement. The total saleable area is not more than 30,000 square feet. The Building is located in an old area witha wet market nearby and fixed pitch stalls opposite. As was revealed during the site visit, the shopping arcade can only serve asa community shopping area and not a high class shopping arcade selling brand name goods. Not only is the character of the Buildingand its neighbourhood not substantially superior to that of Roca Centre as to render the latter unsuitable as a comparable, the characterof Roca Centre and its neighbourhood is actually more superior and has a higher trading potential. A property valuer should takea cool, hard look at the Building and its neighbourhood. The size of the shopping area in the Building is not capable of supportingthe picture depicted in the brochure. If his client wants to buy a dream, he should remind his client of the bed he is sleeping on.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>   Mr Lai argues that the upper floors in the Building are office floors like Pacific Place whereas those in Roca Centre are residentialand as such is unsuitable as a comparable. He suggests that high profile office employees would buy brand name goods in the Buildingand that would enhance the value of the Basement. With respect to counsel, it is a gross exaggeration to compare the Building inNorth Point in its particular neighbourhood as I have described in the above paragraph with Pacific Place in prime central. The Building,the smallness of its shopping area and its neighbourhood is not capable of attracting retailers of brand name goods. As Mr Cullenpoints out, office occupants do not flood downstairs everyday in Pacific Place to buy brand name goods. The big spenders in the shoppingarcade in Pacific Place are the constant flow of tourists from the nearby five star hotels. I do not think those tourists would goto shop in the Building with no more than 30,000 square feet of shopping area and no other attractions nearby. The real thing a valuershould look for in a comparable is similarity in shopping potential. The shopping potential of Roca Centre with residential unitsabove and that of the Building with office above are within comparable range.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>   Mr Lai points to the lack of public parking in Roca Centre and argues that within the neighbourhood hourly public parking is onlyavailable in the Building which enhances its value. Such argument is absolutely misleading. The three floors of parking space weresold to the Plaintiffs. The parking spaces were owner-occupied and not available for public parking. In any event, there were onlytwenty-seven car parking spaces and five lorry parking spaces. The parking facility argument is just a non-point. I do not thinkRoca Centre fails to be a suitable comparable for any of the reasons given by Mr Lai.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>   Furthermore, Mr Tsang argues that as ground floor comparables within the Building are available, Roca Centre is not a suitablecomparable. The ground floor comparables suggested by Mr Tsang are Shops 2, 5 and 6 of the Building, which are the very comparableswhich he and Joseph Leung used in their valuations. These are small shops of 186, 491 and 885 square feet in area. I shall now turnto examine Mr Tsangâs comparables.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>   A general point to note is that Mr Tsang does not dispute that smaller shops command higher unit rates. The Basement is of a saleablearea of 11,388 square feet. Using the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of Roca Centre with a similarly large floor plate as a comparable is far more reliable than using any small shop spaces of1.63% to 7.77% of the saleable area of the Basement. In <i>Hsin Kuang Restaurant (Holdings) Limited and</i> <i>Commissioner of Rating and Valuation</i> LDRA 52 of 1997, it was held that it was inappropriate to use a property of 181.4 square metres as a comparable in valuing a propertyof 4,000 square metres, i.e. less than 4.5% in area. To use the unit rate in transactions of properties which are not comparablein size to the Basement as comparables and then inflate it by size adjustment is just like asking blind men to feel parts of an elephantand then to imagine what an elephant is. Depending on where the blind men feel, they may come up with different ideas of what anelephant is. Another way to describe the anomaly is to ask someone to compare a cat with a tiger and then by adjustment to blow acat up into a super tiger.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>   Shop 2 has a saleable area of 186 square feet. It is the smallest shop in the ground floor of the Building. Shop 5 has a saleablearea of 491 square feet. Both shops fall outside the size range as comparable for the Basement of 11,388 square feet which is 61times larger than Shop 2 and 23 times larger than Shop 5. Size alone makes them unsuitable as comparables.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>   All the three shops are located at street level with open visibility and accessibility. Shop 2 has an extremely good frontage.It is located at the corner and entrance of the Building at Shu Kuk Street. It is open to Marble Road, Shu Kuk Street and to theinside of the arcade. It is an indisputable fact that corner shops command higher unit rate. Shop 5 has external frontage to MarbleRoad and an internal frontage to the arcade. It has good visibility and accessibility. Shop 6 has external frontage to Marble Roadbut no internal frontage. It has good visibility and accessibility though inferior to those of Shop 2 and Shop 5. However, the Basementis located one level below street level. Practically, it has no visibility, except to MTR passengers who use Exit A4.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>   Mr Tsang tries to off set the drawback of the Basement by arguing on the MTR Effect. Joseph Leung also emphasised heavily on thebenefit of the direct link to MTR entrance in the Vigers Report. He said in his evidence that the direct link to MTR was a very uniquefeature and advantage of the Basement. He equated the Basement with Prudential Centre in Jordan district and said that the link toMTR had a very positive impact on pedestrian flow and rental income. He argued that the neighbourhood in which the Basement and PrudentialCentre are located are very similar, namely old mixed commercial and residential area. He said that because of the MTR linkage, theaccessibility of the Basement was not limited to the neighbourhood of Marble Road but was open to a wide MTR network, though he concededthat the Basement was a little less desirable than Prudential Centre. Mr Tsang is supportive of that opinion. He even goes furtherto argue that any shop inside an MTR station is linked to the pedestrians in all MTR stations in Hong Kong. He advanced three furtherreasons for the benefit of the MTR linkage. The pedestrians in an MTR station are weather protected. They can shop comfortably inair conditioned environment. They enjoy a feeling of safety and security. He argues that for these reasons, Roca Centre is inferiorto the Basement as the pedestrians are exposed to rain, sunshine or storm. He quotes the views of an estate agent about the benefitoflow pedestrian flow in the Basement. That estate agentâs view was that the Basement can serve as a specialty centre for sellingwomen underwear as the shops were unexposed but easy to find. Women would not miss the Basement if told to exit from Exit A4 in MTRNorth Point Station.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>   I agree with Mr Cullenâs opinion that it is inappropriate to compare the Basement with Prudential Centre. The localities aredistinctly different. Prudential Centre is situated on Nathan Road in Jordan area which is a very busy commercial and shopping areain Kowloon frequented by locals and tourists. There are a few small hotels nearby and many more larger five star hotels to the southof Nathan Road which supply a continuous flow of tourists. There are large shopping centres, restaurants, theatres nearby which attractshoppers from all over Hong Kong and Kowloon. Apart from the older residential and commercial buildings on the western side of NathanRoad which Mr Tsang and Mr Lai rely on as being similar in character to neighbourhood of the Building, there are many and more luxurioushousing developments on the eastern side, even back in 1997. Undoubtedly, the spending power of the residents in that part of Jordanis far higher than those in Marble Road. Marble Road is in a much quieter neighbourhood near a wet market and fixed pitch stalls.It is not frequented by tourists. There are no hotels nearby, not to mention five star hotels. The neighbourhood is more residentialthan commercial.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>   Mr Lai paints a very busy picture of the then neighbourhood with the then existing North Point Estate, the North Point/KowloonCity Ferry and bus terminus. He suggests that Mr Cullen might have been misguided when making a valuation of the Basement in 2003in a much quieter environment after the demolition of the North Point Estate and closure of the ferry and bus terminus. Even then,I do not think the locality is as vibrant as or a near comparable to Jordan district where Prudential Centre is situated. Furthermore,as Mr Cullen rightly points out, his valuation was based on actual transactions at a time very close to 9 May 1997. The North PointEstate and everything else which Mr Lai considers relevant were <i>in</i> <i>situ</i> at the time of the comparable transactions. I do not think Mr Cullen could have erred.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>   The MTR Jordan Station is one of the busiest and largest stations to which the North Point Station is hardly comparable. The pedestrianflow is certainly much heavier than in MTR North Point Station. The exit to Prudential Centre is far wider that Exit A4 to the Basement.More strikingly and importantly, the exit opens right into the heart of Prudential Centre with a system of escalators leading tofour floors of shopping area which makes it necessary for pedestrians to walk round the arcade before exiting the building.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>   On the contrary, the entrance to the Basement even within the Building is inconspicuous. Accessibility is poor. The escalator islocated in such a position that pedestrians travelling from ground level to the MTR station have to walk one-third inside the Buildingand turn back to take the escalator down to the Basement which delivers the pedestrians almost right to the MTR entrance, by-passingthe entrance to the Basement. Similarly, pedestrians exiting the MTR station going to ground level are drawn to the escalator goingup to ground level on their right without noticing the Basement on their left. The Basement is unlikely to be frequented by the casualpedestrians on Shu Kuk Street or Marble Road but only by the destination shoppers who know of the Basement and have a purpose togo to there. As admitted by Mr Tsang, many of the pedestrians on Marble Road are people buying in the wet market nearby or the fixedpitch stalls opposite the Building. They are a different kind of shoppers from those visiting Prudential Centre.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>   Mr Lai tries to paint a picture about shoppers visiting from the Peak or mid-level in North Point driving to shop in this stateof the art Building in North Point in their motor cars. There is a sauna house of 7,534 square feet saleable area on the 1<sup>st</sup> floor, seven shops of, say similar area on the ground floor of the Building and 11,388 square feet shopping area in the Basement.Even assuming there were seven retail shops on the 1<sup>st</sup> floor instead of one sauna as originally designed, the shopping area in the Building including the Basement is very small. On a visualimpression of the plan of Prudential Centre and the Building as well as the visual impression gained during the site visit, the shoppingarea in Prudential Centre is many times that of the Building. Such a small shopping area in the Building cannot attract shoppersof great spending power. There are only twenty-seven car parking spaces in the Building and they were all owner occupied. There areno convenient public parking nearby. The shopping facilities which the Building can offer are much inferior than that suggested byMr Lai. The Building is nothing like Pacific Place or Elements where there are many floors of luxurious shoppingspaces, fine dinning,a theatre and entertainment facilities. The shopping areas are tens or even a hundred times bigger than that in the Building andthere are free parking facilities for a modest purchase. The very vibrant picture of the Building painted by Mr Lai is illusory.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>   Mr Tsangâs contrary view that the low pedestrian flow of the Basement is an asset is no better. He commended to the Court thatthe Basement can be used a specialist centre for selling women underwear. The Basement had been operated as a stamp centre but failed,presumably because of its quietness, poor visibility and inaccessibility. Joseph Leung argued that it failed because of poor management,but there is no evidence in support of that assertion. As for Mr Tsangâs opinion, I do not think women, these days, act discretelywhen they go to purchase underwear or lingerie. Advertisements for such items can be seen openly almost anywhere in bill boards,MTR stations, trains, trams, shopping centres, etc. Women purchase these items openly in large department stores and shops in luxuriousshopping arcades. If womenâs purchasing behaviour for those items are so discrete, the lingerie business could not have thrivedso well in those expensive and luxurious shopping arcades. I think the estate agentâs opinion is wholly nonsense. That view wouldhave been dismissed by any reasonable man who has walked any large department store or any luxurious shopping arcade with open eyes.It is a surprise that an expert whose duty is to assist the Court would have so thoughtlessly commended to the Court such an nonsensicalview of an estate agent, whose business is to market properties. I note incidentally that Lanbase Surveyors Limited also operatesan estate agent business.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>   Mr Tsangâs argument on MTR Effect is a whole load of non-sense. He has clearly demonstrated himself to be an advocate doing hisbest to advance his clientâs case rather than as an expert assisting the Court with unbiased professional opinion. The MTR Effectproffered by Mr Tsang and Mr Lai is non-existing in the Basement. The Basement is nothing like the Prudential Centre. The immediateneighbourhood of Prudential Centre is significantly different by a wide margin from that of the Building as to render it unsuitableto be a comparable.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>   It is just common knowledge that ground floor shops command a much higher value than basement shops or podium shops. In CullenReport II, Mr Cullen produced sales data of ground floor units and basement units in President Shopping Centre in Causeway Bay andSino Centre in Nathan Road in Mongkok, which showed that basement value is only 25% and 28% respectively of ground floor value. Inother words, if a ground floor shop is used as comparable, an adjustment of minus 75% is called for. In <i>Ngai Kai Suen v Director of Lands</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%20HKDCLR%20123" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] HKDCLR 123</a>, Judge Cruden held that a plus 100% adjustment to the unit rate in a basement transaction to assess the unit rate of a street levelshop is unsuitable. The reverse is equally true. A minus 50% adjustment to the unit rate in a street level shop to assess the unitrate of a basement is also unsuitable. An adjustment of that magnitude is a very telling sign that comparable is not a suitable comparable,not to say an adjustment of minus 75%. Mr Tsangâs insistence that the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of the Building is not a suitable comparable and his insistence to use small street facing shops in the Building as comparablesfor the Basement with no frontage is just absurd.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>   Mr Tsangâs rejection of the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of Roca Centre as a comparable also lacks logical basis. Such opinion is unreasonable and cannot withstand logical analysis.His choice of comparables and his stubborn insistence on their suitability as comparables simply demonstrates his lack of impartialityas an expert. He is trying to justify the use of the transactions of Shops 2, 5 and 6 which are small shop spaces and commandinga higher unit rate so as to inflate the valuation of the Basement. I consider his choice of using Shops 2, 5 and 6 as comparablesis his own personal opinion and not the opinion of any body of the surveying profession. Clearly, Mr Tsang is trying to advance hisclientâs case than assisting the Court. For the fundamental differences I have referred to above, it is unrealistic to use streetlevel shops as comparables for a large inaccessible Basement. Though Mr Tsang made adjustments to the unit rate of his comparables,adjustments to the unit rate of a street level shop for the purpose of assessing the unit rate of the Basement is both difficultand unrealistic. I accept Mr Cullenâs choice of comparables and reject Mr Tsangâs.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>   I now turn to the other comparables which Joseph Leung used in arriving at the valuation. They were all very small ground floorshops on Marble Road with sizes ranging from 70 square feet to 625 square feet. The unadjusted unit rates range from $23,360 to $69,047per square foot. For reasons which should by now be manifestly clear, these comparables were not suitable.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>   The basic principle of valuation in the direct comparison method is to compare like with like. I accept Mr Cullenâs evidencethat the practice of the profession in looking for comparables is to look for transactions in properties of a similar nature, withinthe same size range, with a similar neighbourhood and in a similar location. I accept Mr Cullenâs opinion that the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of the Building and 1<sup>st</sup> floor of Roca Centre are suitable comparables. I reject Mr Tsangâs opinion that Shops 2, 5 and 6 on the ground floor of the Buildingare suitable comparables. Ground floor shops cannot be compared with basement shops. The adjustment allowed by Mr Tsang is utterlyinadequate. An adjustment of up to minus 75% as demonstrated by proven data produced by Mr Cullen may be appropriate. But even then,an adjustment up to that magnitude simply tells that the adjustment is meaningless and the property is just not a suitable comparablefor the other. I reject Mr Tsangâs opinion as his own personal and biased opinion which is demonstrably wrong. It does not representthe opinion of a responsible body of the profession.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>   As a concluding remark to the opening paragraph in this section, Mr Lai is right in one sense. If the comparables are wrongly chosenas a matter of principle, the divergence in valuation is bound to be great, as in this case. If one boards the train from the wrongplatform in MTR North Point Station, one finds oneself in the Hong Kong International Airport, instead of Chai Wan where one is destinedto. Hence, we have the divergence in valuation by Mr Cullen on the one hand and Mr Tsang and Joseph Leung on the other.</p>    <p class="heading">The adjustment</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>   Before dealing with adjustments, I shall first address Mr Laiâs opinion that time lag indices, whether government or privatesector always fall behind real market movements with time delay running up to three months and beyond. He says that given this perpetualchase of analysis data after empirical field transactions, the index believers are likely to see these price trend setters at themoment of their transactions as crazy and going beyond the charted range of rational behaviour. He therefore considers time adjustmentfutile. He argues that understanding the limitation of indices leads to appreciation of the benefit of looking at contemporary orâreal timeâ comparisons which are far more reliable than retrospective time indexing. He criticised Mr Cullen as not being ableto feel the market heat as did the Midland and Richard Ellis teams. With respect to Mr Lai, there is no evidence about inordinatedelay in registering sale and purchase transactions. Usually, because of the risk of loss of priority caused by delay in registration,the absolute majority of transactions are registered within one month. Such time lag within a month does not support the scenariopainted by Mr Lai. Any delay beyond one month must be rare and exceptional. I reject the valuations contained in Midland Report andRichard Ellis Report not because of Mr Cullenâs or the Courtâs failure to have regard to market heat or market atmosphere butbecause of the total absence of information about the basis of the valuation and the comparables used in those reports. Besides,as Mr Cullen points out, his valuation was based on actual transactions at a time very close to 9 May 1997 and adequately adjustedaccording to JLW Index. Actual transaction price is a function of all relevant factors including market heat or the uncharted rangeof irrational behaviour. Again, Mr Lai is trespassing the expertâs arena. I reject his argument.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>   There is no dispute that adjustments are necessary to comparable transactions to allow for time lag, location/trading potential,size, signage/visibility, accessibility, and age/condition of the Building. These factors may be combined and called differentlyby different experts, but adjustments are necessary. In respect of adjustment for time lag, the JLW Index is generally accepted bythe profession. Mr Lai argues that there is a time lag between a sale and purchase transaction and its registration in the Land Registryfrom which the statistics are made. I think the difference caused by the time lag is insignificant unless at around 9 May 1997 therewas a sudden change in market condition. That was not the case. According to the JLW Index, the market was very buoyant up to thethird quarter of 1997. Mr Lai next argues that the JLW Index is not sufficiently categorised into districts and there is no separateindex for North Point. Be that as it may, the JLW Index is probably the best the profession has and the parties have to live withit. In respect of other adjustments, they are subjective and intuitive, based on the views and experience of the valuer.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>   As the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of the Building is within the Building itself, Mr Cullen made no adjustment for location/trading potential and age/conditionof the building. He gave an allowance of minus 15% for time lag in accordance with the JLW Index as the transaction was made whilethe market was still on the rise. He gave an allowance of minus 5% due to the smaller size and minus 5% for the better signage/visibilityof the comparable. He gave another allowance of plus 10% for accessibility including the MTR. The total adjustment is therefore minus15%. Based on the unit rate of $12,347 per square foot saleable area, he calculated the adjusted unit rate to be $10,495 per squarefoot as at 9 May 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>   As the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of Roca Centre is at a distance away from the Basement and on a better location, adjustments are necessary for all the factors.Because the transaction was a year earlier, he added 16.8% to the unit rate. Because the accessibility of the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of Roca Centre is not as convenient as that of the Basement and the building is ten years older than the Basement, he allowedanother plus 10% and plus 15% respectively. He gave an allowance of minus 8.5% for the better location/trading potential and minus5% for signage/visibility of the comparable. The total adjustment is therefore plus 28.3%. Based on the unit rate of $6,529 per squarefoot saleable area, he calculated the adjusted unit rate to be $8,377 per square foot as at 9 May 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>   Mr Cullen gave a weighting factor of 5 to the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of the Building and 3 to the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of Roca Centre. He also gave a weighting factor of 1 to the other two comparables which I excluded. I do not intend to adjustthe weighting factor as a result of my exclusion of the other two comparables. So adopting a total weighting factor of 8 insteadof 10, I calculate the weighted unit rate to be $9,700 per square foot, which is $200 higher than Mr Cullenâs valuation. Accordingly,the open market value of the Basement as at 9 May 1997 was $110,463,600 or say $110.5 million. I prefer to round up to the nearest$100,000. This valuation is $2.5 million higher than Mr Cullenâs. It is within 5% of Mr Cullenâs valuation by rental capitalisationmethod. I find the true open market value of the Basement as at 9 May 1997 to be $110.5 million.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>   Having rejected Shops 2, 5 and 6 as suitable comparables, it would be unnecessary to consider the adjustments Mr Tsang made tothose comparables. I shall, however, briefly demonstrate that his adjustments are also inadequate. Mr Tsang argues that the differencebetween the lower ground floor and the 2<sup>nd</sup> basement of Prudential Centre is that the former has both street frontage and MTR access whereas the latter has only MTR access.Based on the difference in rateable value of the two floors of 35%, he argues that street frontage adjustment for a shop with MTRaccess is minus 35%. He also allowed size adjustments of minus 15% for Shop 2 and minus 10% for Shops 5 and 6. Thus the total adjustmentin respect of these two items for Shop 2 is minus 50% and that for Shops 5 and 6 is minus 45%.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>   Mr Cullen argues that the lower ground floor of Prudential Centre is in fact half a level below street level such that the valueof its street frontage is substantially reduced. I agree. Pedestrians along Nathan Road would only have a partial view of the shopfrom above instead of a direct front view. Thus 35% adjustment is not adequate. By reference to his data from President ShoppingCentre, Mr Cullen argues that the adjustment should have been minus 72% to minus 75%. He then cross referenced this adjustment byusing the reduced zoning method. He argues that the Basement with an area of 11,388 square feet is mainly comparable to the leastvaluable Zone C area of shops. Based on the reduced zoning method of analysis, Zone C shop value is only 25% that of Zone A. Sincethese Shops 2, 5 and 6 are 1.63% to 7.77% the size of the Basement, they must all be within the most valuable Zone A area and thatthe Basement be within Zone C. Hence, the adjustment should also be 75%.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>   Mr Lai submits that the reduce zoning method which originated in the United Kingdom where the shops are rectangular in shape witha relatively small frontage and greater depth is inapplicable in Hong Kong and has been rejected by the Lands Tribunal. Whether thereduced zoning method is applicable to Hong Kong is not necessary for my decision because Mr Cullenâs data from President ShoppingCentre and Sino Centre are sufficient to prove Mr Tsangâs adjustment inadequate. The reduced zoning method was referred to by MrCullen not for the purpose of giving a valuation to the Basement but for the purpose of showing Mr Tsangâs adjustment is inadequate.Thus, this is not a suitable occasion for arguing whether the method is applicable to Hong Kong. I shall deal with counselâs submissionvery briefly, but whatever view I express is bound to be <i>obiter</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>   Mr Lai cited six authorities in support of his proposition that the reduced zoning method is not applicable in Hong Kong. I shallexamine those authorities in chronological order.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>   Mr Cullen was the expert witness in <i>Secretary for the New Territories v Lee Pui Leung</i> LDLR 1 of 1981, [1982] HKDCL5. In accepting the reduced zoning method submitted by Mr Cullen, the Lands Tribunal said that it didso because the method was not seriously challenged. The Tribunal also referred to <i>Man On Land Investment Co Ltd v Director of Public</i> <i>Works</i> [1977] HKLTR 4 at 7 in which the Tribunal commented that it did not consider the reduced zoning method easily applicable to HongKong conditions especially in the case of the smaller shops. Thus, the method was actually accepted though the Tribunal doubted itsapplicability to smaller shops. The method was not accepted in the other decisions which followed.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>   In <i>Ngai Kai-suen v Director of Lands</i>, Judge Cruden rejected the reduced zoning method and said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe affirm that the amount of frontage is a very important factor to take into account in valuing a shop. There are a number ofdifferent methods of valuing shops. One of the better methods is based on directly taking frontage into account. When the Tribunalmentioned this as a preferred alternative, Mr Chan responded that perhaps he should have used a zoning method. We disagree. Zoningdoes recognise the higher value of a shop frontage. However, dividing areas towards the rear into zones, in an attempt to determinetheir lesser value, is unnecessarily arbitrary and can often be inaccurate.</p>        <p class="quote">The better approach is simply to value on a unit per metre frontage basis, provided the depths of the comparables, are similar tothe subject property. Any small variation in depth can be allowed for by way of a percentage or factor allowance. For example, thesubject property is roughly 10 metres deep. If it is compared with shops of the same or very similar depths, the rate per metre frontage,can be compared directly rather than the rate per square metre area.</p>        <p class="quote">Where the depths to be compared are more varied, Dept Tables have elsewhere been devised, to allow for these larger differences. However,before being adapted to Hong Kong or other localities, they would have to be compared to the current local market, to ensure thatthey are appropriate for local circumstances. Where they are applicable, variations for depth are made by applying factors appropriateto the depths more or less than the standard. As depths increase, the fact that proportionate value decreases, is provided for bythe application of the factor appropriate to the particular depth, until the point is reached where extra depths adds no value. Althoughfrontage was very much in issue, neither valuer used this method, so we are unable to consider its application in the present proceedings.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The Tribunal refused to adopt the reduced zoning method and commented that an adjustment of plus 100% for a basement shop for frontageemphasised the unsuitability of the method. This is the case in which the method was severely criticised. Despite that the Tribunalrecognised in the last paragraph quoted above the importance of frontage, the fact that as depths increases the value decreases andthe possible use of Depth Tables. Mr Sarony SC submits that in the last paragraph above the Tribunal effectively endorsed the reducedzoning approach. I do not agree. The Tribunal only recognised that Depth Tables might be used if it is satisfied that they are appropriatefor the local circumstances. Their appropriateness remains to be proved. Nevertheless, I am unable to read from the above dicta thatthe reduced zoning method was expressly rejected as not being applicable to Hong Kong. It was not adopted because better direct comparableswere available. That in fact is the sentiment of the Tribunal as expressed in later decisions.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>   In <i>Rand Company Limited and The Director of Lands</i> LDLR 7 of 2001, after reviewing <i>Man On Land Investment Co Ltd, Lee Pui Leung and Ngai Kai-suen v Director of Lands</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%20HKDCLR%20123" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] HKDCLR 123</a>, Deputy Judge Wong held at paragraph 25:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ We also hold that the previous observations and decisions of the Tribunal on the applicability of the zoning method in thecited cases are still relevant today.

Instead, he used the more common average unit rate methodin this valuation.</p>        <p class="quote">I agree with the opinion of RW in the drawback of using the Reduced Zoning Method. Besides, â¦ the remaining 11 comparables are offairly similar size. With the exception of RC4 and RC11, they actually range in area of between 32.87 m and 51.37 m. I have checkedthe layout plans produced by RW and find that most of them are of fairly regular shape too. To conclude, I decide in favour of theRespondent.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Again, the reduced zoning method was not adopted in this case where comparables of fairly regular shape were available.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>   Despite the rather flimsy circumstances under which the reduced zoning method was adopted by the Tribunal in <i>Lee Pui Leung</i>, from the authorities cited above it appears that the method has long been recognised by the profession. It was not accepted in manyof the authorities cited by Mr Lai not because it was found to be inapplicable to Hong Kong conditions but because it was not suitablein the factual circumstances of the case as better comparables were available. So long as suitable comparables are available, theymust be the best evidence of value and direct comparison method using unit rate should be preferred. This is just common sense. Thereduced zoning method is arbitrary. But in the absence of truly suitable comparables, the reduced zoning method does not cease tobe a useful means of analysis. It is useful for shops of irregular shape and greater depths. As demonstrated by Mr Cullen, so longas the same depth for Zone A is adopted for all the comparables, the result would be reasonably consistent.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>   Turning back to the present case. I do share the sentiments of Judge Cruden in <i>Ngai Kai Suen</i> that a basement shop was not a suitable comparable for a street level shop and vice versa. The value of the street level shops andbasement shops in President Shopping Centre and in Sino Centre demonstrate the adjustment should be in the range of minus 72% tominus 75%. Those real data support Mr Cullenâs opinion that if the very small street level shops of Shops 2, 5 and 6 are used ascomparables, the very large Basement falls within Zone C under the reduced zoning method. Besides, an adjustment of that magnitudeis a very telling sign that the comparable is not a suitable comparable. Accordingly, Mr Tsangâs adjustments must be rejected.That said, this is nevertheless not an appropriate occasion to determine whether the reduced zoning method is applicable to HongKong conditions.</p>    <p class="heading">Whether the Vigers Report was negligently prepared</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>   On the basis of expert evidence, I reach the conclusion that the open market value of the Basement as at 9 May 1997 was $110.5million. Vigersâ valuation of $470 million was 4.25 times the true open market value. On any objective criteria, there is no needto consider whether it was outside the permissible bracket. It clearly was. The valuation was so bizarre, so glaringly sub-standardand so disproportionate that negligence can be readily inferred. I shall nevertheless turn to examine the Vigers Report in greaterdetail.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>   On the format, Mr Tsang opined that the format of the Vigers Report was reasonable and acceptable. He said that there is no particularrequirement from the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors or the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Hong Kong Branch) that comparablesand comparable analysis must be included in the report. The common practice is not to include comparables unless specifically requestedby the instructing client. He also referred to the absence of such in the Midland Report, the Richard Ellis Report and the modelreport adopted by the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Hong Kong Branch). Mr Cullenagrees that there is no requirement for residential property but points out that for valuation of this size, it is unusual not toquote the comparables and that he had not seen a valuation of a large basement which did not quote the evidence on which the valuationwas based. A property even of a valuation of $110.5 million is a significant investment, not to mention a property with a valuationof $470 million as suggested by Vigers. Though no comparables or analysis were indicated in the model report, the model report isprobably for general application and not intended for a valuation of property of substantial value. It is not just a matter of commonsense but sense of responsibility of a person practising a profession. Indeed in <i>Menno Leendert Vos and Global Fair Industrial Limited and others</i> HCA 4200/1995, Vigers prepared a valuation report under its reference NL/jc/V63512-93 dated 11 September 1993, which quoted the saleablearea and comparables used in valuing a small commercial property of $3.4 million. In many other company winding-up cases, I havealso seen valuation reports prepared by reputable surveyors quoting comparables even for commercial properties valued much lower.I think the comparables were produced not at the specific instruction of lay clients as Mr Tsang suggests, but as the professionâsstandard of good practice in valuing at least commercial properties of substantial value. In any event, for a valuation of $470 millionin 1997, a responsible valuer must inform his client the basis on which the valuation was reached, so that the lay client knows thebasis of the professional opinion and the extent of his risk in acting on that opinion. I concur with Mr Cullenâs opinion as representingthe standard and practice of the profession. Vigers fell short of that standard.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>   The saleable area was not stated in the Vigers Report. Mr Tsang opines that that was not strictly necessary. Mr Tsangâs LanbaseReport I also quoted the saleable area. The Richard Ellis Report also took care to quote the net area. In the model report, bothgross floor area and saleable floor area are shown. This is clear evidence of professional practice. Joseph Leung or his colleagueshad calculated the saleable area which was exactly the same as that given in the sale and purchase agreement. Joseph Leung said hewould not quote the figure because he could not be sure if it is correct. He rejected counselâs suggestion of quoting the figurewith a rider that it is subject to confirmation. On the other hand, contrary to what he said, Joseph Leung quoted the saleable areain the Vigers Valuation Letter. Even Mr Tsang admits that saleable area is the most important factor to determine value. Withoutsuch datum, the client may not have a clear appreciation of what he was bargaining for.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>   Mr Sarony SC criticises Joseph Leung for just lifting information from the developerâs brochure and assumed that the informationwas correct. Both Mr Sarony SC and Mr Cullen criticise Mr Joseph Leung for making a valuation without even inspecting the Basement.For a building in progress, some assumptions, such as the standard of the finishes and the materials to be used would have to bemade. However, Joseph Leungâs evidence is that he made generous assumptions. He assumed that the escalators would be installedin such a way as to direct the pedestrian flow to the Basement and if not an extra pair would be installed by the developer. He saidhe could not read from the plans how the pedestrians would be delivered by the escalators. I do not agree. The drawings show thatthe up and down escalators would be aligned together to operate in different directions. This together with the vertical cross sectiondrawing made it clear that pedestrians would be diverted away from the Basement. My laymanâs view may have been assisted by hindsightand the benefit of a site visit, but as a professional Joseph Leung ought to have known. Joseph Leung said he did not go inside theBasement to make an on-site inspection because it would create difficulties. He made the decision not to inspect even without askingthe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant for permission to inspect. As Mr Cullen said, he should have put on the helmet and went inside. I agree. In view of thesize of the valuation he reached, he should have made an on-site inspection to verify his valuation.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>   While he placed strong emphasis on the benefit of the MTR link, not only did he not do any pedestrian flow analysis, he did noteven visit the MTR North Point Station when he inspected the Building. Had he gone inside, he would have realized MTR North PointStation is very much different from MTR Jordan Station and that the Basement could not be compared to Prudential Centre. The verywild assumptions he made showed the total lack of care in making the valuation.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>   Joseph Leung wrongly chose small street level shops with good visibility and accessibility as comparables to value this large undergroundBasement. His choice of comparables, if not deliberately made in bad faith, is basically and manifestly wrong for three reasons.Firstly, it is wrong to use small shops as comparables for a large basement. He should use shops with a floor plate which is withinthe range as comparable. Secondly, he should not use street level shops as comparables. As shown in Cullen Report II, basement shopsusually have a value of between 25% to 28% of street level shops. This is a well-recognised fact known even to the layman, not tomention the professional. Thirdly, instead of making a minus 75% adjustment which would have been appropriate, he only made an adjustmentof minus 15% by relying on the MTR Effect. I have found that the MTR Effect is practically non-existent in the Basement. His opinionwas based on his comparing the Basement with Prudential Centre. Again, if that was not a comparable chosen in bad faith, it was anegligent choice. For reasons as I have explained earlier, the Basement is nothing near to Prudential Centre. Joseph Leung claimedin the report that he has âanalysed sales transactions of similar commercial premises in the subject building and North Pointâ.As I have already pointed out, this is a misleading statement and reflects his grossly negligent approach in making the valuation.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>   The comparables chosen by Joseph Leung were inappropriate. In defending his choice of small street level shops as comparables,he said he assumed that the purchaser would do what is best in his interest and to develop the Basement into Ginza style shoppingarcade. Again that was a wild assumption. He did not even ask the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant or the Plaintiffs if that was the intention of the Plaintiffs; nor did he disclose in the Vigers Report that the valuationwas on the basis that the Basement would be converted into a Ginza style shopping arcade. His choice of comparables was clearly negligent.If that choice was based on the assumptions, he was reckless.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>   At the time Joseph Leung made the valuation, he did not have the benefit of the transaction data of the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of the Building. The transaction information about the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of Roca Centre was available to him. But he chose to use those seven small street level shops with good visibility and accessibilityas comparables for the underground Basement. It is his wrong choice of comparables and insufficient adjustments which led to thegrossly wrong valuation. This is what this case is all about. On the basis of the valuation, a conclusion could safely be drawn thatJoseph Leung was negligent in his valuation of the Basement.</p>    <p class="heading">Fixing the valuation</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>   The Plaintiffsâ case in the big picture is that there was a conspiracy among some or all the Defendants, except Vigers, to disposeof chunks of the uncompleted Building to the Plaintiffs by a series of transactions so as to cash strip the Plaintiffs in excessof $1 billion in favour of the Defendants. In the narrow picture, part of that design involved the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant causing Joseph Leung of Vigers to value the Basement at $470 million, i.e. to fix the valuation of the Basement. The thrustof the Plaintiffsâ case against Vigers is that the valuation was fixed before the transaction was made. Joseph Leung could nothave reached a valuation which coincidentally was identical to the transaction price unless there was an agreement between him andthe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to fix the valuation. Mr Sarony SC relied on the evidence of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant as supported by the inferences to be drawn from Joseph Leungâs valuation and how he arrived at the valuation.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>   Joseph Leung denied that there was such an agreement between him and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. He said he was not told and he did not ask what the bargain price for the Basement was. There is little Joseph Leung couldsay in the witness box about a negative averment, except a denial. Mr Lai submits that the events did not happen that way. He suggeststhat the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was negotiating the purchase with the 5<sup>th</sup> Defendant and the price was yet to be agreed. That explained the great urgency of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs telephone call asking Joseph Leung for an urgent valuation to name a price for him to bargain on. Joseph Leung gavea valuation via the Vigers Valuation Letter. Armed with that letter, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant returned to the negotiation table with a price offer and successfully negotiated the price down from whatever it was tothe valuation of $470 million. When the formal report came out three days later, the deal was closed.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>   I shall first briefly recap those inferences before turning to the evidence of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant. Joseph Leungâs valuation of $470 million was so glaringly excessive and the way he made the valuation so negligent andreckless that the valuation could not have been reached by a qualified and experienced valuer like him however negligent. JosephLeungâs choice of small street level shops as comparables was a blatant departure from professional practice. His putting the Basementas the same category of properties as Prudential Centre and over amplifying the MTR Effect on the Basement was such defiance of commonsense as to suggest a conscious intention to over value. His failure to make an on-site inspection, his irresponsible assumptionabout the position of the escalators and pedestrian traffic was so out of line with professional practice. Though he made adjustmentfor size to the unit rates for his comparables, his assumption that the Plaintiff will sub-divide the Basement to maximise its developmentpotential and to value the Basement as if it were an aggregate of small units indicate that he had no intention to follow the professionalpractice but to reverse engineer some valuation. Then, there were the various negligent conduct in the valuation, such as his inexplicablereasons for rounding up the unit rate in his comparables and then rounding up the valuation to the nearest ten million and that noneof his calculation hit a valuation of $470 million, to name a few. Mr Sarony SC submits that from the above facts the inference thatJoseph Leung reverse calculated the valuation of $470 million pursuant to an agreement to fix the valuation could readily be drawn.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>   I now turn to the evidence of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant. She is the younger sister of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. She had worked in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs garment factory for about two years before she went to study law in the United Kingdom. She qualified as a solicitorin Hong Kong in 1993. In 1994, she and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant acquired Unisouth Industrial Company Limited which then changed its name and became the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff. She became a director of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff with responsibility for its secretarial and legal department. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant became the chairman while the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was invited to join as the managing director of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff. The 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants were also appointed as directors of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>   In essence, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant made three crucial allegations. Firstly, in around March 1997, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant informed her that he intended to procure the Plaintiffs to enter into a series of transactions with the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Defendants in respect of the Building. She sought confirmation from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant who told her to take care of the legal aspects of the transaction.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>   Secondly, as a result, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff acquired the entire issued share capital of Fei Wang and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff on 11 March 1997 at $140.175 million. Thus, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff effectively acquired Shops 5 and 6 on the ground floor and the 7<sup>th</sup> floor of the Building for $140.175 million. The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was not particularly concerned about this transaction as the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants had already decided, that it was the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs business to acquire and sell property and that the price was within the means of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>   Thirdly, on a day before 9 May 1997, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant informed the 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiff that he had provisionally concluded a deal with the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant for the purchase of the Basement at $470 million. She was surprised by the purchase price and asked the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant if the price was a fair market one. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant relied that he would procure Vigers to issue a valuation report that the Basement was worth the purchase price. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant said words to the effect that he âwould get it doneâ, which she understood to mean that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had verbally informed Vigers the purchase price of the Basement was $470 million and it would be vital to obtain such valuationreport to support the decision to purchase.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>   The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant said that she objected to the Basement transaction as she thought the price of $470 million exorbitant compared with thatof $140.175 million for the earlier transaction just two months ago. She thought the Plaintiffs would be paying the price of a RollsRoyce for a bicycle. She doubted if the Basement worth that much. She was worried that the Plaintiffs did not have funds to makethe purchase. She disagreed with financing the purchase with the Consideration Shares Arrangement under which shares of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff would have to be issued at substantial discount. She also objected to the absence of a locked-up period for the sharesissued under the Consideration Shares Arrangement. She raised her objections but the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant overruled her. She made it clear that she did not consent to the Basement transaction.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>   The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was so uncomfortable with the Basement transaction that she contemplated resigning from the Plaintiffs. She tendered herresignation notice in July to take effect in September 1997. Despite her firm stand and her non-consent to the Basement transaction,she nevertheless signed the board minutes with the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on 13 May 1997 approving the transaction at the behest of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. She also signed the Principal Agreement on behalf of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff to purchase the Basement from the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant when the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant excused himself from attending the solicitorsâ office at the last minute.</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>   After the issue of the present proceedings, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant approached the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant. The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant told the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to handle the litigation on her behalf and appointed him as her attorney. She told the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to have his solicitor, Messrs Jones Day, to represent her as well. She discussed the litigation with the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant a number of times. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant gave instruction to Messrs Jones Day on her behalf. Messrs Jones Day acted as the common solicitors for all the three Defendantsand filed a defence dated 4 September 2003 on behalf of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant. In essence, she denied the allegation of conspiracy and fixing the valuation. She and the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants justified the price for the Basement because of the boom in the property market, hot money from China, Singapore, Indonesiaand confidence in the future of Hong Kong. They boasted about the MTR access for the Basement. The defence filed on behalf of the3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant is wholly inconsistent with her evidence in Court.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>   On the basis of her evidence, I can well imagine the frustration the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was suffering upon receipt of the statement of claim from the Plaintiffs. It was normal to seek support and assistancefrom oneâs co-director who was also being sued and pull their heads together to consider their defence. It would not have beenunusual for one director to hand the litigation over to another director who was in the same boat and had the necessary experienceand competence to handle the litigation. However, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant is not a company director of ordinary competence and skill. She is a solicitor of ten yearsâ standing by the time litigationstarted. She is familiar with company practice. She must be aware of her liability as a director of the Plaintiffs. She was beingsued for over $300 million. More importantly, according to her evidence, she was not in the same boat as the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants. She objected to the Basement transaction for good reasons. According to her, the purchase price was grossly inflated.The Plaintiffs were paying the price of a Rolls Royce for a bicycle. She recalled it was the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant who said he would have Vigers to fix the valuation. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant should be the last person on earth whom she should trust. Yet, she did not seek separate legal representation. Instead,she entrusted the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, appointed him as her attorney, asked him to instruct his solicitors to act for her and left it to him to give instructionsto Messrs Jones Day. She chose to stand on the same front with the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. She did not discuss with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, who is her brother, saying that he was always flying around and not available. In the end, she was shown the defence preparedon the basis of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs instruction. She read and approved the defence which, on the basis of her evidence, she knew does not represent hercase at all. Her conduct was inconsistent with the allegation she is now making against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and Joseph Leung. Her signing the board minutes approving the Basement transaction, the Principal Agreement and the sub-purchaseagreement and her conduct in preparing for the defence in this action can only be explained on the basis that she was acting in linewith the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants as is consistent with her defence. The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant had read and approved the defence filed on her behalf. Her defence filed in this action, even if it had been withdrawn,stands as a previous inconsistent statement which discredits her evidence in Court. Her defence casts doubts on the veracity of herevidence in Court. Now, instead of entrusting her defence to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, she is stabbing him in the back by putting all the blame on him for fixing the valuation. Her evidence creates insurmountabledifficulties to the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>   The inference of fixing the valuation to be drawn from the glaringly excessive valuation and the way the valuation was arrivedat by Joseph Leung is a very strong one. However, the inference of negligence is equally strong. Two months later, two reputablevaluers, namely Midland and Richard Ellis also made very excessive valuations of the Basement. They might probably have been influencedto some extent by the actual transaction, without which they might come up with a lower valuation. Nevertheless, their valuationssuggest mistake was easy to make by the less competent, particularly in view of the then market atmosphere. Negligence could notbe ruled out. The evidence of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant is decisive of negligence or fixing valuation.</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>   Though the Plaintiffs are not pursuing on the allegation of conspiracy against Vigers, fixing a valuation is a very serious allegationto make of a professional valuer. The burden of proof is on the Plaintiffs who make the assertion and they must proof their assertionwith cogent evidence. What weight can I give to the evidence of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant in the light of her inconsistent pleading in her defence? Was her allegation that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had told her on a day before 9 May 1997 that he had provisionally concluded the transaction at $470 million a concoction?Could she have mistaken about what was said and when it was said? Could she have misunderstood or misinterpreted what was said? The1<sup>st</sup> Defendant might well have been very optimistic about the market as pleaded in the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantâs defence and hence said he would have Vigers to make a valuation which would support the purchase price which he believedwas appropriate. As between a grossly negligent valuer and one who bends to the wishes of his client, I prefer to identify JosephLeung as the former. In the light of the quality of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantâs evidence, I cannot be satisfied that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantâs evidence was wholly reliable. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was not called. Hence, the scenario as suggested by Mr Lai is not at all unlikely. The 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants were very optimistic about the market. So was Joseph Leung. He too indulged in the Defendantsâ dreams and negligentlygave an excessive valuation which became the transaction price agreed to by the misinformed Plaintiffs. The case of fixing the valuationis not made out. But that has no bearing on the issue of negligence.</p>    <p class="heading">Causation</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>   The allegation of conspiracy against Vigers has now been abandoned, but the statement of claim has not been amended to that effect.The Plaintiffsâ solicitors have by letter shortly before commencement of the trial informed the Plaintiffsâ solicitors that theydid ânot intend to proceed with the allegation of conspiracyâ. However, Mr Lai submits that the Plaintiffs cannot simply walkaway from their pleaded case with impunity. He argues that the conspiracy issue has been standing in the pleading for years and avery strong prima facie case of conspiracy is pictured in the witness statement of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant. The Plaintiffs opened the arena with a very high profile letter of 17 February 2003 alleging the Vigers Report as a âdesignto deceiveâ, â¦ and âassisting the perpetration of the deceit/fraudâ. He submits that Vigers is running a defence of lackof causation and contributory negligence. Contributory negligence, if successfully contended at 100% is a complete defence and isjust another way of saying that even if the valuation report was wrong and negligent, there was no causation because the conspiratorswere in any event bent on pushing ahead. All they wanted from Vigers was just some industry compliant papers by whatever naÃ¯ve orgullible valuers they could get hold of to see the deal through.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>   I am not the least convinced by Mr Laiâs submission. Assuming that there was a conspiracy among the Defendants, save Vigers,and all that those Defendants wanted from Vigers was a valuation report of $470 million to see the deal through, there was nothingto prevent Vigers from doing the valuation properly and arrive at a valuation which was within the range of what a valuer exercisingordinary skill and care would have arrived at. Vigers offered no evidence that any of the Defendants had done anything to misleador prevent Joseph Leung from doing his valuation properly. There was no evidence that the Defendants prevented him from making anon-site inspection. Joseph Leung did not even ask for permission to visit the Basement. There was no evidence of any misrepresentationmade by the Defendants about the Basement. Joseph Leung made various assumptions which no valuer would have made. Under cross-examination,he admitted that he would assume the Plaintiffs would maximise the value of the Basement by partitioning it into small units andhe effectively valued the Basement as an aggregate of small units.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>   Mr Lai submits that as far as Vigers were concerned, the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants were the corporate minds of the Plaintiffs. He submits that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants went on a shopping spree under circumstances as described in the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantâs defence and that the Plaintiffs were buying a dream of the future. Mr Lai argues that Vigers were under no duty toinquire. Vigers did not have to inquire what was in the corporate mind of the Plaintiffs. They were under a duty to make a propervaluation but they failed miserably in that duty. If Vigers made a proper valuation and if despite that the Plaintiffsâ corporatemind determined to proceed with the dream, it would have been a matter for the Plaintiffs. That the Plaintiffsâ corporate minddecided to go ahead with the transaction could not relieve Vigersâ duty to make a proper valuation.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>   Mr Lai argues that there was no reliance on Vigersâ valuation as the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants were bent to go ahead with the transaction. He argues that the irony is that if the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantâs evidence is to be believed, it would kill the Plaintiffsâ case instantly because there was no reliance. Even if the1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants were bent to go ahead, they could not do so unless supported by the valuation in the Vigers Report. The decision to proceedwith the transaction had to be approved by shareholders in a general meeting. The transaction could not have been approved unlessthe Plaintiffsâ Circular issued to the shareholders contained a valuation which would support the transaction. Joseph Leung consentedon behalf of Vigers to have the Vigers Report annexed to the Circular. At the shareholders meeting, the shareholdersâ mind wasthe corporate mind. Regardless of the intention and desires of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants, the shareholders would not have approved the transaction without the Vigers Report. Clearly, the shareholders acted onthe Vigers Report. Furthermore, the real irony is that it is Vigersâ case and Mr Laiâs submission that Joseph Leung prepareda valuation based on which the Plaintiffs reached the transaction price with the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant. It cannot be said that there was no reliance on the Vigers Report.</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>   Lastly, Mr Lai submits that despite the initial reliance on the Vigers Report, the chain of causation was broken when accordingto the Plaintiffsâ own pleading and the documentary evidence the Plaintiffs could have pulled out of the transaction upon the conditionsprecedents not being fulfilled by the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant. I do not think Vigers can rely on the fortuitous event that the conditions precedents were not fulfilled to be relievedof liability. It was the Vigers Report which set the chain of events in motion. If as a result of the failure of conditions precedent,the motion stops, Vigers is entitled to be lucky as no injuries would be suffered. But if the motion does not stop, Vigers are liablejust the same. There was all along reliance by the shareholders in general meeting. Whether subsequent to that the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants as agents of the Plaintiffs took or by their imprudent conduct failed to take advantage of the failure of conditions precedentis neither nor there.</p>    <p class="heading">Contributory negligence</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>   Specifically on contributory negligence, that defence presupposes the Plaintiffs, or at least the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants, knew that the valuation was bogus but nevertheless were bent to proceeding with the transaction. There is no evidencethat the Plaintiffs knew the valuation was bogus before the transaction. It is Vigersâ case that the valuation was not bogus andthat there was no agreement to fix the valuation. It is even Vigersâ case that the Plaintiffs closed the deed based on the valuationin Vigers Report. Joseph Leung never informed the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant or the Plaintiffs that the valuation was bogus. Only if there is evidence of such knowledge would it be open to Vigersto argue that in carrying on with the transaction the Plaintiffs were contributory negligent.</p>    <p class="heading">Measure of damages</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>   Mr Lai submits that the Plaintiffs have not proved their case properly and their claim can be dismissed under the principle of<i>damnum absque injuria</i> because they still have their Basement. He produced some newspaper cutting suggesting that a bubble mentality has resurfaced in theHong Kong property market. He says who knows whether in the not too distant future the Hong Kong people who sees a âriver of goldâin property today will bring the market mania back to days of 1997 or beyond. I reject that submission. Firstly, it has been provedto my satisfaction that the true open market value of the Basement as at 9 May 1997 was $110.5 million. Secondly, the injuries wereincurred on the date of the transaction. The bubble mentality today is totally irrelevant to the injuries suffered yesterday.</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>   The Plaintiffs are entitled to be compensated the difference between what they paid for in reliance on the Vigers Report and whatthey get as at the transaction date, subject to any damages they have successfully mitigated. They obtained compensation in the amountof $101,708,828.74 from the 4<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> Defendants. Accordingly, I award the Plaintiffs $257,791,171.26 being the difference between the valuation which is the same as thetransaction price and the true open market value of $110.5 million as at 9 May 1997 less the compensation received from the 4<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>   This is a case of serious breach of duty. The manner in which Joseph Leung carried out the valuation was extremely irresponsible,reckless and even appalling. Vigersâ expert witness, Mr Tsang, totally ignored his duty to assist the Court and gave opinion asadvocate in support of his clientâs case. His evidence is revolting and a waste of the Courtâs time. For these reasons, it isappropriate that Vigers should pay the Plaintiffsâ costs on an indemnity basis.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>   Accordingly, I enter judgment in favour of the Plaintiffs in the amount of $257,791,171.26 with interest from the date of the writ.I also make a costs order <i>nisi</i> that the 7<sup>th</sup> Defendant shall pay the Plaintiffsâ costs on an indemnity basis with certificate for two counsel, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top" height="17"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top" height="17">( Anthony To )<br />            Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr. Sarony Neville, SC and Ms. Angel W.
