A3 refers) Union Syndicate Corporation took over Hamilton's role as the seller.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> As the contract permitted partial shipment, the Letter of Credit No. 062590-111 LDEU (Exh. A5) which the Taiwan Freeway ConstructionBureau in due course opened in Taiwan on 13th September, 1974 with its bankers, the 1st Plaintiff ("the Bank of Taiwan") in favourof the beneficiary, Union Syndicate Corporation, related to only 7,000 of the 10,000 metric tons to be shipped under the contract.The actual amount of the credit was for US$896,000. Under this Letter of Credit, payment was to be by sight drafts drawn on the FirstNational City Bank, New York for the account of the Taiwan Freeway Construction Bureau. The Taiwan Freeway Construction Bureau suppliedthe necessary funds to the Bank of Taiwan so that the credit could be met, and the Bank of Taiwan saw to it that the First NationalCity Bank in New York was put in funds.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Because Union Syndicate Corporation was located in Hong Kong, the Bank of Taiwan used the services of a Hong Kong bank as advisingbanker here, the Kwong On Bank performing this role.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> After various amendments to the Letter of Credit as originally issued, it finally reached a form where the latest date drafts couldbe presented for negotiation under it was February 13th, 1975.

Ltd. ("Capricorn"),the 2nd Defendant, in respect od 3,000 metric tons of the scrap metal to which the credit related. (Exh. A21 refers). It is now commonground that such a transfer was unimpeachable under the terms of the credit.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> That same day, at about 4.30 p.m., Capricorn presented the Letter of Credit together with what purported to be the documents requiredunder it to Ka Wah Bank, with which it had an account, for negotiation.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Ka Wah Bank that same day negotiated two bills (Exh. A37 and A40) to a total value of US$358,963.20 presented to it by Capricornunder the credit.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Immediately afterwards, by telex, Ka Wah Bank sought reimbursement for the value of the bills from First National City Bank, NewYork, the drawee under the Letter of Credit, such reimbursement occurring within a matter of days. It is the amount which Ka WahBank received by way of reimbursement on that occasion that the Plaintiffs are in effect claiming by the present action.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> As directed by the Letter of Credit, Ka Wah Bank mailed the Bank of Taiwan the documents Capricorn had tendered under the credit.(Exh. A42 and A47 refer). Precisely when those documents reached the Bank of Taiwan was not ascertainable on the evidence, but itwas certainly no later than about the 27th February, 1975 for, by then, they had passed the documents on to their customer, the TaiwanFreeway Construction Bureau. This could be gathered from the evidence of P.W.2 who was the Deputy Divisional Manager of the TaiwanFreeway Construction Bureau. I do not think anything really turns on a difference of a few days, but for the sake of completenessit might be as well to mention the Bank of Taiwan would in all probability have received the documents several days before 27th February,1975, judging from the dates on A42 and A47, and bearing in mind the normal course of the post between two such close neighboursas Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> At this point, it will be convenient to turn attention to the documents which Capricorn tendered under the credit. When consideringthese documents, it is useful to know that the cargoes of steel to which they are supposed to relate have in fact never turned upin Taiwan. The Plaintiffs allege in effect that Capricorn never had any scrap to sell, and that the whole transaction which Capricorn'sdocuments purport to describe was nothing more than a sham. For reasons which I will give at a later stage, I accept the Plaintiffs'contention that Capricorn engaged in a fraudulent transaction, purporting to sell them non-existent cargoes of scrap.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> The Bills of Lading (Exh. A26 and A27) tendered under the credit purport to have been made at Cam Ranh Bay, South Vietnam on 10thFebruary, 1975. They purport to show that a total of 3,000 metric tons of scrap was loaded aboard two vessels at Cam Ranh Bay, SouthVietnam for a voyage to Taiwan where the port of discharge was shown as Kaohsiung. The consignee was shown as the Bank of Taiwan,and the Taiwan Freeway Construction Bureau is shown as the party to be notified. For reasons I will state in due course, I am satisfiedthese bills of lading are foregeries relating to non-existent shipments, and rather than being made at Cam Ranh Bay on 10th February,1975, they were probably concocted at some stage by Capricorn in Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> I have also concluded that the Quality and Quantity Certificates (Exh. P30 and P31) tendered by Capricorn under the credit were false.I will touch upon my reasons for this in due course.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> A point about those Quantity and Quality Certificates which the Plaintiffs maintain has some significance in their favour is thatboth these documents indicate that the vessels to which they relate had not sailed at the time the documents were made. The certificate(Exh. P30) relating to one vessel states "We also hereby certify that the above vessel is sailing at 9.00 a.m. on 10th February,1975", where as the certificate in respect of the other vessel (Exh. A31) has an identical sentence except for the time being shownas 7.00 a.m. The relevance of those sentences is only in the context of the provision in the Letter of Credit that payment was tobe made against shipping documents "after sailing."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Apart from the bills of lading and the Surveyor's Quantity and Quality Certificates just referred to, the genuiness as such of theother documents tendered under the credit is not called in question other than in the sense they all relate to non-existent goods.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Apparently nothing at first struck the Bank of Taiwan as odd about the documents it received from the Ka Wah Bank. There is no suggestionthat the Bank of Taiwan pointed out any oddity to its customer, the Taiwan Freeway Construction Bureau, when it handed on the documentson or about the 27th February, 1975. No doubt, if the Bank of Taiwan had noticed anything suspicious about the documents it wouldimmediately have protested to the Ka Wah Bank about accepting non-conforming documents.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> It was not till almost the end of March, 1975, that any of the Plaintiffs began to find fault with the way the Ka Wah Bank had performedits duties under the Letter of Credit. By then the buyers had ample cause for anxiety about whether they were ever going to get theshipments they thought they had purchased. The efforts made by the buyers to ascertain what was happening to the ships which weresupposed to be making the short voyage from Vietnam to Taiwan can be observed from the various copy telegrams and telexes put inevidence by consent.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> As opening salvo, the Taiwan Freeway Construction Bureau through the Bank of Taiwan complained to the Ka Wah Bank by a telex dated31st March, 1975 (Exh. A60) that the Taiwan Freeway Construction Bureau wanted all its money back because the Ka Wah Bank was inbreach of the Letter of Credit by paying Capricorn which was not a beneficiary under the credit.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> That complaint got the Plaintiffs nowhere because the Ka Wah Bank were quickly able to point out that the Kwong On Bank, which wasthe Bank of Taiwan's advising bank in Hong Kong, had authorised the transfer to Capricorn under the Letter of Credit which was bothtransferable and divisible. Nothing more has ever been heard of that particular line of complaint.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Next the Bank of Taiwan sent the Ka Wah Bank a telex (Exh. A65) on 19th May, 1975 passing on a complaint by the Taiwan Freeway ConstructionBureau that the goods had still not arrived and expressing the view that the documents presented by Capricorn were false. This telexrequested the Ka Wah Bank to ask Capricorn to refund the money.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> After that comes a telex (Exh. A68) dated 4th June, 1975 from the Bank of Taiwan to the Ka Wah Bank which substantially embodiesthe Plaintiffs' main complaint against the Ka Wah Bank. I will set out the relevant part of the text:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"IF THE RELEVANT BLADING AND SURVEYORS CERTIFICATE BOTH ISSUED IN VIETNAM ON FEBRUARY 10 1975 WERE GENUINE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PRESENTSAID DOCUMENTS TO NEGOTIATING BANK IN HONG KONG FOR NEGOTIATION ON THE SAME DAY FEBRUARY 10 1975 STOP NEGOTIATION BANK SHOULD HAVEQUESTIONED THIS APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FACT AND SHOULD HAVE TAKEN ACTION TO ASCERTAIN AUTHENTICITY OF THE DOCUMENTS BUT FAILED TODO SO THEREFORE NEGOTIATING BANK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS AND IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE TO REFUND THE PROCEEDS."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Basically the Plaintiffs' complaint against the Ka Wah Bank is that it was negligent in failing to detect that some of the documentstendered by Capricorn were false.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> As a second string to their bow, the Plaintiffs have sought to derive such assistance as they can from an allegation that the KaWah Bank did not observe the requirement of the credit that payment was to be "after sailing." The Plaintiffs now say that thereshould have been no payment under the Letter of Credit unless there was evidence of sailing.</p>    <p align="left"><u>Causes of Action</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> Each of the Plaintiffs claims it is in its own right entitled to sue the Ka Wah Bank. Whether in fact each of the Plaintiffs couldhave a cause of action against the Ka Wah Bank, and what the nature of any such action might be, is a problem which can now be convenientlyconsidered in the light of the facts as already outlined.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> The only actions it has been suggested any of the Plaintiffs might have are in contract or in tort for negligence.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> Contract as a possible ground of action is clearly excluded for both the Taiwan Freeway Construction Bureau and for the Tang EngIron Works because of absence of privity. Thus if either of that pair is to succeed it can only be on the basis of the tort of negligence,</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Aside from the question of whether it was ever owed any duty of care by the Ka Wah Bank, Tang Eng Iron Works must surely fail inany action for negligence as it has failed to establish the vital ingredient of damage. There is nothing to show Tang Eng Iron Worksis any the worse off as the result of the non-arrival of the cargoes of scrap.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> On the other two elements of negligence, namely the existence of a duty of care and the breach of that duty, Tang Eng Iron Workswould also fail.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Nothing in the evidence suggested that the Ka Wah Bank should have contemplated that its actions might affect Tang Eng Iron Works,so this absence of foreseeability would necessarily mean there was no duty of care. What I will say in a moment about why the KaWah Bank did not even owe a duty of care to the Taiwan Freeway Construction Bureau will apply with even more force to the positionof the Tang Eng Iron Works which is in an even more remote relationship to the Ka Wah Bank: at least the Ka Wah Bank knew from theLetter of Credit who was the buyer of the steel i.e. Taiwan Freeway Construction Bureau.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Frankly, I find it difficult to understand why Tang Eng Iron Works was ever joined in this action as there was never any possiblehope it could succeed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Turning now to whether Taiwan Freeway Construction Bureau might have an action in negligence, the first question to consider is whetherKa Wah Bank owed it a duty of care, the particular duty of care in the circumstances of this case being not to pay out on false documentsor on documents which did not conform with the requirement of payment "after sailing."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Determining who is owed a duty of care is ultimately a policy decision for the courts. Lord Atkins famous "neighbour" dictum in <u>Donoghue</u> v. <u>Stevenson</u><sup>(1)</sup> does not by itself provide a universal answer to the question of when in practice the courts will recognize a duty of care situationto exist. Unfortunately for the Plaintiffs, one sphere where the courts have been slow to find a duty of care to exist is that relatingto the avoidance of inflicting pecuniary loss. (See, e.g. Street on Torts, 6th Ed., 112). True, as Mr. Bernacchi points out the categoriesof negligence are never closed, but against this one has to balance Mr. Ching's equally valid assertion that the flood-gates arenot open either.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Mr. Bernacchi sought to draw some comfort from <u>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co</u>., v. <u>Heller &amp; Partners, Ltd.,</u><sup>(2)</sup> as an example of how the courts can find a duty of care not to cause pecuniary loss. That was a case where the House of Lords declaredthat where a "special relationship" exists a person can be liable for uttering negligent misstatements which cause pecuniary lossto another.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Another more recent instance has been where the court found a solicitor liable to someone who would have been a beneficiary undera will if the solicitor had not been negligent concerning the manner in which the will was executed: <u>Ross</u> v. <u>Caunters</u><sup>(3)</sup>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> However, the situations where the courts have been prepared to find a duty not to inflict pecuniary loss have in practice been fewand far between, and I cannot say that I regard the position in which the Taiwan Freeway Construction Bureau now finds itself asan appropriate one for holding that a duty of care exists. (See Ellinger's Documentary Letters of Credit pages 234, 235, hypotheticalcase No. 3; also page 264).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> There is no reason for a negotiation banker to suppose its skill and judgment in accepting documents tendered under a Letter of Creditwill be relied on by the buyer: the buyer will be looking to its own banker, the issuing banker, to ensure that the documents arein order. Further, there already exist practical ways in which a buyer can protect himself from fraudulent sellers without the courtsneeding to lay down that the negotiation banker owes the buyer a duty of care. The buyer can, for example, insist upon his sellergiving a performance bond.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> If the Taiwan Freeway Construction Bureau wished the court to hold that it was entitled to the benefit of a duty of care, it neededto come up with good reasons why this should be so, and to my mind it has failed in this regard. Without compelling reasons, I wouldbe loathe to discover some novel form of liability on the part of negotiation banks, for the courts will not lightly take steps whichcould prove disruptive of the well established machinery of international trade which operates through the Letter of Credit system.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> For want of a duty of care, Taiwan Freeway Construction Bureau's claim must fail.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> As between the Bank of Taiwan and the Ka Wah Bank there is a contract. That contract is embodied in the Letter of Credit which incorporatesthe UCP. A Letter of Credit is in effect an offer which a negotiation bank accepts by negotiating the drafts tendered under it. Thatis a form of accepting an offer by conduct. (See e.g. <u>Elder Dempater Lines Ltd.,</u> v. <u>Ionic Shipping Agency Inc</u>.<sup>(4)</sup></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> A contract with more comprehensive terms than one incorporating the UCP is difficult to imagine. Virtually every conceivable contingencyis provided for in great detail by the UCP. The duties of the parties are expressly stated. Article 7 of the UCP in the section headed"Liabilities and Responsibilities" sets out in unmistakable terms the duty imposed on a negotiation banker. "Banks must examine alldocuments with reasonable care to ascertain that they appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of thecredit."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> What conceivable scope exists for some separate duty of care to be owed to the Bank of Taiwan in the tort of negligence I just cannotsee. Such duty of care as exists is in contract, defined by the contract. This might be highly inconvenient to the Bank of Taiwanbecause there is another provision in the contract - Article 8 - which is to the effect that, if after a reasonable time for examiningthe documents, the issuing bank fails promptly to give notice, with reasons, why the documents on their face do not conform withthe credit, the issuing bank is taken to have ratified the transaction. There is also Article 9 which states:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Banks assume no liability or responsibility for the form, sufficiency, accuracy, genuiness, falsification or legal effect of anydocuments .......................... "</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Presumably to avoid the inconvenient incidents of the contract, the Bank of Taiwan hopes to be able to pitch its claim in tort, butthis it just cannot do for its relationship with the Ka Wah Bank is regulated by the contract. (On the relationship between an issuingbanker and a negotiation banker see Ellinger, op. cit. at 259-261).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> Of all the Plaintiffs, the only one which could conceivably have a cause of action against the Ka Wah Bank is the Bank of Taiwan,and the only possible action it could have would be for breach of contract.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> This leads into a consideration of whether the Ka Wah Bank is in fact in breach of any duties it owes the Bank of Taiwan under thecontract.</p>    <p align="left"><u>Whether the Ka Wah Bank is in Breach of its Duties to the Taiwan Bank under the Letter of Credit</u>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> Merely because some of the documents tendered under the credit were false cannot avail the Bank of Taiwan anything unless it canbe shown that the Ka Wah Bank failed to exercise reasonable care to ascertain those documents appeared on their face to conform withthe credit. That is the combined effect of Article 7 and Article 9 of the UCP.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> It has already been mentioned that the Plaintiffs complain in effect that the Ka Wah Bank has failed in its duties in two ways, thefirst being in accepting false documents, and the other in making payment in disregard of the requirement of "after sailing".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> Whether payment should have been made without specific evidence the vessels had sailed is unmistakably a problem of whether the documentsappear on their face to conform with the credit, and whether the Ka Wah Bank could be said to have exercised reasonable care if itoverlooked this. Equally, but perhaps not quite so obviously, the false documents pose exactly the same problem, namely whether theyappear on their face to conform with the credit, and whether the Ka Wah Bank could be said to have exercised reasonable care if itoverlooked this. How this is in fact the problem posed by false documents tendered under a documentary credit is made clear by <u>Gian Singh Ltd.,</u> v. <u>Banque de 1'Indochine</u><sup>(5)</sup></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> Looking at all of the documents tendered under the credit, I consider that the only respect in which there is scope for a plausibleargument that they do not on their face conform with the terms of the credit is the requirement that payment is to be made againstshipping documents "after sailing." Even there, one can see scope for a counter-argument that in the context of the carriage of goodsby sea "after sailing" meant the same as "after shipment" for sometimes "sailing" will by synonymous with "shipment": See Article40 of the UCP. In their turn Articles 14 and 18 in effect make the date of the Bill of Lading the date of "shipment". Following theargument through, one could say that on the face of the documents, payment was made after "shipment", and hence after "sailing".Such an interpretation would in fact serve to give the Letter of Credit business efficacy in the absence of any provision in theLetter of Credit as to how the paying bank is supposed to ascertain a vessel has sailed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> However, I find it unnecessary to reach a firm conclusion as to the precise meaning of "after sailing", because, in any event, theBank of Taiwan's failure to protest in accordance with Article 8 of the UCP means it has ratified the Ka Wah Bank's action. On thisI will say more in a moment.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> Although this was not an easy argument to follow, it seemed to be suggested on behalf of the Plaintiffs that it was so intrinsicallyunlikely that documents which purported to have been made at a port in Vietnam on 10th February, 1975 could be available in HongKong's Central District by 4.30 p.m. the same day, that this somehow by itself meant that even on the face of the documents theydid not conform with the terms of the credit. In this era of the aeroplane, the helicopter and the car, I see nothing at all unusualin documents getting here from Vietnam within a few hours of being made. The position might be otherwise if Vietnam were on the otherside of the world.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> In any event, if it should have been so obvious to the paying banker that there was something odd about the dates of the documents,it should, presumably, have been equally obvious to the issuing banker, so that if the issuing banker failed to reject them in accordancewith Article 8 of the UCP after a reasonable time for examination, then the issuing banker will be taken to have ratified them.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Perhaps a word should be said at this point about the significance of the tendered documents showing Cam Ranh Bay as the port ofshipment. I am prepared to accept the truthfulness of everything the witness Chu Yu-liang (P.W.3) said about it being a militaryport with no commercial airport, and about how it took at least five hours to drive from there to Saigon which was the only placefrom which one could get a commercial flight to Hong Kong, but my view was that this evidence was irrelevant to the only real issuein the case which was whether the documents tendered under the credit appeared on their face to conform with the credit. Referencesin the documents to shipments from Cam Ranh Bay, South Vietnam on their face fully conform with the requirement of the Letter ofCredit: "Shipment from South Vietnam port to Kaohsiung." If bankers had to start concerning themselves with such details as the travelarrangements within the countries from which goods are shipped, Letters of Credit could no longer operate as a simple banking toolfor the finance of international trade. Any reasonable banker in my opinion would treat documents purporting to show shipment fromCam Ranh Bay, South Vietnam as conforming with "Shipment from South Vietnam Port". If I am wrong, and the Ka Wah Bank accepted non-conformingdocuments, then it was not alone on doing this, the Bank of Taiwan having done the same without availing itself of the rejectionprovisions of Article A.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> A few words can now be said about the operation of Article 8 in the present case. The Bank of Taiwan was entitled to "a reasonabletime to examine the documents" to enable it to decide whether they conformed. A reasonable time for this purpose seems to vary frombanking centre to banking centre. According to Paget's Law of Banking 8th Edition at page 658 forty-eight hours is sufficient inLondon, whereas according to McNair, J. in Bank Molli Iran v. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas)<sup>(6)</sup> six weeks might not have been long enough in Iran.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> I would not have thought there was too much which the bankers of London could teach their Chinese colleagues in Asia when it cameto matters of efficiency. It is unnecessary in the circumstances of the present case to come up with a precise figure on what isa reasonable time for a banker in Taiwan to examine documents for the purpose of Article 8. Suffice it to say that, as a matter ofcommon sense, in the light of the efficiency with which business is generally known to be conducted in the South-East Asian region,it would not be far different from the period treated as reasonable in London.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> For at least a month after the Bank of Taiwan received the documents in February 1975, it did not communicate with the Ka Wah Bankat all. Clearly by then a reasonable time for examining the documents had long since expired. Even when the Bank of Taiwan did sendits telex of 31st March, 1975 (Exh. A60), seeking to reject the documents, it did not give the reasons which it now seeks to relyon, whereas Article 8 requires the reasons to be stated. Moreover, to make an effective rejection in accordance with Article 8, theBank of Taiwan needed to inform the Ka Wah Bank that the off ending documents were being held at the letter's disposal or being returnedto it, but that was never done.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> The conclusion is inescapable that insofar as the documents tendered under the credit failed to conform with the terms of the creditthe Taiwan Bank has missed its opportunity to complain about this because of failure to follow the requirements of Article 8.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The Evidence of Miss Ho Chieh-yu.</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> The background of this witness was that for several years she had worked in a section of the Dah Sing Bank in Hong Kong, dealingwith letters of credit. She then went on to become a Manager with that bank. All her experience was with the same bank. By Hong Kongstandards her bank was comparatively small being in Category 4, and the amount of turnover in the section dealing with Letters ofCredit sounds to have been relatively small, too. Apart from her practical experience in working for the one small bank, it was notsuggested she had any formal qualifications in banking.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> She was put forward as an expert by the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> My view of her evidence can be summed up very briefly: it was irrelevant to the issues which I regarded as material for disposingof the case, and, in any event, it was unreliable.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> Her opinion, based on such expertise as she had, was of no assistance to the court on the issues which by themselves were determinativeof the present case, namely whether the documents tendered under the credit conformed on their face with the requirements of thecredit, and if not, whether there had been ratification. Just because she thought a document did not on its face conform with therequirements of the credit was neither here nor there. Were her views to be taken into account on that, she would be usurping thefunction of the court.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> Presumably the Plaintiffs' main object in calling the witness was to establish that the Ka Wah Bank had acted negligently by failingto fulfill a duty to safeguard the Plaintiffs from fake documents. However, I have already indicated that I do not think any dutyof this nature exists towards any of the Plaintiffs so that I did not regard her evidence as having any relevance for this purpose.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> Now I will touch upon why I did not regard her as a reliable witness.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> Her evidence took the form of a prepared statement (Exh. P5) which she adopted as her evidence-in-chief. From that statement (Exh.P5),it can be seen that she made some observations numbered from 1 to 7 after being shown the shipping documents and Letter of Creditof the present case. Some of her observations seem to be plainly wrong to me and served to cast doubt on her general reliability.Moreover, after observing her under cross-examination and after considering the content of her answers, I finished up with the impressionthat this was not a detached expert trying to assist the court, but rather someone with a partisan approach who was doing her bestfor the side which called her.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> An egregious example of an observation of hers which does not seem correct is No. 5, which starts off "The date of issue of the Billof Lading was suspicious. Usually, a Bill of Lading is not issued on the same day as the sailing date."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> I frankly see nothing suspicious or unusual about issuing a Bill of Lading on the sailing date. It happens all the time where shipshave a quick turn-around. She goes on to claim that in such a situation the bank is under a duty to verify the Master's signature.Why a bank, acting under the UCP, and therefore not concerned with whether documents are false, would want to do that eludes me.I was not persuaded she was describing a standard banking procedure to me.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> Her observation No. 1 is equally wrong. There she states: "The Letter of Transfer in favour of Capricorn was made on 10th February,1975 and dated 10th February, 1975. When a banker has the documents presented to him by the transferee the same day that itself shouldhave caused grave suspicion. A banker should have grave suspicion because, if there was a proper transfer, there would not be sufficienttime to make the transfer since the Bills were presented at 4.30 p.m. on 10th February, 1975. being the last working day before theholiday." The fact of the matter is that by itself there was nothing suspicious in Union Syndicate Corporation transferring partof its credit to Capricorn on 10th February, 1975. As between Union Syndicate Corporation and Capricorn, there was no need to waittill the shipping documents reached Hong Kong before they effected such a transfer. Without there being anything suspicious, thetransfer could have been made at any time on 10th February, 1975, and it would not even have been suspicious if it had been madebefore 10th February, 1975. The time Union Syndicate Corporation chose to make the transfer would depend on its previous course ofdealing with Cparicorn, and the transfer would by no means necessarily have to depend on the arrival of the shipping documents inHong Kong. There was nothing to show it was meant to be a transfer against documents: the arrangement might have been the documentswere to be handed over as soon as they became available.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> Miss Ho chooses to find cause for "grave suspicion" in that circumstance, but I tend to doubt whether that would be the reactionof a more detached observer.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> Observations No. 3 and 4 cover basically the same ground. They are to effect that a banker in Hong Kong should have suspected thetransaction was a sham because there was no evidence the seller in Vietnam - a country with foreign exchange control - had been paid.Back-to-back Letters of Credit were cited as an example of the type of evidence a banker in Hong Kong might look for to ensure theseller in Vietnam had been paid. (On back-to-back letters of credit, see The Law of Bankers' Commercial Credits by Gutteridge andMegrah, 6th Edition at 13 and Ellinger op. cit. at 19).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> Mr. Ching for the Ka Wah Bank heaped ridicule on the suggestion that a paying banker under a letter of credit would concern himselfwith whether a seller had been paid, and I must say I found what P.W.6 had said about this extremely difficult to believe. What shesaid does make a nonsense of the whole UCP system which was obviously designed to protect a banker who pays out on documents conformingon their face with the terms of the credit. The type of elaborate detective work which P.W.6 seems to expect of bankers strikes meas completely at variance with the UCP. I find it very difficult to imagine that she could have been describing the practice of bankersgenerally in Hong Kong. Perhaps it was her own personal practices she was describing. and if that is so, it is difficult to resistthe comment that those practices just cannot be reconciled with the UCP.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> As her observations No. 2 and No. 7 cover basically the same ground, namely whether it is suspicious for documents to arrive in HongKong on the very day on which they were supposed to have been made in Vietnam, I will deal with them together. She says in effectthat being presented in Hong Kong with documents purporting to have been made overseas on the same day would put a banker on enquiry.I just do not accept that as a general proposition. Where the banker is operating under the UCP, His sole concern is whether thedocuments on their face conform with the terms of the credit.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> In any event, as I have already stated, there is nothing by itself strange in documents reaching Hong Kong the same day from a nearbycountry like Vietnam.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> With the benefit of hindsight P.W.6 is able to say she would not have paid out till she had taken steps like checking the signatureon the Bill of Lading and checking flights from Vietnam that day. I tend to doubt whether the average banker would have deemed itnecessary to take any of those steps she described. Even if there were a duty on a banker to safeguard against false documents, Ido not think the failure to take the steps she described would amount to absence of reasonable care. As it is, the position was coveredby the UCP in the way I have already described.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> No comment is called for on her observation No. 6, which calls attention to the requirement that payment is to be made "after sailing".I have already dealt with the significance of that requirement.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a> Mention can conveniently be made at this point of whether there is any significance in the fact that 10th February, 1975 was ChineseNew Year's Eve. After receiving the documents no earlier than 4.30 p.m. that evening, the Ka Wan Bank negotiated the Bills of Exchangefor its client that very day. Apart from suggesting the motive that the bank's staff might have been tempted to cut a few cornersin order to get home more quickly for the holiday, I see no reason to draw any inference adverse to the Ka Wah Bank from this happeningon Chinese New Year's Eve. Likewise the fact that Capricorn was the Ka Wah Bank's client and that he was overdrawn is only relevantto the bank's motive: the bank might have been tempted to scrutinise documents coming from such a source with less care than if theywere presented by a stranger2</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> Such possible motives on the part of the Ka Wah Bank could be borne in mind if it had to be determined whether it was in fact negligent.</p>    <p align="left"><u>Falsity of Documents</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> A combination of circumstances led me to conclude that the documents tendered under the credit were false in the sense of being forgedor relating to a sham transaction of non-existent goods.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> Of some significance is the mere fact that the Plaintiffs have not received the goods. That could of course be consistent with innocentexplanations such as loss of the ships at sea or blockade, but it is also consistent with the Plaintiffs being the victims of fraud.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> Strongly indicative of fraud is the circumstance that Capricorn's invoices Exhibits 32 and 33 which purport to have emanated fromHong Kong were obviously typed on the same machine which was used for the Bills of Lading, Exhibits 26 and 27, supposedly comingfrom Vietnam. There are such distinctive peculiarities common to the typewriting on these documents that the only reasonable explanationis the same machine was used for all of them. No expertise is required for this exercise: only common sense. A recital of the peculiarfeatures of the typing will be found in the evidence of Miss Ma Fung-ming (P.W.1), who was not claiming to be an expert on the characteristicsof typewriters, but who helped the court by drawing particular matters to the court's attention, after which the court could arriveat its own conclusions. The same result could have been reached if the peculiarities of the typewriting had been pointed out to thecourt from the Bar table.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> With sufficient imagination it is possible, I suppose, to suggest a hypothesis under which the Bills of Lading purporting to comefrom Vietnam could have been prepared on the same typewrite as the Hong Kong invoices without there being any forgery or falsity,but far and away the most likely explanation is that the Bills of Lading are forgeries, made in Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> Any documents which came via Capricorn fall under suspicion, because it looks as if Capricorn was deeply involved in a plot to drawfraudulently under the Letter of Credit. Capricorn's involvement can be gauged by its efforts to cover its tracks after the Bankof Taiwan started asking some fundamental questions about the whole transaction. To explain how it was in fact able to get documentsin Hong Kong by the afternoon of the very day on which they were supposed to have been made at Cam Ranh Bay, Capricorn was even preparedto invent a non-existent Air Vietnam Flight No. 787 which it claimed arrived in Hong Kong at 3.45 p.m. on 10th February, 1975. (SeeExhibits A75, 76 and 77). The combined effect of the evidence of P.W. 4, P.W. 5, and Exhibits P2A and 8, and Exhibits P3 and 4 wasto satisfy me there never was any such flight.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> Further documents which I am satisfied are false are the Quality and Quantity Certificates Exhibits P30 and P31. Whether those documentsare actually forgeries I do not know, but I am satisfied they are at least false in the sense of relating to non-existent shipments.Coming from a contaminated source like Capricorn is, by itself, in the circumstances of the present case, sufficient to give riseto the inference that those documents are false.</p>    <p align="left"><u>Conclusion</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a> In view of the foregoing my conclusion is that the claims of all of the plaintiffs against the Ka Wah Bank must be dismissed.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">(J.J.
