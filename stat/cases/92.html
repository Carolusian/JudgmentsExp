The defendant is an employment agency.  The claimant is an Indonesiandomestic helper who had sought the assistance of the defendant to obtain a job for her in Hong Kong. </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  In this appeal, the defendant relied on two broad grounds.   Firstly, it was argued that there is no cause of action against thedefendant on the findings made by the adjudicator.  Leave was given by Dep. J. To to the defendant to bring an appeal on this pointof law on 30 March 2001 under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28(1)(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap.338</a> and he gave directions that the defendant should serve perfected grounds of appeal within 14 days of his order.  Secondly,it was argued that the claim of the claimant was outside the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal in that it was within theexclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.  The defendant had not sought leave to bring an appeal on this ground, which wouldhave come under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28(1)(b)</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap.338</a>.  It was only raised by the defendantâs counsel, Miss Po, in her written submissions served the day before the hearingof the appeal.  I gave leave to the defendant to argue the point on jurisdiction notwithstanding it was raised very late in the day,as jurisdiction is an important matter.  I have also allowed the parties to make further written submissions on this point afterthe hearing was concluded in view of the insufficient time for counsel on both sides to research fully into the matter. </p>    <p class="heading">The claimantâs claim</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In the prescribed form of claim for proceedings in the Small Claims Tribunal, a claimant is required to set out the grounds forthe claim and how the amount of the claim is calculated.  The grounds for the claimantâs claim and how the amount claimed was calculatedas stated in her claim form filed on 14 November 2000 may be summarised as follows. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In late 1999, the claimant approached the defendant to introduce a job to her as she was released by her previous employer in October1999.  She was instructed by the defendant to return to Indonesia first and then come back to Hong Kong, which she did accordingly. In January 2000, she was introduced by the defendant to work for an employer, one Madam Wong in Quarry Bay, and she did so on afull time basis from then onwards.  The defendant told her to pay an agency fee of HK$10,000.00 for introducing her to this job. When the claimant received her salary of HK$3,000.00 each month from Madam Wong, she paid HK$2,500.00 to the defendant until shehad paid the agency fee in full.  It was only after full payment was made that the defendant assisted her to report to the ImmigrationDepartment on 19 June 2000 to process her application.  She was charged with overstaying by the authorities and the case againsther was later dropped.  She claimed that she did not know that the agency fee of HK$10,000.00 was illegal in that under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/57A" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Agency Regulations</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/57A">Cap.57A</a> (âthe Regulationsâ), the prescribed amount of commission that the defendant could charge was an amount not exceedinga sum being 10% of the first monthâs wages received by her from Madam Wong.  She claims the amount of HK$9,633.00 which is thedifference between the amount she had paid (i.e. HK$10,000.00) and the amount that the defendant could charge legally (i.e. HK$367.00,being 10% of her first monthâs salary of HK$3,670.00).</p>    <p class="heading">The possible causes of action</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  It would be convenient if I consider first the ground of appeal raised by the defendant that there is no cause of action beforeI deal with the jurisdiction point although it would be logical to rule on the fundamental question of jurisdiction before I decidewhether there are valid causes of action.  I do so because the possible causes of action are not entirely straightforward and itis important to see what possible causes of action there are before I turn to the question whether the claim falls within the exclusivejurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.  Hence, whilst I canvass the possible causes of action, it may be convenient to rule on theirvalidity. </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In the judgment of the adjudicator, he did not identify the cause or causes of action of the claimant when he made her an awardin the amount as claimed.  Miss Po made clear that she does not seek to argue that the possible causes of action would have to bestated in the judgment.  However, she contended that on the facts as found by the adjudicator, the claimant has failed to establisha valid cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Mr Ling for the claimant has contended that there are three possible causes of action:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) a claim for restitution based on economic duress;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) a claim for restitution based on the fact that the parties were not <i>in pari delicto</i>; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) a claim based on breach of statutory duty.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  For ease of reference, I set out the relevant statutory provisions that would have some bearing on the possible causes of actionas follows:</p>    <p><u><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57">Cap.57</a></u></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b>57.

It is necessary to establishpressure amounting to compulsion of the will of the victim or the absence of choice, that the pressure exerted was illegitimate,and that such pressure has constituted a significant cause inducing the victim so to act.  What Miss Po took issue with is that theadjudicator has made no finding on the evidence that there was threat or coercion by the defendant that had caused the claimant topay the HK$10,000.00 charged by the defendant for introducing her to work.  It was submitted by Miss Po that I am not allowed tolook at the transcript of proceedings to see if there is any evidence of threat or coercion if the adjudicator has not made any findingson it.  Under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 29(2)(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a>, on an appeal for which leave is granted under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28</a>, the Court of First Instance may âdraw any inference of factâ.  It is further provided in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 29(2)</a> that the Court of First Instance âmay not â (i) reverse or vary any determination made by the tribunal on questions of fact;or (ii) receive further evidence.â  Hence, Miss Po submitted that I may only draw an inference of fact from primary facts, I amnot permitted to infer from the evidence, which is not the subject of any finding of fact of the tribunal. </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Where the evidence is conflicting and the tribunal has not made any primary finding of fact, the Court of First Instance is notpermitted to look at the evidence and make a finding of its own.  Where the evidence is not controversial or where the tribunal hasmade a primary finding of fact, the Court of First Instance may draw an inference of fact from such material, if the inference isa proper one to draw in the circumstances. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In this instance, the adjudicator in his judgment first set out the evidence given by the claimant and her witnesses, then the evidencegiven by the defendantâs witnesses, then he gave his conclusion and stated that he was of the view the claimant and her witnessesare credible whereas the evidence given by the defendantâs witnesses is not credible.  Whilst the claimant had mentioned a fewtimes in her evidence that she was threatened or coerced by the defendant into making payment, the adjudicator did not expresslysay she was threatened or coerced when he recited the claimantâs evidence, which he accepted in the concluding part of his judgment. I am thus left in doubt if the adjudicator had accepted the claimantâs evidence that the defendant had threatened her expressly. As there is conflict between the claimantâs evidence and the defendantâs evidence whether she was expressly threatened intomaking payment, it would not be open to me to draw any inference on this from the claimantâs evidence, as her counsel Mr Ling hasinvited me to do.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  This, however, is not the end of the matter.  For there to be economic duress, the pressure applied does not have to be in the mannerof an express threat or coercion.  Pressure for this purpose could take many forms.  If the victim is left with no practical choicebut to submit because of the course of action of the other party, this would suffice.  Mr Ling submitted that the lack of practicalchoice could be inferred from the evidence accepted by the adjudicator.  Firstly, the demand for HK$10,000.00 was grossly excessive,considering that the monthly wages the claimant was to receive were only about HK$3,000.00.  Secondly, the adjudicator did acceptthe claimantâs evidence that she was told by the defendant that if she did not pay the agency fee, the defendant would not completethe necessary procedure for her to change to another employer.  Thirdly, the demand for payment was made in late 1999 or early 2000,the amount was paid by the claimant in four instalments from February to May 2000.  The adjudicator had accepted the claimantâsevidence that she had made repeated requests to the defendant to complete the necessary procedure after she was employed by MadamWong, that she had already signed a contract with her employer one month after the commencement of employment, and that it was only<i>after</i> the claimant had made full payment that the defendantâs staff took her to the Immigration Department in June 2000 to make the necessaryapplication. </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In my judgment, in view of the above facts found by the adjudicator, it would be entirely proper to draw the inference that theclaimant was presented with no practical choice but to pay the amount as demanded, that the pressure thus applied was illegitimatein that the amount had exceeded the commission prescribed in the Regulations, and that such pressure constituted a significant causefor the claimant to make payment.  On the basis of the above inference, I rule that there is a valid cause of action for restitutionbased on economic duress.</p>    <p class="heading">Not in pari delicto</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Where both parties have participated in an illegal transaction, one party may bring a restitutionary claim to recover what he haspaid in the transaction if he is able to establish that the parties are not <i>in</i> <i>pari delicto. </i> One of the categories of cases in which a plaintiff may be able to establish this is where there is oppression by the defendant,as illustrated in <i>Smith v. Cuff</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281817%29%206%20M%20%26%20S%20160" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1817) 6 M &amp; S 160.</a>  Another category is where there is statute enacted for the protection of the plaintiff, as was first recognised by Lord Mansfieldin <i>Smith v. Bromley</i> (1760) 2 Doug. 696n and applied more recently by the Privy Council in <i>Kiriri Cotton Co. Ltd. v. Dewani</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1960%5d%20AC%20102" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1960] AC 102.</a>  These categories of cases are founded on the principle of exploitation, whether actual or potential, by the defendant of the plaintiff,see â<i>The Principles of the Law of Restitution</i>â by Graham Virgo, 1999 ed., at p.297-299; and â<i>The Law of Restitution</i>â by Goff and Jones, 5<sup>th</sup> ed., at p.613, 615-616. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In this instance, I find there is sufficient evidence of inequality between the parties and the claimantâs conduct in making paymentof the agency fee could not be regarded as voluntary for the reasons I have given above.  There was exploitation by the defendantof the claimantâs situation in that the defendant had declined to help her with her application to the authorities until she hadpaid the amount demanded in full.  There was oppression on the part of the defendant.  I consider the claimant would be able to establishthat she is not <i>in pari delicto</i> with the defendant on this ground.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  As for the ground of statutory protection for the claimant, for restitution to be granted on this basis, it is necessary to determinewhether the policy of the statutory provision is for the protection of protecting a particular group of people to which the claimantbelongs.  An illustration is found in <i>Kiriri</i> in which it was held that a tenant could recover a premium paid to a landlord where this was prohibited by statute as the statutewas enacted to protect tenants and the responsibility for ensuring compliance with the law rested primarily with the landlord ratherthan with the tenant so the parties were not <i>in pari delicto. </i> It was stated by the Privy Council in <i>Kiriri, supra.</i> at 205 that âthe omission of a statutory remedy does not, in cases of this kind, exclude the remedy by money had and received.â</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  I shall not repeat the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 57(a)</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">60</a>(7) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10(2)</a>, (3) and the Second Schedule of the Regulations which I have set out in full.  It is to be noted that the prohibition is imposedon the employment agency from receiving payment in excess of the prescribed commission, not on the person seeking to obtain employment. Likewise, the criminal sanction is imposed only on the employment agency.  To adopt the words of Lord Denning in <i>Kiriri, supra</i>. at 205, the duty of observing the law is firmly placed by the Ordinance on the shoulders of the employment agency for the protectionof the person seeking employment; and if the law is broken, the employment agency must take the primary responsibility.  I am satisfiedthat the claimant belongs to that class of persons which the statutory provision in section 57(a) and the regulations enacted inconnection therewith were intended to protect.  As for Miss Poâs submission that there are other provisions in section 57, namely,sub-sections (b) and (c) that would appear to regulate employment agencies and the objective of which is not or not primarily forthe protection of those seeking employment, I do not think this should detract from the clear primary objective of section 57(a),which is what we are concerned with.  I hold that the claimant is not <i>in pari delicto</i> with the defendant and is entitled to recover on this basis as well.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  I should point out that in <i>Kiriri</i>, it was sought to argue for the tenant that he could recover on the alternative claim for breach of statutory duty, which is thethird cause of action relied on by the claimant here.  The Privy Council did not rule on this, having found for the tenant that hecould recover as he was not <i>in pari delicto</i> with the landlord, hence âit is not necessary to find a remedy given by the Ordinance, either expressly or by implicationâ (at205).</p>    <p class="heading">Breach of statutory duty</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The third and last cause of action relied on by Mr Ling is that as a matter of construction of the statute, section 57(a) <i>impliedly</i> confers a civil cause of action on those in the position of the claimant.  The statute does not expressly provide for a civil remedy,and only a criminal penalty is imposed in section 60(7) for the contravention of section 57(a).  Miss Poâs submission was thatthe claimant has failed to show there is clear legislative intent that a person in her position should have a private right of actionwhere an employment agency is in breach of section 57(a).</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The general rule is that where a statute creates an obligation and enforces the obligation in a specified manner, that performancecannot be enforced in any other manner.  There are two well established exceptions to this general rule and one of them is whereupon the true construction of the statute, it is apparent that the obligation or prohibition was imposed for the benefit or protectionof a particular class of individuals, as in the case of industrial safety legislation, see <i>Lonrho Ltd. v. Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd. (No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%20173" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] AC 173</a> at 185C to D, per Lord Diplock.  A neat encapsulation of the law is found in the speech of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>X (Minors) v. Bedfordshire County Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20633" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 633</a> at 731D to G:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe principles applicable in determining whether such statutory cause of action exists are now well established, although the applicationof those principles in any particular case remains difficult.  The basic proposition is that in the ordinary case a breach of statutoryduty does not, by itself, give rise to any private law cause of action.  However a private law cause of action will arise if it canbe shown, as a matter of construction of the statute, that the statutory duty was imposed for the protection of a limited class ofthe public and the Parliament intended to confer on members of that class a private right of action for breach of the duty.  Thereis no general rule by reference to which it can be decided whether a statute does create such a right of action but there are a numberof indicators.  If the statute provides no other remedy for its breach and the Parliamentary intention to protect a limited classis shown, that indicates that there may be a private right of action since otherwise there is no method of securing the protectionthe statute was intended to confer.  If the statute does provide some other means of enforcing the duty that will normally indicatethat the statutory right was intended to be enforceable by those means and not by private right of action: <i>Cutler v. Wandsworth Stadium Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] AC 398</a>; <i>Lonrho Ltd. v. Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd.

It is still possible to show that on thetrue construction of the statute the protected class was intended by Parliament to have a private remedy.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  I turn to examine the statutory provisions to see if there is any legislative intent to confer on a person in the position of theclaimant a private right of action against an employment agency.  As I have stated above, I am of the view that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 57(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> was intended for the protection of those seeking employment through an employment agency.  My view is reinforced when I have regardto the preamble of the Ordinance, which stated that it is âto provide for <i>the protection of the wages of employees, to regulate</i> general conditions of employment and <i>employment agencies, and for matters connected therewith.</i>â (Emphasis supplied) Further, under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10(3)</a> of the Regulations, an employment agency is required to display in a conspicuous position at his place of business a notice containingthe provisions in the Regulations regarding the amount of commission he is allowed to receive from a person seeking employment, nodoubt to serve as notice and reminder to persons seeking employment that the agency is prohibited by law to demand from them anysum in excess of the statutory limit.  I do not think it matters that other provisions in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57#p12" class="autolink_findacts">Part XII</a> of the Ordinance (in which <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 57(a)</a> is found) are more concerned with the regulation of employment agencies and Miss Po may well be correct in saying that the purposeof this part of the Ordinance is to maintain the integrity of the labour market.  The fact remains that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 57(a)</a> and the related provisions, being <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 60(7)</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s62.html" class="autolink_findacts">62</a>(h) of the Ordinance and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 10(2)</a>, (3) and the Second Schedule of the Regulations are clearly designed for the protection of those seeking employment through employmentagencies.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  It is also pertinent to have regard to the fact that the obligation imposed on employment agencies not to receive from those seekingemployment a commission in excess of the prescribed amount is a simple, specific and limited duty.  It does not involve the makingof any difficult or delicate decision or the exercise of subjective judgment.  If the duty created were of this nature, in the wordsof Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>X (Minors), supra</i>. at 747D,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ in such a context it would require exceptionally clear statutory language to show a parliamentary intention that those responsiblefor carrying out these difficult functions should be liable in damages if, on subsequent investigation with the benefit of hindsight,it was shown that they had reached an erroneous conclusion and therefore failed to discharge their statutory duties.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  See also the application of the above dicta in <i>Clunis v.

Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, ex p.

In my view, there is such an indicator in favour of a private right of action in the presentsituation. </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The criminal sanction imposed on an employment agency would not be a sufficient remedy to those who had paid a commission in excessof the prescribed amount.  This would give no financial protection to those who are most in need of such protection and it was mainlyfor the protection of this class of persons that section 57(a) and the related provisions were enacted.  It would be right to interpretthe statute as conferring a right of action, despite the existence of a criminal sanction. </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  As for Miss Poâs submission that the claimant must establish that the alleged breach of statutory duty would give rise to thekind of damage generally remediable in tort, I think this has been satisfied here.  It would suffice if the breach of duty âwouldbe likely to cause to a member of the class for whose benefit or protection it was imposed either personal injury, injury to propertyor economic lossâ (<i>Pickering v. Liverpool Daily Post and Echo Newspapers Ltd</i>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%202%20AC%20370" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 2 AC 370</a> at 420C, per Lord Bridge).  There is no rule against recovery of economic loss in an action for breach of statutory duty where theplaintiff can establish that the purpose of the statute was to protect his financial interest (<i>Rickless v. United Artists Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20QB%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 QB 40).</a></p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  For the above reasons, I rule that there is a valid cause of action for breach of statutory duty.

If she had lodged her claim in the Labour Tribunaland this tribunal had declined jurisdiction and transferred the claim to the Small Claims Tribunal under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/453/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10(1)</a> and (2) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a>, the Small Claims Tribunal would have jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim under paragraph 1A of the Scheduleto <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap. 338</a>. </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  What falls to be determined here is whether the claimantâs claim is within the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.  If it is,the Small Claims Tribunal would have exceeded its jurisdiction in trying the claim.  The argument of counsel was centred on paragraphs1(b) and 3 in the Schedule to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a>.  It was submitted by Miss Po that insofar as the claimantâs claim is based on a claim forrestitution founded on economic duress or on the fact that the parties were not <i>in pari delicto</i>, it is a claim for a sum of money which arises from the failure of the defendant to comply with the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 57(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>.  Therefore the claim falls within paragraph 1(b) of the Schedule to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a> and is within the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal. Insofar as the claimantâs claim is founded on breach of statutory duty, Miss Poâs submission was that paragraph 3 of the Scheduleis not applicable as this is not âa cause of action, founded in tortâ.  On behalf of the claimant, Mr Ling submitted that herclaim for restitution founded on economic duress or not <i>in pari delicto</i> is not caught by paragraph 1(b) of the Schedule.  As a fallback position, he submitted that the claim based on breach of statutoryduty is clearly âa claim for a sum of money â¦ in respect of a cause of action founded in tort â¦ arising from â¦ a breach ofa duty imposed by â¦ [an] enactmentâ, i.e. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 57(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>.  Hence, by virtue of paragraph 3 of the Schedule, the Labour Tribunal would have no jurisdiction to hear the claim. </p>    <p class="heading">Is the claim within paragraph 1(b) of the Schedule?</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Mr Ling raised a number of arguments that the claim, insofar as it is based on economic duress or not <i>in pari delicto</i>, is not within paragraph 1(b) of the Schedule to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a>.  Firstly, he submitted that all the various paragraphs of the Schedulerefer to self-contained causes of action or remedies.  Hence, paragraph 1(b) should be construed in the same way as referring toa complete cause of action, as opposed to a factual event which merely forms part of the basis of a claim.  If paragraph 1(b) isconstrued in this light, this paragraph is not apt to cover a cause of action founded on economic duress because there are otherelements required to establish such a cause of action, such as pressure and causation, not mentioned in this paragraph which onlyrefers to the failure of a person to comply with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>.  Likewise, for the cause of action based on not <i>in pari delicto</i>, the cause of action is not founded merely on the failure of the defendant to comply with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 57(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, so the words in paragraph 1(a) are again not apposite to include such a cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  I do not accept this argument.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7(1)</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a> provides that the Labour Tribunal shall have jurisdiction to hear âthe claimsâ specified in the Schedule.  The Schedulemakes provisions for various types of claims for this purpose.  A âclaimâ is not the same thing as a âcause of actionâ, thelatter denotes the factual or legal basis out of which a claim arose.  Paragraph 1 provides for a claim for a sum of money whichâarises fromâ the breach of a term of a contract of employment, the breach of a term of a contract of apprenticeship, and thefailure of a person to comply with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> or the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/47" class="autolink_findacts">Apprenticeship Ordinance</a>.  I do not think the wording of paragraph 1 or of the other paragraphs in the Schedule would warrant a requirement that the <i>entire</i> legal or factual basis of a claim should be spelled out.  I say this for two reasons.  The various kinds of claims in the Scheduleappear to be framed in fairly broad terms, see in particular paragraphs 4, 5 and 7.  If it were intended that the entire legal orfactual basis must be set out, one would have expected more precise language to be used.  Further, the words used in paragraph 1are âarises fromâ, which may leave room for debate as to the degree of causal connection required between the claim and the basisthat gives rise to the claim, and this is another argument advanced by counsel which I will deal with.  If the entire legal or factualbasis were required to be spelled out, one would have expected a more restrictive expression to be used. </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Next, Mr Ling submitted that the words in paragraph 1(b) (i.e. âthe failure of a person to comply with the provisions of the EmploymentOrdinanceâ) should connote an <i>omission</i> to perform a positive duty and they are not apt to cover the <i>commission</i> of a prohibited act.  He argued that as section 57(a) has not imposed any duty on an employment agency to charge a person seekingemployment any commission at all, the making of an excessive demand for an agency fee or the receipt of an excessive fee was nota âfailure to complyâ with section 57(a).  I also reject this submission.  The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> makes provisions for the performance of obligations and the prohibition of acts by the parties concerned.  If a provision is contravened,whether this relates to a positive duty or a prohibited act, there is nonetheless a failure to comply with a provision of the Ordinance. I see no justification to cut down the meaning and scope of paragraph 1(b). </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Lastly, Mr Ling argued that the words âarises fromâ in paragraph 1(b) should be construed to require an immediate or proximatecause between the claim and the basis giving rise to the claim, in this instance, the failure to comply with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 57(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>.  I was referred by Mr Ling and Miss Po to a number of cases in which the courts have construed the words âarises fromâ in othercontexts.  I shall not refer to them individually as they are ultimately of limited assistance.  I have studied them for the generalapproach in construing these words.  As submitted by Miss Po, the starting point is to consider the expression in its ordinary andnatural meaning.  âAriseâ followed by âfromâ or âout ofâ means âresultâ.  The expression signifies a causal connectionbetween the subject and the predicate event.  In the construction of this expression by the courts, the degree of proximity in thecausal connection varies according to the context in which the expression was found.  At the liberal end, the words have been giventhe wider meaning of âin connection withâ.  At the restrictive end, the words have been construed to mean âcaused byâ, assignifying an immediate and direct causal relationship.  This is what Mr Ling has argued here. </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Mr Ling submitted that the causal connection should not be a tenuous one bearing in mind that the Labour Tribunal is a specialisttribunal set up to facilitate the speedy and economic disposal of labour disputes and such an objective would be defeated if thetribunal is taken up with claims that have only a tenuous connection with areas of law within its staple work.  This may be a validreason to require something more than a tenuous connection between the claim and the basis that gives rise to the claim, i.e. thefailure to comply with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 57(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> in this instance.  However, I am not persuaded that the degree of connection required should be immediate, direct or proximate. I do not think there is anything in the language used in paragraph 1 of the Schedule or in the context of the provision that wouldrequire such an interpretation. </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  In my judgment, the degree of causal connection required in this instance should be a reasonably close connection.  Giving the expressionâarises fromâ its ordinary and natural meaning, I ask myself whether the claim based on economic duress or not <i>in pari delicto</i> arose from the defendantâs failure to comply with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 57(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>.  I am satisfied that this is the case.  I hold that the claimantâs claim, insofar as it is based on economic duress or not <i>in pari delicto</i>, falls within paragraph 1(b) of the Schedule and is within the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.  I turn to consider the claimantâsfallback position on paragraph 3 of the Schedule.</p>    <p class="heading">Is the claim excluded by paragraph 3 of the Schedule?</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  On the plain wording of paragraph 3, it would seem to me that the claim insofar as it is based on breach of statutory duty is excludedfrom the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal, as it is a cause of action founded in tort arising from a breach of duty imposed by<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 57(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>.  An action for breach of statutory duty is an action in tort, this is the established view and it has been recognised in textbookson the law of torts.  I am unable to accept Miss Poâs submission that the claim based on breach of statutory duty is not âa causeof action, founded in tortâ because it is in essence a claim for refund for overpayment.  I do not propose to go over the legalbasis of the claim founded on breach of statutory duty as I have analysed this when I rule that there is a valid cause of actionon this ground. </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Miss Po also submitted that the claim should not be excluded under paragraph 3 of the Schedule as this would give rise to tensionbetween paragraphs 1(b) and 3 and might make it difficult to apply the provisions in the Schedule in practice.  I agree with Mr Lingthat it is clear from the opening words of paragraph 3 (i.e. ânotwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2â), it was envisaged that therewould be an element of overlap between the claims in paragraphs 1 and 2 and the claim in paragraph 3.  Take for instance a claimfor a sum of money which arose from the breach of an express or implied term of a contract of employment to provide a safe systemof work.  This would fall within paragraph 1(a) and yet one would have no difficulty in seeing that it would be excluded from thejurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal as this claim is in respect of a cause of action founded in tort whether arising from a breachof contract or a breach of duty imposed by the common law or by statute.  As for paragraph 1(b), Mr Ling has suggested that thisis meant to cover simple claims in which there is an express provision in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> or the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/47" class="autolink_findacts">Apprenticeship Ordinance</a> governing the right of recovery in the event of failure to comply with the statutory provision.  He mentioned as an example <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 40</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> which governs the payment of holiday pay.  Where there is failure of a person to comply with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> and the means of enforcing the right which arose is provided in the Ordinance itself, there is no need to rely on a cause of actionfounded on breach of statutory duty.  I agree with his submission that where a claimant is driven to rely on a private right of actionimpliedly conferred by statute, as in this case, the claim is excluded from the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal by virtue ofparagraph 3 in the Schedule. </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  For the above reason, I rule in favour of the claimant that she could advance a claim founded on breach of statutory duty and asthe claim is not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal by virtue of paragraph 3, the Small Claims Tribunal hasnot exceeded its jurisdiction in trying the claim. </p>    <p class="heading">Orders</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  As I have ruled against the defendant both on the point of law and on the issue of jurisdiction, I dismiss the defendantâs appeal. I make an order <i>nisi</i> that the claimant is to have the costs of the appeal and that the claimantâs own costs are to be taxed in accordance with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(S.
