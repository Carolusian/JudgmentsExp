The Plaintiffhas been in existence for some years and it is of a substantial size. It is virtually a one-product company. The Plaintiff's salesfigures both in Hong Kong and in the People's Republic are impressive. For example, in 1995 to 1996 the Hong Kong sales figures wereover $36 million and in the People's Republic of China they have reached $107 million. This is no small feat when one considers thateven at the sales price of approximately $15.00 a bottle of cough medicine, that can represent a substantial figure to someone inthe People's Republic. The sales in the People's Republic have gone from about $210,000.00 in 1982 and have increased year on yearapart from a slight dip in about 1990 through to the present sales figures.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The Plaintiff's product is sold in a distinctive packaging. One might describe it, perhaps, as being slightly old-fashioned but itis really traditional because when compared with other packaging, one can see that it is not in fact old-fashioned but it is, asI say, traditional. It has a background pattern which consists of what at first glance might look like medallions but in fact arecombinations of Chinese characters in a more or less stylistic form and these have been registered as trade marks. Then on each sideof the box are different depictions that are normally contained in rectangular boxes. It is difficult to describe the packaging satisfactorily.However, I am certain that it is an easily recognised packaging. The Plaintiff sells the product widely in Hong Kong. It is availablenot only in traditional medicine stores but also in what would be open-shelf stores, for example, supermarkets and some of the chainsof retail chemists.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The Plaintiff has for some time been bedevilled by imitations of its product and imitations of its packaging. This has occurred,for example, in the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China, of course, registers trade marks and the Plaintiff'strade marks and name are, I understand, registered in China and they have been able to stop the sale and distribution of those productswhich incorporate their trade marks. The Plaintiff, however, in 1994 became aware of a product which is manufactured by the 1st Defendant.The packaging of one of the samples which the Plaintiff obtained in 1994 has been exhibited.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> It is not altogether clear to me from looking at the packaging, including the bar code, that this product was necessarily manufacturedin Hong Kong. It may possibly be that the 1st Defendant's name itself, Chai Tin Sow Medicine Factory, would give that away but Iam not convinced of that. One thing that I am convinced about, however, is that anybody who looks at that would at once be confusedin to thinking that it might be the Plaintiff's product. The Defendants have filed evidence saying that not even a moron in a hurrywould be confused. I should only say, as politely as I can, that that is probably adventurous advocacy at its best. It is unnecessaryfor me to describe the Defendant's product since that can best be seen from looking at it but there are so many features which lookso similar, to my eye at any rate, to the Plaintiff's product that I have no doubt that anybody seeing it in a shop would be confused.He or she might easily pick it up thinking it was the Plaintiff's or having seen the Plaintiff's side by side for some reason makea mistake when he took it and may never be aware of the mistake he has made. The Plaintiff's evidence shows that they attempted tomake a complaint about this in the People's Republic back in 1994 but were told that because the trade marks used on that productwere not the same as the Plaintiff's that they could not do anything about it. So the matter rested.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The Defendants' evidence shows that this product has in fact been on sale in the People's Republic for some 3 1/2 years. I have tosay that the sales figures of the Defendants' product are nothing like the Plaintiff's. The comparative figures show that there weresales in 1993-4 of some $3.7 million. However, there seems to have been a big drop in the Defendants' sales in 1994-5 to somethingover $1 million creeping up again in 1995-6 to $1.8 million and so far this year there has been an increase up to September of salesof $2.7 million.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> However, there has been a slight change, apparently, in the packaging which the Defendants have used in the People's Republic. Oneof the changes has come about because the 2nd Defendant has now, since March of this year, become the distributor of the 1st Defendant'sproducts in China and Hong Kong and that has caused a further yellow rectangular box to be printed at the bottom of the front panel.There has also been a slight alteration to the extent that the 1st Defendant now puts on its packaging its name "Chai Tin Sow" inblack characters at the top of the centre panel on the front of the box whereas before it used golden characters "Sai Yeung Sum".However, this change, to my mind, again is not particularly significant because it is the overall look of the packaging which, tomy mind, is so noticeable and impressive.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The Plaintiff next became aware of the 1st Defendant's product in September of this year when it became apparent that the 1st Defendantwas now marketing its product in Hong Kong and it seems to be accepted that that only took place in about September of this year.This was accompanied by a certain amount of advertising and point of sales advertising which was the matter which drew the productto the Plaintiff's attention again. As a result of that, the Plaintiff consulted its trade mark agent in Hong Kong and matters thentook their course. A letter was written on the Plaintiff's behalf to the Defendants which met with a rebuff and this was followedthen by the commencement of this Action.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Up until the filing of the Defendants' evidence, it appeared that the Defendants were disposed to defend the application for an interlocutoryinjunction to prevent further distribution of the packaging complained of. But with the filing of their evidence, which was afterthe first hearing of this summons, the Defendants indicated that they were disposed to change the packaging for Hong Kong alone andnot for China. However, the change in the packaging is merely a change in the background colouring of the packaging and a changein some of the colouring on the rectangular boxes but not a total change and in some respects only a change in the shade of yellowto a darker gold and in another respect a change from a darker shade of silver or grey to a lighter shade of silver or grey.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The bone of contention in this case really, however, is what form of wording the injunction or an undertaking should take. I exploredthat with Mr. Kotewall Q.C. who appears on behalf of the Defendants last week and it emerged that really any undertaking or any injunctionwould have to be worded in the usual form in a way that would prevent manufacture, distribution and sale, but if the Defendants wereto be permitted to continue their old packaging for sale of goods to China, there would have to be a <i>proviso</i> which permitted that.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In my view, taking the position in Hong Kong first, it seems to me clear that there must either be an undertaking or an injunctionto prevent distribution of the old packaging. There, to my mind, is no doubt about it. There can scarcely be any defence to a caseof passing off based on get-up. This is of course not a case of counterfeiting as such because the trade marks are different butit comes as close to an exact reproduction as any case of get-up, in my view, does.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Of course, imitation of get-up on its own and copying on its own does not give a cause of action in itself, but it does indicatethis that if the Defendant has produced something which is so close to the Plaintiff's product, the Court is usually not inclinedto exercise its imagination to believe that the Defendant has failed to produce something which is likely to be passed off. In theabsence of a full explanation as to how the Defendant arrived at its packaging which is the subject of complaint, the Court not unnaturallytakes an adverse view as to any intentions which the Defendant might have and as to the likely result of any actions.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In this case, the 1st Defendant really did not explain how its packaging was arrived at. It said in its evidence that it had instructedan artist by the name of Kam Garden to make its packaging. But I am told that when the only documentary evidence which was produced,is properly understood, all it relates to is the colour separations. That is hardly design work in itself. So I proceed upon thebasis that the Defendant has not really explained how it came by this packaging. I draw from that the obvious conclusion that itwould be a very difficult thing for it to explain.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> I then turn to the new packaging, so to speak, which the 1st Defendant has devised, the one with the black and gold colour as opposedto the white and red colour. In my view, Mr. Liao Q.C. is correct when he says that that too should be stopped. As he has correctlypointed out, the situation might be different had the Defendants not put their red and white old packaging on the market, but havingdone so and the similarities being so close, the effect of this yellow and gold packaging may well be to cause customers to believethat this was some kind of deluxe packaging or otherwise. In effect, what it would be doing would be to permit a possible continuationof hte deception. In view of hte fact that the Defendant is changing its packaging, I consider that that change should be much furtherapart from the Plaintiff's packaging than this yellow and gold which has been produced. I would mention that it is the Defendants'case that its name "Chai Tin Sow" is crucially important. If that be the case, the get-up of the packaging becomes less importantand the consequent damage by causing any change becomes less important.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> I next come to consider the question of whether there should be a proviso which permits sale in China. I have to say that this hascaused me grave anxiety and caused me to consider the matter particularly over the adjournment as to whether an injunction should,in effect, be granted. I hesitate because one comes with, first of all, the notion that interlocutory injunctions are temporary andspeedy matters and should not be granted where there has been lengthy periods of delay. I, for one, consider that that is a veryimportant starting point to a consieration of whether there should be an interlocutory injunction.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> It impinges on a number of matters. It impinges, first of all, because very often what the Court decides is best to do is to preservethe status quo. If there has been a long period of delay, the status quo will clearly be to allow the Defendant to continue to dowhat it has been doing. It impinges too on the question of the damage. If the Defendant has been doing something for a long periodof time, it is unlikely that the damage that will be caused by continuation until trial will be of such an irreparable nature thatit should not be permitted to continue. It impinges too on the question of whether the Plaintiff has established the seriousnessof the damage that will be caused by what the Defendant is doing. If the Plaintiff has been content to sit by for a substantial period,then it is unlikely that it considered the matter so seriously and was seriously concerned about the damage that was being caused.If the Plaintiff is not seriously concerned about the damage which has been caused should the Court then assume that it is seriousdamage which is likely to be caused?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> However, having borne these considerations in mind, one also has to consider what is being allowed. In the first place, one of theproblems with a proviso of the nature which I have indicated which would allow the Defendants to manufacture in Hong Kong and sellto China is that of course they have no control over the products once they have been manufactured and sold. Those products couldconceivably come back to Hong Kong again. There is no continuing control either by contract or otherwise over those products.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> I consider that an important consideration in deciding whether to include a proviso to enable manufacture in Hong Kong for sale overseasis whether it has been demonstrated that the Defendant has a legitimate trade to protect. In my view this has not been made out inthis case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The Court also has to consider, in my view, what are going to be the issues in the case. I taxed Mr. Kotewall Q.C. on this. At theend, it seemed that at this stage, at any rate, the likely defence in the case was a defence possibly as to the grant of an injunction,it being said that the Defendant having sold its goods in China for the last 3 1/2 years, and one can assume 4 years until trial,it would have built up a significant reputation of its own and therefore should not be enjoined from doing what it is doing.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Mr. Liao Q.C., for the Plaintiff, cited to me the <i><u>Electrolux Limited v. Electrics and Another</u></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=71%20RPC%2023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">71 RPC 23</a> where the Court of Appeal indicated in a trade mark case that substantial periods of delay on its own are not sufficient to debara plaintiff from obtaining an injunction. Mr. Kotewall Q.C. rightly pointed out that the case cited in that judgment related to astatutory right. That may be right but I would be more than surprised if a period of 3 1/2 years' delay would be sufficient to debara plaintiff from obtaining final relief of an injunction at trial particularly in the circumstances of this case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Mr. Liao Q.C. has cited to me the case of <i><u>Series 5 Software Limited v.

By doing so, I am not of course specifically granting an injunction which affects China.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> I do draw this to attention that the cause of action which prevents somebody from manufacturing what are called instruments of deceptionwithin the jurisdiction for use outside the jurisdiction and the cause of action which allows someone to sue in respect of a tortcommitted overseas, thus enabling a passing off action to be brought within the jurisdiction for passing off which takes place outsidethe jurisdiction, are things which experience shows are known by those practitioners within the industrial property field but arenot necessarily known outside. I would not necessarily attribute that knowledge say to a trade mark agent. Whether they were consultedin 1994 by the Plaintiff or not, I know not. But even if they were, I would not necessarily expect them to know that it would bepossible to bring action in Hong Kong in respect of a passing off which was primarily taking place in the People's Republic.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> In my view, looking at the case as a whole, however, the following matters appear to me to be important. First of all, this is tomy mind, as I have said, a very clear case where the get-up of the Plaintiff's product has been copied and a very strong case ofpassing off based on get-up. Secondly, although the Defendants have been selling in the People's Republic for the last 3 1/2 years,their sales by comparison with the Plaintiff's have been very small and from what I can see from the evidence have been confinedto a small area. There has, however, been with the introduction of the 2nd Defendant, who is also a distributor of other well-knownproducts, perhaps an increased vigour in the 1st Defendant's sales and it cannot be assumed that the Defendant's sales in the People'sRepublic are going to remain static from now until the trial. Indeed the indications are that they are possibly increasing to a significantamount. Hence, not only will the sales go up but the area of the sales is likely to increase. The Plaintiff has given a list of placeswhere their products are on sale in the People's Republic and they are diverse.
