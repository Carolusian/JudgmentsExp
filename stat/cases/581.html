These diamonds were stolen in thecourse of the plaintiffâs attempt to sell them, and in a bid to recover their value the plaintiff has instituted these proceedingsagainst the fifteen defendants who have been joined as parties thereto.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Some of these fifteen defendants have not been served.  Others have had default judgment entered against them.  These particularinterlocutory applications have as their focus two defendants, the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants, who were purportedly served with process out of the jurisdiction, and whom also have had default judgments entered againstthem.  In addition, charging orders <i>nisi</i> and stop orders were entered on the strength of the default judgment, and a worldwide Mareva injunction has been granted freezingtheir assets.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> These two defendants, Mr Rajesh Mehta and his uncle Mr Vijay Mehta, are members of a diamond dealing family.  Each resides in Belgium. They are unhappy by the treatment that has been accorded them by the plaintiff. Each objects strenuously to the assertion of jurisdictionover them by the Hong Kong court, and wishes the exercise of such jurisdiction to be set aside.  Coterminus with this relief, eachseeks the setting aside of the default judgment together with the Mareva injunction and the charging and stop orders.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Pursuant to their desire to rectify the situation, and to seek to set aside the primary exercise of jurisdiction over them, togetherwith the subsequent forms of procedural relief, the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants caused three summonses to be issued, respectively dated 3 June 2004, 27 August 2004, and 28 August 2004.  A fourth summons,dated 8 October 2004, was also issued, which has as its subject matter the striking out of parts of an amended pleading against themin conspiracy.  The latter I mention for completeness only; it has no relevance to the main jurisdictional fight, and for presentpurposes I do not intend to deal with it further in this judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The date for the hearing of the first three summonses was fixed for 3 November 2004, with an additional day reserved.  The evidentialambit of the case appeared considerable.  A great deal of evidence had been assembled during the course of these proceedings; infact, just shortly before the hearing was due to start Mr Lane, the plaintiffâs solicitor, had sworn his eleventh affidavit dated29 October 2004.  For their part the defendants had put in their own evidence : Mr Rajesh Mehta, the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant, had put in two affirmations of 3 June 2004 and 13 October 2004, and his uncle, Mr Vijay Mehta, had filed his own affirmationof 11 October 2004.  Neither, however, thus far had had the opportunity to respond to the latest affidavit of Mr Lane, and accordingly,by summons dated 2 November 2004, leave was sought, and granted, to introduce into evidence the 3<sup>rd</sup> Affirmation of Mr Rajesh Mehta.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> In addition, in anticipation of the application to discharge the existing orders against his clients, Mr John Scott SC, leading counselfor the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants, had compiled a lengthy and detailed skeleton argument.  In the introduction apologies were tendered for its length anddetail, but in truth such reticence was unnecessary : absent this document, it would have been difficult indeed for the <i>inter partes</i> judge hearing applications to set aside <i>ex parte</i> orders to make sense of the almost labyrinthine course that this litigation had thus far followed, and the court found these writtensubmissions to be of great assistance.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> However, the procedural complexities of this case were to take a further and unexpected turn.  Confronted with Mr Scottâs skeletonargument, the plaintiff chose to throw in the towel and not to oppose discharge of the various orders that they had accumulated againstthe 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants.  This stark fact, which no doubt resulted from counselsâ advice, was communicated to the court, and to those actingfor the defendant, by letter from the plaintiffâs solicitors dated 2 November 2004, that is, the day preceding the commencementof this hearing.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Nevertheless, in this letter it was made clear that the plaintiffâs concession, and the decision not to oppose the defendantsâapplications, was not to be taken as acceptance of the validity of the evidence and argument filed by the defendants in oppositionto the plaintiffâs allegations of fraud, and that the intention was for the plaintiff to make an <i>ex parte</i> application to the court for leave to further amend its pleading, and to seek fresh Order 11 and Mareva relief against the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants based upon the allegation of conspiracy to defraud the plaintiff of US$7,154,575 worth of diamonds.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> At the end of the day, therefore, the focus of this judgment became not the discharge of the existing orders â such discharge isconceded â but with the application for fresh orders permitting service upon the defendants out of the jurisdiction, for new <i>Mareva</i> relief, and for leave to file and serve a Re-re-Amended Statement of Claim, a draft of which was exhibited to a second affidavitof Mr George of the plaintiffâs solicitors.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Upon that which at the outset was characterised as a hearing <i>ex parte</i> on notice, it was initially suggested by Mr Bunting SC, who appeared for the plaintiff, that the role of Mr Scott should be limitedto that of merely âassisting the courtâ in accordance with the practice laid down in the Supreme Court Practice at 29/1/40. This contention was rejected.  I saw no reason, in these most unusual circumstances, why Mr Scott should be in any way constrainedin his submissions.  During preliminary argument Mr Scott made it clear that he did not seek to put in further evidence, nor, shouldhe be unsuccessful in preventing such new relief, would he attempt to have a further bite of the cherry in terms of an applicationto discharge.  Hence, the hearing became, in effect, a hearing <i>inter partes</i> on short notice, and was treated by both counsel as such, albeit as Mr Scott made clear â and it was not suggested otherwise âin so participating his clients were in no sense submitting to the jurisdiction.</p>    <p class="heading">The pleaded case</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> At this juncture it may be useful to comment briefly upon the manner in which this case has evolved against the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Whilst they are presently asserted to be part of a conspiracy to defraud the plaintiff, this was not always the position.  At theoutset the plea mounted against them was solely in terms of their alleged liability as guarantors pursuant to a series of bank facilitiesâ âMurabaha agreementsâ â entered into between the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, of which the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants were directors until 2003.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Thus was the plaintiffâs claim initially formulated in the Statement of Claim filed on 13 October 2003.  However, on 16 October2003, by amended Writ and Statement of Claim, a cause of action in conspiracy was introduced against these defendants.  This latterplea did not stay in place for very long, however, because on 20 January 2004, upon an application seeking to enter default judgment,counsel then acting for the plaintiff gave an undertaking to the court to abandon the conspiracy claim against the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants in order, it seems, to facilitate the entry of default judgment.  In fact, judgment in default was entered on 5 February2004, based solely upon the plea that the defendants had failed to honour their obligation under the personal guarantees : this judgmentwas in the sums of some US$15.46 million and GBP13,750.  This position was confirmed by a letter dated 5 May 2004 from the plaintiffâssolicitors to those acting for the defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> By order of Lugar-Mawson J dated 20 August 2004 leave was granted to the plaintiff to re-amend the Statement of Claim.  This re-amendmentappears to have maintained allegations of conspiracy to defraud against the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants, although such was not reflected in the prayer, doubtless because by this stage default judgment in terms of the sumsclaimed under the guarantees already had been entered against them.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The pleading sequence was not yet over, however.  Consistent with the decision not to attempt to defend the earlier assertion ofjurisdiction over the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants, and thereby not to object, <i>inter alia</i>, to the discharge of the default judgment, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit of Mr George ââ which supports the application for the fresh orders as now sought â exhibits thereto a draft Re-re-AmendedStatement of Claim, wherein the particulars of the claim in conspiracy against, <i>inter alia</i>, the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants are reamended, and which now includes within the prayer a claim consequential upon such asserted conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> It is this new re-re-amended pleading which now forms the subject of one of the applications now before this court, namely, the applicationfor leave to file and serve this document, and it is a draft pleading the content of which also has been referred to during argumentregarding the desired fresh exercise both of Order 11 jurisdiction and of the <i>Mareva</i> jurisdiction.  It is to these applications that I now turn.</p>    <p class="heading">The fresh applications</p>    <p><u>Order 11 jurisdiction</u></p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The original order granting leave to serve the 1<sup>st</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants out of the jurisdiction had been granted on <i>ex parte</i> application by Pang J on 9 July 2003.  That order, which it is now conceded is to be set aside, was granted on the basis of two affidavits,namely that of the 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit of Mr Dinshaw, the plaintiffâs London solicitor, dated 1 July 2003, and the 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit of Mr Lane, of the plaintiffâs Hong Kong solicitors, dated 9 July 2003.  The basis of the application was put on thebasis of Order 11, rule 1(1)(c), namely that âthe claim is brought against a person duly served within or out of the jurisdictionand a person out of the jurisdiction is a necessary or proper party theretoâ.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> On behalf of the plaintiff, the extraterritorial reach of the Hong Kong jurisdiction, in the form of service upon the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants of the re-re-amended pleading, is now asserted on the basis both of Order 11, rule 1(1)(c) and further on the basis ofsubparagraph (f), which provides that service out is permissible when âthe claim is founded on a tort and the damage was sustained,or resulted from an act committed, within the jurisdictionâ.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Mr Bunting SC submits that this case meets the requirements of both heads, and that in all the circumstances this is a proper casefor service out of the jurisdiction.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> As to (c), he says that the 2<sup>nd</sup> to the 5<sup>th</sup> defendants and the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> defendants have already been properly served within the jurisdiction, and that implicit within the conspiracy claims there are realissues between the plaintiff and the other conspiracy defendants which the plaintiff may reasonably ask the court to try : Order11, rule 4(1)(d).  Moreover the 6<sup>th</sup> and the 7<sup>th</sup> defendants are âproperâ parties to the claim in that if both had been within the jurisdiction they would both have been properparties to the claim : see <i>Dicey &amp; Morris, The Conflict of Laws, Vol.1 (30<sup>th</sup> ed.), at para 11-148</i>.  Mr Bunting further noted that there is now deposed to the assertion that there is a good cause of action against these defendants: see Order 11, rule 4(1)(b).</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The submission that the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants fall within the rubric of (c) is an assertion which, in the circumstances of this case, I am unable to accept.  An analysisof the state of play within the proceedings against the other defendants joined in this case reveals that, at present, there is currentlynot one âlisâ between plaintiff and any of these defendants which is âliveâ.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> In this connection it is perhaps worth summarizing the procedural position, which is thus : the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant (the original debtor) has not been served, and in fact has been subject to summary judgment in England; default judgmenthas been entered against the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants; the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant is now deceased, and there are no personal representatives; the 8<sup>th</sup> defendant, together with the 11<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> defendants, were all joined to this action for the purpose of obtaining <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> relief; default judgment has been entered against the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> defendants; the 14<sup>th</sup> defendant has not been served; and the 15<sup>th</sup> defendant, a private Hong Kong company, has had no cause of action pleaded against it, and has been joined to this case because itsshares have been subject to the erstwhile Mareva relief to which the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants earlier were subject.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The established jurisprudence as to the joinder of foreign parties on the ânecessary or properâ basis makes it clear that thisis a ground for service out of the jurisdiction with respect to which particular care must be taken; as this court noted in <i>Inchcape JDH Ltd v. Baltrans Exhibition &amp; Removal Ltd &amp; anr.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20HKLRD%201278" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] HKLRD 1278</a>, at 1282, this ground has traditionally been set apart from other categories within Order 11, possibly because there was a tendencyfor its provisions to be creatively utilized in order to found jurisdiction when difficulty was encountered in fitting a particularcase within the more âsubstantiveâ subheads of this rule, and it is important that there should be no question of permittingan existing defendant to become, in effect, a sort of jurisdictional Trojan Horse.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The circumstances of this case provide an apt, if somewhat unusual, example.  Where there is no âliveâ issue between the plaintiffand any of the other defendants, as is the case here, it seems to me to be hard to get home on the argument that in such circumstancethe 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants can be regarded as âproper partiesâ within the accepted meaning of that phrase : there are simply no âreal issuesbetween the plaintiff and the other [conspiracy] defendants which the plaintiff may reasonably ask the court to tryâ.  In thisconnection I recognize the plaintiffâs fall-back position to the effect that the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> defendants, against whom default judgment has been entered, are said to be attempting to set aside such judgments, but Mr Buntingfairly accepts, I think, that this court must consider the situation as it prevails as at the date of this application for leaveto serve out, and that is that these default judgments currently are in place.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> For this reason alone in my view Mr Bunting fails on his argument under (c), and perhaps it is in recognition of this fact that hemounts his alternative argument under (f), submitting in this regard that the plaintiffâs claim against the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants is in the tort of conspiracy and that the damage was sustained, or resulted from, an act committed within the jurisdiction. Taken together with the fact that the plaintiff, through the affidavit of Mr George, has deposed to the fact that there is a goodcause of action, as required by Order 11, rule 4(1)(b), and also together with the matters raised in the affidavit evidence, it wassubmitted that a good case for service out thus had been established.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Mr Scott submits to the contrary.  He says that the requirements of (f) have not been met.  On the plaintiffâs case what overtact or acts on the part of his clients, he asks, took place in Hong Kong?  And how is it said that damage occurred in Hong Kong?</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> In this I think that Mr Scott is correct.  The âdamageâ in this case undoubtedly was suffered in Tokyo, where there appears tohave been delivery to an empty 4<sup>th</sup> floor of a building (which was <i>not</i> the address of the Mehta family company, Gembel Tokyo), at which point the âtrailâ, on the plaintiffâs own case, has gone cold. Whilst it is clear that the rule requires that there must be an act committed within the jurisdiction by the alleged tortfeasor,on the state of the evidence it is unclear what this is; in fact, this seems to be a similar problem which appears to have facedthe applicant for leave to serve out in <i>ABCI v. Banque Franco Tunisienne</i> [2003] 2 Lloydâs Rep 146, a case in which the cause of action was in conspiracy and in which the Court of Appeal set aside theleave granted below in reliance upon rule 1(1)(f).</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> In my view the analytical difficulty thus facing the plaintiff cannot simply be finessed under the head of a plea in conspiracy,and the position is <i>a fortiori</i> when there is factored into the equation that which I regard as the poor state of the evidence in conspiracy against the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants â as to which I have something further to say later in this judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Accordingly in my judgment the case for service out of the jurisdiction under (f) fails also.  In neither the assertion under (c)or (f) does the plaintiff meet the requirement of a âgood arguable caseâ, which is the degree of proof required by the courtat this stage to show that the case falls within one of the subparagraphs of Order 11 rule 1(1).</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> This however is not quite the end of the point.  If I be wrong in my view of the merits of the application under grounds (c) and(f), the further consideration arises as to whether, pursuant to Order 11 rule 4(2), that it has been made âsufficiently to appearto the court that the case is a proper one for service out of the jurisdiction under this Orderâ.  This general provision permitsthe court to exercise its discretion in all the circumstances of the case, so that, for example, special considerations apply whereproceedings are on foot in another jurisdiction, a fact which must be disclosed to the court since it is clearly highly germane tothe decision as to whether this âlong armâ jurisdictional rule should be exercised.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Had this case come to this court <i>de novo</i>, then, other things being equal it is unlikely that the new application as now made would have been affected by the ambit of rule4(2).  However this is not the position in this instance.  I agree with Mr Scott that in the exercise of its discretion in this applicationthe court is entitled to take into account the history of events, and in particular that which occurred (or, more precisely, didnot occur) in the first <i>ex parte</i> application before Pang J on 9 July 2003.  When the learned judge was dealing with that application â in the context of a casewhich at that time remained <i>solely</i> as a suit upon the guarantees â he was asked to grant leave to the plaintiff to serve the 6<sup>th</sup> and the 7<sup>th</sup> defendants in Belgium, but he was not told a number of significant matters, all of which were relevant to the <i>forum conveniens</i> considerations which are inherent in the exercise of discretion under Order 11.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The judge was not told of the fact that the proper law of the guarantees â which was the sole cause of action asserted at thatstage â was English, and that none of the parties had any connection with Hong Kong.  More particularly, however, he was not toldthat proceedings under the guarantees had been brought, and were continuing, against the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants in Belgium for the same debt, although Mr Dinshaw refers to the fact that âdemandâ on the guarantees has issued inBelgium, and at one stage Mr Lane makes passing reference to litigation in Belgium and the UK.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> It is difficult to understand why such economy of reference should have been regarded as necessary.  There could have been littlemore material, in the context of an application to serve out, than the fact that there were existing foreign proceedings relatingto precisely the same debt and involving precisely the like cause of action; as Burton J observed in the recent decision in <i>Network Telecom (Europe) Ltd v. Telephone Systems International Inc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%201%20All%20ER%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 1 All ER 418</a> (wherein âmirror imageâ proceedings had been served in the United States against the plaintiff) it is a serious matter for aforeigner to be put to the expense and inconvenience of being brought before the courts of England, and failure to make full andfair disclosure as to relevant foreign proceedings would, as in all without notice applications, justify the court in dischargingthe order.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Absent the analytical difficulty of bringing itself within grounds (c) and (f), on the basis such non-disclosure alone I should havedeclined to find that this case is a âproper oneâ for service out of the jurisdiction; a plaintiff is unable, in effect, to moveto âsanitiseâ the earlier non-disclosure by conceding, as here, that the earlier order be set aside, and then by mounting a newapplication untrammeled by that which has occurred in the earlier <i>ex parte</i> application.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> At the end of the day, therefore, in my judgment the plaintiff has failed, and failed clearly, in its renewed application for leaveto serve the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants out of the jurisdiction.  Accordingly the application is dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> This conclusion effectively spells the end of this case, at least as far as the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants are concerned.  These parties are not subject to the jurisdiction of this court, and indeed, consequent upon the concededdischarge of the earlier <i>ex parte</i> order of Pang J, such jurisdiction has never been established.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> The issue of primary jurisdiction is a fundamental consideration.  At the outset of argument Mr Bunting noted that it was entirelyin the discretion of the court as to the stage at which the court formally should make the orders discharging the earlier <i>ex parte</i> orders regarding the exercise of jurisdiction and the imposition of <i>Mareva</i> relief.  As to the latter, he asked the court to retain the status quo pending decision upon his renewed application.  Analogous,he said, was the situation in which the court hears application to discharge such relief, during which the plaintiff seeks to renewthe application if and in so far as the court should accede to the application to discharge the existing order; thus there can beno lacuna created between orders if in fact there is to be the grant of new relief, and thereby asset dissipation within such periodcan be avoided.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> There was some debate on the point between bench and bar, but in the event the court acceded to this application.  On reflection,this course was inappropriate in these circumstances.  There is here a distinction with a real difference.  In the more usual instancein which a court, after argument, is minded to discharge, but thereafter to regrant Mareva relief, there is no primary jurisdictionalproblem; the issue is solely whether the earlier breach of <i>ex parte</i> principles, generally within a material non-disclosure context, is sufficiently serious to preclude grant of a fresh order whereinthe circumstances of the case otherwise would justify such injunctive relief.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> In this instance, however, it is conceded that the earlier order must be set aside, and thus there is, and was, no valid exerciseof primary jurisdiction upon the basis of which injunctive relief may be granted : as Lord Mustill expressed the position in <i>Mercedes-Benz AG v. Leiduck</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%203%20HKC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 3 HKC 1 (PC)</a> â a case combining Order 11 and Mareva jurisdictions âboth of which should be exercised with great circumspectionâ â Mercedescould not bring themselves within the terms of Order 11, and thus could not have improved their position by starting incompetentproceedings, with the result that the earlier proceedings were âprocedurally meaninglessâ(<i>op cit</i>, page 9).</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> It follows, therefore, that as a matter of law, upon concession that the <i>ex parte</i> order of Pang J should be set aside, an order in those terms, together with an order setting aside the Mareva relief that was graftedthereon, should have been made immediately, without the delay incumbent in argument upon the fresh applications necessitated by suchconcession.</p>    <p><u>Mareva relief</u></p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> In light of the conclusion that has been reached as to the absence of jurisdiction in this case, the issue of the fresh applicationfor Mareva relief is thus effectively resolved.  Nevertheless, if and in so far as I may be held to be wrong upon the primary issue,I move now to consider the question of renewed injunctive relief.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Mr Bunting submits that a fresh Mareva is justified, but on a basis different to that upon which relief originally was granted <i>ex parte</i> by Lugar-Mawson J on 20 August 2004.  He notes that this earlier relief was premised upon a cause of action based upon the guaranteesexecuted by the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants.  However, this is no longer the basis asserted.  Mareva relief is now sought in support of the intended conspiracy claimagainst these defendants, as set out in the draft re-re-amended Statement of Claim, and further in aid of the pending Belgian proceedings,wherein the defendants have mounted an appeal (which is to be by way of rehearing) against the judgment that there has been enteredagainst them.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> It is said that there is a real risk that if Mareva relief is not granted that the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants will dissipate their assets and thereby render nugatory any judgment in these proceedings (or in the Belgian action ifthe appeal is dismissed).  In particular it is asserted that there is a real risk that substantial sums accruing to the 15<sup>th</sup> defendant herein, a Hong Kong company known as Valuable Resources Ltd, will be dissipated such as to render worthless any beneficialinterest the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants have in this company; in fact, it is said that such beneficial interest in VRL already has been transferred to juniormembers of the Mehta family (<i>vide</i> the 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit of Mr George).  Mr Bunting further submits that the plaintiff is willing to provide a cross-undertaking as to damages,but says that fortification - which I note found no place in the earlier order - is unnecessary.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Mr Scott begs to differ.  On behalf of his clients he is indignant in his opposition to this application.  The main thrust of hissubstantial argument is that there no good arguable case in fraud has been made out against his clients, and he vigorously attacksthe quality and style of the affidavit evidence that in this regard has been placed before the court by the plaintiff.  He asks thatthis application be dismissed, and invites the court to conclude that the substance of the fraud assertions is paper thin, and thatin this regard there is no question of the plaintiff reaching the required threshold of a âgood arguable caseâ.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The case as raised asserts the participation of the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants in a scheme to procure the plaintiff into selling diamonds worth about US$7 million, which were held by the plaintiffas security, to the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants between April and November 2001.  The mechanics of the transaction leading to the loss are thus.  Four diamond shipmentshave gone missing.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, Precious (HK) Ltd, was the purchaser of the first two shipments, and the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, Keenhill Ltd and Goldwide Ltd, were the purchasers of the last two shipments.  This is undisputed.  The diamonds thesubject of these shipments were routed through Hong Kong, and were subsequently consigned to Gembel Tokyo, which is said to be aâMehta family companyâ, albeit the evidence from the 6<sup>th</sup> and the 7<sup>th</sup> defendants is that this company is controlled by a rival family faction with which the âSymphony Gemsâ side is in a long-standingdispute.  Suffice to say that it appears that the diamonds were delivered to a Tokyo address, which on subsequent investigation appearsto have been an empty floor of a Tokyo building, but which it is accepted by the plaintiff was <i>not</i> the address of Gembel Tokyo.  Thereafter the trail has gone cold.  There is no allegation that the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants have obtained either the missing diamonds or the proceeds thereof.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Mr Scott points out that the diamonds in question were in the custody of the plaintiff, through Regency Shipping, and that it wasthe plaintiff who took the decision to sell them, and who determined the manner in which this was to be done.  The 6<sup>th</sup> defendant had agreed to assist the plaintiff, which had no contacts in the industry, and whom, against the background of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, Symphony Gems NV, being the debtor under the loan arrangements, had been asked by the plaintiff to help in selling thediamonds.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> In terms of the alleged conspiracy to defraud, said Mr Scott, little if anything was specifically alleged against the 7<sup>th</sup> defendant.  As for the role of the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant, it was accepted that his involvement was to facilitate the sale process, and that he had an already established businessrelationship with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, Precious, and with Mr Hameed, recently deceased, who ran the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendant companies, Keenhill and Goldwide.  However, he submitted that none of the matters which were relied upon to demonstratea good arguable case against the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant stood up to scrutiny.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> It is probably fair to say that the case as now advanced by the plaintiff in terms of Mr Rajesh Mehta contains three, or possiblyfour, distinct strands.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> First, it is the case that the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant proffered to the plaintiff that which can be characterized as a âletter of comfortâ with regard to the creditworthinessof the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, ostensibly the purchasers of the third and fourth shipments.  The 6<sup>th</sup> defendantâs evidence in this regard is that he was relying on Mr Hameed, a business associate, an explanation that has been profferedin the English litigation which has arisen as a result of this case.  In this regard it is difficult to see how this becomes evidenceof fraud; bank references were taken up also, and in any event it is not demonstrated that this statement in itself was false tothe knowledge of the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Second, given that it is undisputed that the plaintiff asked Mr Rajesh Mehta to find buyers for the remaining US$5.8 million of securitydiamonds, it is not easy to appreciate why the representation ascribed to Mr Mehta at a meeting on 31 August 2001 that he was âexpectingbuyers in Antwerpâ can take the case much further; as Mr Scott has pointed out, this reference to such buyers plainly cannot havebeen to the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants since they materialized as potential buyers some time later, so this does not appear materially to assist the plaintiffeither.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Third, and it is here perhaps that Mr Bunting makes the most play, there is the hotly disputed topic of the alleged relationshipbetween the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants and the other relevant defendants who figured in some fashion in the putative sale process, from which the court is askedto draw certain negative inferences.  In this respect the eleventh affidavit of Mr Lane looms large, because exhibited to this document,at âJHL-30â, is an affidavit of one Mr Rashid Suleman Oomer, who appears to be the managing director of a finance house associatedwith the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> This affidavit is dated 28 October 2004, but relates to a conversation that Mr Oomer is said to have had with a Mr Ramesh Desai duringa visit by Mr Desai to Mr Oomerâs office on 23 August 2004.  The thrust of Mr Oomerâs account of Mr Desaiâs information isthat the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 9<sup>th</sup> defendants had been set up on the instructions of the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants, and that Mr Desai was employed as an âemployee directorâ by the Mehtas although, he, that is, Mr Desai, also saysthat he was not involved in the day to day operations of the two companies.  From this a link is drawn by the plaintiff between the6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant (purchaser of the first two diamond tranches), of which company it is alleged that they are the âbeneficial ownersâ,whilst it is yet further alleged that the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants (purchaser of the latter two tranches) is further indirectly owned by the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants through the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. Mr Bunting also draws attention to the fact that the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants appear to have been set up, in part at least, from funds drawn on the 9<sup>th</sup> defendant.  The point of all this, and the focus of the submission on the point, is thus that the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants are, in effect, alleged to be under the <i>de facto</i> ownership of the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants, and that it is these entitities which have played a key role in the disappearance of the diamonds.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> It is clear that Mr Oomerâs evidence is a most substantial factor within the present debate.  Mr Scott has submitted that the courtshould place little or no weight thereon.  He points out that so far as the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is concerned, there is no company registry documentation linking the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants with Precious (HK) Ltd, or indeed any record or any other corporate document to suggest any connection whatever.  He furthersuggests that Mr Oomerâs account is not worth the paper that it is written on, maintaining that this is, in effect, an interestedparty recounting a hearsay conversation with Mr Desai, absent documentary evidence of any kind, about a conversation occurring overtwo months ago but which has just seen the light of day in this case as at the beginning of November; moreover, the âshort noteâwhich Mr Oomer recounts that he prepared following his discussion with Mr Desai is nowhere to be seen, nor is there any evidencethat the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants had any knowledge of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs actions, of which in any event Mr Desai says that he had no âday to dayâ experience.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> Moreover, said Mr Scott, as to the alleged connection with the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, which was denied by his clients, a private investigatorâs report prepared for the plaintiff bespeaks the fact thatâthe responsible individual for both companiesâ is Mr Hameed, the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant and regrettably now deceased.  Whilst as to the 9<sup>th</sup> defendant, of which the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant was a director, and its supposed role in the setting up of the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants admittedly had been shareholders (but not directors) for a short period in order to facilitate business with de Beers,but that role had ceased by 9 May 2001, whereas the 9<sup>th</sup> defendantâs cheque in payment of the acquisition of Keenhill and Goldwide had been dated 11 October 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> As to that which I will term, for shorthand, the âOomer elementâ of this case, in my judgment Mr Scottâs criticisms are wellfounded.  In the context of a serious allegation of conspiracy to defraud I regard this as flimsy and insubstantial evidence whichhas arrived late in the day, and it is not something to which, having regard to the circumstances of this case, I would ascribe anyweight.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Thus far, therefore, there does not seem to be a great deal of substance upon which the plaintiff can hang its hat, even factoringinto the equation the forensic difficulties inherent in establishing a fraud case.  The fourth matter upon which reliance appearsto be placed relates to the assertion that Gembel Tokyo â to which the diamonds apparently were onshipped from Hong Kong, albeitthey failed to arrive â is a Mehta family company âcontrolled byâ the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants and their family members.  This allegation surfaces in Mr Laneâs second affidavit (at para.18) and is repeated in firstaffidavit of Mr George (at para.7).  The response of the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant (at para.13b of his second affirmation) states that the Gembel Group is indeed associated with some members of the Mehtafamily, but not with himself or the 7<sup>th</sup> defendant.  He states that it is controlled by two of his uncles, Rashmi and Prabodh, with whom the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants have since late 2000 been engaged in a âbitter disputeâ, in fact a âfamily feudâ which is referred to in Mr Laneâsninth affidavit, so that the Gembel group is controlled by the âother sideâ to this dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> In the circumstances there seems little scope for much argument about this.  This dispute is documented, and recognized by the plaintiff,yet the assertion as to âcontrolâ by the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants appears to be maintained.  In fact, the assertion of this element of âcontrolâ within the second affidavit of Mr Lanestrikes me as an object lesson in prejudicial drafting.  A close reading of paragraph 18, in which this allegation first surfaced,seeks to demonstrate that ârepresentatives of the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendantsâ family are active in control of the [Gembel] groupâs companiesâ, but in the later narrative within that paragraphthis assertion seamlessly morphs into âThe Gembel Group of companies, therefore, was and remains very much a family business, controlledby the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants and their family members.â</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> This sort of narrative elision, subsequently repeated in the evidence, by Mr George, as a âstated beliefâ that Gembel Tokyo ispart of a group of companies âcontrolled by the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendantsâ is regrettable, and I take this opportunity to state as firmly as I may that âglossingâ of this nature has no placein affidavit evidence of any kind, far less in evidence filed in support of draconian <i>ex parte</i> orders wherein a busy first instance judge is asked to act quickly in reliance of that which is placed before him.  Indeed, aftermaking due allowance for forensic hyperbole, I consider that there is some justification for Mr Scottâs characterization of theplaintiffâs evidence in this case as âshot full of speculation, hearsay and unsubstantiated allegationâ.  The immutable principleis that interests of accuracy and fairness are never to be sacrificed upon the altar of forensic expediency.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> At the end of the day, therefore, with respect to the issue of fresh Mareva relief, I have concluded that notwithstanding Mr Buntinghaving said all that he properly could say on this issue, in my judgment the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a âgood arguablecaseâ in conspiracy against the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> In assessing the position I have come to this conclusion after reviewing the evidence on both sides, and I have borne in mind judicialdicta as to what comprises âa good arguable caseâ, some of which are set out at length in an earlier decision of this court dealingwith an application for the discharge of a Mareva injunction : see <i>Jau-Hwa Stewart v. E Excel Ltd</i>, HCA 2493 of 2001, unrep., dated 30 August 2001.  I appreciate, of course, that the concept of a âgood arguable caseâ is sometimeslikened to the smile on the face of the Cheshire Cat : difficult to describe, but you know it when you see it.  And in this caseI am in little doubt that the plaintiff has failed to get home in a case wherein, at the outset, the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants were described, in the first affirmation of Mr Dinshaw, merely as âpossiblyâ instigating the deception of the plaintiff. In my view the accumulation of emphasis which has taken place has not been justified by the quality of the evidence as subsequentlyfiled, and whatever suspicions the plaintiff may harbour, at the end of the day the discretion of the court is, and can only be,governed by the strength of the evidence : see here the observations of <i>Gee, Mareva Injunctions, 4<sup>th</sup> Ed. (1998), at 184</i> who sums up the position thus :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn Mareva cases, the all-important question is whether, in the circumstances of the case, it is âjust and convenientâ to grantthe injunctionâ¦ the court will take into account the apparent strength or weakness of the respective cases in order to decide whetherthe plaintiffâs case, on the merits, is sufficiently strong to reach the threshold, and this can include assessing the apparentplausibility of statements in affidavits â¦ Although a good arguable case remains the minimum requirement, the judgeâs view ofthe merits of the plaintiffâs case and his chances of ultimate success are obviously important factors in the exercise of his discretion.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Finally under this head, there is no need in the present circumstances to consider in detail the interesting submission by Mr Paoto the effect that in instances in which a substantial claim is brought within the jurisdiction, it is open to the court to grantinterim relief in such circumstances, regardless of whether final judgment is to be pronounced in this or another court.  In otherwords, the submission that in this case that there was a clear need for Mareva relief in aid of the Belgian proceedings.  As Mr Paopointed out, in <i>Jau-Hwa Stewart, op cit</i>, this court therein took the view that there is jurisdiction in appropriate circumstances to grant such form of relief, citing inthat instance the decision of Barnett J in <i>Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd v. Wallace</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%203%20HKC%20776" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 3 HKC 776</a> at 781, wherein reliance was placed on <i>Channel Tunnel v. Balfour Beatty</i> <i>Construction</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20AC%20334" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] AC 334.</a></p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> In the instant case, however, and putting to one side this courtâs conclusion as to the absence of jurisdiction, this court hasbeen told little in detail about the state of these Belgian proceedings (the existence of which was not disclosed at the time ofthe first application to serve out), save that the Belgian judgment is not a âfinalâ judgment for enforcement purposes and thatsuch proceedings are in any event based on a cause of action which the draft re-amended pleading makes clear is intended no longerto be pursued in Hong Kong against the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants.  Nor, for that matter, is there any pleaded claim for specific injunctive relief in support of the Belgian proceedings,which in my view is necessary is instances in which this form relief is sought on this particular basis.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> Accordingly, even if the principle in <i>Channel Tunnel, op</i> <i>cit,</i> was to be applicable â this court in <i>Jau Hwa-Stewart</i> noting that the authorities establish that a court faced with a merely ancillary jurisdiction should adopt a âcautious approachââ and there were to be no primary jurisdictional hurdle, the view I have taken on what presently is no more than an academic pointis that in any event I am signally unsatisfied on the state of the present evidence that this is, or would be, a proper case forgrant of a Mareva injunction.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> It follows from the foregoing that if and in so far as primary jurisdiction has been established over the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants (which I have held is not the position) for the reasons set out above I further dismiss the renewed application as nowmade by the plaintiff for Mareva relief.</p>    <p><u>The amendment issue</u></p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> As indicated at the outset, the third application was for leave to file and serve a Re-re-amended Statement of Claim in term of thedraft exhibited to the second affidavit of Mr George.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> Since the plaintiff has lost the jurisdictional argument, and this court has held that the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants are not to be subject to the exercise of Order 11, and thus are not to be impleaded <i>qua</i> defendants before this court, this last application appears of little practical consequence, save that the application to file andserve the re-re-amended pleading in terms of the draft as presently proposed is denied. Whether in light of this judgment, and anyappeal therefrom, the plaintiff wishes to reconsider its pleading position I know not.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> Two further matters arise in this context.  First, it seems to me that if a plaintiff seriously is to pursue a claim in conspiracyto defraud, as a matter of good practice the evidence should be considered by counsel, and the consequent pleading, with all thatsuch a plea imports, should be signed by counsel.  The present draft pleading bears the signature of the Hong Kong solicitors forthe plaintiff, although it is as plain as a pikestaff that it was drawn by counsel, albeit such authorship is not acknowledged, whichin my view should have been the case.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> Second, a point has arisen about an undertaking which was given to the court by counsel on behalf of the plaintiff at the time thatthe plaintiff wished to enter default judgment against the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants.  This undertaking was to the effect that the plea in conspiracy then advanced against the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants would be abandoned.  That such undertaking was made appears not to be in dispute, although the plaintiff currently isrepresented by counsel who were not then involved.  In the context of this application to amend Mr Scott takes the point that suchundertaking having been given to the court, it cannot now be retracted, and that in so far as this application remains relevant theleave to re-re-amend as now sought should be denied for this reason alone.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> There is no need in the circumstances to decide the issue, and I do not do so, not least because in the circumstances there was alimited amount of argument on the point.  I am inclined to think, however, that in light of the fact that the undertaking as givenwas proffered for a specific purpose, namely the entry of a default judgment that now is not sought to be defended, that in theseparticular circumstances the absolute nature of the bar which it is suggested now has arisen consequent upon such <i>ex parte</i> undertaking is not a submission which, had it been of any practical relevance, would have found favour.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> It is difficult to see how there could have been an irrevocable waiver or abandonment in the circumstances, not least because I amtold that in support of its application to re-amend the then existing Statement of Claim in order to delete the plea in conspiracy,there was an express reservation of right to reinstate such conspiracy claim should such judgment in default be set aside.</p>    <p class="heading">Orders</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Consequent upon this judgment, and the concessions made at the outset by the plaintiff, I make the following substantive orders :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)    that the Order of Pang J dated 9 July 2003 and the Order of Lugar-Mawson J dated 20 August 2004 be set aside in so far as suchorders relate to the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants herein;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)    that the Default Judgment entered on 5 February 2004 and the Charging Order Nisi dated 1 April 2004 and the Stop Notice ancillarythereto be set aside;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)    that the plaintiffâs application for a fresh leave to file and serve the Re-re-amended Statement of Claim out of the jurisdictionupon the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants be dismissed;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d)    that the plaintiffâs application for fresh Mareva relief against the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants be dismissed;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(e)    that the plaintiffâs application to file a Re-re-amended Statement of Claim in terms of the draft proposed be denied.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> There can be no argument but that the costs of the applications as taken out on behalf of the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants to set aside those orders which were conceded at the outset should be set aside must be to the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants, such costs to be taxed if not agreed.  However, Mr Scott has made it clear that in this regard his instructions are toask for costs orders on a higher scale than party and party, and in the circumstances the court will entertain submissions from counsel.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> As to the costs of the renewed applications for fresh leave to serve the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants out of the jurisdiction, for renewed Mareva relief, and for leave to file the draft re-re-amended pleading, such costssimilarly are to be to the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants, to be taxed if not agreed.  I await the submission of counsel as to whether it is intended to argue that these costsalso should be taxed upon an enhanced basis.</p>    <p class="heading">Matters arising</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> I should be assisted if counsel would agree orders in appropriate form for the purpose of engrossment. Absent agreement, and in sofar as may be necessary I will hear counsel as to the precise form of such orders.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> I will also entertain any other submissions which may immediately arise as a consequence of this judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> I express my appreciation to counsel on both sides for the manner in which this hearing was conducted, and for the assistance renderedto the court in what was a case of some complexity, both factually and as a matter of law.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(William Stone)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Michael Bunting, SC leading Mr Jin Pao, instructed by Messrs Wilkinson &amp; Grist, for the plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr John Scott, SC instructed by Messrs Clifford Chance, for the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants</p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2004/1018.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
