The first of a series of certificates was issued bythe Director of Legal Aid on 2nd March 1967; and the defendant was assigned to act as the plaintiffs' solicitor. Counsel was assignedon 16th June 1967; and on 27th June 1968 a draft statement of claim was forwarded by counsel to the defendant for the purpose ofinstituting proceedings against Ng Kwong and the owner of the goods vehicle.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The plaintiffs allege that the defendant was negligent in that he failed to commence proceedings "before 2nd February 1969 or atall in consequence whereof the plaintiffs' cause of action became statute barred" by virtue of the provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap.347</a>; and that by reason of his alleged negligence they have lost all prospects of recovering damages; and they claim damagesagainst him.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The defendant denies that the cause of action against Ng Kwong and the owner of the goods vehicle is statute barred; and on 17thSeptember 1970 there was a consent order made by the Registrar that this question be tried as a preliminary issue. That is how thematter now comes before me.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> As Mr. Jackson-Lipkin said, it is rather a bizarre situation; and I find it a little difficult to understand. One would have expectedthe action against the alleged tortfeasors to have proceeded at least to the stage of ascertaining whether they were going to pleadlimitation. Instead, the plaintiffs have chosen to assume that they would do so, and furthermore that this plea would be upheld bythe court. So, they now proceed against their ex-solicitor, presumably having withdrawn their instructions to proceed against NgKwong and the owner of the vehicle.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In England prior to 1939, it was the law that time did not begin to run under any circumstances during infancy, or other disability.As Lord Denning said in <u>Hewer</u> v. <u>Bryant</u><sup>(1)</sup>:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"For over 300 years everyone under 21 was not barred by lapse of time. He was not entitled himself to bring an action at law for damages:because, being under 21, he was considered incapable of managing his own affairs, at least to that extent. Until he was 21, he hadto find someone to act as his next friend and bring an action on his behalf. But it was not everyone who was prepared to be his nextfriend, especially as a next friend is liable to pay all the costs if he loses. Even the most loving parent might hesitate, and aneglectful parent would not bother. No parent was under any duty to bring an action on behalf of his child. ................................Seeing, therefore, that an infant could not bring an action himself, and that no one was under any duty to bring it for him, thelaw (in its natural solicitude for infants) said that time did not run against an infant until he became of age and was able to bringan action himself."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">That was the position in Hongkong until the enactment of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap.347</a> on 11th June 1965.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Section 4(1) of the Ordinance provides that an action founded on tort shall not be brought after the expiration of six years fromthe date on which the cause of action accrued; but in the case of an action for damages for negligence where the claim includes damagesfor personal injuries, the period of limitation is three years. Section 22 provides that if the plaintiff was under disability onthe date when the cause of action accrued the action may be brought at any time before the expiration of six years from the datewhen the plaintiff ceased to be under disability. But, s.22(2) provides that in the case of an action for damages for, inter alia,negligence where the claim includes damages for personal injuries, the action may be brought at any time before the expiration ofthree years from the date when the plaintiff cessed to be under disability. But s.22(2)(b) reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"this section shall not apply unless the plaintiff proves that the person under the disability was not, at the time when the rightof action ............. accrued to him, in the custody of a parent."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> It would appear that the intention of the legislature was that as regards these particular classes of action, time should begin torun as soon as the cause of action accrues, even in the case of a person under disability, in the absence of proof by the plaintiffthat the person under disability was, at the material time, not in the custody of a parent. As Lord Denning said in <u>Hewer</u> v. <u>Bryant</u><sup>(1)</sup>, presumably the legislature thought that every parent who had the custody of a child ought to bring an action for him; and if hedid not do so the child must suffer. 'Parent' is defined as including grandparents and step-parents, whether legitimate, illegitimateor in consequence of adoption.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> There is no doubt at all that if s.22 does apply, time does not begin to run during disability. It matters not if the person is afew weeks old when the cause of action accrues. Time begins to run when the person ceases to be under disability.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> What, then, is the meaning of the word "custody" in s.22(2)(b)? There has been two schools of thought about this. In <u>Hewer</u> v. <u>Bryant</u><sup>(2)</sup>, Paull J. at first instance thought that "custody" meant legal custody, and that the law was accurately stated by Sir William BrettM.R. in <u>In re Agar-Ellis</u><sup>(3)</sup> thus:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...... the law of England ...... is that the father has the control over the person, education and conduct of his children untilthey are 21 years of age. That is the law."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">And at p.426, Paull J. said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...... it seems to me that the test to be applied as to whether the infant is in the custody of a parent is not whether or not thefather or some other parent is or is not away from the infant for a period or periods; it is not whether or not the parent allowsthe infant the freedom to do as he likes; it is not whether someone else has temporarily been given the duty of the day-to-day controlof the infant; in all such cases the custody remains ............"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> That view was utterly rejected by Lord Denning when the case came before the Court of Appeal. The Master of the Rolls said (pp 369/70):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"My conclusion is that an infant is 'in the custody of a parent' if he is in point of fact, in the effective care and control of aparent at the time of the accident. I stress the word 'effective' because I am firmly of opinion that Parliament must have had inmind a parent so circumstanced that it can be confidently expected that he will take whatever action is necessary or desirable onbehalf of the infant."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Sachs L.J. adopted a similar approach (p.374). His conclusion was that the words "in the custody of a parent" in the Limitation Actshave a "special, limited and somewhat artificial meaning"; and that the word</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...... parent ...... must be someone who factually both has and is effectively exercising those personal powers which a father (orother guardian) has over an infant ...... . If the plaintiff proves that the relevant parent either had not got or was not exercisingthose powers, which include both care and physical control at the material time, then the period of limitation does not commenceto run."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">And in <u>Brook</u> v. <u>Hoar</u><sup>(4)</sup>, Melford Stevenson J. said:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%"></td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">'...... the question whether an infant is in the custody of a parent is a question of fact which has to be determined on the availableevidence. I do not attempt any definition or even description of custody for the purpose of the subsection under consideration ina case where custody has not been granted to a parent by an order of a court, but I think that an essential characteristic of suchcustody is the right to control the infant's life coupled with the capacity to exercise that control whether arising from economiccircumstances or otherwise."</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">I agree entirely that, for the purpose of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.22</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, "custody" is a question of fact to be determined on the evidence.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In this case, the relevant facts are very simple; and they disclose a situation which is all too common in Hongkong today. The secondplaintiff is a casual manual labourer. During the last 10 years his employment has been somewhat irregular. For most of that period,he has worked in the construction business; and this has necessitated his moving from one building site to another throughout theColony. He has also been a factory worker from time to time</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> He is the father of four children - three boys and one girl. The eldest boy was born in 1958. The first plaintiff and his brotherare twins. They were born on 1st September 1959. The girl was born in 1960.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The second plaintiff's wife deserted him in 1962. His daughter was then 1 1/2 years old. He cared for the four children for a time;but he found it impossible to continue doing so. He had to try to find work in order to live; and he could not work and look afterfour young children as well, especially as his work took him from one construction site to another in various parts of the Colony.He therefore put the four children into a nursery. Later, he found a lady named Lee Fung who was willing to care for the children;and, for two or three years prior to 2nd February 1966, they lived with her and her husband, a Mr. So. The second plaintiff paidMr. and Mrs. So $40 per child per month to cover the cost of the childrens' board and lodging.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> After his son was discharged from hospital, the second plaintiff arranged for his three sons to be brought up by a Mr. and Mrs. Ipin Rennie's Mill. He pays Mr. and Mrs. Ip $90 per child per month to cover board, lodging and school fees. He is not a Christianhimself; but it appears that Mr. and Mrs. Ip take the children to the Lutheran Church on Sundays. The second plaintiff buys someclothing for the children; but the Lutheran Church also makes some contribution in this regard. He has visited his children wheneverhe was able to do so; but because he has been working and sleeping on building sites situated far away from Kowloon or Rennie's Mill,his visits must have been rather irregular.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> In evidence he gave 385 Yuen Chow St., 1st floor, as his present residential address. But, from his answers in cross-examination,I gathered that he did not possess more than a bed-space. Indeed, he said that he sometimes slept in the street.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> It is not in dispute that the second plaintiff has "custody" of his children in the legal sense of the term. But I do not see howany court could reasonably come to the conclusion that he has had de facto custody of any of his children since he arranged for themto be brought up by Mr. and Mrs. So. For many years he has not been in a position to exercise effective day-to-day control over them;and, in my view, that was the position at the time of the accident on 2nd February 1966.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The only person who gave evidence was the second plaintiff himself. Presumably his object was to prove that his son <u>was</u> in his custody on 2nd February 1966. But, in fact, he proved to my entire satisfaction that his son <u>was not</u> in his custody on that date.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 22(1)</a> therefore applies. The period of limitation does not begin to run during the first plaintiff's minority; and, in my view, it is opento the plaintiffs to institute proceedings against Ng Kwong and the owner of the goods vehicle.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%"></td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">(W.A.
