Imperial was responsible for arranging shipment for therequired goods and it engaged Translink Shipping Line (âTSLâ) as the carrier to ship the goods.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Defendant alleges that TSL carries the Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (âNVOCCâ) license issued by the US Federal MaritimeCommission.  For the shipments emanating from Hong Kong, Imperial instructed its suppliers such as the Plaintiff to contact the Defendantso that the Defendant could arrange for the outbound shipment with TSL.  The Defendant was/is not a NVOCC as it did not have sucha licence.  Therefore the Defendant could not carry on as a carrier of goods by sea to or from the US, and could only act as an agent. The Defendant submits that it was a mere agent and not the actual carrier.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Defendant submits that Clause 3 and Clause 34 in the Bills of Lading are relevant.  Clause 3 provides:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIt is understood and agreed that other than the said Carrier no person whatsoever (including â¦â¦ all servants, agents â¦ andother independent contractors whatsoever) is or shall be deemed to be liable with respect to the goods as carrier bailee or otherwisehowsoever in contract or in tort.  <u>If, however, it should be adjudged that any other than said carrier is under any responsibility with respect to the goods all limitationsof and exonerations from liability provided by law or by the terms hereof shall be available to such other person as herein describedin contracting for the foregoing exemptions, limitations and exonerations from liability,</u> the Carrier is acting as agents and trustee for and on behalf of all persons described above, all of whom shall be this extent bedeemed to be a party to this contract evidenced by this Bill of Lading, it being always understood that the said beneficiaries arenot entitled to any greater or further exemptions limitations or exonerations from liability than those that the Carrier has underthis Bill of Lading in any given situation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(Underlines provided)</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Clause 34 reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âNothing in this Bill of Lading shall operate to deprive the Carrier of any statutory protection or exemption from, or limitationof liability, contained the laws of the United States, or in the laws of any other country which may be applicable.  This Bill ofLading shall be construed according to the laws of the United States and the Merchant agrees that any suits against the Carrier shallbe brought in the Federal Courts of the United States â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Defendant submits that the effects of the above two clauses are as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)   US laws will be used in this hearing in construing the 2 bills of lading in question: clause 34.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)   Clause 34 contains an exclusive clause, which imposed an obligation on the Plaintiff to bring any suit against TSL in the FederalCourts of the US.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)    Notwithstanding that the exclusive jurisdiction clause binds the Plaintiff and TSL (the Defendant not a party to it), by virtueof Clause 3, the Defendant thereby enjoys the same protection of TSL.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Defendant avers that Clause 34 contains an exclusive jurisdiction clause which imposed an obligation on the Plaintiff to bringany suit against the TSL in the Federal Courts.  In my judgment no issue on this can arise because this is not an action againstTSL.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Defendant avers that notwithstanding that the exclusive jurisdiction clause binds P and TSL, by virtue of Clause 34, the Defendantequally enjoys the same protection as TSL.  In my judgment the protection provided by Clause 3 is subject to the occurrence of thepre-condition that âIf, however, it shall be adjudged that any other than said carrier is under any responsibility with respectto the goods â¦â¦â  However, there is no such adjudication, and so Clause 3 has not been invoked.  As a result Clause 3 doesnot apply to the present case. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The burden is on the Defendant to prove that the parties intended not only to confer jurisdiction on the foreign court, but to excludeall other jurisdictions for the resolution of disputes.  There is nothing in Clause 34 to show that that clause confers exclusivejurisdiction on the Federal Courts of the United States.  It does not even say that any suits against the Carrier shall be brought<u>exclusively</u> in the Federal Courts of the United States.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Bills of Lading are evidence of the contract for carriage of goods which was reached after negotiation between the parties. There is no evidence to show that the Plaintiff intended that the Bills of Lading are to be construed according to the laws of theUnited States.  This is because it was not involved in the negotiation of the Bills of Ladings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  By virtue of the reasons aforesaid the Defendantâs submission that this Court has to apply the US laws must fail.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Forum non conveniens</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Defendant alleges that the following issues are in dispute and therefore require determination in the forthcoming trial:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)   The Plaintiff alleges that Imperial required the Plaintiff to enter carriage contract with the Defendant.  On the other handTSL admit that the carriage contract was between TSL and Imperial.  On this issue alone, the most relevant party is Imperial, whichis a US company.  Of course, TSL is also a US company which give evidence on this issue.  As such, US Court is clearly a more appropriateforum.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)   The Plaintiff alleges that soon after the cargo for both the 1<sup>st</sup> Order and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Order arrived in the US, the Plaintiff had received a conference telephone call from a Mr. Nelson Tsiao of TSL and a Mr. Mark Nelsonof Imperial on 21 May 2005 and was informed that the Defendant had wrongfully released the cargos to Imperial without presentationof any original bills of lading.  Mr. Nelson Tsiao of TSL affirmed that in that conference telephone call, the Plaintiff again acknowledgedrelease the shipments at issue in this case without presentation of original bills of lading along with four other shipments, andthat the Defendant was not included in the conversation or in any decision to release the cargo due to the fact that the Defendantwas not the NVOCC but merely the agent of TSI.  On this issue alone, there is a dispute as to what was said in that conference call. Therefore, the persons involved in that conference call were Mr. Nelson Tsiao and Mr. Mark Nelson, both live in the US.  Again,clearly, US Court is the best court to hear this issue.   </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)    Stemming from the issue aforesaid, it is also TSLâs case that the other 4 shipments which were released to Imperial withoutpresentation of original bills of lading and that Imperial paid the Plaintiff for those shipments, the Plaintiff are not raisingany complaints about those 4 shipments, the relevant documents would be in the US.  Again, this factor is also in favour of the USCourt.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d)    The goods in question were released in the US.  As to how and under what circumstances the goods were released, the US Courtis clearly the appropriate forum to try this issue.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(e)    Imperial claims that they are entitled to refuse to pay the Plaintiff for the 2 shipments in question due to the fact thatImperial claims to have valid set-offs against the Plaintiff for defective products tendered by the Plaintiff on prior shipments. If Imperial had valid set-offs against the Plaintiff, then the Plaintiff would have suffered no damages in the present claim.  Allthose issues should be tried in the US.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(f)    There are disputes between TSL/Imperial and the Plaintiff as to the value of the goods alleged to have been misdelivered. Again the witnesses and the goods are all in the US.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(g)    As the Defendant was only a mere agent and the Defendant has not incurred any personal liability, there is in substance noissues involving the Defendant in the trial.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(h)    The governing law of the bills of lading is US laws.  Hence, US courts is the best court to try this matter.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Issue (a)</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  There is nothing to show that Imperial is the âmost relevantâ party.

The Defendantâs submissionis therefore only partially correct.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Issue (c)</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The Defendant has not shown that the Plaintiff has no copies of the documents in question.

The Defendant will not be able to subpoena Imperialâs officers to give evidence or compel production of any documents fromImperial if the trial of this action shall take place in Hong Kong.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b). If the action herein is allowed to proceed and the Defendant is adjudged liable as alleged, the Defendant will be forced to commencean indemnity action in US against TSI and Imperial.  This will result in multiple proceedings in different courts, and there is arisk of inconsistent finding of facts.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">These are problems for the Defendant to solve.
