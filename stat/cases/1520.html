He is a seaman.  On 8 May 2008, he met an accident on board the Zhonghang 903, a barge commutingbetween the ports of Guangdong, Macau and Hong Kong in transportation of containers and cargoes.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  At the time, the Zhonghang 903 was in Hong Kong waters.  The containers on board the barge were to be discharged onto a dumb lighter,the âMidstream 18â, which was equipped with a derrick.  The crane was operated by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant at the time.  As part of the procedure of unloading the containers, the Plaintiff and his co-workers had to join the metalslings of the crane to the anchors at the top of the containers to enable the containers to be lifted out of the hold of the barge.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The discharge of the first 2 containers proceeded uneventfully.  However, in the course of hooking up the third container, the Plaintiffsuddenly fell off from its surface and landed at the bottom of the hold.  The Plaintiff alleged that the container was suddenly liftedby the crane while he was standing on it, causing the metal sling to spring onto him which resulted in his fall.  The exact mannerof how the accident happened is no longer material for the purpose of this trial.  It suffices to note that the Plaintiff was injuredas a result.      </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  During the opening of the Plaintiffâs case, Mr Szeto (appearing for the Plaintiff) indicated that the Plaintiff no longer wishedto pursue the claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  The question of costs vis-Ã¡-vis the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant remained a live issue but the claim for damages would only be pursued against the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants. </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Later, during the Plaintiffâs evidence, Mr Kwok (appearing together with Mr Chow for the Defendants) indicated that the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants would no longer contest liability for the Plaintiffâs injuries.  The main question remaining for the trial is the quantumof the Plaintiffâs claim.  </p>    <p class="heading">Background of the Plaintiff</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Plaintiff was born in 1962.  He was 45 years old at the time of the accident. </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Plaintiff has long been a seaman.  From about 1986, he has been employed by the same company although the company has undergoneseveral restructuring.  His current employer is the ZhongShan Port &amp; Shipping Enterprise Group Ltd (ä¸­å±±å¸æ¸¯èªä¼æ¥­éåæéå¬å¸). There are several sister companies within the same corporate group.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  As a seaman for 22 years before the accident, the Plaintiff had been assigned to work on different vessels and in different positionssuch as the second-mate, the first-mate and as captain of other vessels.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  At the time of the accident he was the Deputy Captain of the Zhonghang 903.</p>    <p class="heading">Injuries and Treatment</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  I accept that before the accident the Plaintiff was a healthy and active person.  He enjoyed sightseeing during his leisure. Fromtime to time, he also liked dinning out with his family. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Immediately after the accident, the Plaintiff was admitted into the Accident &amp; Emergency Department of Queen Mary Hospital. Examinations revealed that he suffered (i) bruises to the right posterior upper arm, size 1 x 1 cm; and (ii) anterior wedge collapseof L1 in the spine.  He was given analgesic to relieve pain.  There was no neurological deficit.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  He did not, however, stay in Queen Mary Hospital.  On advice from his employer, he considered it better to receive treatment onthe Mainland as he would be closer to home and his family.  He was transported back to Zhongshan on board the Zhonghang 903.  I acceptthat the Plaintiff must have endured pain and discomfort when he was transported from the hospital to the vessel, and during thejourney back to Zhongshan in circumstances where the vessel was not designed to carry or offer special comfort to injured passengers.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  On his arrival in Zhongshan in the morning on 9 May 2008, he was admitted into Zhongshan City Chinese Medicine Hospital (âZCCMHâ). There he was treated with IV fluid injections, herbal application, physiotherapy and was in a corset for 48 days. He was hospitalizeduntil 26 June 2008 before he was discharged home for convalescence.  According to the hospitalâs discharge record, he had a compressedfracture at L1 and the compression was about 1/3.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  During the period in hospital, he was confined to bed rest and was treated with both Chinese and Western medication.  Although theorthopaedic specialists appointed by the parties (Dr Tio and Dr Chun) questioned the appropriateness of prolonged bed rest, nothingturns on the point. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On discharge from ZCCMH, it was recorded that his pain in the waist and back had lessened.  He still experienced mild limitationof motions but no dizziness or headache.  He had bed rest for another month.  He had been receiving follow-up treatment since. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In a joint report (âthe Joint Reportâ) prepared by Dr Tio and Dr Chun, it was recorded (and I accept) that the Plaintiff wasstill experiencing low back pain and dull ache with change of weather, after exertion at work or other activities, big sneezing orwhen turning in bed.  He also experienced dizziness which was at first severe after discharge from hospital, but had since becomemild.  His wedge fracture at L1 has healed with 47% compression ratio.  The doctors expressed the view (which again I accept) thatthe Plaintiffâs symptoms at the low back were compatible with the residual of the healed wedge fracture.  The Plaintiffâs milddizziness was likely to be related to the prolonged bed rest in the Chinese hospital and the symptom is likely to improve.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  I accept that the Plaintiff will continue to experience intermittent back pain on physical exertion and also in changing weather. The severity of the pain will reduce with time though it is likely to continue and be persisting.  Notwithstanding his intermittentback pain, the Plaintiff is independent in the usual activities of daily living. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  As is accepted by both doctors, the fracture at L1 did not involve the nerves and therefore the fracture itself would not have asserious an effect on the Plaintiff as one which did.</p>    <p class="heading">Impact of Injuries on the Plaintiff</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The nature of the Plaintiffâs pre-accident duties on board the Zhonghang 903 and his ability (or otherwise) to resume such dutiesare disputed issues I have to resolve in this trial.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  According to the Plaintiff, his main duties as Deputy Captain was to assist the Captain and be in charge of the steering and generaladministration of the barge.  In his statement (which he adopted as his evidence), he said that he was often required to assist othercrew members in various duties particularly when they were all pressed for time to complete the loading / unloading of the cargoes. This, for instance, would involve him teaming up with 2 other crew members to hook up the slings of the crane onto the anchors ofthe containers.  Also there had been occasions when the Plaintiff would be required to assist other crew members in handling or movingcargoes as well as tools and equipment on the vessel.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In the Joint Report, the Plaintiffâs pre-accident duties were described as including âsailing, steering, administration, riggingand as a helping hand.â</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The Defendant disputed the nature of the Plaintiffâs duties on the barge.  In cross-examination, it was suggested that the Plaintiffas Deputy Captain would not be required to perform heavy manual labour such as rigging or moving cargoes and equipment.  Such workcould be left to his subordinates and there were several other junior crew members on the vessel to do such work. </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  On this issue, I accept the Plaintiffâs description of his pre-accident duties. They included not only steering of the vesseland administration, he was required from time to time to perform tasks including rigging, pulling and manoeuvring metal slings, hookingup containers, as well as tasks that involved manual labour such as handling cargoes, tools and equipment.  Such tasks were oftenstrenuous and required physical exertion.  I find that these tasks were among the duties of the Plaintiff as Deputy Captain of theZhonghang 903, and he had participated in such tasks with other members of the crew.  I reject the suggestion that his position asDeputy Captain would not require him to undertake tasks that involved heavy physical exertion. </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  According to the Plaintiff, and I accept, in January 2009 the doctor suggested that he could try to return to work but he shouldonly undertake less strenuous duties.  The Plaintiff related his readiness to resume duties to his employer but was told that owingto his long period of absence his previous post on the Zhonghang 903 had already been filled by somebody else.  The company agreedto look for other suitable positions for him.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  He was therefore waiting to be assigned to new positions.  In about May 2009, he was given the post as a guard/watchman guardingscrap vessels on land with a lower salary than what he would have earned as a seaman.  I accept, in this regard, the Plaintiffâsevidence that there had been 2 occasions when he had raised the subject of his posting with his employer.  His employer suggestedthat he should consider resigning or changing his job to becoming a guard/watchman but neither of those prospects appealed him, ashe needed a good income to support his family and especially his 2 sons in university.  I accept also his evidence that one of suchoccasions took place at around the time he was offered the post as the guard. As to the other occasion, contrary to the submissionsof the Defendant, I do not consider the fact that the Plaintiff was unable to remember more precisely when it took place should inany way undermine the credibility of his evidence in this regard. </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The Plaintiff took up the offer as a guard on a temporary basis while requesting to be deployed back to some sea-going duties. </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Eventually, a vacancy as chief mate arose on a tugboat, the Xianxing 703, after the retirement of the vesselâs captain and theconsequent promotions of the then deputy captain and chief mate.  The Defendant questioned the veracity of the Plaintiffâs evidenceas to emergence of the vacancy, pointing to the allegedly short duration of office if Captain Leung of the Xianxing 703 only becameher captain in August 2009 but was apparently replaced in less than 2 year (latest in May 2011).  I do not find any substance inthis attack on the Plaintiffâs evidence.  On the contrary, I accept the Plaintiffâs testimony that he had been offered the positionas Chief Mate on the Xianxing 703 as the vacancy arose in August 2009, a position he has continued to occupy to this day. </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The posting of the Plaintiff as Chief Mate on the Xianxing 703 was, and I find, the companyâs response to the Plaintiffâs desireto return to a sea-going position while having regard to the limitations of his ability to perform the physical duties on a boatand their inherent hazards.  This is evident from the memorandum issued by ZhongShan Port &amp; Shipping Enterprise Group Ltd dated20 July 2010.  I further accept that he was mainly involved in the performance of light duties as the Chief Mate such as dealingwith the paper work for the business operation of the vessel and matters relating to customs and duties.  In this regard, while Ihave taken note of the Plaintiffâs evidence that there had been occasions he had exerted himself on the tugboat by moving ropesand pulling cables, I accept that because of the pain he experienced afterwards, he had ceased doing such work since. </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I accept that the conditions of the Plaintiff are such that the type of work which required heavy exertion, for instance, manoeuvringmetal slings and hooks of the crane, handling heavy cargoes, tools or equipment and activities involving heavy labour, will bringabout pain to his back.  Such kind of work will be unsuitable for him especially taking account of the risk of unexpected turbulenceat sea (if he were to engage in such work).  Such limitations of the Plaintiffâs ability to perform heavy manual labour on a boatwere clearly, and understandably, a concern to his employer in their consideration of his posting, as is evident from the letterdated 20 July 2010 aforementioned.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In coming to the above conclusion, I have taken note of the Plaintiffâs evidence given under cross-examination regarding the training-instructionshe had received for the purpose of renewing his Seafarer Registration (in March 2009) and his Certificate of Competence as SecondCaptain (in May 2009).  The Defendant sought to challenge the Plaintiffâs version that he would not be fit to resume the pre-accidentduties as Deputy Captain.  Having considered the evidence, I am prepared to accept the Plaintiffâs explanation that the trainingfor the purpose of renewing the Registration consisted mainly of refreshing their knowledge by way of a video, and for the Certificateof Competence the instructions and examination concentrated mainly on the knowledge of the theory.  Although on the Plaintiffâsown evidence, he did not alert the Marine Bureau or the Health Department as to his physical limitations in the annual health examinations,I do not consider such failure to be a sufficiently weighty piece of evidence to cast doubt on my view that the Plaintiff was indeedsuffering limitations as to his ability to perform heavy manual labour on a boat.   </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  I have also taken note of Dr Chunâs view that the Plaintiff would be able to resume his duties as a Deputy Captain.  This view,however, was not expressly stated in the Joint Report.  But in any event, I think it is more pertinent to take note that in paragraph35, Dr Chun also agreed that the Plaintiff might have intermittent pain on heavy exertion. That, to me, supports my conclusion fromthe evidence that the kind of work requiring heavy exertion on a boat as described in the foregoing paragraphs will be unsuitablefor the Plaintiff.  In my view, because of the unsuitability and their inherent risks, the Plaintiff is unlikely to be able to resumethe full range of the pre-accident duties pertaining to the position of Deputy Captain of the Zhonghang 903.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  I will now turn to the different heads of claim.</p>    <p class="heading">Pain, Suffering and Loss of Amenities</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Under this head, my attention has been drawn to the following authorities:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) <i>Choi Siau Bon v Chevalier Construction (Hong Kong) Ltd &amp; Ors</i>, HCPI 913 of 2000;</p>        <p>(b) <i>Wu Choi Lan v Tonge (Hong Kong) Ltd &amp; Anor</i>, DCPI 634 of 2003;</p>        <p>(c) <i>Limbu Muni Parsad v Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Co Ltd</i>, HCPI 1167 of 2003;</p>        <p>(d) <i>Khan Amir v Kwok Yui Chor &amp; Anor</i>, HCPI 422 of 2009;</p>        <p>(e) <i>Tsang Shun Keung v Ko Wang International Trading Ltd t/a Ko Wang Design Engineering Co &amp; Anor</i>, HCPI 373 of 2009;</p>        <p>(f) <i>Ho Moh v Tam Yiu Keung t/a Yiu Sun Construction Engineering Co &amp; Anor</i>; HCPI 1251 of 1998;</p>        <p>(g) <i>Shek Kam Ching v Po Kee Construction Engineering Ltd &amp; Ors</i>, HCPI 434 of 2001;</p>        <p>(h) <i>Shea Lai Chuen v Federal Express Pacific Inc</i>, HCPI 1025 of 2003;</p>        <p>(i) <i>So Man v So Ting t/a Fung Kee Waste Wooden &amp; Metal Collection Co</i>, HCPI 566 of 2006;</p>        <p>(j) <i>Shah Nisar v Wai Kit Engineering Co Ltd &amp; Ors</i>, HCPI 1092 of 2003;</p>        <p>(k) <i>Ali Shoukat v Hang Seng Bank Ltd</i>, HCPI 3 of 2003;</p>        <p>(l) <i>Lawati Bhawani Bikram v Ting Kau Contractors Joint Venture</i>, HCPI 1242 of 1999 &amp; on appeal, CACV 3 of 2002.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Having considered the authorities and in light of my findings above, I think it would be appropriate to award $250,000 under thishead for the Plaintiffâs pain, suffering and loss of amenities.</p>    <p class="heading">Pre-Trial Loss of Earnings</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The pre-trial period in this case is 38 months.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The documents regarding the Plaintiffâs pre-accident monthly earnings revealed some minor inconsistencies.  For the purpose ofcalculating the Plaintiffâs average pre-trial monthly earnings, I would adopt the following figures set out in the 2 memorandaissued by his employer (both dated 16 September 2009): his monthly salary of RMB3,408.66; monthly labour fee (ååè²») of RMB1,400;half-year bonus of RMB2,470; and year-end bonus of RMB3,800.  These averaged RMB5,331.16 per month.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  After resumption of duties as Chief Mate on the Xianxing 703, his monthly salary was reduced to RMB2,381 (according to a memorandumissued by his current employer).  There is no dispute that he earned a monthly labour fee of RMB1,000.  Accepting also that he wouldhave earned reduced bonuses for half-year and year-end, I would adopt the figure of RMB3,700 as his average monthly earnings as ChiefMate since mid-August 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In this connection, apart from the loss resulting from a reduction in monthly earnings as Chief Mate, the Plaintiff further claimedthat he had suffered an additional loss in income by reason that he had lost the opportunity of being promoted to be the Captainof the Zhonghang 903.  The Plaintiff contended that if he had not been injured in the accident, he would have been promoted by January2011.  This, he argued, should entitle him to calculate the pre-trial loss for the 7 months between January and July 2011 with referenceto the higher earnings pertaining to the position as captain of that vessel.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The Defendant took issue with the approach of assessing the loss of promotional prospect.  Mr Kwok submitted that the claim forloss of pre-trial earnings and future earnings should both be approached by way of a percentage assessment of the chance of promotion.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  With respect to Mr Kwok, I think that submission has overlooked the distinction between assessment of pre-trial and post-trial losses. It is a well-settled principle that pre-trial loss has to be established as a matter of probability, but calculation of future losscan take possibilities into account: <i>Charlesworth &amp; Percy on Negligence</i>, 12<sup>th</sup><sup> </sup>edition, para 5-113.  The distinction in the approach must apply to loss of earnings on account of loss of promotional prospect. </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  A claim of pre-trial loss is, in nature, one of compensation for accrued loss.  It is incumbent upon the claimant to prove <i>on a balance of probabilities</i> both the elements that such promotion would have occurred <i>and</i> the timing of the promotion.  In this connection, it is perhaps worth repeating that such loss, being claimed as part of the specialdamages, must be pleaded with particularity: <i>Charlesworth &amp; Percy on Negligence</i>, <i>ibid</i>, para 5-112.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  In this instance, the Plaintiff would be required to show that it was more likely than not that he would be promoted at the latestby January 2011 to justify his claim for the 7 monthsâ loss of additional earnings: see <i>Balasing Gurung v Ng Lay</i>, HCA 4567 of 1985, judgment of Cough J at p 11.   </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Focusing on the evidence relevant to this issue, I would accept the 2 letters from ZhongShan Port &amp; Shipping Enterprise GroupLtd, respectively dated 10 February 2010 and 20 July 2010, as reflective of the employerâs intention with regard to the Plaintiffâspromotional plan.  I am satisfied that there was indeed a good prospect of the Plaintiffâs promotion to the position as Captainof the Zhonghang 903 had he not met the accident.  I am also satisfied that that chance is now lost consequent upon the Plaintiffâsinjuries.  Contrary to the Defendantâs submissions that the employerâs letters were questionable and should be given no weight,I find nothing in the evidence or the cross-examination of the Plaintiff which would cast doubt on the veracity of the contents ofthe said letters.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  That said, it is noted however that neither of the 2 letters gave a clear indication as to when promotion would likely take place. I do not find the lack of precision on timing surprising given the question of promotion had become hypothetical after the Plaintiffâsaccident. While the letter of 20 July 2010 stated that the company, before the accident, had planned to promote the Plaintiff âwithina short period of timeâ, that statement in fact referred back to the earlier letter of 10 February 2010.  The earlier letter, inturn, merely suggested that the Plaintiff would have been promoted to be the Captain âin a few yearsâ timeâ after he had becomefamiliar with the operation of the vessel. </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Bearing in mind the approach requiring proof as a matter of probability, I think the evidence falls short of establishing that theposition as Captain of Zhonghang 903 would more likely than not become available by 2011, even if the Plaintiff was ready for thatpost.  The Plaintiff has not satisfied me that by January 2011 he would be promoted to the position as Captain of that vessel ona balance of probabilities. </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Accordingly, the Plaintiffâs loss of pre-trial earnings would be the amount of gross income he would have received as Deputy Captainless the amount he actually received during this period.  His income for the months between April 2008 and March 2009 is set outin his employerâs letter of 20 April 2008.  Those figures are not challenged and I would accept them as evidence of the Plaintiffâsearnings for those months.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  I find the Plaintiffâs actual earnings for the pre-trial period to be:</p>    <blockquote>        <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="100%">            <tr>                <td valign="top">                May 2008</td>                <td valign="top"></td>                <td valign="top">                RMB 3,500.70</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top">                June 2008</td>                <td valign="top"></td>                <td valign="top">                RMB 4,899.70</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top">                July 2008</td>                <td valign="top"></td>                <td valign="top">                RMB 2,714.70</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top">                August 2008 â January 2009 at RMB 2,520 / month</td>                <td valign="top"></td>                <td valign="top">                RMB 15,120.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top">                February 2009 â May 2009 at RMB 1,065 / month</td>                <td valign="top"></td>                <td valign="top">                RMB 4,260.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top">                June 2009 â August 2009 at RMB 3,408.66 / month</td>                <td valign="top"></td>                <td valign="top">                RMB 10,225.98</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top">                September 2009 to June 2011 at RMB 3,700 / month</td>                <td valign="top"></td>                <td valign="top">                <u>RMB 81,400.00</u></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top">                Total:</td>                <td valign="top"></td>                <td valign="top">                RMB 122,121.08</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  The total loss of earnings for the pre-trial period is thus RMB5,331.16 x 38 months - RMB122,121.08 = <u>RMB 80,463</u>.</p>    <p class="heading">Future Loss of Earnings / Loss of Promotional Prospect / Risk of Redeployment</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  There are three aspects of the claim which need to be considered under this head:  first, the reduction in earnings as Chief Matewhen compared with the pre-accident earnings as Deputy Captain; second, the loss of earnings on account of the loss of promotionalprospect to be Captain of the Zhonghang 903; and third, the possibility of a reduction in income by reason of being required to takeretirement or being redeployed to a job with a lower salary.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  On the first question, at the time of the trial the Plaintiff was 2 months from 49.  Taking retirement at the age of 60 and consideringalso the nature of work as a seaman, I think a multiplier of 7 is appropriate.  I think it is reasonable to take into account a 10%rise in the level of income in the coming years.  Accordingly, the loss of future earnings if the Plaintiff continues to be employedas the Chief Mate will be:</p>	<blockquote>		<p>RMB (5,331 â 3,700) x 110% x 12 x 7 = RMB150,704.</p>	</blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  On the second question concerning the loss of promotional prospect, as already discussed, the treatment of such loss is differentdepending whether a claim is made for pre-trial or future loss. </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  If, on the evidence, the claimant establishes on a balance of probabilities that there would have been a promotion before trial,the promotion is to be treated as an event certain which straddles the trial date.  The increased level of income on promotion willhave to be adopted as the basis for assessment of future earnings.  On the other hand, as in the present case, the claimant has failedto establish that he would have been promoted during the pre-trial period, the claim for future loss will be assessed by way of anevaluation of the chance of the prospect of such promotion.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The relevant principles are summarised in Cheung JAâs judgment in <i>Liu Chun Kow Joe v Lee Sau Wing</i>, CACV 304 of 2007:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â41.

Consistent with this approach, the English Court of Appeal in <i>Allied Maples Group v Simmons &amp; Simmons</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20WLR%201602" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 WLR 1602</a> at 1610 per Stuart-Smith LJ held that</p>		<blockquote>			<p class="quote"><b>âQuestions of quantification of the plaintiffâs loss, however, may depend upon future uncertain events.</b> For example, whether and to what extent he will suffer osteoarthritis, whether he will continue to earn at the same rate until retirement,whether, but for the accident, he might have been promoted. It is trite law that these questions are not decided on a balance ofprobability, but rather on the courtâs assessment, often expressed in percentage terms, of the risk eventuating or the prospectof promotion, which it should be noted depends in part at least on the hypothetical acts of a third party, namely the plaintiffâsemployer.â</p>		</blockquote>                <p class="quote">43. This was expanded later in the judgment under the third category of situations which may arise where the plaintiffâs loss dependsupon the action of an independent third party.</p>        <p class="quote">44. The three situations are best summarised by Otton LJ in <i>Doyle v Wallace</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20PIQR%20Q146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] PIQR Q146</a> at Q149 as follows :</p>		<blockquote>			<p class="quote">â(1) In his first category fell cases in which the defendantâs negligence consisted of some positive act or misfeasance and thequestion of causation was one of historical fact, in which event proof on the balance of probability prevailed.</p>			<p class="quote">(2) In the second category fell cases in which the defendantâs negligence consisted of an omission where caution depended not upona question of historical fact but upon the answer to the hypothetical question âwhat would the plaintiff have done if there hadbeen no negligence?â; here the answer is provided by the application of proof on the balance of probabilities.</p>			<p class="quote">(3) In the third category fell cases in which the plaintiffâs loss depended upon the hypothetical action of a third party, whetherin addition to action by the plaintiff or independently of it; here the plaintiff need only show that he had a substantial chanceof the third party acting in such a way as to benefit him. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiffs needed to show only thatthere was a significant chance, which could be less than likely, that the third party would have been prepared to offer them thisprotection and held that the loss of such a chance had been made out and it was assessed at 50 per cent.â</p>		</blockquote>                <p class="quote">For ease of reading I have numbered the three situations.â</p>        <p>(emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  In assessing <i>future uncertain events</i> and where such contingency will have to depend upon the action of a third party, for instance, the prospect of promotion or riskof redeployment, the court should adopt the approach for the category-three cases as explained in paragraph 44 of Cheung JAâs judgmentabove: see <i>Cheung Mun Yi v Tam Siu Wing &amp; Anor</i>, HCPI 809 of 2006; <i>Attorney General v Chun Yat Nam</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20HKC%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 HKC 218</a>, at 236D - 237B.  The approach is to inquire, first, whether the evidence discloses a âsubstantial chanceâ or âsignificantchanceâ (which could be less than likely) of the event or risk materializing, and if so, such contingency should be taken intoaccount for the purpose of assessment.  The lost chance or risk is generally assessed as a percentage.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In this case, as earlier noted, the evidence does reveal a real prospect of the Plaintiffâs promotion to be Captain of Zhonghang903 if not for the accident.  The question is one of timing.  Taking into account the letters from his employers I think it is reasonableto consider that the promotion would likely take place in the near rather than distant future.  In the circumstances, while takingnote on the one hand of the good prospect of promotion but also bearing in mind the uncertainty as to timing on the other, I wouldassess his overall chance of deriving a higher income for the post-trial period to be 60%. </p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  On the evidence which is not disputed, the monthly salary of the Captain of Zhonghang 903 would have been about RMB3,800. He wouldalso earn a monthly labour fee of RMB1,400; half-year and year-end bonuses of RMB12,000, and an extra annual quarter-bonus of RMB2,000. These aggregate about RMB76,400 a year or RMB6,367 per month.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Accordingly, I would assess the loss on account of loss of promotional prospect to be as follows:</p>	<blockquote>		<p>RMB (6,367 â 5,331) x 110% x 12 x 7 x 60% = RMB57,436.</p>	</blockquote>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  On the third question, the Plaintiff contends that there is a possibility that he will lose the job as Chief Mate on the Xianxing703.  On the evidence from the employer, the Plaintiffâs present position as the Chief Mate is a tailor-made position for him. In the letter from the employer (dated 20 July 2010), the Plaintiffâs present job was described as a âtemporary arrangementâ. The evidence further suggests that the employer is keeping the Plaintiffâs situation under review.  I accept the Plaintiffâsevidence that the company had raised with him the possibility of early retirement or redeployment to some other duties such as aguard / watchman.  It is quite apparent, and I find, that whether the Plaintiff will be able to keep his present job as Chief Matewill depend not only on his physical ability to discharge his present duties but also on the employerâs assessment of whether heshould be allowed to continue in that position.  As is evident from the said letter, the employer may have regard to the overallefficiency and safety of the vesselâs operation in coming to a decision whether the Plaintiff should be redeployed.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Whilst noting that the evidence does not indicate an imminent danger of redeployment, I would nevertheless consider that the riskshould be taken into account given the somewhat precarious nature of his present position.  I would assess the overall chance ofthat eventuating to be 25%. </p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Accordingly, the loss on account of the risk of redeployment is calculated as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>RMB (5,331 - 1,100) x 110% x 12 x 7 x 25% = RMB97,736.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  The aggregate amount for future loss of earnings is therefore: RMB (150,704 + 57,436 + 97,736) = <u>RMB305,876</u>.</p>    <p class="heading">Loss of Earning Capacity</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  This is a separate head to compensate him for the disadvantage in the labour market should be he lose employment with the presentemployer altogether. </p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The Plaintiff has all along only received training as a seaman.  He does not have other special skills.  I will accept that he wouldsuffer disadvantage if he were asked to retire or otherwise lost his job with the present employer altogether.  In this connection,I think it is right to have regard to the possibility of the employer redeveloping him (for which he is already compensated) andhence the chance of losing the job completely will be reduced.  Taking all matters into account, I think it will be appropriate toassess the loss arising under this head by a sum equivalent to about 6 monthsâ earnings, say RMB32,000.</p>    <p class="heading">Loss of Congenial Employment</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  The Plaintiffâs case for a claim under this head is that before the accident, he was the Deputy Captain of a vessel, a positionthat commanded respect from others and gave him much satisfaction.  He is now only granted a lower position on a smaller vessel,a situation which undermines his self-esteem.  It is contended that the Plaintiffâs case is comparable to that in <i>Wong Sau Lai v Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd</i>, HCPI 111 of 2002 (on appeal,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%204%20HKLRD%20395" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 4 HKLRD 395:</a> and  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282006%29%209%20HKCFAR%20371" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2006) 9 HKCFAR 371)</a> on this issue.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  I do not think a separate award should be made under this head in the present case.  The present case is quite unlike the situationin <i>Wong Sau Laiâs case</i> where the claimant was forced to quit her âdream jobâ as a cabin attendant.  In the present case, the Plaintiff is still employedas a seaman, and occasionally he would take over certain navigation duties of a captain or deputy captain.</p>    <p class="heading">Care and Attention of Wife</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  A sum of RMB10,000 is claimed under this head.

The Defendant argued that since the experts had questioned the appropriateness of prolongedbed rest and that some of the expenses were incurred to treat the resulting dizziness, such expenses should be disallowed.  However,even if the expenses were incurred to treating dizziness, such treatment clearly flowed from the Plaintiffâs injuries which wereoccasioned by the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantsâ wrongdoing.  I do not consider the treatment received by the Plaintiff in the Mainland hospital has broken the causallink between the wrongdoing of the relevant Defendants and the loss incurred.

The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant seeks costs against the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  It would appear from the correspondence between the parties that soon after the Action was commenced, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs solicitors had already warned the Plaintiff that his claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was misconceived. This led eventually to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs application to strike out the Plaintiffâs claim. The application was refused by the Master who ordered costs againstthe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant for the unsuccessful application. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not appeal the Masterâs decision and I do not think that those costs should now be reopened.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  In resisting the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs application for costs here, Mr Szeto submitted that the Court should not assume that the Plaintiffâs claim againstthe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would fail. However, nothing put forward by the Plaintiff had convinced me that the Plaintiff had a valid claim againstthe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. I have little doubt that his claim would fail had it not been withdrawn. Therefore, in relation to any costs incurredby the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant (up to the time of the Plaintiffâs withdrawal of the claim) which are over and above those for the striking out should,in my view, be awarded in favour of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. The extent of those costs is a matter for taxation (unless agreed by the parties). Further in this connection, it shouldbe noted that all three Defendants are represented by the same counsel and solicitors. The part of the costs which was common toall three Defendants in defending this Action cannot be regarded as costs exclusively incurred by 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. Therefore, in taxation, it will be incumbent upon the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to identify precisely that part of the costs incurred exclusively by it which is over and above those incurred for thestriking out.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Subject to the aforesaid, I would make an order <i>nisi</i> for Plaintiffâs costs of the Action to be borne by the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  The Plaintiffâs own costs are to be taxed in accordance with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>.</p>	<p> </p>		<p> </p>		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">		<tr>			<td width="50%" valign="top"></td>			<td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Ambrose Ho, SC)<br />			Recorder of the Court of First Instance<br />			High Court</td>		</tr>	</table>		<!--sino section representation --><representation>		<p> </p>	<p>Mr Patrick Szeto, instructed by Messrs Ip, Kwan &amp; Co., assigned by Director of Legal Aid, for the Plaintiff</p>		<p>Mr Tim Kwok and Mr Tony Chow, instructed by Messrs Holman Fenwick Willan, for the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants</p>	</representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2011/613.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
