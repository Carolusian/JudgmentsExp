The details or the basisof the plaintiffs' claim are not relevant for present purposes.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> In the Amended Statement of Claim by paragraphs 26(a), (b) and (c), the plaintiffs advanced a number of claims for damages includingunder paragraph 26(a) pain, suffering, loss of amenities, physical inconvenience, mental stress and so on, and it is claimed thatby reason of the defendant's breach of duty since about mid-1999 the 1st plaintiff had suffered insomnia, pneumonia, arthritis ofthe right knee, impairment of concentration and other ailments, and was diagnosed in June 2003 to be suffering from depressive disorder.It is also claimed in paragraph 26(b) that there was a loss of opportunity and profits to resell the property at the rising market.In paragraph 26(c), the plaintiffs made a claim for loss or diminution in value of the property by reason of the lack of a completeset of title documents in a falling market.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Under the particulars under that sub-paragraph, they referred to two specific incidents :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) they have said that they had only one offer for HK$8.5 million from a third party to purchase the property in or about early 1998;and</p>        <p>(2) there are contemplated time and again from about mid-1999 to the present, that is the present date of the amendment to the Statementof Claim, to cut loss and sell the property.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In relation to these items the defendant seeks discovery of various documents as set out in the schedule to the summons. I will notset them out in detail here save for the necessity to refer to one sub-category in a moment.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The action has reached the stage where a split trial of liability and quantum has been ordered and the trial of liability is nowscheduled for November of this year. On that basis the plaintiffs rejected the request for specific discovery on the basis that suchdiscovery is not necessary at this stage of the proceedings. Mr Wu on behalf of the plaintiffs referred me to the judgment of LightmanJ in the English High Court in the case of <strong>Baldock v. Addison &amp; Ors</strong> [1995] 1 WLR at page 158. In that case Lightman J, in a considered judgment, held that where there has been a split trial of theaction with the issue of liability being determined before any question of assessment of damages, then it would need special circumstancesbefore the court would exercise its discretion to order discovery relating solely to quantum which, as I have already described,is the present circumstances before me. There is nothing, in my view, put before me to justify why I should not follow that approach.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> I note also that in <strong>Kapur v. J.W. Francis &amp; Co.</strong> (1988) <strong>The Times</strong>, the English Court of Appeal had come to a similar view where if there is a separate trial of liability and quantum, the court wouldnot normally exercise its discretion to order discovery solely in relation to quantum and a party seeking such discovery must satisfythe court that such an order was not wasteful of cost, and would be of real assistance to him in making a realistic and sensibleoffer of settlement or paying in. There is nothing in the evidence before me to show that this is the case.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> In any event, Lightman J in <strong>Baldock</strong> considered the point that an opportunity for the party seeking discovery to assess the prospects of success and to determine whetherto go on with the matter is not sufficient by itself to engage the court's discretion in ordering discovery. That being the case,I see no reason why the defendant should have discovery that they seek by their summons.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> I would note and record that the defendant's solicitor, Miss Tse, has informed me this morning since the conclusion of certain relatedproceedings by the mortgagee that a split trial is no longer necessary and she referred me to correspondence between the solicitorsin March of this year indicating that the plaintiffs' solicitors have shown that there is no in-principle reason why a trial of liabilityand damages should not now be held together.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Before me Mr Wu today has no instructions to comment on that proposed course of action and in any event there being no summons beforeme that is not something that I will take into account. In any event I have to mention that whether, if an application were madeto the court in due course, a combined trial will be held is far from clear. As I said the trial date for the trial of liabilityhas been set for November of this year, if there is to be a combined trial of both liability and quantum, it is not at all clearat this stage whether the November dates could be kept and if the combined trial were to be held and the trial has to be delayedthat may cause prejudice to the plaintiffs. For that reason I do not speculate upon whether an application for varying the directionfor a split trial would be made and, if so, whether discovery would be appropriate consequent upon that variation of the direction.Therefore the rejection of the discovery sought today should not bar the defendant from seeking such discovery if they see fit whenthe question of quantum becomes relevant and also that must be without prejudice to the plaintiffs' opposition to any such furtherapplication.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> I mentioned earlier that there is one item that I would wish to mention specifically and that is in relation to item (c) in the scheduleto the defendant's summons. By the present schedule they seek : "Documents relating to all mortgage repayments by the Plaintiffsto Orix Asia Limited on the Property, including all documents issued to Orix Asia Limited." As it is framed at the moment, this isfar too wide. It would include documents which could not in any way be said to be necessary, such as copies of cheques or copiesof deposit slips which would be relating to mortgage repayments made by the plaintiffs but cannot be said to be conducive to thefair disposal of the matter.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Before me today when I raised the issue with Miss Tse of the defendant, she has proposed to amend that paragraph of the scheduleto the following : "All those documents issued by Orix Asia Limited to the plaintiffs in relation to their mortgage repayments ontheir Property." Having rejected the defendant's application for discovery as being premature and unnecessary at this stage of theproceedings, I need not make an order on that.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Therefore for those reasons I make no order on the defendant's summons.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> I will now hear the parties on costs.</p>    <p class="heading">[Submissions on Costs]</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Having heard both parties I see no reason why the plaintiffs should not have their costs, however I would order that the costs beto the plaintiffs in any event rather than to be taxed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(S.T.
