In around 1996,the plaintiff was interested in investing in shares and opened a cash trading account with the defendant company through Mrs Ho,a long time family friend who was employed by the defendant as dealer representative.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  At the time he opened the account with the defendant, Mrs Ho gave the plaintiff documents to sign, including: Account Opening Information,Uniform Cash Clientâs Agreement (the âUCC Agreementâ) and a Chinese document with the heading âæéï¼å§ä»»ä»£è¡¨äºå®â(the âAuthorization Letterâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Between December 1996 and October 2000, the plaintiff gave Mrs Ho a number of instructions to purchase and sell shares. The arrangementwas the plaintiff would give Mrs Ho oral instructions to either purchase or sell shares, after his instructions were executed, MrsHo would then orally inform the plaintiff. In case of a purchase, Mrs Ho would instruct the plaintiff to deposit funds into her bankaccount and in case of sells, Mrs Ho would arrange to deposit the proceed into the plaintiffâs account.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  After every transaction, brought or sold notes would be sent to the plaintiff. The plaintiff also received monthly statements, allapparently issued by the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In or around the end of 2000, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (the âICACâ) contacted the plaintiff and asked forhis assistance in their investigation against Mrs Ho for fraud.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Mrs Ho was subsequently prosecuted and convicted in 30 charges of procuring the making of an entry in bank records by deceptionsand of thief. One of Mrs Hoâs tricks was to falsely represent to clients, including the plaintiff, that shares had been purchasedin accordance with their instructions, and induced them into depositing money into bank accounts controlled by her. In fact the clientsâinstructions were never executed and the purchase money was appropriated for Mrs Hoâs own use.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Between December 1996 and October 2000, the plaintiff instructed Mrs Ho to purchase the following shares (the â Sharesâ):</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="60%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="30%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">PAC Centcyber-N</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">7,116 shares</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="30%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">SHK PPT</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">3,000 shares</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="30%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Lamex Holdings</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">120,000 shares</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="30%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">AWT Holdings/401.com</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">200,000 shares</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="30%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">China Unicom</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">4,000 shares</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="30%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Sunevision</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">14 shares</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  HK$829,260.84, inclusive of purchase price, brokerage and CCASS fees, were paid by the plaintiff to Mrs Ho.

The duties of a dealerrepresentative were:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)    Introducing clients to the defendant and receiving instructions on securities from clients, on behalf of the defendant;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)    Passing her clientsâ purchase or sale orders to the dealing room of the defendant;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)    After the dealing room executed the orders, to confirm the transaction with her clients.

Minister of Social Security</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%202%20QB%20173" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] 2 QB 173</a>, Cooke J. stated the test as follows: âIs the person who has engaged himself to perform these services performing them as a personin business on his own account? If the answer to that question is âYesâ, then the contract is a contract for service. If theanswer is âNoâ, then the contract is a contract of service.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> In <i>Tong Chun Chung v. Onshine Securities Ltd</i>. HCA 4343/1991, Liu J. (as he then was) applied this test to a securities brokerage dealer representative and concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âA dealerâs representative is defined in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.2</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333" class="autolink_findacts">Securities Ordinance</a> as a person in the employment of a broker. The defendant had certainly power to direct and control the work of Yeung although a runnerâsperformance would probably be more productive without very close supervision. A runner would guard his contract jealously to protecthis commission earning capacity. However, the defendant company could insist on revelation of such information from his runners,including Yeung, although more often than not it would refrain from doing so. The runners, including Yeung must conform with thebasic guidelines in matters of form, procedure and policy. Yeung disclosed in his evidence that the defendantâs observance of itsown regulatory procedure irregularities and made references to similar shortfalls in the general practice of other broker firms.Yeung ran a private mobile phone and incurred entertainment expenses, but he was exposed to no real financial risk; nor could itbe sensibly maintained that he was in fact running his own business or outfit independently of the defendant. The court was not toldof any terms or conditions regarding Yeungâs position as a runner with the defendant, which were decidedly inconsistent with thestatus of an employee. In my view, without doubt, Yeung was an employee of the defendant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Here, the defendantâs director Mr Wong Tung Chi, Tony (â Mr. Wongâ), testified that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)   Mrs Ho was appointed by the defendant.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)   She had an assigned place of work at the defendantâs office. In Mr Wong's words, Mrs Ho âæä½åâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)   In dealings with Mrs Ho, a customer would rely on the goodwill of the defendant.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)   She was remunerated by the defendant, at a commission rate agreed between her and the defendant. The customer would not evenbe informed of the commission rate.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(5)   Her conduct was subject to the control of the defendant. There were regular meetings, where the defendant ensured Mrs Ho andother dealer representatives were aware of<i> </i>and followed the defendantâs procedures and guidelines.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(6)   The defendant could terminate Mrs Hoâs appointment at any time, if her conduct was unsatisfactory to the defendant.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(7)   She owned duties of<i> </i>loyalty to the defendant and was not allowed to introduce customers to any other securities broker.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(8)   There was no real financial risk to Mrs Ho.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The facts surrounding Mrs Hoâs engagement with the defendant are similar to the dealer representative in <i>Tong Chun Chung</i>, nothing the defendant has stated about Mrs Hoâs relationship with the defendant pointed against an employment relationship.Havingcarefully considered all of the circumstances of this case, I find as a matter of fact that Mrs Ho was the defendantâs employee.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">What were the authorities of a dealer representative with the defendant in relation to receiving instructions and confirming executionof these instructions?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Mr Wong testified that the defendantâs dealer representatives have the following authorities:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  Receiving instructions to buy or sell shares from customers on behalfof the defendant.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  On behalf of the defendant, r elay verbal confirmations (as to whether purchase or sale instructions had been carried out) tocustomers. The customer was entitled to rely on the dealer representativeâs verbal confirmation as being true.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Was Mrs Ho authorized to receive money from the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The defendantâs allegation that Mrs Ho was not authorized to receive money from the plaintiff was based on clause 3 of the UCCAgreement. Mr Chan, counsel for the defendant, argued that clause 3 stated specifically that the plaintiff had agreed to pay allsettlement sum directly to the defendantâs account and thus shows Mrs Ho had no authority to receive money from the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The relevant part of clause 3 of the UCC Agreement read as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âUnless otherwise agreed, I/We agreed that when you have executed a purchase or sale transaction on my/our behalf, I/we will bydue settlement date make payment to you against delivery of credit to my account for purchase securities, or make good delivery ofsold securities to you against payment, as the case may be.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> There was nothing in clause 3 that mentioned direct payment or payment into the defendantâs account. In fact, there was no mentionof what was acceptable or unacceptable form of payment. It just said if defendant purchased shares on plaintiffâs instructions,plaintiff had to pay defendant on or before the settlement date.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The plaintiff testified that the Authorization Letter was proffered by Mrs Ho with the other account opening documents. Given thefact that her duty was to introduce customers to the defendant, proffering account-opening documents for customerâs signature mustbe within the ostensible authority of Mrs Ho. In fact, during his testimony, Mr Wong admitted it was within Mrs Hoâs actual authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> During his cross-examination, after changing his testimonies no less than three times, Mr Wong finally admitted that the defendantagreed to the terms of the Authorization Letter and conducted its dealings with the plaintiff in accordance to the content of thesame.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Paragraph 2 of the Authorization Letter stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âè²´å¬å¸å¯å¨è²´å¬å¸èªçºå¿è¦æç¥æå¾ç­æ /åä¸è¿°ä»£è¡¨æ³¨å¥é¡å¤ãå­å±ãä¿è­éï¼èåå°ä¸è¿°ä»£è¡¨æç¼åºä¹ç¥¨æãæ¯ç¥¨ãå­å¥å¾ç­å¨è²´å¬å¸ä¹è­å¸æææ¬æ¶å£ä¸­ãâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> In other words, the defendant agreed to accept Mrs Hoâs cheques in settlement of the plaintiffâs purchase orders. Unless thedefendant thought Mrs Ho was using plaintiffâs account to do her own trading (and approved it), it must have known that beforeor immediately after Mrs Ho issued her cheque to settle the plaintiffâs account, the plaintiff would have paid the settlement fundto Mrs Ho.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> It was implicit in the defendantâs agreement to accept Mrs Hoâs cheques to settle the plaintiffâs outstanding account thatit had also agreed the plaintiff could pay his outstanding account through Mrs Ho. I find as a matter of fact that Mrs Ho was authorizedby the defendant to receive money from the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><u>Plaintiffâs causes of actions:</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The plaintiffâs claim was based on four separate causes of action:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)    The defendant was in breach of an implied term of agreement in failing to or refusing to account for or deliver up the Sharesthat the plaintiff had given valid instructions to purchase.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)    The defendant was vicariously liable for its employeeâs, Mrs Ho's, fraudulent representations in tort.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)    The defendant was in breach of an implied term of the agreement and a common law duty of care to the plaintiff for failingto exercise reasonable care in implementing proper internal control mechanisms to prevent loss to the plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)     The defendant was in breach of trust for failing to or refusing to account for or deliver up the sum of HK$829,260.84, paidto the defendant for the Shares that the defendant did not purchase.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> I will now deal with each cause of action separately.</p>    <p class="heading">Breach of implied term to deliver up or account for shares:</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> The thrust of the plaintiffâs case was that Mrs Ho had the authority to receive instructions to purchase and to receive paymentsfor the Shares on behalf of the defendant. It was not disputed that the plaintiff did give instructions to purchase and paid MrsHo for the Shares, it must follow that the defendant is contractually obligated to deliver up or account for the same.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The defendantâs defence on this cause of action were:</p>    <blockquote>        (1)   The implied terms only applies to shares duly purchased and money actually and duly received by the defendant. Sinceclause 3 of the UCC Agreement specified that payment must be made to the defendant and plaintiff only made payment to Mrs Ho, theimplied term did not apply.    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        (2)    Even if the defendant was liable to the plaintiff, the defendant is exempted from liability pursuant to the indemnityclause in the Authorization Letter.    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> As I have already found clause 3 of the UCC Agreement did not require the plaintiff to pay the defendant directly and paragraph 2of the Authorization Letter, by necessarily implication, authorized Mrs Ho to receive money from the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant,the first ground of defence must fail.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> As to the second ground of defence, when Mr Chan first raised this issue during his cross-examination of the plaintiff, I enquiredif it was pleaded and Mr Chan admitted it was not. I then asked if he wanted to amend his pleadings to add this ground of defenceand Mr Chan said no and withdrew that question. I was frankly flabbergasted to find this argument reappearing in Mr Chanâs closingsubmission.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> It is trite that one is bound by oneâs pleaded case. It is often forgotten that the purpose of proper pleading is to ensure theoverriding principle that litigation between parties, and particularly the trial, should be conducted fairly, openly, without surprisesand as far as possible, so as to minimise costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Quite apart from a pleading point, if the defendant were allowed to proceed with this defence, especially after Mr Chan rejectedthe opportunity to amend the defence during trial, would deprive the plaintiff an opportunity to examine the circumstances surroundingthe signing of the Authorization Letter, the relative bargaining position of the parties and the rules of construction that shouldbe applied. Allowing Mr Chan to ignore the rules would result in actual and material prejudice to the plaintiff, I therefore refuseto consider this unpleaded ground of defence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Perhaps as a reply to Mr Man making an issue on the defendantâs failure to plead the indemnity clause, in his closing submission,Mr Chan stated the plaintiff had also failed to mention the Authorization Letter in his pleadings too.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> The difference between the defendantâs failure to plead the indemnity clause and the plaintiffâs failure to mention the AuthorizationLetter in his pleading, is simply the former was a ground of defence relied on and the latter, merely evidence in support of allegationsclearly stated in the pleadings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Whilst Paragraph 18/7/7 of Hong Kong Civil Procedure states: âEach party must plead all the material facts on which he means torely at the trial; otherwise he is not entitled to give any evidence of them at the trial.â Paragraph 18/7/5 of Hong Kong CivilProcedure states: âEvery pleading must contain only statement of the material facts on which the party pleading relies, and notthe evidence by which they are to be proved.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Accordingly, the plaintiffâs first cause of action should succeed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Although once I find for the plaintiff on one cause of action, it is not necessary for me to consider the other three causes; howeverfor completeness, I will complete my analysis of the other causes as well.</p>    <p class="heading">Vicarious liability:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The relevant law was succinctly stated by Earl Loreburn in <i>Lloyd v. Grace, Smith &amp; Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1912%5d%20AC%20716" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1912] AC 716</a> (at page 724). Earl Loreburn wrote:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIf the agent commits the fraud purporting to act in the course of business such as he was authorized, or held out as authorized,to transact on account of his principal, then the latter may be held liable for it.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> The test is whether the agentâs fraudulent representation was made within his actual or ostensible authority? All of the casescited by Mr Chan did not depart from the legal principle stated <i>in Lloyd v Grace, Smith &amp; Co</i>, but factually the courts there found the fraudulent representations were made outside of the agentsâ ostensible authorities.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> It was undisputed that dealer representatives like Mrs Ho, had actual authority to report to customers when their orders were executedand I have already found Mrs Ho had actual authority to receive the purchase money from the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant,the fraudulent representation she made to the plaintiff was clearly within her ostensible authority. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Quite apart from whether Mrs Ho had any authority to receive money on behalf of the defendant, it is important to remember that thiscause of action is based on Mrs Hoâs fraudulent representation to the plaintiff that all purchase transactions for the Shares hadbeen executed and in reliance thereto, the plaintiff paid money for the Shares and therefore acted to his detriment.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> The plaintiffâs case relied only on Mrs Hoâs fraudulent representation that the purchase orders were executed. Whether Mrs Howas authorized to receive money from the plaintiff was not relevant, because the payment of money was merely the detriment causedby Mrs Hoâs fraudulent representation and not the fraudulent representation itself. Since the defendant admitted reporting to customersthat their orders were duly executed was within Mrs Hoâs actual authority, there is no question that Mrs Hoâs fraudulent representationwas within her ostensible authority.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Accordingly, the defendant is vicariously liable to the fraudulent representation of Mrs Ho.</p>    <p class="heading">The independent claim of negligence:  </p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The SFCâs public reprimand stated the independent accountant identified four âspecific weaknessesâ of the defendant, including:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) no written company policies and procedures manual;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b) inadequate overall management controls including:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(i) weak control over the issue and delivery of trading documents; and</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(ii) weak control over account opening procedures and the steps necessary to change client particulars;</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(c) inadequate segregation of duties in the form of weak control over client orders and dealings; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d) no proper procedures for staff dealing.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> The defendant stated in the defence that it did not accept the findings of the independent accountant; however the defendant tookno steps to protest its findings.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> Mr Chan argued that was because there was no avenue of appeal in the old <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333" class="autolink_findacts">Securities Ordinance</a> and when I asked if the defendant considered a judicial review, Mr Chan said it was costly and once the reprimand was made public,it was not worth the trouble. Since all judicial reviews must by definition be preceded by a decision of some public body and itis likely that such decision would have been made public as soon as it was made, if Mr Chanâs rationale was correct, all judicialreviews would be a waste of time.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> In any event, the defendant has fought hard not to disclose the independent accountantâs report. When the plaintiffâs solicitorsseek to discover this report, Mr Lee Sung Yin, another director of the defendant, stated in paragraph 15 of his affirmation in oppositiondated 17/12/2005:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦This is because the plaintiff can rely on the final findings concluded by the independent certified public accounts as statedin the press release in questionâ¦in order to show the cause in relation to the present case.â <i>Emphasis added</i>.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> It is my opinion that the defendant cannot on the one hand refuse to disclose the independent accountantâs report by stating, <i>inter alia</i>, the plaintiff can rely on the conclusion of the report and on the other hand state that it does not agree with the same conclusion,without adducing any evidence in support. Doing so tantamount to having its cake and eat it as well.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> As in any claim for negligence, the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the defendant owed him a duty of care, that the defendantbreached that duty of care and as a result of that breach the plaintiff suffered a lost.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Whilst no one can dispute the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care and that the plaintiff suffered a lost, the only issuein this cause of action is whether the defendant breached that duty of care.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> In accordance to the conclusion of the independent accountantâs report, the defendant had weak internal controls and it was clearlyforeseeable that weak internal controls could lead to frauds against customers of the brokerage firm. Mr Alan Linning, the SFC ExecutiveDirector of Enforcement, in the conclusion of the public reprimand against the defendant, stated: âWeak internal controls in abrokerage put the brokerâs clients and the broker itself at risk. At worst, they allow brokerage employee to defraud clients.â</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> The defendant owed the plaintiff a duty to ensure it had sufficient internal control to prevent its employees defaulting its client.The defendant was in breach of that duty and as a result of that breach Mrs Ho was able to default the plaintiff.  Defendant wasliable to the plaintiff in negligence as well.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> As to contributory negligence, Mr Chan raised two points: (1) The plaintiff should not have paid money directly to Mrs Ho; and (2)the plaintiff should not have signed the Authorization Letter.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> In my opinion, neither had any merit. First, I have already found the defendant authorized Mrs Ho to receive money from the plaintiff.Second, how could the plaintiff know he was not supposed to pay money to Mrs Ho, an employee/agent/representative of the defendant?Especially when the Authorization Letter was proffered to him as part and parcel of the account opening documents. The duty was inthe defendant to have sufficient internal controls to prevent its staff from defaulting its customers and not in leaving the customersto protect themselves. There was no contributory negligence.</p>    <p class="heading">Breach of Trust:</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Once I found Mrs Ho had authority to receive money from the plaintiff to settle outstanding share purchases, it follows that whenMrs Ho received money from the plaintiff, the defendant was in law deemed to have received the same and when the money was not usedto purchase the Shares, the defendant is liable to account for the money as fiduciary and as trustee. Therefore, the defendant isliable under this cause of action as well.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Quantum:</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> In <i>McGregor on Damages</i> (<i>17<sup>th</sup> Ed),</i> at paragraph 22-003, the learned author stated the general rule in damages for failing to deliver shares, as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â The normal measure of damages is the market price of the shares at the contractual time for delivery less the contract price.This represents the amount that the buyer must obtain to put himself in the position he would have been in had the contract beencarried out, since to do so he must buy equivalent shares in the market.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Since the date Mrs Ho confirmed the purchase of the Shares were the date that the defendant was contractually required to deliverthe Shares to the plaintiff, the proper measurement of damages should be the purchase price of the Shares HK$829,260.84.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> For the claim in vicarious liability for the fraud of Mrs Ho, Silke JA in <i>Wocom Commodities Ltd. v Texuna International Ltd</i>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20HKC%20392" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] HKC 392</a>, at page 404, quoted <i>McGregor on Damages</i> <i>(14<sup>th</sup> Ed),</i> paragraph 1459, and stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThus the correct measure of damages in the tort of deceit is an award which serves to put the plaintiff into the position he wouldhave been in if the representation had <i>not</i> been made to him, and not as with breach of condition or warranty in contract, into the position he would have been in if the representationhad been <i>true</i>.â <i>Emphasis original.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> If Mrs Ho did not represent to the plaintiff that the Shares had been duly purchased for him, the plaintiff would not have depositedHK$829,260.84 into her account. The proper measurement under this cause of action is thus HK$829,260.84.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> In the independent negligent claim, the proper measurement of damages is again HK$829.260.84.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> For the claim in fiduciary duty and trust, the money paid by the plaintiff to the defendant as trustee, to be applied to the purchaseof the Shares. In fact the money was misapplied. The defendant must account for the money paid by the plaintiff, which is again HK$829,260.84.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Mr Chan argued in his final submission that because the plaintiff retained the Shares and he had expressly accepted the risk of securitiesdealings, the general rule should not be applied. All purchasers of securities must have either expressly or impliedly accepted thatthere is a risk the value of their securities may fall. I see no merits in Mr Chanâs argument.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Mr Chan also stated that the ICAC had only charged Mrs Ho in relation to one transaction in which the plaintiff paid her HK$264,083.00and that the proper measure of damages should be that sum only.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Which transaction the ICAC decided to charge Mrs Ho with is not relevant to how much the defendant is liable to the plaintiff inany one of the four causes of actions.
