Popular toys are not just play-things.  They involve enormous amount of business.  Consequently,they would easily attract imitators.  In this case, we are concerned with a line of dolls called <i>âBRATZâ</i>.</p>    <p class="heading">BACKGROUND</p>    <p class="heading">The âBratzâ dolls</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The Plaintiff is a company incorporated and existing under the laws of the United States of America carrying on business in the design,manufacture and sale of, inter alia, toys and dolls.  Amongst the Plaintiffâs products, there are a series of fashion dolls knownas âBRATZâ dolls.  According to the Plaintiff, the âBRATZâ dolls were originally developed under a distinct theme of denotinghip and cool young adolescent or teenage girls and consisted of four dolls representing different ethnic origins, namely, Cloe (Caucasian),Sasha (Black), Yasmin (Hispanic) and Jade (Asian).  The theme is that they represent 4 best friends in high school who love to tradeclothes, shoes and hairdos.  Their accessories are interchangeable and thus they can look different everyday.  Subsequently, twomore female dolls, namely, Meygan and Dana, and four male dolls were added to the range.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> In the USA, the âBRATZâ dolls have brought numerous awards for the Plaintiff.  In 2001, the âBRATZâ line of products wonthe Toy Industry Association (âTIAâ) Peopleâs Choice Toy of the Year Award, the Family Fun Toy of the Year Award and Toy WishesHot Pick Award.  In 2002, the âBRATZâ line again won the TIA Peopleâs Choice Toy of the Year Award and the Family Fun Toy ofthe Year Award.  LIMA, the licensing industryâs official arm, awarded the Plaintiffâs âBRATZâ the best character licenseof the year as well as the overall best licensed property of the year for 2003.  The âBRATZâ also earned the TIA âPropertyof the Yearâ and âGirl Toy of the Yearâ for 2003, as well as the Family Fun Toy of the Year Award.  MSNBC named âBRATZâthe âHottest Toy of the Year 2004â, and both the Plaintiff and âBRATZâ received several other accolades in 2004, includingthe Suppliers Performance Award by Retail Category in the Girlsâ Toys Category sponsored by DSN Retailing Toy/Apperel Merchandising. Additionally, in 2001 and 2002, âBRATZâ related toys won Todayâs toy tests.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Since their market introduction, the âBRATZâ dolls were sold in more than 52 countries and regions in the world including HongKong.  They were first sold in Hong Kong in mid-December 2002 and are available for sale in retail outlets such as Jusco, Toys âRâUs, Sogo, Citi-Store, Seibu, Seiyu and Kalmâs.  Shortly before and after the launch of the âBRATZâ dolls in Hong Kong, thedolls received considerable attention from the media such as Sing Tao Daily and South China Morning Post.  They also have their ownwebsite at www.bratzpack.com which is and was at all material times accessible worldwide.  The website also maintains a fan clubknown as âBRATZâ pack which maintains a list of its members.  The aim of this fan club is to notify its members of new fashiontrends that the âBRATZâ dolls will wear themselves and the launch and marketing thereof.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Moreover, the Plaintiff is and was at material times the registered proprietor of the trademarks nos.200213329 for âBRATZ and deviceâand 200309866 for the mark âBRATZâ in plain capital letters, both are registered in Class 28 in respect of dolls and doll accessories.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiffâs case</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants are and at all material times were companies incorporated and existing under the laws of Hong Kong.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant is and at all material times was the common director of both the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants which carry on the business of toys manufacturing and trading. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> In the Amended Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff claims against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants for infringement of copyright, infringement of registered trademarks and passing off, and against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant as joint tortfeasor who renders himself personally liable together with the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants, all in respect of the alleged infringing/wrongful acts done by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, as described herein below.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The Plaintiff now applies for summary judgment under Order 14 against the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> In this application for summary judgment, Mr. John Yan S.C. appearing with Mr. Colin Shipp, Counsel for the Plaintiff, indicatedthat the claim for infringement of copyright would not be pursued for summary judgment purpose.  Hence, this application only concernswith the Plaintiffâs claims against the Defendants in respect of the remaining two causes of action, namely, infringement of registeredtrade marks and passing off.</p>    <p class="heading">The alleged infringing/wrongful acts of the Defendants</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The Plaintiff came to have knowledge of the alleged infringing/wrongful acts of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants based on the documents obtained in another previous High Court Action No.3242 of 2003 (âHCA 3242â) against a toy tradingcompany named âUnion Top (H.K.) Co. Ltd.â (âUnion Topâ) which was commenced by the same Plaintiff.  In that HCA 3242, I madean Anton Pillar Order together with interim injunction on 28<sup>th</sup> August 2003 which was amended on 29 August 2003.  The said Anton Pillar Order was executed on 29<sup>th</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup> August 2003 by the Plaintiffâs solicitors at the office of Union Top.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> From the documents disclosed during the execution of the said Anton Pillar Order, the Plaintiffâs solicitors found a photographof three dolls in packaging bearing false trademark âBRATZ and deviceâ marked Y1288-2DD and 1D1987WB in one of the computersin Union Topâs office, all appear to be very similar to the Plaintiffâs âBRATZâ dolls and their packaging.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The Plaintiff further discovered the following articles :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)   a product item list in the office of Union Top showing that the maker and the maker no. in respect of item no.1D1987WB describedas â12â BRATZ FASHION GIRLS, 4 ASSTâ to be GOLDEN CITY (the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant herein) and Y1288-1DD respectively; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)   actual samples of four dolls (âthe alleged Infringing Dollsâ) in the packaging bearing the false trademark âBRATZ anddeviceâ (âthe alleged Infringing Packagingâ).  The four  alleged Infringing Dolls in the alleged Infringing Packaging werehidden in the false ceiling in a showroom of Union Topâs office.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The following documents were also found during the execution of the said Anton Pillar Order :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)   a purchase order numbered Order No. 03010045-15(B) dated 20 January 2003 from Union Top to the <i>1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</i>, for the order of 1,824 pieces of the alleged Infringing Dolls described as â12â BRATZ FASHION GIRLS, 4 ASSTâ with item no.1D1987 WB; Vendor and Customer Reference Code Y1288-2DD; Packaging; Each in Window Box, for the amount of HK$15,655.39;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)   an invoice no. YI-03-0003, for Order No. 03010045-15(B), dated 29 February 2003 issued by the <i>1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</i> to Union Top in respect of 1,824 (152 dozen) pieces of the Infringing Dolls described as â12â FASHION GIRLâ with item no. (Packing)Y1288-2DD; for the amount of HK$15,655.39;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)   a receipt numbered 0054 issued by the <i>1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</i> to Union Top for receipt of the amount of HK$15,655.39 in payment of invoice no. YI-03-0003;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d)   a Supplier Payment Statement and Bank Payment Voucher of Union Top, in relation to the <i>1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</i>, contract 03010045-15, Invoice Number YI-03-0003, Invoice Date 29th February 2003 for the invoice amount of HK$15,655.39; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(e)   a purchase order 03070069-04(LA) dated 10th August 2003 from Union Top to the <i>2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant</i>, to the attention <i>to the name of the</i> <i>3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant</i>, in respect of 720 pieces of the alleged Infringing Dolls described as â!2â BRATZ FASHION GIRLS, 4 ASSTâ; Vendor GH125; ItemNumber âID1987WBâ with Vendor Reference No. and Customer Reference Code: Y1288-2DD, by the <i>2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant</i> to Union Top.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> It is also noted that the name of the <i>3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant</i> appears on most of the discovered documents that passed between Union Top and the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> As a result of these discoveries, the Plaintiff commenced the present action.  The particulars of Infringement of Trade Marks andwrongful passing off acts are pleaded by the Plaintiff in its Amended Statement of Claim as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)   The authorization and manufacture by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant of 1,842 pieces of Infringing Dolls packaged in Infringing Packaging under invoice no. YI-03-2003 dated 29 February 2003issued by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to Union Top (H.K.) Ltd. (âUnion Topâ).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)   The sale or supply of 1,842 pieces of Infringing Dolls packaged in Infringing Packaging under invoice no. YI-03-2003 dated 29February 2003 issued by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to Union Top.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)   The sale or supply of 720 pieces of Infringing Dolls packaged in Infringing Packaging by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to Union Top under a purchase order 03070069-04 (A) dated 10 August 2003.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The alleged Infringing Dolls and Packaging</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The alleged Infringing Dolls and Packaging together with the Plaintiffâs Dolls and Packaging were produced to the Court at thehearing.  I had the opportunity to examine them in details, including the size and colours of their heads, surface decoration andbody of the respective dolls, and the appearance, colours and position of the words, pictures and devices appearing on the respectivepackaging.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> After my examination, I have no hesitation to find that the alleged Infringing Dolls and alleged Infringing Packaging closely resemblethe Plaintiffâs Dolls and Packaging.  In fact, the same words âBRATZâ appear in an extremely similar manner on both the allegedInfringing Packaging and the Plaintiffâs Packaging. </p>    <p class="heading">The Defence of the Defendants</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> By their Defence, the Defendants denied that they had passed off the Plaintiffâs âBRATZâ dolls and packaging and put the Plaintiffin strict proof thereof.  They also denied that they had infringed the registered trade marks of the Plaintiff saying that the registrationof the relevant trade marks are invalid and, again, put the Plaintiff in strict proof thereof.  The Defence, in my view, is no morethan a bare denial.  At the hearing, Mr. C.W. Ling, Counsel for the Defendants, did not deny the similarity for the purpose of infringementbut relied on other defences.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> By the affirmation filed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant for and on behalf of all the three Defendants, the <i>1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</i> denied that it had manufactured the alleged Infringing Dolls and/or Packaging.  However, it was admitted that it had sold and/orsupplied to Union Top 1,824 pieces of alleged Infringing Dolls in alleged Infringing Packaging.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The <i>2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant</i> denied that it had sold and/or supplied any alleged Infringing Dolls to Union Top.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant said in his affirmation that in about early August 2003, several months after the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant sold and/or supplied the 1,824 pieces of the alleged Infringing Dolls to Union Top, he received from Union Top a purchaseorder placed with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant for the alleged Infringing Dolls.  The reason why Union Top placed an order with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant instead of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was that, according to him, it was the decision of the family that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would take over all the business of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, and therefore after March 2003 all of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs customers, including Union Top, were told that all future orders should be placed with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant instead of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> After the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant enquired with a Mr. Ong, one of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs Mainland supplies (and presumably the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs supplier as well, at latest, after March 2003) who supplied the alleged Infringing Dolls to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, as to whether there was remaining stock for that product for the alleged Infringing Dolls.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was informed by Mr. Ong that the alleged Infringing Dolls were out of stock and therefore the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant told Union Top that the purchase order could not be accepted.  According to him, there was never any actual transactionbetween Union Top and the <i>2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The <i>3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant</i> said in details about his family background leading to the incorporation of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants.  He admitted that he is and at all material times was a director of both the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants.  He, however, denied that he had any actual knowledge that the alleged Infringing Dolls were infringing items.  He saidthat he worked for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants as a sales executive.  During the discharge of his duties, he was just asked by Mr. Wong Fei, his elder brother, to receivethe latest product samples from their regular suppliers and show them to the regular customers, without any selection on his partat all.  He described his work in the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as a fairly mechanical process which did not require any judgment or discretion.  He said he never decided for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant what product to sell and what not to sell.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> I shall now deal with each of the causes of action and the defences raised thereto.</p>    <p class="heading">INFRINGEMENT OF REGISTERED TRADE MARKS</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> It is not in dispute that the Plaintiff is and was at all material times the owner of the trade marks âBRATZ and deviceâ andâBRATZâ in Hong Kong under Trade Mark Registration Nos. 200213329 and 200309866 respectively in Class 28 in respect of dollsand dolls accessories registered on 2 August 2001 and 5 February 2002 respectively (âthe Trade Marksâ).</p>    <p class="heading">Validity of the Trade Marks</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Mr. Ling submitted that the registration of the Trade Marks were invalid.  The essential submissions put forward by Mr. Ling werethat the Trade Marks contained the word âBRATZâ as their core or sole element and that the word âBRATZâ was a play on theword âBRATSâ which, in its ordinary English meaning, meant âa childâ and especially âan ill-behaved childâ.  He submittedthat the word âBRATZâ contained an obvious and direct reference to the character of the goods and the word âBRATZâ couldbe used to designate the characteristic of the Plaintiffâs dolls namely, to describe their image as ill-behaved children, an objectionunder <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 11(1)(c)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Ordinance</a> (âthe Ordinanceâ).  Finally, he submitted that the Trade Marks were devoid of any distinct character, an objection under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 11(1)(b)</a> of the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Section 80 of the Ordinance provides that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIn any proceedings for rectification of the register, the registration of a person as owner of a trade mark shall be prima facieevidence of the validity of the original registration and of any subsequent or other transmission of it.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Hence, the burden is on the Defendants to show that the Trade Marks are invalid. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Having considered the submissions put forward by Mr. Ling and Mr. Yan, I am unable to agree to Mr. Lingâs submissions that theregistration of the Trade Marks are invalid.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> In <i>âDoublemintâ case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%20RPC%2018" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] RPC 18</a></i>, Advocate General Jacobs said the followings :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â A18      In BABY-DRY, the interpretation of Art.7(1)(c) of the Regulations (which is equivalent to section 11(1)(c) of the Ordinance)was in issue in the context of a mark having features in some ways comparable to those of âDoublemintâ.  Following a refusalof registration as a Community trade mark, the Court of First Instance essentially confirmed the Board of Appealâs view that sincethe words âbabyâ and âdryâ can both be used to describe characteristics of babiesâ nappies, a mark consisting of nothingother than those words cannot by virtue of Art.7(1)(c), be registered for such goods.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">A19        In my Opinion in the ensuing appeal to the Court of Justice, I took the view, first, that a <i>Community trade mark may include descriptive terms but may not consist exclusively of them.</i>  I then considered that the brand name âBaby-Dryâ contained elements additional to the descriptive terms âbabyâ and âdryâ:extreme ellipsis, unusual structure and resistance to any intuitive grammatical analysis that would make the meaning immediatelyclear.  In addition, âBaby-Dryâ was an invented term and as such less likely to be used descriptively in trade and could moreoverallude to many very different types of product, lessening its descriptiveness in relation to babiesâ nappies.  Failure to takesuch factors into account was an error in law.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">A20       In its judgment the Court stated that the purpose of Art.7(1)(c) was to prevent registration of signs or indications which,being no different from the usual way of designating the relevant goods or services or their characteristics, could not fulfil thefunction of identifying the undertaking that markets them.  Such signs and indications were those which may serve in normal usagefrom a consumerâs point of view to designate those goods or services, directly or by reference to an essential characteristic. A mark composed of such signs or indications should not be refused if it included other signs or indications or if the purely descriptivesigns or indications were presented or configured in a manner that distinguished the resultant whole from the usual way of designatingthe goods or services concerned or their essential characteristics.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> In my view, similar to the mark âBABY-DRYâ in the âDoublemintâ case in the context of trade mark registration, âBRATZâis not devoid of any distinctive character under section 11(1)(b) of the Ordinance.  In particular, in respect of the trade markâBRATZ and deviceâ with Trade Mark Registration no.200213329, it is crystal clear that the mark does not consist <i>exclusively</i> of a descriptive element (even assuming that âBRATZâ is descriptive of the goods in respect of which the mark is registered,which I do not consider to be the case and this will be dealt with later).  The mark clearly consists of other elements such as theparticular manner in which the mark is represented and the ring device.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Further, while there is a dispute between parties as to the image of the Plaintiffâs Dolls represented â ill-behaved or rebelliousyoung girls as suggested by the Defendants as opposed to hit and cool young adolescent or teenage girls as suggested by the Plaintiff,I consider that the proper question to be considered when considering whether the registration of a mark is objectionable under section11(1)(c) of the Ordinance is whether it is <i>descriptive of the goods</i> in respect of which the mark is registered.  The question is, however, not whether the mark is <i>descriptive of that which is represented by the goods</i> in respect of which the mark is registered.  Even if I accept that the word âBRATZâ is a play of the word âBRATSâ, it mayonly be descriptive of children or girls, but clearly not of dolls or dolls accessories.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Hence, the registration of the Trade Marks cannot be invalid for the aforesaid reasons and there is no triable issue in this regard.</p>    <p class="heading">Infringement of the Trade Marks by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Both the alleged Infringing Packaging and the Plaintiffâs Packaging bear the word âBRATZâ.  Thus, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, by providing samples and selling the 1,842 alleged Infringing Dolls in alleged Infringing Packaging to Union Top, throughthe 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant as its sales executive, clearly infringed the Trade Marks under Section 27(1) of the old <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/43">Cap.43</a>.</p>    <p class="heading">Infringement of the Trade Marks by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> According to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantâs affirmation, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had no actual transaction with Union Top in respect of the alleged Infringing Dolls, although a purchase order was placedby Union Top to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in respect of the same.  He denied that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had provided any samples to Union Top.  Except this bare assertion of denial, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant did not produce any other concrete evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> As for the Plaintiffâs evidence, I have before me the affirmation of William Fan filed in HCA 3242 as an exhibit to the 2<sup>nd</sup> affirmation of Lee Shiu Cheung for the Plaintiff.  Paragraph 33 of William Fanâs affirmation reads :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â33. Rejina Chan [a solicitor of the Plaintiffâs solicitors] saw Mr. Lee in Showroom B and asked whether any sample of the photographeditems were available, Mr. Lee answered that all available samples were on display in the showrooms and that the samples requestedwere not available.  Unable to obtain samples of the dolls in the photographs, Rejina Chan went out and asked Ms. Ho for the Vendorreference of 18#y1288-1DD (which was the code printed next on the top of the photo of âBRATZâ dolls â Item 1d1987wb) whereupon<i>Ms. Ho answered that the company was called Golden City</i> but that since no order had been placed with Golden City (yet), no factory folder on Golden City had been opened.  Rejina Chan askedMs. Cheung for the corresponding particulars of Golden City and Ms. Cheung wrote down such contact reference for Rejina Chan.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Further, from the samples of the alleged Infringing Dolls and the alleged infringing Packaging produced, it can be seen at the backof two of those 4 samples put in front of me, the following is marked on a white label :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âGH125 Golden City Toysâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> At the back of the other 2 samples, the item numbers âY1288-1DDâ and âY1288-2DDâ are marked on pale yellow labels respectively.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> A product item list (âthe Listâ) was discovered in the office of Union Top and produced as one of the exhibits to the Plaintiffâsaffirmation.  In the List, the number Y1288-1DD appeared and it refereed to the maker as âGOLDEN CITYâ (the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant herein).  The corresponding Description is â12â BRATZ FASHION GIRLS, 4 ASSTâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Thus, it is plain and obvious that those 4 samples were provided and/or supplied by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to Union Top.  By doing so, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant used in the course of trade or business signs which are identical to or nearly resemble the Plaintiffâs Trade Marks.This is an act of infringement under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 18(1)</a> of the new <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559">Cap.559</a>. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Mr. Ling however submitted that the Plaintiffâs pleaded case against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was only the sale or supply of 720 Infringing Dolls packaged in Infringing Packaging under purchase order 03070069-04(A)dated 10 August 2003 and therefore the provision of samples is not part of the Plaintiffâs pleaded case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> However, in the commercial activity between two parties, the provision of samples was intended as a first step leading to the saleof goods.  This actually led to the aforesaid purchase order placed by Union Top with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  This is an incident of sale or intended to be so albeit the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant said there and then that they had run out of stock.  In any event, this is an incident of supply of the infringing dolls.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Consequently, for the aforesaid reasons, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant has no defence to the Plaintiffâs claim at all.</p>    <p class="heading">Infringement of the Trade Marks by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> The Plaintiffâs case against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant is that he directed and procured the acts of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants about which the Plaintiff complained.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> On the other hand, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant defended by saying that he was a director in name only acting according to the instructions of his brother Wong Fei andhe was a mere sales executive having no part in deciding what product to sell.  Besides, he also said that he had never heard ofâBRATZâ dolls until mid/late 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant alleged that he had only received salary from another company called Wing Fung Hing International Ltd (âWFHâ) and noneother.  He also alleged that he had never received any dividend from either the 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants.  In support to his allegation, he produced a document which he claimed to be his tax return for the year 2003.  However,as a matter of fact, the document was indeed the return filed by WFH but not his own return.  From this document, one is unable tosee any evidence to support that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant did not receive any dividends or salary from the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants, nor can one possibly see that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant is only a shareholder and director in name only acting according to the instructions of Wong Fei.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> The assertions made by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant are just bare assertions.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant simply has no concrete evidence to support his allegations.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> On the other hand, the evidence put forward by the Plaintiff is clear.  As seen from the annual return of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, the registered office of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is the residential address of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant.  If, as alleged, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was only a nominee of Wong Fei and played such a minor role in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants, there is no reason why Wong Feiâs address was not used as the registered office of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Another important observation is that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantâs name appears on all the invoices and purchase orders that passed between Union Top and the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants.  On the other hand, Wong Feiâs name did not appear on any of the papers.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> Moreover, it is simply inconceivable that 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant had only heard of âBRATZâ dolls in mid/late 2003.  The goodwill of the âBRATZâ dolls in Hong Kong had been wellestablished at the time the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant sold the 1,842 pieces of alleged Infringing Dolls to Union Top.  As a person working in the toys industry since 1995 or1996 (as said by him in his affirmation), the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant must have a lot more updated knowledge and information of toys than the average people in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> From the evidence before me, I do not think there was a fair or reasonable possibility of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant having a <i>bona fide</i> defence.  I therefore conclude that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant is liable as a joint tortfeasor with the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Having concluded that all the three Defendants had infringed the Trade Marks of the Plaintiff, I shall from now on refer to the allegedInfringing Dolls and alleged Infringing Packaging as âInfringing Dollsâ and âInfringing Packagingâ respectively.</p>    <p class="heading">PASSING OFF</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> The other cause of action against the Defendants is passing off.  Mr. Yan has helpfully summarized the law regarding the tort ofpassing off.  The three essential elements which must be established by a plaintiff are as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)   that the plaintiff enjoys reputation and goodwill in the name, mark or indicia which it wishes to prevent the defendant fromusing;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)   that the defendant has made a misrepresentation which was likely to lead members of the public to believe that his business,goods or services are the business, goods or services of the plaintiff; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)   that the plaintiff was suffering and was likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendantâsmisrepresentation.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Did the Plaintiff enjoy reputation and goodwill in the name, mark or indicia which it wished to prevent the Defendants from using?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> Mr. Ling submitted that it was only less than two months later than the launch of âBRATZâ dolls in Hong Kong that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant sold the 1,842 Infringing Dolls to Union Top and therefore there were triable issues as to :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)   whether âBRATZâ had by then become sufficiently well-known amongst members of the purchasing public; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)   whether the mark was sufficiently distinctive despite its descriptive content so as to distinguish the Plaintiffâs goods fromother similar goods in the minds of the purchasing public.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> In respect of (1), I do not consider that there exists such triable issue for the following reasons. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> In the first place, the âBRATZâ dolls were promoted and sold not only in Hong Kong but worldwide.  They have won numerous awardsin the toys industry.  They also have their own website which is accessible worldwide.  Their reputation and goodwill in Hong Kongcould not have just started to be built up after they first sold in Hong Kong.  This is supported by the newspaper article of SingTao Daily which was issued on 13<sup>th</sup> December 2002, a date before the âBRATZâ dolls were first sold in Hong Kong.  The article mentioned that the âBRATZâ dollswere the best selling dolls in the United States of America.  Photographs and description of the âBRATZâ dolls were given inthe article.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Secondly, even if assuming the goodwill and reputation of âBRATZâ dolls only started to be built up after its launch in HongKong (which I do not consider to be the case), I still find that they had built up sufficient goodwill and reputation by the timethe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant sold and/or supplied the Infringing Dolls to Union Top.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> In this regard, it should be noted that it is established law that it is possible for goodwill in a new kind of business to be builtup in a short period of time.  In <i>Stannard v. Reay  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%20RPC%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] RPC 589</a></i> at 592, Buckley J. said that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âAs regards the goodwill which the plaintiffs did or did not have at the time when the defendants started their fish and chip businessin November 1966, Mr. Monckton says with great force that the plaintiffs then had only been trading for some three weeks, or perhapsrather more if one does not take the defendantâs business as effectively under way until rather later than 5<sup>th</sup> November 1966, and that that would be a very short time in which to acquire a goodwill of any value connected with a trade name. It would seem from the evidence that probably the plaintiffs were the only people in the Isle of Wight carrying on this sort oftrade in this sort of way at the time when they began their business in October 1966.  There is no suggestion that there were anyother mobile fish and chip vans then operating in the Isle of Wight, and, although a period of three, four or five weeks may be ashort time in which to build up a goodwill associated with a particular trade name, it does not seem to me to be by any means impossibleto suppose that amongst those members of the public who enjoy fish and chips and who find it convenient to be able to buy them readycooked and supplied at convenient places where they can go and collect them a new business of this kind might not attract to itselfconsiderable notice and trade within quite a short time, and I think that there is to some extent supported by the evidence of thefirst plaintiff to the effect that in the first complete week of trading after the plaintiffâs had put their fish and chip vanto the road, that is to say, the week ending 26<sup>th</sup> November 1966, the takings of the fish and chip van amounted to ï¿¡129 7s 6d., and in the next week to ï¿¡138 16. 10d., and in thethird week to ï¿¡133 12s. 3Â½d., amounts which seem to me to be substantial sums to be taken by one van in a business of this kind.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> The newspaper articles showed that the Plaintiffâs âBRATZâ dolls earned substantial reputation and goodwill by January 2003. The 19<sup>th</sup> January 2003 issue of South China Morning Post reported that the âBRATZâ dolls were the worldâs top selling toys and had outsoldBARBIE dolls.  It further reported that they had been a big hit in Hong Kong since their launch in December 2002.  Although therewas no evidence before me as to the sales volume of the âBRATZâ dolls in December 2002 and January 2003 (which I was told ishighly confidential information of the Plaintiff), I am satisfied that the Plaintiff enjoyed reputation and goodwill in âBRATZâdolls which it wished to prevent the Defendants from using.  There is no triable issue in this aspect.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> In respect of (2) I have concluded in this judgment earlier that the Trade Marks are distinctive and not descriptive.  I thereforeconclude that there is again no triable issue in this regard.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Had the Defendants made a misrepresentation which was likely to lead members of the public to believe that his business, goods orservices are the business, goods or services of the Plaintiff?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> In <i>Chelsea Man Menswear Ltd. v.

Here we have two identical marks which aregoing to be used in connection with identical businesses and on identical goods.  I would say without the need for any evidence atall that it seems to me to be apparent that if reputation is established confusion and deception must result.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> I have concluded that the reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiffâs Dolls have been established and that the Infringing Dollsand Packaging closely resemble the Plaintiffâs Dolls and Packaging, and the fact that the marks are identical and used in respectof identical goods (i.e. dolls), it is clear that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had made misrepresentation misleading the members of the public.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Since the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants infringed the Trade Marks, this, together with my previous analysis of misrepresentation, leads me to the conclusion thatthere was such kind of misrepresentation made by the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Was the Plaintiff suffering and was likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the Defendantsâ misrepresentation?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> The âBRATZâ dolls are known worldwide, it goes without saying that the Plaintiff will clearly suffer damage by reason of theDefendantâs aforesaid misrepresentation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> There is no triable issue in whatever aspect in respect of passing off.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> For the aforesaid reasons, in my view, there is no triable issue in respect of the Plaintiffâs claim for infringement of the TradeMarks and passing off against all three Defendants.
