The purchase proceeded to completion uneventfully. It is the plaintiff's case that since then ithas tried twice to sell it without success. On each occasion agreements were entered into but the purchasers discovered a defectin the title document and requisitioned for rectification. The plaintiff was unable to rectify resulting in the cancellation of bothsales. It is the plaintiff's complaint that when it purchased the shop the defendant did not alert it to the defect or raise thesame requisition with which it, as subsequent vendor, was obliged to deal, or otherwise make proper enquiry, resulting in consequentialloss.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> By this action the plaintiff is suing the defendant for negligence in contract and tort to recover that loss. The defendant deniesliability and quantum and otherwise puts the plaintiff to proof.</p>    <p class="heading">History</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Mr Chan Chi Hin (Chan) for a number of years prior to the period in question had engaged in the buying and selling of real estate,of which the shop in Tsuen Wan was a typical example, for profit. The plaintiff was one of a number of companies of which he wasa shareholder and director incorporated by him for the express purpose. Much - perhaps most - of his conveyancing he entrusted toa conveyancing clerk called Mr David So Hon Shing (So). So began working in this field in 1972. In 1994 he became employed by thedefendant. By the end of that year he had 22 years' experience. Although not legally qualified he was well-versed in the proceduresinvolved in a transaction and unless something untoward happened was able to deal with a purchase and sale with minimal supervision.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The property market in Hong Kong is to say the least volatile. In 1994 there had been something of a slump in values and activity.1995 saw a period of gradual recovery. In 1996 that accelerated and there was a marked increase in values and transactions whichpersisted through the first three quarters of 1997. Then, sparked by the South-East Asian economic crisis, there was a spectaculardownturn in the final quarter of 1997. By 1998 many properties were worth only half their value of a year earlier. Hong Kong is graduallyrecovering from that but prices are still well below their peak of 1997.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> During the period 1995 to 1997 the defendant comprised three partners. They were the founder, Mr Daniel Wong Kwok Tung (Daniel Wong),Mr Dennis Wong Wang How (Dennis Wong) and Mr Gordon Lee (Gordon Lee). The firm almost exclusively was engaged in conveyancing. Itwas so structured that each partner was responsible for those transactions that came to the firm from existing clients of that partner.Any new client without previous allegiance came to the founder Daniel Wong. Each partner was in charge of his own team of conveyancingclerks and support staff. In theory each transaction was overseen by the so-called team leader and the conveyancing clerk handlingthe same was required to have each conveyancing step vetted and approved before it was actioned. This included the examination oftitle documents, the drafting of new documents, the approval of letters of requisition and other correspondence. In practice thesupervision process was less structured. The partners were sometimes busy or otherwise unavailable in which case the clerk wouldbe directed to or of his own volition take the file to another partner or other qualified staff member.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> When So joined the defendant in 1994 he was put on Daniel Wong's team. Given his experience and seniority and level of activity hehad an assistant, called Mr Joseph Lee Siu Hung (Joe Lee).</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Daniel Wong was the busiest of the three partners. At some stage there were up to ten clerks in his team, while Dennis Wong had threeand Gordon Lee two. Not only as founder member did he have most clients but he also held public office which occupied much of histime during a typical working day. And as work piled up he was to get even busier.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Against this background on 5 November 1994 the plaintiff through Chan entered into a provisional agreement to purchase the shop thesubject of these proceedings, whose short address is Shop 2, No. 6, Shiu Wo Street, Tsuen Wan, from the owner as vendor called EmpireRich Development Limited (Empire Rich). As in the past Chan engaged the services of So; thus the provisional agreement came to himas employee of the defendant. In the usual way that was superseded by a formal agreement prepared by the solicitors for Empire Richcalled Boris Lui &amp; Co (Boris Lui) and the final draft was approved by the defendant before the parties signed.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The agreement was dated 5 December 1994. The price was $9.5m and the due date for completion 4 April 1995. In compliance with itsterms and usual conveyancing practice Boris Lui by letter of 6 December 1994 sent what they described as all the relevant title deedsand documents to the defendant for perusal against the usual undertaking to hold the same returnable on demand.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> By letter of 9 December 1994 over the signature of Daniel Wong the defendant raised a number of requisitions. This letter was toplay an important part in these proceedings as I shall come to. The requisitions were answered satisfactorily or otherwise resolved.The sale came to be completed without incident on completion date.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The next development of consequence was the plaintiff's decision to sell the shop. By provisional agreement dated 20 August 1996it agreed to sell it to a Mr Ng King Ming (Ng) for $11.4 m. Chan instructed the defendant to deal with the conveyancing. So openeda file. In the fullness of time the parties agreed the terms of the formal agreement and the same was signed and dated 3 September1996. The due date for completion was 31 October 1996. Ng paid deposits totalling $1.14m. On 11 September the defendant sent to Ng'sSolicitors, Messrs Siao Wen Leung (Siao Wen) the title documents for perusal. By letter of 18 September Siao Wen raised a numberof requisitions, only one of which is relevant. I repeat it verbatim:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"4. The assignment memorial No. 514441 is being held voidable pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/10/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 55</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/10" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Ordinance</a>. Please comment."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The defendant did not immediately respond to this requisition and when they did it was not back to Siao Wen. By letter of 11 Octoberthey referred the requisition to S Y Chu &amp; Co. Solicitors (S Y Chu) which firm had prepared the assignment in question.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> I come now to the history of assignment 514441.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> In 1987 the then registered owner of the shop was one Mr Kwok Hung. In July of that year he died intestate, survived by a wife andfour children. One of these, called Mr Kwok Chun Wai (C W Kwok) applied for and was granted Letters of Administration on 26 February1988. He was to deal with the shop shortly afterwards. In his capacity as personal representative of the estate he entered into anagreement for the sale of the shop to Empire Rich, the company that was to become the plaintiff's vendor. But this was not an arm'slength transaction. C W Kwok was also at the material time one of two directors and a 50% shareholder of Empire Rich. In fact hesigned the agreement and the subsequent assignment which was to become designated assignment 514441 as both vendor and for and onbehalf of the purchaser.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Section 55 of the Probate and Administration Ordinance (PAO) states:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"55.

Further,if you are doubtful as to whether <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 20</a> would apply to a case of fraudulent breach of trust, your worry can be relieved by the opinion of Mr. Justice Findlay in <em>Yeung Kit Lam and Wong Fun V Lau Yiu Shing</em> (M.P. No.3392 of 1994)[at Page 5 of Judgement enclosed] where the Judge said <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 20</a> could still apply and an action by the beneficiary (if any) under the Trust would be time-barred after 6 years against an innocentparty acquiring the property.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">(b) There is no evidence suggesting that there might be any other person who still has a <em>subsisting claim</em> against the estate.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">(c) In any event, we take the view that if anyone were to make claim they must be the beneficiaries (if any) under the intestacy.However, it is trite law that where the estate's <em>assets</em> are still <em>unadministered</em>, a beneficiary has no legal or equitable <em>proprietory interest</em> in the unadministered property. The authority is <em>Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Queensland) v. Livingston  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%20AC%20694" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965)</em> A.C. 694</a> (copy enclosed). This means the beneficiaries have no interest in land as such, but only interest in the proceeds of sale of theestate. As such they can no longer claim against the property once it has been assigned to a bona fide purchaser for valuable consideration,i.e. our client. This further means that such beneficiaries are no longer" person <em>interested in the property</em> sold", and Section 55 simply would not be available to them now.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">(d) Finally, the property was at the time of the said Assignment held by the Administrator upon a statutory <em>trust for sale:Section 62</em> of Probate &amp; Administration Ordinance.

But nothing was forthcoming by the deadline.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Mr Lam's advice of 1 November was that the sale was an indirect one to C W Kwok, and caught by Section 55 PAO. In his view the titlecould be defeated by a claim by a beneficiary of the late Mr Kwok's estate and thus the plaintiff had not shown good title.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The parties elected to cancel and executed a cancellation agreement. Ng received back his deposits. The circumstances surroundingChan's election to cancel are disputed as I shall come to.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> The next development was Chan's decision to rent the shop. Although on a single title the shop was in fact subdivided into two portions.Shop A was let first, for four years from 5 February 1997. So was engaged by the plaintiff to undertake the conveyancing and he didso, apparently under the supervision of Daniel Wong.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> But after that the plaintiff's and Chan's relationships with the defendant came to an end. The plaintiff instructed another firmcalled Tang Wong &amp; Cheung (Tang Wong) to write to the defendant alleging negligence in the performance of their duties when theplaintiff purchased the shop, threatening a suit if the plaintiff's consequent loss could not be settled. That letter was sent on25 March 1998. The defendant responded by letter of 1 June 1998 emphatically denying negligence, and gave the reason for the cancellationwhich I repeat verbatim:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"When your client subsequently sold the property in 1996, the sale was cancelled due to your client's own choice and preference. Thesaid sale did not fall through by reason of any alleged failure to prove good title. Quite on the contrary, we have been given tounderstand that the sale was cancelled at your client's decision in view of a sharp increase of the price of the property at thematerial time. As such, we do strongly dispute and deny your allegation that your client has suffered any loss or damage, or thatwe ought to be liable in any way, whether as alleged or otherwise."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Daniel Wong signed this letter.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The allegation was immediately denied by Chan and Tang Wong responded to that effect. There was more correspondence but no resolution.Tang Wong issued the writ on 16 September 1998.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> But in the meantime Daniel Wong had made contact with C W Kwok, and Kwok told him that at the time of the sale to Empire Rich thefamily had all approved the same. He then produced a copy of an agreement handwritten in Chinese characters, dated 18 May 1988, purportedlysigned by all five beneficiaries, with one, the widow, C W Kwok's mother, having signed by a mark. Daniel Wong prepared a declarationfor C W Kwok to sign and he did so. The copy agreement was attached to it, and the defendant then registered the declaration on 2June 1998. When it was returned by the Land Registry he forwarded the same to Tang Wong, "without prejudice and without any admission".</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Next the plaintiff rented the second portion of the shop, shop B, for 34 months from 5 July 1998.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> With the defect in title apparently made good, the plaintiff then put the shop back on the market, found a buyer and entered intoa provisional agreement dated 5 November 1998 for completion on 19 July 1999. The price was $7.95m.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> But this transaction was to go off also.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> During the normal requisition process Tang Wong called for the original or in the alternative a certified true copy of the Chineseagreement. This was retrieved from S Y Chu. But it proved to be a different document from the copy exhibited to C W Kwok's declaration.In particular a crucial sentence was missing, translated to read "And agreed to sell the property to Empire Rich Development Limited",suggesting it may have been added subsequently. This discrepancy could not be satisfactorily answered so that agreement was cancelledalso.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The last chapter in the history was written within the month preceding the date of trial. Daniel Wong prepared a document headed'Confirmatory Assignment' to be executed by the Kwok family beneficiaries to rectify the assignment to Empire Rich, and then tookit upon himself personally to trace the Kwok family members and have it signed. In fact he did manage to find all but the widow whohad died. This document has now been signed and if not yet registered can be, and by all accounts now rectifies the title.</p>    <p class="heading">Dispute of Fact</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Crucial to the outcome of this case is how I resolve the dispute as to the circumstances leading to Chan agreeing on behalf of theplaintiff to a cancellation of the Ng sale. To deal with this I recount the evidence of the parties where the conflict seems to arise.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> I return to 25 October 1996.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Completion was due six days hence and Siao Wen on that date had written insisting that there was a defect in title. So was on leave.According to Joe Lee's account Chan asked him to arrange a meeting with a solicitor to discuss the problem and he arranged that withDennis Wong. At the meeting Wong told him that in his view there was no defect and if Ng refused to complete he could forfeit thedeposits. On the other hand that might result in litigation with inherent risks. Chan said he would think about it. The meeting thenended. Dennis Wong in evidence confirmed that there was a meeting, and that was what was said and how it was left.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Next came a telephone call of 31 October from Siao Wen which Joe Lee received, proposing a nine day extension of the completion dateand that the parties share the cost of counsel's opinion on the disputed point. He referred the suggestion to Chan who told him toaccept. That was passed on to Siao Wen which gave rise to their letter of 31 October confirming the arrangement.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> By the time the opinion reached the defendant's office on 6 November to the effect that the title was defective So had returned fromleave and the file was back with him. His evidence is that he telephoned Chan and explained its contents and they met in his office.I revert to his witness statement as to what he said took place:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"I then telephoned Chan and briefly informed him of the Purchaser's Counsel advice. Chan told me that he would like to discuss thematter with me in my office. At the meeting, I told Chan that it was the advice of the Purchaser's counsel that evidence would berequired to show that all beneficiaries had approved the sale. I explained to Chan that the counsel advice was not conclusive andtherefore should not be taken as authority that good title had not been shown. In order to satisfy the query of the Purchaser, Iwould nevertheless contact SY Chu and KCW for the requested document and in any event there should be no difficulties in obtainingthe confirmation of the beneficiaries of the estate that they approved the Empire Rich Assignment. <em>Notwithstanding such advice, Chan informed me that the Plaintiff was not eager to complete the sale of the Property because therehad been a sharp rise in the property market and thus a substantial increase in the market price of the Property in the region ofHK$2-3 million.</em> I advised Chan that if the Plaintiff preferred not to complete the sale of the Property, then the Plaintiff could ask the Purchaserto cancel the Formal Agreement. Chan eventually decided for the Plaintiff not to complete the sale of the Property and instructedme to proceed to procure the cancellation of the Formal Agreement."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The underlining is mine.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Chan has a different version of events.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> I repeat verbatim that part of his witness statement which deals with the period:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"9. About one week before the completion date, I attended So's office and enquired him of the progress. So told me that Ng's Solicitorshad decided to seek a Counsel's opinion on whether the title was good and whether Ng could accept the title and proceed with thetransaction but they wanted the Plaintiff to bear half of the fee. So further told me that the fee was around HK$D10,000.00. As Iwas eager to conclude the matter and wished that the transaction could be completed without more ado, I agreed to pay HK$5,000.00being half of the Counsel's fee.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">10. Shortly before the completion date on the 9th November 1996 (the exact date cannot be recalled), So asked me to attend his officein the morning. Upon my arrival, So led me to see a Mr. Wong Wang How ("Wong") who was the solicitor in charge of the transaction.During the meeting at Mr. Wong's room, I asked Wong whether the transaction could be proceeded as scheduled. Wong replied that accordingto the Counsel's advice, there was some problems with the title and the Purchaser would not complete. I then asked Wong whether thePlaintiff could forfeit the deposit if the Purchaser refused to complete but Wong advised me that I could not forfeit the depositbecause the title was defective. Wong further proposed that a cancellation agreement should be made and the deposit be returned toNg.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">11. Although I felt frustrated, I followed the advice of Wong and entered into a cancellation agreement on or about 14th November1996. I followed his advice because he was a solicitor and I had trust and confidence in him then.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">12. After the cancellation of the sale of the Property to Ng, I repeatedly asked So to remedy the defect for the obvious reason thatif the defect was not remedied, the Plaintiff would be unable to sell the Property. Furthermore with a view to mitigate its loss,I then looked for a tenant and subsequently instructed the Defendant to prepare a tenancy agreement."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> In the witness box he consistently denied that he had said the plaintiff was not eager to complete the sale because of the sharprise in the property market. He said that this would have made no sense, because with the title apparently defective there wouldbe no market for the shop at least not at market value. He said that shortly before the rescheduled completion date So took him tosee Dennis Wong, who explained that the purchaser Ng was refusing to complete. Wong told him he could not forfeit the deposits becausethe title was defective. Wong proposed that the transaction be cancelled. He agreed because that was the only feasible option. Inthe months thereafter he persistently contacted So to get the title sorted. He wanted to sell but realised there would be no marketunless this was done first. He resorted to letting the two parts of the shop when it seemed that this could not readily or quicklybe dealt with.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Dennis Wong denied involvement in the file following So's return from leave; in particular he denied there was the meeting Chan referredto. But So confirmed that from November 1996 Chan did chase him along.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Though clearly there is a conflict as to who met whom in the run up to the completion date I do not propose to resolve that beyondthe crucial aspect of whether Chan really did opt for cancellation with profit as the sole or primary motive. On this issue whenhe was under cross-examination So was much less forthright then in his witness statement. He admitted that after 10 years of lookingafter Chan's conveyancing it thereafter dried up. He said that was not surprising - "Mr Chan was more or less upset..........I knewMr Chan well. In his eyes I had done something wrong..........I was the one who caused him trouble. So of course I would feel sorry."</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> And there was a telling exchange which I repeat verbatim:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Q. The sole reason for cancelling the sale and purchase agreement with Ng was because the title requisition could not be solved,why the Plaintiff had no choice but to accept a cancellation.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">A. I agree.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">Q. I suggest he made that decision not because he said to you he was not eager to sell because the shop had risen $2-3m.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">A. For a small part.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">Q. What do you mean by that?</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">A. He also put the question of price into consideration to decide whether he would sell it.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">Q. He never told you that. It was only your guess work.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">A. During our discussion that was the impression he gave me.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">Q. He never said he didn't want to sell because of price rise.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">A. I agree."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> I come now to Chan's evidence under cross-examination.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> When counsel was dealing with the proposition that he was motivated by a rise in the market to cancel he said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"A. The title was not a good one. The purchaser was attacking the title. How could we sell it? If we were to try to sell again thesame thing would happen. We were still not able to sell in 1998. Only asking $7.95m. Still people attacked our title. Daniel Wong&amp; Partners produced a letter of consent in Chinese. But then people found another that was different. To me this law firm isvery dishonest. In order to defend this case they framed me, by saying I refused to sell it. Moreover when the transaction did notwork out I kept pressing them to rectify. But they were unable to do it for me."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Only Chan and So gave evidence on this topic. Chan was forthright that he was not motivated to cancel to take advantage of a potentialrise in profit. So appeared to concede that. There is no dispute that after cancellation Chan chased So to get the problem fixed.Common sense dictates that any perceived gain in value was dependent on the title being clear.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> I am satisfied that Chan cancelled because, on advice or not, he was satisfied that he could not hold Ng to the bargain. He did notopt to insist on completion because his title was bad. There was, quite simply, no other choice.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> I come now to the issues.</p>    <p class="heading">The Issues</p>    <p align="justify">(1) Did the defendant owe a duty of care in contract and tort to the plaintiff in the conveyancing when the shop was purchased, andthereafter?</p>    <p align="justify">(2) Was the defendant negligent in the performance of those duties?</p>    <p align="justify">(3) If so, is it liable in damages for loss suffered by the plaintiff?</p>    <p align="justify">(4) If so, to what extent?</p>    <p class="heading">Solicitor's Duty of Care</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> There is an implied term in any contract of service between a solicitor and his client that the solicitor should carry out the serviceswith reasonable care and skill, a duty he owes his client in tort as well.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> In the case of <strong>Foshan Hua Da Industrial Co. v.

Where an action is brought by the client against his solicitor for negligence, the clientmust prove that there was such a want of skill or care on the part of the solicitor as to amount to a breach of contract....A solicitoris not guilty of negligence if he has merely acted upon his client's instructions in the reasonable belief that they were correct,or if he has fully explained the position {422} to his client and is nevertheless instructed to proceed; or merely because he hascommitted an error in judgment, whether on matters of discretion or of law such as, for instance, on points of new occurrence orof doubtful construction."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">One of the cases cited in Halsbury is Stevenson v Rowand(1830) 2 Dow and Clark 104;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=6%20ER%20668" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">6 ER 668</a>, an appeal to the House of Lords from the Court of Session. In that case, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Lyndhurst said, p 119; 674:</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"But then it was argued that the point of law was a new and delicate one, and that some of the Judges below were at first of opinionthat as the precept of saisine made no reference to any manner of holding, the inferment might be construed as base, and that theCourt arrived at a contrary conclusion after long discussion; and that it was hard on Mr Stevenson that he should be held responsiblefor a mistake upon a nice and delicate point of law. But the distinction is this: A solicitor is not liable for mistake in a niceand difficult point of law, for to such mistakes all lawyers must be liable; and if the question had been merely one of that description,I would say that Mr Stevenson was not responsible."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> The law is clear. The defendant did owe a duty of care to the plaintiff whilst it carried out the plaintiff's conveyancing, withinthe standards dictated by the authorities and statute.</p>    <p class="heading">Was the Defendant Negligent?</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> I return again to November 1994 by which time the defendant had contracted to act for the plaintiff in the purchase of the shop.Assuming due compliance with the defendant's normal practice So carried out a preliminary search of the vendor's documents of title,before handing them to his supervising solicitor for a further check. The requisition letter was sent on 9 December 1994. I makethis assumption because not surprisingly neither So nor Daniel Wong have any specific memory of this file, given the volume of conveyancingtransactions passing through the office. But apart from So being in Daniel Wong's team the requisition letter in question was signedby Daniel Wong, which is a further pointer.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> I have earlier mentioned this letter was a crucial one. It is Daniel Wong's evidence that he did not include in the list of requisitionsreference to assignment 514441 (C W Kwok to Empire Rich) because it is his opinion now and would have been then that the transactionwas not caught by Section 55 PAO. No requisition was made because none was necessary.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> It has been argued on the defendant's behalf that this was a correct interpretation of Section 55 PAO, by virtue of the purchaserbeing a separate legal entity from the vendor. And the defendant could not be guilty of negligence if Daniel Wong was correctly applyingthe law. But even if Daniel Wong was wrong it was an error of judgment that a competent and careful solicitor could have made, fallingwell short of amounting to a breach of a duty to exhibit reasonable care and skill.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> That is all well and good, but I do not accept Daniel Wong made this judgment call. The form in which assignment 514441 was presentedcried out for an explanation. Although Section 55 PAO is not clearly drafted, a conveyancer of the experience of Daniel Wong wouldbe well aware of the obligations the appointed administrator of an estate owes to the beneficiaries and the restrictions imposedon him while in office.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> I quote from <em>Williams Mortimer &amp; Sunnuks on Executors Administrators and Probate,</em> 17th edition at p. 703:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"A representative is further bound to do everything in his power for the benefit of the estate, and is, therefore, absolutely precludedfrom buying the assets from himself or from his co-representatives, irrespective of undervalue or otherwise, for if he were allowedto buy he might thereby be induced to neglect his duty. This rule is for the protection of the executor. It stems from the rule thatno one who has a duty to perform shall place himself in a situation to have his interests conflicting with that duty."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">In <strong>Re Boles</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1902%5d%201%20Ch%20244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1902] 1 Ch 244</a>, Buckley J said at p.244:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The principle that lies at the root of this matter is that a trustee for sale owes a duty to his cestuis que trust to do everythingin his power for their benefit, and is therefore absolutely precluded from buying the trust property, irrespective of questions ofundervalue or otherwise, because he may be thus induced to neglect his duty. Beyond that, if he retires with a view to becoming apurchaser so as to put himself in a position to do what would otherwise be a breach of trust, that will not do."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> The solicitor of experience would surely have raised a requisition, as solicitors for subsequent purchasers were to do.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> Daniel Wong did not.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> In the circumstances I am satisfied that Daniel Wong took no steps because neither So before him nor he spotted the potential defect.The letter of requisition was silent on assignment 514441 because the clerk and solicitor in the defendant responsible failed toinspect it and find that the person who signed as the vendor administrator and for and on behalf of the purchaser was one and thesame. If any further pointers to this inevitable conclusion are necessary they include So's recognition he was blameworthy for theplaintiff's loss, and Daniel Wong's going to the expense and trouble of preparing and arranging execution of C W Kwok's declarationthat exhibited the Chinese agreement and then the confirmatory assignment, so recently concluded.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> What should have happened?</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> A solicitor possessing adequate skills and knowledge and the requisite experience would have in the conveyancing transaction of November1994 noticed the irregularities revealed by assignment 514441 and related documents and raised a requisition. Whether or not thetransaction would have proceeded would have depended upon the vendor's response. In the event that it might have chosen to rejectthe requisition there would in that case have been the need for careful analysis of the law, followed by advice to the client, whoseinstructions would then be called for in informed circumstances.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> But of course none of this did happen.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> Applying the tests I find that the plaintiff has satisfied the necessary burden of establishing that the defendant's Daniel Wongfailed to exercise that reasonable degree of skill and care to be expected of a competent and reasonably experienced solicitor inacting for a client in the purchase of a shop and it was thereby guilty of negligence.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> Before departing from the issue of liability I mention that the plaintiff has pleaded and it has been argued that the defendant wasin further breach of its duty of care to the plaintiff because of its conduct in the aborted sales of August 1996 and November 1998.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> With respect these are red herrings. The want of duty of care was in December 1994. The plaintiff's failure to pass good title inthe subsequent transactions which caused the cancellation stemmed from that breach. The events that subsequently transpired go tothe liability in damages I now come to.</p>    <p class="heading">Is the Defendant Liable to the Plaintiff in Damages?</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> I have found and stated earlier that the cancellation of the August 1996 sale to Ng was caused not by Chan's decision to hold outfor a higher price, but because of the defect in the plaintiff's title gave it no option. The plaintiff's claim arises from the lossof profit that it would have won had the sale gone through. But is the defendant liable for this?</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> I have already found that the defendant was in breach of its duty of care when acting for the plaintiff in the purchase of the shop.Had it been otherwise the defect in title would have been discovered and a requisition letter been sent. Whether or not the vendorwould have been able to make good the defect in time is a matter of speculation; given the difficulties subsequently encounteredin tracing the Kwok family members it may well not have been. Chan in evidence said that he would not have completed at any pricein such circumstances. So what would he have done? Would he have recovered the plaintiff's deposit and done nothing or have purchasedan alternative shop of like value but with a good title? And would he have put it on the market in August 1996? All this is unknown.But I pay heed to Chan's field of endeavour and that of the plaintiff. He is an investor in real estate and the plaintiff was oneof a number of companies incorporated by him for the purpose. This was what he did. And So said he undertook numerous conveyancingtransactions on his behalf.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> The burden is on the plaintiff to prove its loss. I quote from McGregor on Damages sixteenth edition at p.236:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">"1. THE PROBLEM OF CERTAINTY</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">A PLAINTIFF claiming damages must prove his case. To justify an award of substantial damages he must satisfy the court both as tothe fact of damage and as to its amount. If he satisfies the court on neither, his action will fail, or at the most he will be awardednominal damages where a right has been infringed. If the fact of damage is shown but no evidence is given as to its amount so thatit is virtually impossible to assess damages, this will generally permit only an award of nominal damages; this situation is illustratedby <em>Dixon v. Deveridge</em> and <em>Twyman v. Knowles</em>.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">On the other hand, where it is clear that some substantial loss has been incurred, the fact that an assessment is difficult becauseof the nature of the damage is no reason for awarding no damages or merely nominal damages. As Vaughan Williams L.J. put it in <em>Chaplin v. Hicks</em>, the leading case on the issue of certainty: "The fact that damages cannot be assessed with certainty does not relieve the wrongdoerof the necessity of paying damages." Indeed if absolute certainty were required as to the precise amount of loss that the plaintiffhad suffered, no damages would be recovered at all in the great number of cases."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> In the circumstances of this case and as a matter of fact I am satisfied that the plaintiff if forced to withdraw from the sale ofthe shop would have entered into a similar transaction with similar expectations of profit at the same time. According I find thedefendant liable for the consequential loss suffered by the plaintiff when the August 1996 sale went off which is the profit it wouldhave gained after the sale or a similar profit won on a like investment.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> So, what would that amount to?</p>    <p class="heading" align="justify">The Assessment of Damages</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> The overriding rule in assessing damages is to ascertain the sum that would place the injured party in the same position as he wouldhave been if he had not sustained the wrong. Accordingly, no basis for assessing damages for negligent advice would be applied automaticallyso as to defeat that rule and, in applying that rule, it is necessary to select a date that would reflect accurately the loss sustainedwhich was usually but not necessarily the date of the breach of duty.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> In <strong>County Personnel Ltd. v. Alan R. Pulver &amp; Co.</strong> [1987]1 WLR 916 Bingham L.J. said at p.925:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The principles to be applied in assessing damages in this case are, in my judgment, these:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">(1) The overriding rule was stated by Lord Blackburn in <em>Livingstone v. Rawyards Coal Co.</em> (1880)5 App.Cas. 25, 39, and has been repeated on countless occasions since: the measure of damages is</p>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">"that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured, or who has suffered, in the same position as he would have beenin if he had not sustained the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="justify">(4) While the general rule undoubtedly is that damages for tort or breach of contract are assessed as at the date of the breach (see,for example, <em>Miliangos v. George Frank (Textiles) Ltd.</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20AC%20443" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] A.C. 443</a>, 468, per Lord Wilberforce), this rule also should not be mechanistically applied in circumstances where assessment at another datemay more accurately reflect the overriding compensatory rule. <em>The Dodd Properties</em> case[1980]1 W.L.R. 433, both affirms this principle and illustrates its application."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> In <strong>McElroy Milne v. Commercial Electronics Ltd.</strong> [1993]1 NZLR 39 it was held that the negligent solicitor of the plaintiff vendor has to take the state of the market at the datewhen in fact it became possible for the plaintiff to offer the property for sale free from dispute. In this case where the respondentproperty developer (CEL) lost the opportunity to enjoy the benefit of a buoyant market which had collapsed by the time it was clearto sell because of negligence by its solicitors the appellant, Cooke P. said at p.44:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The remaining exercise is quantification. This is not necessarily restricted by foresight or contemplation. In principle it is primafacie an eggshell skull type of case, in that the contract breaker has to take the state of the market at the date when in fact itbecame possible for CEL to offer the property for sale free from dispute. That was not before May 1989, by which stage the markethad fallen still further from its declining level in 1988. Possibly there may be some cases where a depressed market could not besaid to be sufficiently clearly and strongly or naturally related to the breach of duty to warrant imposing liability. But in thiscase it is not enough in my opinion to say that the market fell to an extent never expected by the appellant. Part of the very purposeof a guarantee is to protect against market deterioration. The more serious the deterioration, the more important the guarantee.Like others disadvantaged by the crash the appellant has to accept the consequences of failure to carry out its responsibilities.All factors relevant in considering remoteness appear to me to point to its liability."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> In this case Daniel Wong rectified the title defect, but not until just before the trial date.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> In all the circumstances of this case I propose to establish the plaintiff's loss that it may recover by taking the contract pricein the Ng sale, less costs of sale, plus conveyancing costs thrown away, less net rentals earned meantime, less the present valueof the shop, plus interest.</p>    <p class="heading">The Measure of Damages</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a> First it is necessary to establish the current worth of the shop.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> In this respect I have had the benefit of their reports and live evidence from the two valuers employed by the parties for the purpose;Mr Raymond Hui for the plaintiff and Mr Ian Cullen for the defendant. Both are registered professional surveyors with the qualificationsand expertise to undertake such reports and give evidence.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> Mr Hui was put at something of a disadvantage because he was only briefed on 16 October 2000, the first day of trial. The plaintiff'sadvisers were in all respects prepared and ready for trial on time save that, curiously, no steps had been taken to value the shop.There was an early application for a spilt trial but the defendant opposed that course, and I declined the request. With no disrespector criticism attaching to Mr Hui, for he had an onerous task which he completed in just three days, I prefer the methodology, calculationsand comparables in Mr Cullen's report. He valued the shop at $7.5m. I discount that by a modest amount to recognize a discount inrent agreed after he had prepared his figures. I assess its current worth at $7.45m.</p>    <p align="justify">The measure of damages is as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <div align="left">            <table border="0" width="90%">                <tr>                    <td width="50%" valign="top">Sale price to Ng</td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">11,400,000</td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="50%" valign="top">less real estate commission</td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">114,000</td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">11,286,000</td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="50%" valign="top">Conveyancing costs thrown away</td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"><u>43,830</u></td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">11,329,830</td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="50%" valign="top">Deduct - present worth of shop</td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">7,450,000</td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="50%" valign="top">Net rents received</td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"><u>2,578,450</u></td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"><u>10,028,450</u></td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>                    <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"><u>1,301,380</u></td>                </tr>            </table>        </div>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">together with interest at prime rate plus 2% from 31 October 1996 to date of judgment.</p>    <p class="heading">The Orders</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> There shall be judgment in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $1,301,380 together with interest thereon at prime plus 2% from31 October 1996 to this date and thereafter at judgment rate until payment.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> Liberty to apply.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> Costs shall be to the plaintiff taxed if not agreed.
