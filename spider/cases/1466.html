He says that the statement of claim (a) discloses no reasonablecause of action, or (b) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious, or (c) it may prejudice, embarrass or delay a fair trial of theaction, or (d) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.  He also relies on the inherent jurisdiction of the court.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The ground for the striking-out is <i>res judicata</i>.  Elliot says that this is the third time that he is being sued by the 1st plaintiff (âHealthy Livingâ) and those associatedwith it, including the 2nd plaintiff (âChanâ).  The subject matter of this action is a property at Lot No. 215 in DemarcationDistrict 219, 56, Hing Keng Shek, Sai Kung, the New Territories.  Healthy Living used to be the registered owner of the property. Chan was and is its director.  The property had been assigned to Elliot on 2 August 2006 pursuant to an order of Deputy Judge Gillmade on 19 July 2006 in HCA3202/2003 (âthe first actionâ).</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Healthy Living in this action seeks to obtain declarations, among other matters, that the assignment to Elliot is void and an orderfor the return of the property and damages to be assessed.  Chan seeks damages for mental distress, physical discomfort and inconveniencecaused by Elliotâs breach of the formal agreement for the sale and purchase of the property and damages for infliction of emotionaldistress. </p>    <p class="heading">The Statement of Claim</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Healthy Living and Chan pleaded that Healthy Living is Chanâs âself-owned companyâ and the property was purchased under HealthyLivingâs name for Chanâs family, the directors and shareholders of Nu Life International (âNu Life Intâlâ) and Chan andher daughter (paragraphs 31(vi), (ix) and (xvi)).</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  By a provisional agreement dated 14 June 2003 and made between Healthy Living and Elliot, Healthy Living agreed to sell the propertyto Elliot for $8,830,000.  The provisional agreement was signed by Chan and her son, Khan Jawid Iqbal (âKhan Jawidâ) on behalfof Healthy Living. Khan Jawid was also a director of Healthy Living.  Chan then on behalf of Healthy Living signed a formal saleand purchase agreement with Elliot on 26 June 2003.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Healthy Living and Chan alleged in this action that immediately before the signing of the formal agreement, Elliot was told throughhis wife that Chan had no authority to sign the formal agreement singly on behalf of Healthy Living.  Despite this, Elliot stillprocured Chan to sign the formal agreement for Healthy Living.  Chan and Healthy Living thus pleaded that the formal agreement wasnot binding on Healthy Living. </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Furthermore, Elliot, in disregard of his oral promise to Chanâs daughter given on 21 June to back out from the transaction andwithout waiting for the return of Khan Jawid to participate in the matter, procured the registration of the formal agreement at theLand Registry against the property. </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Healthy Living and Chan further pleaded that Chan at the material time was in frail physical condition and did not have the necessarymental capacity to enter into the formal agreement, and Elliot was fully aware of her conditions.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Healthy Living and Chan further pleaded that Chan entered into the formal agreement as a result of some misrepresentations madeto her by Elliot through his estate agent, one Miss Lau, to the effect that Chanâs signature would not make the formal agreementvalid or binding and that Elliot would not register this agreement at the Land Registry before it was signed by Khan Jawid. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Healthy Living and Chan also pleaded that the above matters constituted undue influence by Elliot on Chan.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Healthy Living and Chan then pleaded that Elliot had breached the formal agreement in failing to tender the balance of the purchaseprice at $7,947,000 on 25 August 2003, the date of completion, and Elliotâs repudiation of the formal agreement was accepted byHealthy Living. Healthy Living then claimed loss and damage from Elliot.  Such loss and damage are basically the legal fees incurredin previous legal proceedings referred to below.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Chan also claimed loss and damage flowing from Elliotâs breach of the formal agreement.  Chan pleaded that Elliotâs repudiatorybreach caused frustration to her.  The previous legal proceedings brought by Elliot herein also caused her anxiety, mental and emotionaldistress, physical discomfort and inconvenience.</p>    <p class="heading">The First Action: HCA3202/2003</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  As mentioned above, Healthy Living entered into the provisional agreement with Elliot on 14 June 2003.  Chan and her son, Khan Jawid,signed for Healthy Living.  Pursuant to the provisional agreement, Healthy Living and Elliot made a formal agreement on 26 June 2003. Chan signed the formal agreement alone on behalf of Healthy Living.  The completion day was fixed on 25 August 2003. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  However, on 21 July, the then solicitors of Healthy Living informed the solicitors of Elliot that there were illegal structuresin the property.  That did not deter Elliot.  On 6 August 2003, Healthy Livingâs solicitors further wrote to Elliotâs solicitors,alleging that Nu Life Intâl had paid the down payment and the mortgage instalments for the purchase of the property by HealthyLiving.  Hence, Nu Life Intâl was the beneficial owner of the property.  Healthy Livingâs solicitors suggested returning thedeposit to Elliot and cancelling the formal agreement.  This was refused by Elliot.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Then another firm of solicitors, which represented one Nu Life International (Hong Kong) Limited (âNu Life HKâ), wrote to Elliotâssolicitors on 12 August and alleged that this company had from time to time transferred money into the account of Healthy Livingto meet the monthly mortgage instalments.  Hence, this company had an equitable interest in the property and it was objecting tothe sale of the property to Elliot. Elliot was still undeterred. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Healthy Living did not complete on 25 August, and Elliot issued the first action on the next day.  Nu Life HK and Khan Jawid wereadded as the 2nd and 3rd defendants in this action on 7 November.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Healthy Living in its re-re-re-amended defence and counterclaim pleaded that the property was acquired by Nu Life Intâl throughHealthy Living and it was held by Healthy Living as trustee for Nu Life Intâl.  Nu Life HK was then incorporated on 29 October1999 to take over from Nu Life Intâl its business and beneficial interest in the property.  Khan Jawid was a paid director of NuLife HK.  It further pleaded that Khan Jawid had, before signing the provisional agreement, told the estate agent, Miss Lau, thatHealthy Living needed an authorisation to sell the property.  The deal was then cancelled with Elliotâs agreement on 21 June 2003because Healthy Living could not obtain the authorisation.  </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Healthy Living also pleaded that prior to the making of the provisional agreement, Elliot was already aware of or put on enquirythat the property was subject to the beneficial interest owned by Nu Life HK.  However, Elliotâs disappointment caused by the cancellationmotivated Healthy Living to agree with Elliot to still proceed with the formal agreement subject to Healthy Living obtaining theauthorisation to sell.  Nevertheless, they agreed that the provisional agreement and formal agreement would still have to be cancelledif the authorisation was not forthcoming.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Healthy Living then ascertained on or about 24 June and then also told Elliot that no authorisation would be given, and the provisionalagreement was cancelled on the same day.  However, Healthy Living went on to plead that it was upon the agreement to proceed subjectto obtaining authorisation and the ascertainment on about 24 June that no authorisation would be given that Chan on about 26 Juneon behalf of Healthy Living entered into the formal agreement with Elliot, and Elliot paid the further deposit of $383,000 to HealthyLiving.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  This appears to contradict the earlier part of the defence which pleaded that the provisional agreement had been cancelled on orabout 24 June.  Nevertheless, Healthy Living then pleaded that for these reasons, it was never the intention of Healthy Living andElliot to complete the sale and purchase of the property if Healthy Living could not obtain the authorisation.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Healthy Living then pleaded that Elliot had refused the suggestion of Healthy Livingâs solicitors made by letter of 6 August tohave the sale and purchase cancelled and the deposit returned to him.  He insisted on completion.  However, on 25 August 2003, Elliotfailed to tender the balance of the purchase price and had repudiated the formal agreement.  Healthy Living then forfeited the depositand counterclaim for the deficiency in price below the purchase price.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The matters pleaded in the re-amended defence of Nu Life HK are similar to those in the re-re-re-amended defence and counterclaimof Healthy Living.  The re-re-amended defence of Khan Jawid is also the same as the re-re-re-amended defence and counterclaim ofHealthy Living.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Elliot in his reply relied upon <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing and Property Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219">Cap. 219</a> which provided that no equitable interest in land can be created or disposed of except by writing signed by the personcreating or disposing of the same.  There is no instrument in writing registered at the Land Registry recording the transfer of equitableinterest in the property by Nu Life Intâl to Nu Life HK.  Hence, by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128" class="autolink_findacts">Land Registration Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128">Cap. 128</a>, which provided that any instrument that may affect any parcels of ground, if not registered at the Land Registry, shallbe null and void as against any subsequent bona fide purchaser, the interest of Nu Life HK in the property, if any, was null andvoid.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  It appears that Healthy Living, Nu Life HK and Khan Jawid have pleaded Elliotâs knowledge of the equitable interest of Nu LifeHK in the property so as to make Elliot not a bona fide purchaser as there is this plea in the defence of the three defendants tothe effect that Elliot was aware or ought to have known of the beneficial interest of Nu Life HK in the property.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The trial of the first action was then fixed to commence on 1 March 2006.  The first PTR took place on 13 January 2006. There wasa second PTR on Monday, 23 January 2006.  At the end of the business hours on the Saturday before that, the solicitors for HealthyLiving and Khan Jawid served a summons on Elliotâs solicitors, seeking to amend their defences and file fresh evidence.  The substancesof the proposed amendments were that there had been duress and undue influence on Chan by the estate agent employed by Elliot andHealthy Living.  They also sought to plead that Chan was of unsound mind and not fit to give her consent at the time.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The application to amend was dismissed by Deputy High Court Judge Gill.  The learned judge said the proposed amendments were lateand substantial.  The defence in the proposed amendments was known well before a few weeks before the trial.  There was no evidenceto explain the delay.  The proposed amendments were also prejudicial to Elliot.  If the proposed amendments were allowed, the trialwas unlikely to proceed on the due day. The application to amend and, consequentially, the applications to file medical reports onChan and new witness statements were all dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Healthy Living and Khan Jawid appealed.  But the appeal was dismissed on 24 February 2006 by the Court of Appeal.  Rogers VP saidin para 9 of the judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦  However, having been taken through the various documents, including the affidavits which were filed in the Order 14 proceedingsand one of the witness statements, the more that I was taken through them, the more I saw that there was no justification for anydelay.  There is little justification that I can see for raising these matters now.  The evidence, at best, amounts to some high-pressuresalesmanship on the part of the estate agent but no more.  The evidence shows, quite clearly, as far as I can see, that Madam Chanwas in control of her faculties at the time.  She may have wanted to rid herself of a âsalesman with a foot in the doorâ, andthe 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant may have been annoyed about the price obtained for the house and that consternation was expressed, no doubt, at the timewhen he actually signed the provisional sale and purchase agreement.  But this unfortunately does not, to my mind, amount to duress,nor does it begin to establish that Madam Chan was of unsound mind.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The first action then proceeded to trial before Deputy Judge Gill on 6 March 2006, having been adjourned from 1 March.  Chan madea witness statement for Healthy Living, Nu Life HK and Khan Jawid and gave evidence for them at the trial.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The learned judge found in favour of Elliot.  He accepted that Nu Life Intâl owned the beneficial interest of the property, butdecided that such interest had not passed to Nu Life HK.  The learned judge also found that Elliot had no actual or constructivenotice of the interest of Nu Life Intâl or Nu Life HK until the receipt of the letter of 6 August 2003 from Healthy Livingâssolicitors.  The learned judge also found in favour of Elliot on the other matters in dispute. He ordered specific performance ofthe sale and purchase by Healthy Living and dismissed the counterclaim.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Healthy Living and Nu Life HK lodged an appeal against the judgment, but the appeal was dismissed by consent on 2 April 2007.</p>    <p class="heading">Second Action: HCA1157/2006</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  On 29 May 2006, Nu Life Intâl started the second action against Healthy Living and Elliot.  Nu Life Intâl claimed that it wasthe owner of the beneficial interest of the property and Healthy Living was holding the property as its trustee.  It relied on thefindings of Deputy Judge Gill in his judgment in the first action.  It also claimed that Elliot was aware of this when notified bythe letter dated 6 August 2003 of Healthy Livingâs solicitors.  It claimed that Healthy Living and Elliot should jointly conveythe property to it.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Elliot applied to strike out this action on the ground of <i>res judicata</i>.  The matter was before Deputy Judge Gill again.  The learned judge gave his determination on 12 September 2007.  He referred tothe conduct of the first action.  Nu Life HK and Nu Life Intâl had the same beneficial shareholders and directors.  The learnedjudge took the view that those in control of the two companies had embarked on a considered strategy to use Nu Life HK to claim thebeneficial interest in the property in the first action, which strategy was supported by Healthy Living and Khan Jawid.  The firstaction called for a determination of which of the competing equities of Elliot and Nu Life HK had priority.  Nu Life Intâl shouldhave known about it and should have applied to join as a defendant to provide an alternative defence.  It chose not to do so.  Thelearned judge therefore held that the second action was an abuse of process by virtue of the extension of the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>.  He struck out the action with costs to Elliot.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Before the second action was struck out on 12 September 2007, Chan had on behalf of Healthy Living already assigned the propertyto Elliot on 2 August 2006.  The assignment was, however, subject to the second action.</p>    <p class="heading">Analysis and Decision</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  This action is the third claim on the property. It is brought by Healthy Living and Chan.  I have already summarised above the groundspleaded in the statement of claim.  The main allegation is that Healthy Living held the property on trust for Chanâs family, theshareholders and directors of Nu Life Intâl and Chan and her daughter.  This claim is not the same claim as made by Nu Life Intâlin the second action where Nu Life Intâl alone claimed the beneficial interest in the property.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Healthy Living and Chan further pleaded in this action that Chan had no authority to sign the formal agreement and Elliot had beentold about this.  Elliot had registered the formal agreement in breach of his promise.  Chan also did not have the necessary mentalcapacity to enter into the formal agreement, and Elliot was aware of it.  There was also misrepresentation and undue influence exercisedon Chan which vitiated the formal agreement.  There was also the argument that Elliot had breached the formal agreement by failingto pay the balance of the purchase price on the completion day.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  It is the case of Chan and Healthy Living that Healthy Living is Chanâs company.  Chan also gave evidence for the defendants atthe trial of the first action.  It is therefore clear that Chan could have applied to be joined as a defendant in the first actionand put in her counterclaim there.  It is obviously her considered decision not to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  For the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> in the wider sense, I quote here the judgment of Lord Kilbrandon in <i>Yat Tung Investment Co. Limited v Dao Heng Bank Limited</i> [1975] AC581 at 590: </p>     <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ But there is a wider sense in which the doctrine may be appealed to, so that it becomes an abuse of process to raise in subsequentproceedings matters which could and therefore should have been litigated in earlier proceedings. The locus classicus of that aspectof res judicata is the judgment of Wigram VC in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281843%29%203%20Hare%20100" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1843) 3 Hare 100</a>, 115 where the judge says:</p>   <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhere a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the courtrequires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permitthe same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of thesubject in contest, but which was not brought forward only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence or even accident, omittedpart of their case.  The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the court was actuallyrequired by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject oflitigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.ââ</p> </blockquote>        <p class="quote">The shutting-out of a âsubject of litigationâ-a power which no court should exercise but after a scrupulous examination of allthe circumstances-is limited to cases where reasonable diligence would have caused a matter to be earlier raised; moreover, althoughnegligence, inadvertence or even accident will not suffice to excuse, nevertheless âspecial circumstancesâ are reserved in casejustice should be found to require the non-application of the rule.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The Vice Chancellorâs phrase âevery point which properly belonged to the subject of litigationâ was expanded in <i>Greenhalgh v Mallard</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1947%5d%202%20All%20ER%20255" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1947] 2 All ER 255</a>, 257 by Somervell LJ:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>Res judicata</i> for this purpose is not confined to the issues which the court is actually asked to decide, but that it covers issues or facts whichare so clearly part of the subject-matter of the litigation and so clearly could have been raised that it would be an abuse of theprocess of the court to allow a new proceeding to be started in respect of them.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  I also refer to the judgment of Cheung JA in <i>Ngai Few Fung v Cheung Kwai Heung</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%202%20HKC%20111" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 2 HKC 111</a> at para 16 and 17:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â16. In <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co. (a firm)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20WLR%2072" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 WLR 72</a> the House of Lords explained the rationale behind the <i>Henderson</i> âabuse of processâ principle:</p>        <blockquote>          <p class="quote">(1) The principle is to serve public interest in that there should be finality in litigation and that a party should not be twicevexed in the same matter.</p>          <p class="quote">(2) This is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and economy on the conduct of litigation, in the interests of the partiesand the public as a whole.</p>          <p class="quote">(3) The onus is on the party alleging abuse.</p>          <p class="quote">(4) The bringing of a claim or the raising of the defence in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court issatisfied that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all.</p>          <p class="quote">(5) It is, however, not necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional elements such as a collateral attack on aprevious decision or some dishonesty. But where those elements are present, the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive.</p>          <p class="quote">(6) There will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment of aparty. Per Lord Bingham of Cornhill at p 90.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">17. Lord Bingham, however, emphasised this:</p>        <blockquote>          <p class="quote">â<i>It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so far as torender the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive.  That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in myopinion be a broad, meritsâbased judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes accountof all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing orabusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before.</i>  As one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether,on given facts, abuse is to be found or not.ââ</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote><p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Mr Hui, counsel for Healthy Living and Chan, does not dispute the legal doctrine.  He, however, submitted that Chan is not the onlyshareholder and director of Healthy Living.  Healthy Living is a legal person in its own right.  Therefore, there is no sufficientdegree of identity between her and Healthy Living.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  I disagree.  Though Chan is not the only shareholder and director of Healthy Living, the only other director is her son.  She andher son signed the provisional agreement and she signed the formal agreement.  She now says that Healthy Living is her company andit held the property for her family, herself, her daughter and the shareholders and directors of Nu Life Intâl.  In other words,Healthy Living is her vehicle to hold the property for the benefit of her, her family and others.  In this scenario, there is certainlya sufficient degree of identification between her and Healthy Living so that the decision in the first action should be binding onher in this action.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Mr Hui also submitted that the defendants in the first action could not have amended their defence to plead duress and undue influenceon Chan and to adduce the two medical reports by Dr Benjamin Lai on Chan dated 3 January and 10 January 2006.  Dr Lai in these reportswas of the opinion that Chan was mentally not competent to sign the formal agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  He further submitted that this question of capacity was highly relevant as Chan was the sole signatory of the formal agreement. Healthy Living had tried its best in the first action to amend the pleadings and to adduce the medical evidence but failed.  Hence,he submitted that Healthy Living and Chan should be allowed to run these arguments again in this action. </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Alternatively, Mr Hui submitted that there are special circumstances in the present case that should permit Chan to run this action. She was not legally represented and had not obtained legal advice. She also had a long history of medical problems as detailed inthe medical reports.  Account should also be taken of whether she could have expressed herself and described what had happened inthe sale and purchase of the property.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Despite Mr Huiâs valiant efforts, I do not accept his arguments.  The issues of duress and undue influence and the medical evidencewere not allowed to be ventilated not because they were irrelevant, but because they were raised too late.  To try to raise theseissues again in this action is to circumvent the decision of Deputy Judge Gill which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.  It isan abuse of process.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  What Chan and Healthy Living should have done was to apply for Chan to be joined as a defendant in the first action, to raise thearguments of duress and undue influence and to procure and then adduce the medical evidence on Chan all in good time so that Elliotcould properly prepare his case to meet them.  The fact that Healthy Living and Khan Jawid could not have made use of these argumentsand Chanâs medical condition in their defence was only because they were too late, and that would not render the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> any less applicable to these matters. Since these matters should have been raised and raised in good time in the first action, theycannot be raised in this action now.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Regarding the argument that Chan had no legal advice, this ignores the fact that her son and her company, Healthy Living, were allalong legally represented.  She had also given evidence as a witness in the first action.  The sale and purchase of the propertywas a matter that she and her son had tremendous interests in.  She was not a distant or independent party to the matter.  I do notaccept that she was so ignorant and had not been taken care of by her son and her sonâs advisers.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Regarding the argument that Elliot had repudiated the formal agreement by failing to tender the balance of purchase price on thecompletion day, that argument has also been dismissed by Deputy Judge Gill in the first action who preferred the evidence of Elliot.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  I therefore strike out the claims of Healthy Living and Chan for the various declarations and for the return of the property toHealthy Living and damages.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Regarding the claims for damages by Chan, I accept the submissions of Mr Lee, counsel for the defendant, that there can be no claimfor damages for frustration, mental anxiety, emotional distress, physical discomfort or inconvenience caused by an alleged breachof a contract like the subject contract for sale and purchase of the property (<i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co.</i> [2002] 2 AC1 at page 37B to 38E).</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Regarding the claim for damages for the tort of intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress, since Elliot has succeededin the first action and obtained the conveyance of the property pursuant to the formal agreement, there is no basis for this claimeither. </p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  I therefore strike out Chanâs claims too.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  I also dismiss this action and order that the registration of the amended writ of summons against the property at the Land Registrybe vacated. </p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  I also make a costs order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiffs do pay the costs of the defendant.  Since this is the third time that Elliot is vexed with the same subject matter,I order that the costs be taxed on the indemnity scale and be summarily assessed by me at a 9.30 hearing to be fixed outside thenext 14 days unless the parties can agree the amount within the next 14 days.</p>	<p> </p>	<p> </p>        <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 100%">            <tr>                <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(L.
