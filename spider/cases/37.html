Afeature of it is that as originally pleaded it was for breach of a non-solicitation term that was part of or collateral to a confidentialityagreement entered into between the two firms as they explored the prospects of merger. But in the course of the discovery processdocuments emerged which resulted in the joinder of two of the individual protagonists and the evolving of the proceedings to includeclaims of breaches of fiduciary duty and of the inducing and procuring of those breaches by the defendant firms.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The counter to this is that members of the workforce, whether as partners or employees, should be allowed to advance their careersby moving without undue restraint from one principal to another, that principals should not be prevented from recruiting those whowant to make the move, and that clients should be free to engage whom they choose.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> I begin with a brief history.</p>    <p class="heading">History</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The plaintiff (Deacons) is a large well-known local legal practice. Its head office is in Hong Kong, with a presence either directlyor through associated firms in a number of other Asian cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Bangkok and Singapore. In early1999 its managing partners considered it time for the firm to test the feasibility of a global expansion; to become part of one ofthose practices which have branches or connected firms in some form or another throughout the world. To this end they began dialoguewith partners of the 1st defendant which is a limited liability partnership based in New York controlling an international conglomerationof firms established in 25 or more countries worldwide. One of those firms is based in Hong Kong, the 2nd defendant. (From hereonif I need to specify one firm or the other I shall do so respectively as White &amp; Case LLP and White &amp; Case HK. OtherwiseI shall refer to them collectively as White &amp; Case.)</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> At the time White &amp; Case HK was comparatively small; what was envisaged was that Deacons would merge with White &amp; Case HK;thus for White &amp; Case to expand its presence in South East Asia to become one of the largest regional firms and for Deacons tobecome part of an established global practice. With both sides interested in exploring such prospects they entered into a confidentialityagreement the purpose of which was to limit the extent to which shared sensitive material might be utilised, given of course thatat such time the parties were competitors and would remain so until merged if that was to take place. I shall from now on call thisthe Confidentiality Agreement. It is dated 15 May 1999. Its terms are unremarkable; there is no need for me to refer to them. Whathowever is pertinent is an exchange of letters thereafter. On 20 May the then managing partner of Deacons, Mark Roberts, wrote proposing,<em>inter alia</em>, a mutual undertaking between the firms in the following terms:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"2. The second issue which is slightly sensitive relates to our respective firms disclosing considerable amount of information aboutour respective practice groups and our lawyers, which might enable either firm to identify individuals from the other firm as futurepotential recruits. Obviously it is important that each of our firms have some protection in this area and I would, therefore, liketo propose that each firm undertakes not to solicit any lawyer from the other firm during any merger discussions between our respectivefirms and for a period of twelve months after those discussions come to an end (should there be no agreement to merge). Could youplease consider this proposal and let me have your views."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>His counterpart in White &amp; Case HK, George Crozer, who is also a partner of White &amp; Case LLP and on its management board,telephoned to agree and followed that up with a letter of 31 May which stated on the point:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Secondly, I agree to your non-solicitation proposal. I believe that this should go without saying, but it is good to be clear onthe matter, as well as on the specification of a time period as you have indicated."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Pausing here, it is the plaintiff's case that the exchange amounted to a variation of and became part and parcel of the ConfidentialityAgreement; alternatively, that it formed a collateral contract. There was a preliminary denial by the defendants that the partieswere bound by a non-solicitation obligation. But not long before the trial was due to begin a concession was made on the point towhich I shall return.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> After the signing of the Confidentiality Agreement and subsequent exchange of correspondence there followed discussions and swappingof information including financial data. Some of the Deacons partners visited and spoke to White &amp; Case LLP partners in New York.White &amp; Case sought advice on the most tax efficient means of accommodating Deacons in the event of a merger. Then matters wereput on hold; White &amp; Case were at this time engaged in negotiating with other firms in other areas which had priority. On 11November 2001 Deacons' partners resolved to break-off negotiations; the decision was made to stay regional. One of their number,Peter Aherne, was assigned to notify White &amp; Case and he did so, but not until a telephone call with Mr Crozer on 29 January2002.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> At all material times Deacons has operated a department called the Finance and Insolvency Department. Within that is a sub-groupresponsible for a type of activity called business restructuring and insolvency. In the main this comprises advising creditors, particularlybanks and accountants, on the financial restructuring of companies overburdened with debt, but where the situation is identifiedas non-contentious. The Asian financial crisis of 1997 was a shot in the arm for this division of Deacons. By 1998, the sub-group(the BRI group) was headed by a capital partner the 3rd defendant (Mr Fairbairn) whose team included a salaried partner the 4th defendant(Mr Cairns) and an associate solicitor Robin Darton. In mid 2001 a partner of a firm in Australia associated with Deacons calledNeil McDonald was seconded to Deacons to assist Mr Fairbairn in work deriving from the HIH Insurance Group collapse. He, too, becamean integral member of the team. Not in the BRI group but working closely with it was a member of the Commercial Department, a salariedpartner called Jeremy Leifer. Deacons has subsequently come to refer to these five as:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"complementary and senior members of an important part of the firm's practice with specific expertise in business recovery in additionto general insolvency skills." (See Deane W.S.I p. 102)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>By mid 2002 Deacons was holding out the BRI practice to be highly successful within the firm and, of its kind, top tier in Hong Kong.With that success came profit; fees of close to $40 million were earned in 2001. By then its members had developed key relationshipswith substantial financial institutions and accountancy firms including and in particular Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) and KPMG,from which the bulk of the work was forthcoming.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> On 11 June 2002 Keith Cole, by then the managing partner of Deacons, and Mark Roberts, his immediate predecessor, received resignationletters from Messrs Fairbairn, Cairns, Leifer, McDonald and Darton. They announced as one a wish to leave simultaneously and thatthey were all joining White &amp; Case HK.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The Deacons' management took the view that White &amp; Case were in breach of the non-solicitation provision that was a part of orcollateral to the Confidentiality Agreement of May 1999, and in a letter before action of 14 June notified White &amp; Case HK, copiedto White &amp; Case LLP that proceedings would follow unless offers of partnership and/or employment were withdrawn. The responsewas to deny solicitation and indeed the existence of a restriction on solicitation.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> On 24 June 2002 Deacons issued a writ.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Before coming to the claim against White &amp; Case LLP and White &amp; Case HK as originally propounded, it is I believe appropriateto spell out the various conditions and restrictions binding on the five men in question; specifically as to their contractual obligationsand duties, the notice to be given on departure, and restraints upon their activity thereafter.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Mr Fairbairn as a capital partner was a party to the firm's partnership agreement. Of its various provisions the following have relevance:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"5. <em>Obligations of the Partners</em></p>        <p class="quote">The Partners shall except during the periods of leave to which they shall be entitled under Clause 8 devote their whole time and attentionto the practice of the Firm and shall carry on and manage the same for the common benefit of the Partners to the utmost of theirskill and ability with such assistance from time to time of solicitors, clerks and/or other employees as the Partners shall deemnecessary and shall not during the continuance of this Agreement be concerned or engaged directly or indirectly in any business orprofession other than the practice of the Firm.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>

By virtue of the non-solicitation provisionof or ancillary to the Confidentiality Agreement the parties to it, being the plaintiff and defendants, were precluded by such restriction(called therein the "non-recruit term") from offering to take into partnership or employment from the other's firm any lawyer fora period of 12 months from the date of termination of merger discussions. That was a restriction which prevented negotiations leadingto hiring being initiated before January 2003. On an unspecified date but in any event before 11 June 2002 the defendants negotiatedwith five members of the plaintiff's partnership and staff to leave the plaintiff and join the 2nd defendant in breach of the non-solicitationprovision, resulting in those five members being offered and their accepting variously positions of partnership and employment withthe 2nd defendant. The relief sought was an injunction preventing the defendants taking into partnership or employment any of thefive recruits before January 2003 and or in the alternative damages.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The defence as originally pleaded was on behalf of both defendants. It denied that the exchange of letters amounted to an agreementto restrict the right of lawyers in the respective firms from exercising their right to pursue opportunities elsewhere, but if itdid, then it was void as amounting to an illegitimate restraint in trade. Further, the provision was "non-solicitation" not "non-recruitment".The defendants denied any breach or the plaintiff's entitlement to the remedies sought.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> As I stated at the outset, these proceedings were to evolve from those originally pleaded; this was by the joinder of Messrs Fairbairnand Cairns as defendants, the removal of Fairbairn from the plaintiff and the expansion of the causes of action to incorporate claimsof breaches of fiduciary duties and the inducing and procuring of those breaches. That was because in the discovery process undertakenover a passage of some months following a series of orders (including an unless order) a number of documents, mostly emails, revealedan unfolding relationship between Deacons' BRI team members and White &amp; Case LLP and White &amp; Case HK until their recruitmentinto White &amp; Case HK.</p>    <p class="heading">What Emerged in the Discovery Process</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> By email to himself of 3 December 2001 Mr Fairbairn attached a document dated December 2001 headed "The Core Elements of the Insolvencyand Restructuring Practice of the Finance and Insolvency Department".

Mr Kuzmikreported to Mr Crozer on 20 February:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Duane is reasonably impressed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> But Crozer's response of the same day was muted:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The sense I get from Duane is that this proposal is not going anywhere unless we can improve dramatically the profitably (sic) figures."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(From the witness box Mr Crozer explained that for lateral hires White &amp; Case looked for a ratio of three (projected fee income)to one (compensation). His email of 6 February to Kuzmik had said as much. Clearly this was passed on to Fairbairn, for Kuzmik'sresponse, still on the same day, was:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I just spoke with Mark Fairbairn. He understands the issue, and is confident that even a conservative re-working of the projectedfee income and "team" compensation expectations will show a 3:1 ratio within 18 months, and profitability (i.e. a ratio of greaterthan 3:1) in year 2 and thereafter. We'll see."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This resulted in a revamped projection from Fairbairn to Kuzmik of 24 February. By amendments therein, the desired 3:1 ratio was met.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> An email from Fairbairn to Kuzmik of 1 March is particularly significant:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" John</p>        <p class="quote">...</p>        <p class="quote">Moving on and on the assumption that everything is ok with the management board, I am intending to raise the subject of a move toWC to the Global head of credit of SCB next Tuesday (Jake Williams). It would be helpful if I had a list of any work done by WC inHK or elsewhere for SCB. Can you get something together?</p>        <p class="quote">Moreover, in a commercial context, would it be possible for the firm to bank with them in HK (and elsewhere)? This will become anissue which they will consider and perhaps I can fill you in on the telephone. Deacons are major customers for the Bank.</p>        <p class="quote">Regards</p>        <p class="quote">Mark"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The meeting must have taken place with productive results, for Crozer emailed Wall, on 6 March:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" Duane, Standard Chartered yesterday gave the debt rescheduling/insolvency team a green light to join W&amp;C. They then asked whetherthe team had talked to S&amp;S and set up an appointment for them with Ed Turner, the partner here in charge of the S&amp;S HK office.We understand that a first meeting took place. George"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>("S&amp;S" is another legal practice with global representation called Shearman &amp; Sterling)</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> The next significant step was a memorandum prepared by Mr Crozer and sent to Mr Wall on 16 March. It was of some 17 pages, and wasintroduced in this way:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Further to your request this memo is intended to serve as an introduction for the possible lateral recruitment of an establishedinsolvency and restructuring team currently with the Finance and Insolvency Department of Deacons in Hong Kong."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It then went on to provide data much of which was gleaned from the Business Plan and other material supplied by Mr Fairbairn, suchas reasons why the recruitment should proceed-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"unique opportunity to acquire an established top tier practice at partner level";</p>    </blockquote>    <p>a pocket CV of each of the five participants, now including McDonald, ten named clients of Deacons that-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"the team believe ... are likely to follow at the time of their move"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(the first five are SCB, BNP Paribas, Peregrine Capital, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers); reference to the restrictive covenants towhich each was subject; historic financial data and projections; a list of recent matters completed; and that Fairbairn and Cairnsshould be offered contract (capital) partnerships and Darton, Leifer and McDonald salaried partnerships. A paragraph dealing withthe prospect of work coming from SCB is significant:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In order to obtain instructions from Standard Chartered Bank it would be essential for the firm to be admitted to the bank's approvedpanel of lawyers. Standard Chartered has been approached and have confirmed the acceptability of White &amp; Case. Moreover, giventhe firm's international reach any admission to the panel would also present opportunities for the firm in the UK and New York."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> There followed an exchange of emails as Fairbairn sought to negotiate the entry level of Cairns and himself into the White &amp;Case partnership.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> An email of 26 March introduced another development; it was from Cairns to Kuzmik to the effect that a friend of his with Rolls-Roycein UK called Michael Kunz was looking for legal assistance concerning a project in Bangkok - "call him if you are interested." Deaconshas an affiliated firm in Bangkok.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> An email on the same theme was sent by Fairbairn to Kuzmik.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> In early April Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns went to New York for interviews with a selection of partners of White &amp; Case LLP.In introducing them, Wall said by memo of 2 April:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... One of the key issues to consider in assessing the initiative is whether Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns can retain Standard Charteredas a client if they leave Deacons because Standard Chartered is reportedly one of the two principal players in the bankruptcy andrestructuring business in Hong Kong. ... "</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This put four square and upfront what the top man at White &amp; Case regarded as an essential component of the package.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> One of the interviewers, one Eugene W Goodwillie Junior, reported back:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Fairbairn was very clear in stating unequivocally that they had total and complete confidence (presumably based on some sort of discussions)that SCB would follow them to White &amp; Case ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> On 23 April 2002 Fairbairn emailed Kuzmik:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="15%" class="quote">" <em>Subject</em>:</td>                <td valign="top" width="75%" class="quote">Additional papers</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">John</p>        <p class="quote">Thanks for the chat yesterday, I thought it was very constructive. I await hearing from you.</p>        <p class="quote">Meanwhile, I attach a draft "exit paper" and a paper on the "transition" of our business to White &amp; Case.</p>        <p class="quote">Very best regards,</p>        <p class="quote">Mark"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> It later transpired that these documents were requested, and were to emerge exhibited to Mr Crozer's memorandum of 29 April (seeparagraph 44) as "Achieving Successful Business Transition - A Brief Analysis and Discussion of Relevant Issues" (exhibit 3) and"Strategy and Action List" (exhibit 4) which I come to. I shall hereafter refer to these as the Business Transition Document andthe Strategy and Action List.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Thereafter there were further exchanges of emails between Fairbairn &amp; Cairns, Fairbairn &amp; Japp, Fairbairn &amp; Crozer andKuzmik and Crozer concerning the terms of prospective entry.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> One, of 18 April, Fairbairn to Japp, copied to Cairns and Darton, identified 7 issues, of which the first was:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"1. Value of what we give them - a business and an institutional client base - they are not paying for it at all"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>which brought Cairns' response:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I agree entirely with Mark's comments, specifically:-</p>        <blockquote>            <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="80%">                <tr>                    <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">1.</td>                    <td valign="top" width="75%" class="quote">Neither Mark nor I have ever asked or sought any form of "earn out" for the business we bring ... we had expected (indeed we weretold) that the immediate added value we bring could be reflected in our respective packages. ...",</td>                </tr>            </table>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>and was followed by Fairbairn's email to Japp the next day:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" ... I want fairness. We need W. &amp; C. to understand that we deliver a top tier client base - SCB have told them that as well...".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>These are a commentary leaving no doubt as to what was the essential ingredient in the recruitment package.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Then on 29 April, a key document came into being; a memorandum from Mr Crozer to Mr Wall, headed "Business Recovery and InsolvencyPractice" proposing the engagement of the five team members, Fairbairn and Cairns as contract partners and the remaining three assalaried partners. The restrictive covenants were referred to. On this topic Mr Crozer wrote:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... we have concluded there are good reasons for thinking that the covenants would not be enforced, and that Deacons will positivelyengage in a commercial solution for each of the team. Fairbairn and Cairns, in consultation with Herbert Smith, have prepared the"Strategy and Action" paper attached as Exhibit 3, and the "Business Transition" paper attached as Exhibit 4. We have reviewed thesedocuments, and on reflection think they are a reasonable way to proceed. We would, of course, continue to be involved in the processand at the appropriate time if necessary would engage in conversations directly with Deacons. While the foregoing approach is notfree from risk of a delay in Fairbairn's availability, we nevertheless think the approach has the greatest likelihood of avoidingdisruption in our access to the team's clients. We also note that White &amp; Case is not a party to the covenants and it is unlikelythat we would become involved in any enforcement proceeding."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Under the head "Due Diligence", Crozer reported:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"To maintain the team's confidentiality and integrity, we have been asked to limit and direct due diligence to [SCB] and KPMG."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He went on to state that there had been meetings with Jake Williams and Guy Isherwood (SCB) and Paul Brough and Grant Jamieson (KPMG).All expressed confidence in the Deacons BRI team and that the work would follow the team; indeed, that a move to a US based firmwas favoured. He wrote:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Mr Isherwood indicated that the team would have the full support of Standard Chartered Bank in connection with the exit of the teamand transfer of business matters from Deacons to White &amp; Case.</p>        <p class="quote">...</p>        <p class="quote">Mr Brough and Mr Jamieson confirmed that the Fairbairn/Cairns team is KPMG's preferred Hong Kong BRI legal team; Mr Brough commentedthat the only situation where he would not recommend the team is where there is clear conflict. ... "</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... the broad skills available generally in the Fairbairn/Cairns team would be an asset for White &amp; Case HK in building own M.&amp; A., corporate finance and litigation practices in Hong Kong. Interestingly, Mr Brough noted that the Fairbairn/Cairns teamhas made significant in-roads to HSBC and that they have positively engaged Standard Chartered in a dialogue to ensure that workfor HSBC will not disrupt the primary Standard Chartered relationship."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Exhibit 3 was the Business Transition Document sent by Fairbairn to Kuzmik on 23 April. Referring to White &amp; Case as the Firmand Deacons as the Old Firm it recorded at paragraph 4:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">"4.</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%" class="quote">The key issue in these negotiations will be the Team's restrictive covenants. These vary in nature and duration. The Firm has alreadybeen provided by the Team with extensive legal analysis on the issue of enforceability."</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>And at 6:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"6. The prime objective of the Team will be to seek (i) a shortened and uniform notice period for each Team member and (ii) a waiverof all applicable covenants <em>in toto</em>, failing which to achieve a dilution of the restrictions in a form commercially acceptable to the Firm. The Team believes that theseoutcomes will be achieved as it will be in Old Firm's interests for the following reasons:</p>        <p class="quote">...</p>        <p class="quote"><em>Client Support for the Team</em>: The Team enjoys the confidence and wholehearted support of its major clients. The Firm will be aware of this from its own enquiriesand soundings in the market. This support for the Team exists independently of the Team's presence at Old Firm and is based on theTeam's track record. Old Firm does not have other resources at present to convincingly replace the Team and will find it difficultin the short to medium term to recruit replacements. Clients are aware of this fact and the Team believes that major clients willboth wish to see current matters transition smoothly with the Team to the Firm and will not wish to be restricted in their abilityto instruct the Team at the Firm following their exit from Old Firm.</p>        <p class="quote"><em>Client Backlash for Old Firm</em>: The Team believes that Old Firm risks losing a greater amount of work from particular clients if it is not co-operative with theTeam's departure. The Team's business is essentially transactional in nature, with the vast majority of those transactions beingrelatively long-tailed - it is not uncommon for most deals to run for between 1 to 4 years in length; longer significant investmentnot just in their own management time and fee expenses, but also in the outcome i.e. their own and other parties' recoveries. Bankingclients, in particular, also face a reputational risk on deals which they are running involving multiple parties - they need thesedeals to close smoothly for the benefit of all concerned. Anything which is done to hinder or impede that is unlikely to be wellreceived, particularly if it is seen to be a selfish and protectionist move on the part of Old Firm to look after its own interestsfirst rather its clients' best interests.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">...</p>        <p class="quote"><em>Press Release</em>: The Team assumes that the Firm will wish to make an early announcement regarding the recruitment of the Team. Old Firm will wantthe opportunity to inform its clients first. The Team can use this fact to put pressure on Old Firm in negotiations by saying thatthe Firm intends to announce that the Team will be joining them as soon as possible. Old Firm will want to prevent the Team tellingpersons of their resignations on their own terms as a damage limitation exercise. Old Firm will want to agree any press statementto be put out by the Firm but of course cannot insist on doing so. Nevertheless the opportunity to indulge in some damage limitationon their part will be attractive and may form an important dynamic in negotiations."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> It is apparent that of concern were the issues of restrictive covenants and notices to be served and how these might be overcome.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Exhibit 4 was the Strategy and Action List.

Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns having been joined as 3rd and 4th defendants, thefirst of the new grounds is their inducing and procuring the breach by the 1st and 2nd defendants of the non-solicitation provision.What is pleaded is their knowledge of that and its effect, that by their response they were procuring the breach and that loss toDeacons resulted.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> The second of the new grounds incorporates the breach by the 3rd and 4th defendants of their equitable and/or contractual obligationsto the plaintiff and the procurement by the 1st and 2nd defendants of that breach. Extensive particulars then follow. In particular;the 3rd defendant's partnership agreement and the obligations under it owed to the other partners; the terms of the 4th defendant'scontract of employment and pertinent restrictions contained therein; the terms similarly incorporated into the contracts of MessrsDarton, Leifer &amp; McDonald; the equitable obligations of duty owed by a partner to his other partners and by an employee to hisemployer; that by virtue of their calling these contractual and equitable obligations would have been well-known to the partnersof the 1st and 2nd defendants. Then are particularized specific breaches beginning on 9 January 2002 and continuing until the dateof retirement in each case from the Deacons' partnership. Included are:- procuring, inducing, encouraging or facilitating employeesof the plaintiff to leave that employment and join a competitor; disclosure by the 3rd and 4th defendants to the 1st and 2nd defendantsinformation confidential to the plaintiff in the Business Plan; the contacting, by the 3rd and 4th defendants, of clients of theplaintiff to solicit work for the 2nd defendant whilst still with the plaintiff; by the 3rd defendant preparing the Strategy andAction List, designed to put pressure on the plaintiff not to enforce its rights; disclosure by the 3rd defendant to the 1st and2nd defendants information confidential to the plaintiff in the Core Elements Document; the encouraging, by the 3rd and 4th defendants,of potential "free" clients to engage the services of the 2nd defendant whilst still with the plaintiff; the 3rd and 4th defendantsprocuring in August 2002 SCB to instruct McDonald immediately upon his taking up employment with the 2nd defendant on 12 August 2002.These breaches and others particularized were induced and encouraged by the 1st and 2nd defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> The third of the new grounds is that the 1st and 2nd defendants interfered with the plaintiff's business by unlawful means; the fourth,that the defendants entered into a common design to acquire a substantial piece of the plaintiff's BRI work to the detriment of theplaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> What is now prayed for is first as against the 1st and 2nd defendants injunctive relief to prevent employment or other engagementof the five recruits until in each case the end of a period calculated to run from the date the non-solicitation restriction cameto an end and notice to be served; that is after the end of August 2003 (Leifer &amp; McDonald) the end of September 2003 (Dartonand the 4th defendant) and 1 January 2004 (the 3rd defendant); injunctive relief restraining them from providing BRI legal servicesto any former client of the plaintiff until after various dates being August 2003, September 2003, January 2004 or as the court deemsjust; in addition damages, including exemplary damages, they having acted with a cynical disregard of the rights of the plaintiffand in the hope and expectation that in the event of the plaintiff discovering the extent of their wrongdoing the profits that theywould make would exceed any damages that they may be required to pay the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> Against the 3rd and 4th defendants injunctive relief is sought to prevent their joining the 1st or 2nd defendant up to the datesaforesaid.

That undertaking was recordedas part of the preamble in the resultant directions order. No such undertaking was offered in respect of the 3rd defendant, whoserestrictive covenant is at clause 15A(i) and (ii) of the partnership agreement.

It is deniedthat that Business Plan contained confidential information of the plaintiff, as to the figures disclosed or the clientele revealed.It is admitted that some clients of the BRI team became aware of the move to the 2nd defendant but solicitation of their work isdenied.

At the trial Deacons was represented by Mr McGregor QC leading Mr Chow and all four of the defendantsby Mr Plowman SC leading Mr Burns.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> First, the non-solicitation issue.</p>    <p class="heading">Non-Solicitation</p>    <p class="heading">(a) The terms</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> What first I have to resolve is what it was that Messrs Roberts and Crozer committed their respective firms to in the exchange ofletters of 20 and 31 May 1999. It is the defence case that it was all along intended to prevent one or other of the firms from takingadvantage of sensitive material exchanged in the merger process by identifying key personnel and then inducing one or more to changecamps. This is clear from Mr Roberts' letter of 20 May whose terms were accepted without reservation by Mr Crozer in his reply of31 May. Thus it is incumbent on the party alleging wrongful solicitation to establish that it was from confidential material suppliedthat the other was prompted or encouraged to go after the lawyers in question. That being so, there has been no evidence to supportthe proposition that White &amp; Case came to be attracted to the BRI team by virtue of sensitive or confidential material suppliedduring the merger process; indeed that it is incontrovertible that nothing was provided that might have had that effect. Mr Jappwas not an agent for White &amp; Case HK so that any solicitation by him was independent of White &amp; Case HK. What happened wasthat the recruits in question were recruited. Solicit does not mean recruit. If on the other hand non-solicit amounts to non-recruitit cannot be enforced as being unlawful, unfairly restricting lawyers of either firm from earning their living as they chose.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> The plaintiff's contention is that Japp was an agent for White &amp; Case HK having taken on that role from February 2001. Solicitationby him was solicitation by the principal. If Japp is found not to be an agent the role undertaken by White &amp; Case HK, followingintroduction of the BRI team, amounted to solicitation. Deacons is not obliged to prove that the solicitation resulted from exposureof the confidential material during the merger process. This reads into the non-solicitation agreement words that are not there.The restraint imposed was not so wide as to be rendered unreasonable and void; each firm had a legitimate interest to protect, notonly lawyers but practice groups.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> I come to the law.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> Where the parties to a contract cannot agree on what it is they are committed to, it falls to the court to decide what it means byestablishing what it was intended to mean. This is dealt with not by ascertaining what the parties intended, but what a reasonableman having all the background knowledge would understand to be the intention. So it is necessary to have regard to the history leadingup to the commitment to the contract's terms, and that includes paying heed to the recitals and the aim of the contract, in orderto arrive at what is sometimes referred to as "the presumed intention".</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> As Mason J (as he then was) said in the High Court of Australia case of <strong>Codelfa Construction Pty Limited v. State Railways Authority of New South Wales</strong> (1982) 149 CLR at 337:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... when the issue is which of two or more possible meanings is to be given to a contractual provision we look not to the actualintentions, aspirations or expectations of the parties before or at the time of the contract, except in so far as they are expressedin the contract, but to the objective framework of facts within which the contract came into existence, and to the parties' presumedintention in this setting. We do not take into account the actual intentions of the parties and for the very good reason that aninvestigation of those matters would not only be time consuming but would also be unrewarding as it would tend to give too much weightto these factors at the expense of the actual language of the contract."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> And I recite from the headnote of the House of Lords case <strong>Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v. West Bromwich Building Society</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%20896" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 896:-</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Held, ... that in construing contractual documents the aim was to find the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonableperson having all the background knowledge reasonably available to the parties, including anything which would have affected theway a reasonable man would have understood it, but excluding previous negotiations and declarations of subjective intent; that themeaning which a document would convey to a reasonable man was what the parties using its words against the relevant background wouldreasonably have been supposed to mean and included the possibility of ambiguity and even misuse of words or syntax;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> With that principle in mind I turn to the contract itself. It is quite apparent, from an ordinary reading of that part of the letterdealing with the matter, what was troubling Mr Roberts and why protection was sought. But I do not accept on that ordinary readingthat the words reveal an intention that the parties were to be bound only where the solicitation sprung from the confidential orsensitive material exchanged. First those limiting words are not so expressed in the proposal or acceptance; and I pay heed thatas part of the overall matrix the representatives of both proposer and acceptor are senior, highly experienced legal practitionerswho would be expected to write what was intended and not more or less than that. Secondly, they were spokesmen for parties on anequal footing seeking mutual protection readily able to be policed and enforced. And that brings me to the third, that were thoselimiting words to be implied, there would fall on the injured party the need to prove what might be very difficult, lengthy and costlyto establish, namely, not just that there was solicitation, but that it stemmed from wrongful use of the information exchanged. Itseems to me that neither party would have wanted that burden; that the reasonable man, cognizant of the facts, would read the wordsand glean from them that solicitation within the time frame is what the parties intended to prohibit. Thus as I find, and hold, itis incumbent on Deacons to prove White &amp; Case solicited the five lawyers but without regard to how or why.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> Before coming to that I have to deal with what is meant by the words "not to solicit". Variously this has been described as "non-solicitation","hands-off" and "non-recruit"; indeed, as I have recorded, it is pleaded as the non-recruit term. I adopt again the mantle of thereasonable man to establish the presumed intention. First, on an ordinary reading of the various terms there is a difference. Tosolicit connotes the initial approach, the setting in motion, making the running, going after, targeting. I accept that there isauthority for the proposition that a person can solicit even if the solicitee makes the first move. Stein JA said as much in <strong>Barrett and Ors v. Ecco Personnel Pty Ltd</strong> (unreported), CA 4058/96 in a New South Wales Court of Appeal case. But it was also said by him that it is:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The task of the court to interpret the words ... in their context."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> The matter was further traversed recently in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice by Chapnick J in the case <strong>Insurance Portfolio Inc v. Axion Insurance Services Inc</strong> 2002 ACWSJ Lexis 1500. The judge was concerned with what was meant by the word solicit in the context of a claim that the defendanthad breached a covenant made with the plaintiff not to solicit or contact customers of a named insurance company. He did not disagreewith the proposition advanced by both sides that where there is no ambiguity words in a contract must be given their literal meaning.He went on to quote from various dictionaries that solicit means variously to invite, make appeals or requests to, importune, entice,ask earnestly for, seek assiduously, and so on. Then he went on to state that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"the words in question cannot be viewed in isolation and must be understood within the context of the agreement as a whole."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> Vinelott J in the case of <strong>Austin Knight (UK) Limited v. Hinds</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%20FSR%2052" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] FSR 52</a> was required to consider the term solicit in a covenant in which an employee was prevented from "soliciting or endeavouring to enticeaway" customers of her employer for a period after her termination of employment. It was submitted by counsel for the plaintiff thatby making a presentation to a former customer, even one who had approached her, amounted either to soliciting or endeavouring toentice away the customer. His Lordship disagreed. At p. 59 he said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"That is not I think, comprehended in the usual meaning of soliciting, and as regards endeavouring to entice a customer away, if [thePlaintiff's] submission were well-founded, the covenant would amount to a covenant not to deal with customers of [the Plaintiff],even customers with whom [the former employee] had never dealt with while an employee of [the Plaintiff] and with whose relationshipwith [the Plaintiff] she was wholly unaware. On that construction the covenant would ...plainly be an unreasonable restraint".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> Given that the parties before me were concerned to avoid illicit poaching, it seems to me and I so find that the intention was tostop one firm from going after personnel in the other rather than to prevent recruitment absent that approach. In other words thatnot to solicit does not, within the context of what was agreed, mean not to recruit, nor that it was a hands-off restriction, thecolloquial equivalent.</p>    <p class="heading">(b) Solicitation?</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> Was there solicitation, before expiry of the time designated, in breach of the agreement? It is not disputed that when Mr Fairbairnand the others signed up to join White &amp; Case, the non-solicitation restriction was still current. What is in issue is as towhether they had been solicited.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> To answer this question, I need to go back into the history as I glean from the evidence adduced by those who played a part, namely,Messrs Fairbairn, Cairns, Darton, Leifer, McDonald, Crozer, Kuzmik and Japp. There was also evidence from a witness not previouslyreferred to, a partner of Herbert Smith in Hong Kong, called Nigel Francis.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> It is apparent that at least by the close of 2001 Messrs Fairbairn, Cairns and Darton had become close colleagues and firm friends;to a lesser but nonetheless significant extent Mr Leifer fell into the same category. When he arrived on the scene in the summerof 2001 Mr McDonald fitted in well, professionally and socially. At that time Messrs Fairbairn, Cairns, and Darton revealed to theothers of the group that they were not happy at Deacons, having become somewhat disillusioned by what one called "political factionfighting" in the firm. That came to a head in late November when Mr Darton's promotion to partnership, not for the first time, failedto attract the requisite number of votes. The threesome let it be known, within the group, that they intended to leave, ideally asa team, in order to preserve their professional and social relationships. Both Messrs McDonald and Leifer expressed an interest inbeing included; it is fair to say however that neither had the same strong feelings against Deacons.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> Mr Fairbairn contacted Herbert Smith in Hong Kong. Herbert Smith is one of those practices represented worldwide, with its head officein London. There was an expression of interest and he was asked to fill out a form headed "Outline Business Plan" that Herbert Smithhabitually used when considering candidates at partnership level. Mr Fairbairn expanded on the template and submitted it. I mentionhere that in that original form it is very similar though not identical to the Business Plan so-called that was subsequently to besent to and received by White &amp; Case for the same purpose. As with the Business Plan, the document sent to Herbert Smith dealtwith a team recruitment, being Messrs Fairbairn, Cairns, Darton and Leifer. There were several meetings but, in the event, by endDecember, Herbert Smith decided not to proceed.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> By then Mr Japp had appeared on the scene. At all material times he was employed by Robertson Smart on salary plus commission, asa recruiter of personnel within the legal profession. Mr Japp describes himself as that sort of recruitment consultant who does notact on the basis of a formal retainer from a law firm; rather he seeks out practices with a general need and individual lawyers whoexpress an interest in making a move, and then attempts to introduce the one to the other. If a recruiting results his employer getspaid and he earns a commission. To this end he approached White &amp; Case HK in early 2001 to learn of its intentions in Hong Kong.He spoke to Mr Kuzmik. He was told that White &amp; Case were looking for recruits for its intellectual property and China practices,and that it would also be interested in adding to its partnership a practitioner whose speciality was banking. Japp submitted hisemployer's scale of charges payable if a candidate introduced by him came to be employed. During the course of the year he did introducevarious candidates to Mr Kuzmik but no recruitment resulted.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> In December 2001, without particular reason, Mr Japp made contact with and met Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns. He told them he madethe approach representing no firm, because he did not, but that would make the necessary overtures if they were interested. He wastold that they were planning to move and that two others, Messrs Darton and Leifer, were looking to go with them. Mr Fairbairn preparedand sent to him the document I have earlier described being the Core Elements Document. Mr Fairbairn said he produced this from informationheld internally by Deacons, used by it for marketing and promoting its personnel and available services. It was agreed that Mr Jappshould approach Allen &amp; Overy, Clifford Chance, Freshfields and White &amp; Case to establish levels of interest. He did so.He sent or delivered to each firm the Core Elements Document.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> Of all the firms approached, only White &amp; Case were prepared to go further. It was Japp's meeting with Mr Kuzmik that gave riseto Kuzmik's email to Mr Crozer of 9 January 2002:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Just finished with Japp. The Corp restructuring/insolvency team is from Deacons. Expensive, but appears to be an aggressive and successfulteam ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> There was a meeting held on 31 January 2002 attended by Messrs Crozer and Kuzmik, and Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns. Mr Crozer invitedthem to present a case. Mr Fairbairn prepared the Business Plan, adjusting as required the document he had already prepared and submittedto Herbert Smith. This was sent on 10 February. Up to this point those referred to in the Business Plan as candidates for recruitmentas a team did not include Mr McDonald. He had not been regarded then as a serious recruit given that he was on secondment from theassociate firm in Australia. He came "on board", as it were, shortly afterwards, on terms that need to be examined further.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> The rest is history. Following the recruitment Robertson Smart submitted a bill to White &amp; Case HK. There seems to have beena difficulty about collection; certainly there was a delay in payment.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> And so to my findings.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> Against the argument raised for Deacons to the contrary, I am unable to conclude that there is anything in the proposition that RobertsonSmart - through Mr Japp - was acting as agent for White &amp; Case and targeted the BRI team as agent. There was no mandate writtenor verbal. A year prior Mr Kuzmik had spoken of a need to find an experienced banking practitioner for recruitment at partnershiplevel. He had not alluded to lawyers specialising in restructuring insolvent corporations. Mr Japp as I am satisfied "cold called"White &amp; Case HK as one of several firms at the instigation of the candidates, not the other way round. That White &amp; CaseHK paid Robertson Smart when recruitment was achieved is neither here nor there. Nor can I accept the proposition that Messrs Crozerand Kuzmik had on behalf of White &amp; Case initiated an approach to Messrs Fairbairn et al as might amount to solicitation. Theirfirst involvement was to receive from Mr Japp the Core Elements Document. The decision to meet the candidates, and Mr Crozer's requestfor information (which resulted in the delivery to him of the Business Plan) was a logical and anticipated next step, rather thanthat it was the initial step in the recruitment process.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> There was, as I find, no solicitation by White &amp; Case LLP or White &amp; Case HK and thus no breach of the non-solicitation restrictions.</p>    <p class="heading">Inducement to Solicit</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> It follows from that finding that there can have been no inducement or procuring by Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns of such breach.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> And so now to the claims against Messrs Fairbairn &amp; Cairns.</p>    <p class="heading">The Contractual and Equitable Duties of Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> The alleged breaches as pleaded have been broken down into a number of sub-issues.

This is not intendedto be an exhaustive list, but it is sufficient to indicate the nature of fiduciary obligations. They are the defining characteristicsof the fiduciary. As Dr Finn pointed out in his classic work <em>Fiduciary Obligations</em> (1977), p. 2, he is not subject to fiduciary obligations because he is a fiduciary; it is because he is subject to them that he isa fiduciary."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> As far as employees are concerned the implied obligations owed the employer are as well settled.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> In <strong>Robb v Green</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1895%5d%202%20QB%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1895] 2 QB 1</a>, Hawkins J said at p. 10:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I have a very decided opinion that, in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary, there is involved in every contract of servicean implied obligation, call it by what name you will, on the servant that he shall perform his duty, especially in these essentialrespects, namely, that he shall honestly and faithfully serve his master; that he shall not abuse his confidence in matters appertainingto his service, and that he shall, by all reasonable means in his power, protect his master's interests in respect to matters confidedto him in the course of his service.

It was apparent from the Core Elements Document andsubsequent Business Plan that that was how they were promoting themselves, not as individuals. With that as a basic premise, MessrsFairbairn and Cairns had a vested interest in inducing Mr Darton, subsequently Mr Leifer, and finally Mr McDonald to join them. Andthat is what happened. Mr Fairbairn and to a lesser extent Mr Cairns were the spokesmen and orchestrators, negotiating on behalfof the others in general and particular terms.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> It is the defence case that there was no inducing; that Messrs Darton, Leifer and McDonald made their own individual decisions toresign. That they acted in concert is irrelevant. That they permitted Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns to do the running for them is alsoirrelevant. Whilst they may have been influenced by their seniors' decision to leave and to leave together that did not establishinducement; indeed, in the circumstances, it was perfectly understandable.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> I come now to the evidence on the issue.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> First there are the documents. They indicate the development of a plan of three, then four, then five moving as one. They revealthat the documentation, the talking, the negotiating and the fine-tuning were all undertaken by Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns. Theyreveal returns to the recruiter that individuals could not offer.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> Then there is the evidence forthcoming from the participants. Mr Darton, closely associated with his more senior colleagues bothprofessionally and socially, spoke of his own, independent dissatisfaction with Deacons; in particular, the disappointment at beingturned down for partnership. To the proposition that he was somehow induced or procured to leave Deacons, by Fairbairn, Cairns orother agency, he attested he was not. Mr Leifer, who expressed no dissatisfaction with Deacons during his employment with that firm,gave several reasons for leaving. He saw the move to White &amp; Case as a significant career move, given the international natureof the practice. Whilst not specifically in the BRI team he had worked closely with those in it, and most of his own practice wasconcerned with it. He saw the departure of its key members as a prospective set-back to his own advancement. He denied he was inducedto leave. It was a decision he independently and freely made, having considered the pros and cons after a discussion with his wifeand no one else. Mr McDonald stated that having learnt that Messrs Fairbairn, Cairns and Darton were definitely leaving Deacons andnegotiating to join White &amp; Case then gave thought to his own situation. He was attracted by the prospect of joining, presumablyas a partner, a top tier firm, and that the insolvency work in which he specialized would be of an international nature with moreinterest and challenges. On the other hand, he was reluctant to give up his partnership in Deacons' associate firm in Australia ofwhich he was proud and which he valued. And there was the issue of a more long term absence from Australia. In short, he was torn.I repeat verbatim, how he came by his decision to leave:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In the end, I thought about the issue over many nights and had lengthy discussions with my wife and some of my most trusted peersand friends. I did not confer at this stage with any of Mark, Edward or Robin about what I should do. The matters concerning Robin'spromotion to partnership did not affect my decision in any way. I felt it was a decision I had to make for myself whilst being asobjective as possible. Ultimately, I was encouraged by the fact that I received almost unanimous advice from friends and peers thatthe opportunity to join a major international firm as a partner was one I could not simply give up and that White &amp; Case wasan outstanding firm. This view was confirmed to me by a number of Deacons partners in Australia subsequent to my resignation, whoall wished me well in my future career."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He went on to state that he was not induced to leave, that it was, in the end, his own decision, in what he felt was in his best interests.All three of the above were subjected to testing cross-examination by Mr McGregor. All declined to support the proposition that theyhad been induced by Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns to make the move.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns themselves denied there was any inducement on their part.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> It seems to me and I so find that there is nothing in the proposition that Messrs Darton, Leifer or McDonald have been less thantruthful in their evidence both written and from the witness box on the issue of whether they or any of them had been induced orprocured to leave Deacons. The documents and conduct upon which Deacons relies to support that contention do no more than indicatea decision to move together and at the same time, with Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns orchestrating the terms on their behalf. Thisdoes not seem to establish inducement or even to infer that. Having read and listened to the evidence of those said to have beenunder the power of others, I am satisfied that each in his own way was capable of coming to the decision he did independent of anyuntoward, illicit pressure.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> But that is not the complete picture. There was as I have found, no procuring or inducing. But that does not rule out encouragingor facilitating. There is no doubt on the evidence that Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns were the first to feel and then to voice theirdiscontent with Deacons and to make it known of their decision to move on. Mr Darton with his partnership prospects all but overwas quick to join. Messrs Leifer and McDonald followed thereafter. As the team grew in size to become the core element of the DeaconsBRI team, so it was that Mr Fairbairn was able to forecast the prospects of key clients moving with the team; a most attractive propositionfor the prospective suitor but a most damaging one to the existing partnership/employer, Deacons.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> It is apparent to me and I so find that in pursuing the strategy of a co-ordinated exit Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns acted to encourageand facilitate their colleagues' simultaneous departure without regard to the consequences for Deacons save that inevitably it wouldcause hardship. This as I find was directly at odds with Fairbairns' obligations as a partner. He failed to display "the utmost goodfaith" of Lord Lindley's famous lines. In fact his conduct has the hallmarks of bad faith. Similarly, Mr Cairns was in breach ofhis contractual obligations of good faith. There is a further breach under this head; of an obligation to notify one's principalthat a course of action proposed will likely be damaging to its interests if it proceeds; see <strong>Sanders v Parry</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%201%20WLR%20753" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 1 WLR 753.</a></p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> There was also an obligation in both Fairbairn and Cairns to report to Deacons of the other's misconduct, even if to do so wouldhave implicated the notifier; see <strong>Sybron v Rochem</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20Ch%20112" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 Ch 112.</a> I suppose it is hardly surprising that each failed to do so, given they were equally in it together and that that would have amountedto the commission of that most heinous of schoolboy crimes, dobbing in a chum. But when they signed up for Deacons they assumed themantle of loyalty owed to the partnership; what was displayed was loyalty heading the wrong way.</p>    <p class="heading">The Business Plan - 38I(b)</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> Before dealing with the specific allegations, I need to consider the law pertaining to the duty of confidentiality. As to their jointand several obligations I do not find a distinction between those of Mr Fairbairn as a partner and Mr Cairns as employee. This contentionis supported by Megarry J in <strong>Floydd v Cheney</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%201%20ALL%20ER%20446" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 1 ALL ER 446</a> at p. 449.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> Faccenda Chicken (supra) is the leading case on the issue of the extent to which an employee or fiduciary may impart knowledge orinformation of the employer or partnership as the case may be. At first instance the trial judge Goulding J categorized informationinto three distinct classes:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"First there is information which, because of its trivial character or its easy accessibility from public sources of information,cannot be regarded by reasonable persons or by the law as confidential at all. The servant is at liberty to impart it during hisservice or afterwards to anyone he pleases, even his master's competitor. An example might be a published patent specification wellknown to people in the industry concerned. ... Secondly, there is information which the servant must treat as confidential (eitherbecause he is expressly told it is confidential, or because from its character it obviously is so) but which once learned necessarilyremains in the servant's head and becomes part of his own skill and knowledge applied in the course of his master's business. Solong as the employment continues, he cannot otherwise use or disclose such information without infidelity and therefore breach ofcontract. But when he is no longer in the same service, the law allows him to use his full skill and knowledge for his own benefitin competition with his former master; and ... there seems to be no established distinction between the use of such information whereits possessor trades as a principal, and where he enters the employment of a new master, even though the latter case involves disclosureand not mere personal use of the information. If an employer wants to protect information of this kind, he can do so by an expressstipulation restraining the servant from competing with him (within reasonable limits of time and space) after the termination ofhis employment. ... Thirdly, however, there are, to my mind, specific trade secrets so confidential that, even though they may necessarilyhave been learned by heart and even though the servant may have left the service, they cannot lawfully be used for anyone's benefitbut the master's ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> The Court of Appeal did not expressly adopt Goulding J's three categories, and in fact was in respectful disagreement with the propositionthat information other than that which falls into the third category can be protected by a restrictive covenant. But what does emergeis that there is a crucial distinction between what an employee may disclose during the currency of his employment and what he maydo after it is over. Whilst the relationship is current the duty of confidentiality attaches to all kinds of information learnedin the course of employment, excluding that which is trivial or in the public domain. After the employee leaves the only informationcapable of being protected by express or implied restriction is information the equivalent of a trade secret. The same rules applyas between a fiduciary and his partners. It follows as I find that there would be a breach of the core duty of loyalty or of goodfaith and fidelity if information is misused by the fiduciary or employee for his own benefit and/or the benefit of another, evenif the information disclosed falls below Goulding J's third category of a trade secret or its equivalent.</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a> It is the defence's contention that the additional ingredient of detriment has to be established for an action founded in breachof confidence. <strong>Robb v. Green</strong> (supra) is cited in support. Hawkins J expressed the implied term preventing an employee from misusing confidential information requiresthe qualification that such use shall be detrimental to the employer. But moving forward by nearly a century to the House of Lordscase <strong>Attorney General v. Guardian Newspaper Ltd No. 2</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20AC%20109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 AC 109</a>, the celebrated "Spycatcher" case, Lords Goff, Keith and Griffiths touched on the topic without providing a firm view, perhaps becauseit was not material in that case. The other two Law Lords made no reference at all. In the event I make no ruling because I do notfind it necessary to do so as I shall come to.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> I turn to the specific allegations and defence under this head.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> The plaintiff's case is that the information disclosed in the Business Plan as itemized (i) to (v) in clause 38I(b) was materialconfidential to Deacons. Some of the financial information disclosed was of such confidentiality that it could only be assessed throughDeacons' intranet by equity partners, and was clearly material confidential to Deacons. The prospect of referrals, a compiled listof clients and an indication of those ready to follow the team fell into the same category. That Fairbairn had marked his coveringemail as private and confidential indicates he was well aware of that.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> The defence case is first that Mr Cairns played no part in the production of the Business Plan, beyond that he reviewed and commentedon it before it was sent out. That minimal participation permits him to avoid responsibility for it. Next it claims the informationimparted was not confidential, but that which both Fairbairn and Cairns were entitled to disclose in pursuit of their career advancements.This is evident from the fact that the Business Plan emerged from a template used by Herbert Smith in the recruitment process, andthat Deacons looked for and received such information in its own hires. As to the information naming clients of the BRI team, thiswas already in the public domain and was thus neither sensitive nor confidential. The reference to some of the clients being likelyto follow the BRI team was a statement of belief and not information; certainly it was not information confidential to Deacons. Finally,it is pleaded that as a matter of public policy there should be free movement of labour with no unwarranted interference to preventan individual from advancing his career.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> Before I come to my ruling I make brief reference to evidence on the topic from Messrs Scorgie, Fairbairn, Cairns, Darton, Leifer,McDonald and Cole.</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> Mr Scorgie as Deacons' Chief Information Officer was responsible for its computer technology. I have reproduced earlier (see paragraph24) an emailed request to him by Mr Fairbairn for financial information relating to work undertaken by himself and Cairns. He describedthe request as an unusual one because it concerned the performance of a sector of a department and not the whole department or oneperson. He extracted data from level 2 of Deacons' intranet (level 2 is the second highest level of access, restricted to equitypartners only) and sent it to Fairbairn. The abnormal nature of the request and the timing of it would suggest that this may havebeen the source of the financial information that found its way to the Business Plan, and that it came from a secure origin wouldsupport the contention that it was information confidential to Deacons. Mr Fairbairn conceded that he did ask for the informationbecause he was then contemplating departure from Deacons. He also conceded that it was confidential to Deacons. But in the end hedid not use Scorgie's reports because he believed they were wrong. The figures he supplied were based on his own estimates, fromhis figures and those provided by other members of the BRI team.</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a> Messrs Darton Leifer and McDonald stated that on request by Mr Fairbairn they provided figures relative to their respective financialperformances at Deacons. Mr Darton said that he disclosed figures relating to his billings which he would have got from the intranet(at level 4, restricted to associates) or from the hard copy accounts circulated monthly by the Accounts Department. Mr Leifer saidhe calculated the total value of his chargeable hours and net billings and charge-out rate and gave them to Mr Fairbairn. Mr McDonaldsaid he supplied his financial particulars worked out from the monthly accounts handed out by the Accounts Department. Mr Cairnssaid he did not extract anything from the intranet and said that Fairbairn:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"produced a business plan in due course based substantially on publicly available information, together with some simple income projectionswhich were really only the product of multiplying an annual number of billable hours by an hourly charge-out rate (together withother assumptions)."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>However, in cross-examination he conceded that the financial information was not in the public domain and was not a simple multiplicationexercise.</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> Mr Cole explained how it was that the net billings disclosed could not be derived from multiplying the chargeable hours by the relevantcharge-out rates, in this way:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is not the case, because you work a specific number of chargeable hours, and what you end up billing after you have taken intoaccount write-offs, when you have taken into account client reductions, when you have taken into account the sorts of special dealsthat you are talking about with people like CLP earlier, is a complete different figure. I have never come across anybody who hadmanaged to say, 'I worked 1,000 hours at $5,000 an hour. Therefore, I have billed exactly $5 million'. It does not work like that.You get reductions, you get deductions, you get write-backs and you get special deals" [Day 14 page 67 line 15 to page 68 line 3]</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> I glean from this and so find that the figures disclosed were not calculated from a simple multiplication process but were actualhistoric figures extracted either from Deacons' intranet or its Accounts Department. Whether this was via Mr Scorgie's programmemade up at Mr Fairbairn's request or from data supplied by the various BRI members or was a mixture of both is not material. Giventhe various levels of access depending on the seniority of the individuals directing a search, it is apparent as I find (and indeedobvious from any standpoint) that the figures extracted and from which the calculations in the Business Plan derived were not inthe public domain, nor trivial, and amounted to information confidential to Deacons to the level of a trade secret equivalent. Icome to the same conclusion concerning the disclosure of the overall annual billings for the business recovery part of Deacons' insolvencypractice.</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> As to referrals, I am satisfied this, too, was information confidential to Deacons. Mr Fairbairn in cross-examination said that hesourced this information from a partnership conference - hardly in the public domain.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> I come now to the identifying of key clients and the prospect of their following the BRI team to another firm. Taken in isolationthe disclosure of clients of the team is not as I find confidential. Reference is made to their status in Asia Pacific Legal 500and other widely circulated periodicals. But such information takes on an altogether different complexion when ten of them, clearlythe majority and including 'key' clients such as SCB and KPMG, are categorized as clients the BRI team believes will follow the teamat the time of their move. I do not regard this as merely being a statement of belief and not information as such. It is, as I find,information which ought to have been disclosed to Deacons. The fact that it was not but instead was passed on to a competitor, underthe heading "Opportunities for White &amp; Case" was in my view the passage of information which was not only confidential but obviouslyharmful to Deacons.</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> The defence proposition that Mr Cairns played no or minimal part in the preparation of the Business Plan is not supported by thepleadings, or the evidence. At paragraph 59 of the statement of defence it is stated in part "It is admitted that the 3rd and 4thDefendant prepared a written business plan". In his supplemental witness statement Mr Cairns stated at paragraph 33:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">"33.</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%" class="quote">Other than providing Mark with a copy of my CV, I was not involved in the preparation of the business plan that was forwarded to White&amp; Case under cover of Mark's memorandum of 10th February, 2002.

In cross-examination he was taken to the Core Element Document and the sub-headingtherein "Notable Restructuring and Insolvency Matters" and the following line "Whilst financial details of the practice cannot begiven ..." and then a list of transactions undertaken by the team. He conceded that he was not prepared to reveal financial detailsbecause that would have been a breach of his fiduciary duties. He sought to explain his having done so in the Business Plan was becausefor the recruitment to be advanced to the next step that was information needed to justify the value of the team. He conceded thatmerely moving to another stage of the recruitment process does not change the duty owed but sought to justify it by stating "I donot think fiduciary duties can be used to prevent people moving". But his marking of the email to Messrs Kuzmik and Crozer that enclosedthe Business Plan as "PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL" tells its own tale.</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a> As to the defence that it evolved from the Herbert Smith template, one used freely by that firm in London and elsewhere; two pointsemerge. The first is that it appears to be designed for individual lateral hire not for more than one person or a team. Secondlyit makes no provision for disclosure of the historic figures that were disclosed in the Business Plan.</p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a> I have not hitherto referred to Mr Fairbairn's email and attachment to Mr Kuzmik of 18 February 2002 in which he disclosed structuraldetails of Deacons' partnership lockstep and the actual drawings of Deacons' first and second year capital partners. In fact fromthis document one can calculate the drawings of every partner as Fairbairn conceded. The existence of the document is not pleadedto perhaps because it came to light late in the discovery process. It is all too apparent that Fairbairn was aware of its statusand sensitivity "As you will appreciate this is highly confidential" and goes to establish his readiness to devulge secret informationbelonging to his partnership for the purpose of career enhancement of himself and his team.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a> Reverting back to that which is pleaded, the Business Plan; taken as to its parts and the sum total of those parts I find it wasa document containing information which was confidential and sensitive to Deacons. The majority of that which was confidential Iclassify as being within Goulding J's category 3 in <strong>Faccenda Chicken</strong>. The disclosure of it to the competitor White &amp; Case represented a material breach of good faith and fidelity owed by MessrsFairbairn and Cairns.</p>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a> Returning to the issue of detriment; whether or not it is a necessary ingredient, I find that on the evidence there was detriment.There was as I find a direct casual link between the supply of the Business Plan and the recruitment process resulting in the lossto Deacons of the BRI team members, some of their client base, and profits that otherwise would have been earned.</p>    <p class="heading">Soliciting Clients for a Competitor - 38I(c)</p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a> In answer to a request for further particulars of this claim, the plaintiff responded that this was directed specifically to SCBand KPMG. Reference was made therein to the statement of belief in the Business Plan, Mr Crozer's email to Mr Wall of 16 March 2002:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In order to obtain instructions from Standard Chartered Bank it would be essential for the firm to be admitted to the Bank's approvedpanel of lawyers.

He cannot solicit his principal's clientsto leave his principal. Whether activity undertaken by him goes so far as to amount to soliciting or is preparatory work in anticipationof his departure and is unobjectionable is a matter of degree in the given circumstances. <strong>Sanders v Parry</strong> (supra) is a well-known case on the point. An assistant employed by a sole practitioner undertook as part of his duties work broughtin by an important client. The client having said that if he left to set up on his own account he would transfer his business, theassistant handed in his notice and did so. And the client did follow him. The sole practitioner sued for breach of the implied termsof the contract of employment that the assistant would serve him with good faith and fidelity. The defence was that it was the clientwho had initiated the arrangement. Havers J held that it mattered not. Even were it to be so, the assistant having accepted the client'soffer whilst he was still employed by another and not having informed his employer of the offer was in breach.</p>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a> In <strong>Balston Limited v Headline Filters Limited</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20FSR%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] FSR 330</a>, a director of the plaintiff formed an intention to resign and set up his own business, prospectively in competition. When he didso he attracted business formerly undertaken by the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued <em>inter alia</em> for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Falconer J stated at p. 412:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In my judgment an intention by a director of a company to set up business in competition with the company after his directorshiphas ceased is not to be regarded as a conflicting interest within the context of the principle, having regard to the rules of publicpolicy as to restraint of trade, nor is the taking of any preliminary steps to investigate or forward that intention so long as thereis no actual competitive activity, such as, for instance, competitive tendering or actual trading, while he remains a director."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a> Thus on the facts he found there was no breach.</p>    <p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a> I mention one more case; that of <strong>Kao Lee &amp; Yip</strong> (supra). In a case in which a client made its way from the plaintiff, a firm of solicitors, to the defendant, a former employee,Ma J reviewed the authorities and said at p. 137:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"58. Ultimately, as I have said, the application of the principle depends on the facts and involves matters of degree.</p>        <p class="quote">59. The solicitation of clients in the above context can sometimes pose factual difficulties. The following is a familiar scenario.A partner, employee or other fiduciary intends leaving a firm or employers either to join another firm or to set up on his own incompetition. What steps can he take to solicit clients during the time he is still in partnership or employment with the old firm?Here, the partner or employee needs to tread very carefully:</p>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">(1)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%" class="quote">Solicitation as such when he is still working for the old firm or employers is not permitted: see <em>Wessex Dairies</em>.

Furthermore, that the so-called due diligence meetings which it was said were arranged to enable Messrs Crozer and Kuzmikto obtain verbal references concerning the team and, in particular, its leaders Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns, were in fact a smokescreen; the true intention was to establish beyond the words of Fairbairn and Cairns that the SCB and KPMG work would transfer across.Finally that the interfirm memos of White &amp; Case established that the soliciting, so-called, was a success.</p>    <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a> The defence case is not to deny that Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns told clients about their intention to leave Deacons. It is contendedthat there is nothing wrong with this, particularly where there is a close working relationship between client and partner/employee,as long as during the actual currency of his partnership/employment he does not actually compete. There is no evidence of solicitationand the spokesmen for the clients expressly denied there was. Furthermore, there is nothing wrong with a client choosing to remainloyal to an individual rather than the firm he is a partner of or employed by; the fact that such a choice is made is not itselfevidence of improper canvassing. The due diligence meetings were undertaken for the purpose of getting references of Messrs Fairbairnand Cairns from professionals closely involved with them but independent of them.</p>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a> Before I deal with this issue it is necessary for completeness to go to the evidence not already referred to.</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a> Mr Crozer said of the due diligence meeting he attended with Mr Williams of SCB that it was for the purpose of obtaining "referencechecks from people with whom Mark Fairbairn and his team worked". He said Mr Williams told him without prompting that he would continueto instruct them. Mr Kuzmik who attended the meeting with Messrs Brough and Jamieson of KPMG stated in his witness statement thatthere was no discussion of existing matters on which KPMG had instructed Deacons. But he made no reference to a subsequent transferof allegiance. And he made no mention of the meeting being for the purpose of obtaining personal references of the candidates, northat they were in attendance.</p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a> Mr Fairbairn in his witness statement said of client contact:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"During the period in which we were discussing matters with White &amp; Case, I raised with Jake Williams and Guy Isherwood of SCBthat myself, Edward, Robin, Neil and Jeremy were considering leaving Deacons. I did this as White &amp; Case had asked us to identify2 key relationships in order that they could conduct a "due diligence" exercise or, put another way, take references from clientsfor whom we had acted.</p>        <p class="quote">...</p>        <p class="quote">A further meeting (arranged, I believe, by Edward) was held over a lunch with Paul Brough and Grant Jamieson, partners of KPMG, atMorton's Grill in Central. The lunch was attended by myself, Edward and John Kuzmik. The discussions were very general although Pauland Grant did indicate that the 5 Individuals were their preferred legal advisers for insolvency and restructuring matters. I shouldagain make clear that the purpose of the meeting was to enable White &amp; Case to conduct its "due diligence" investigations, andat no stage during the lunch did either of Edward, John Kuzmik or myself raise the issue of a transfer of instructions by insolvencyprofessionals at KPMG from Deacons to White &amp; Case."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In his supplementary statement he said on the topic:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I did not request or encourage those clients to transfer current or further work from Deacons. My firm belief is that clients choosewhom they wish to instruct as their solicitors for themselves, based upon what they believe to be in their own best interests."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a> Mr Cairns said the due diligence meetings came about because he and Mr Fairbairn were asked to identify two key clients from whomreferences could be obtained. He said that at the lunch meeting he attended there was no discussion about there being a transferof work by either SCB or KPMG from Deacons to White &amp; Case.</p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a> Mr Brough described himself as head of KPMG's Finance Advisory Services (FAS) Division with emphasis on Corporate Recovery and CorporateFinance. He said he had come to know both Fairbairn and Cairns having worked with them professionally over a number of years. Helearned of their dissatisfaction with Deacons and their decision to leave following the unsatisfactory outcome of Darton's candidacyfor partnership. Whilst they discussed with him generally such matters as which firms they should try for this was in a social context;there was no reference made about the transfer of existing or future KPMG work. Speaking of the due diligence meeting, he said heand his partner Grant Jamieson were invited to a lunch at Morton's. Cairns had told him the purpose was for a reference check, thatthere would be someone from White &amp; Case to ask about himself and Fairbairn. He met John Kuzmik for the first time at the lunch.He said it was generally a casual occasion. Kuzmik asked him "Are these guys any good? If they came to White &amp; Case would yourefer work to them?" He responded that if they continued to get work from SCB they would refer that to Fairbairn and Cairns unlessthere was a conflict. He found it not untoward that Fairbairn and Cairns were present. However, an excerpt from the transcript whenhe was being cross-examined reveals another side:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="2%">                    <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>                </td>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">Q.</td>                <td valign="top" width="83%" class="quote">Did you think it appropriate that Mr Fairbairn and Mr Cairns, who were under fiduciary and other duties of fidelity to Deacons, shouldbe introducing you to a firm of solicitors and inviting you to tell that firm of solicitors whether you would transfer work to them?</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="2%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="83%" class="quote"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="2%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">A.</td>                <td valign="top" width="83%" class="quote">I did not consider it at the time.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="2%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="83%" class="quote"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="2%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">Q.</td>                <td valign="top" width="83%" class="quote">Would you please consider it now, Mr Brough.

One particularfile was known for short as "Leading Spirit". There were difficulties as Deacons, in particular Mr Cole, sought to resist the transfers.But some of the current files were transferred, including Leading Spirit. Others were left behind, amongst them one known as "S.Megga". He concluded as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"At no time prior to their leaving Deacons did Fairbairn and Cairns ever suggest to me that any existing specific cases or any futurepotential cases which FAS either had or might have with Deacons should be transferred to White &amp; Case.

He said he was the group head of Group Special Asset Management of SCB. As such, he was responsiblefor restructuring/workout globally. He came to Hong Kong in 1999 by which time SCB already had a well-established business relationshipwith Deacons' BRI team headed by Fairbairn and Cairns. He said that as a banker involved in restructuring he adhered firmly to theview that when selecting professional advisers one picks individual lawyers in whom one has confidence rather than firms, a viewshared by other senior personnel at SCB. He said he came to meet Fairbairn and Cairns regularly, mostly on a professional basis.Sometimes there were social events. He was unable to say when he became aware that they were preparing to join White &amp; Case.He does not state how he came to know. He said there was a meeting arranged for 29 April 2002 at which along with Guy Isherwood hemet for the first time George Crozer. Crozer asked what he thought of Fairbairn and Cairns and if he would use them again as lawyersand he said that he thought they were good lawyers, easy to get on with and "Yes he would".</p>    <p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a> He came to hear of the resignations of June 2002. Of what happened thereafter, I repeat verbatim the concluding paragraphs of hisstatement:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"18. There then ensued a dialogue between Keith Cole of Deacons on the one side and me on the other. The dialogue was in telephoneconversations and two meetings. Isherwood accompanied me to the two meetings. At one of the meetings, Mark Roberts of Deacons wasalso present.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">19. My position was simple. As the client, I wanted consistency and reliability of legal service. It was for me to decide which lawyershould handle SCB files. I told Keith Cole that SCB's position was that if Fairbairn and the other departing lawyers were to be takenoff cases, SCB wanted input into the identity of the lawyers who would take over.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">20. These discussions took place over a period of three weeks or a month. I would characterise the discussions as being frank andearnest.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">21. The upshot of the discussions was that those cases which were not considered to be at a critical stage stayed with Deacons afterSCB was satisfied as to the identity of the individual who would take over the case. In one case, involving the restructuring ofa public company, Leading Spirit, matters were at a critical stage. Cairns had worked on this file for over two years and I did notthink it possible someone else could replace him. With considerable reluctance and after much heated discussion, Deacons agreed thismatter could be passed to White &amp; Case and that Cairns could continue to work on it.</p>        <p class="quote">22. Other than this case, I believe the majority of SCB's cases remained with Deacons. In terms of new work, SCB retains its previouscriteria i.e. it selects those individual lawyers whom it considers best qualified to deal with the case. Deacons, still, however,remain on SCB's restructuring panel of law firms.</p>        <p class="quote">23. At no time prior to their leaving Deacons did Fairbairn or Cairns ever suggest to me that any existing specific cases or any futurepotential cases which SCB either had or might have with Deacons should be transferred to White &amp; Case.

It is apparent from the evidence of Messrs Brough and Williams that neither regards KPMGor SCB as having been solicited in the sense of having been canvassed or coerced or pursued or persuaded to transfer their allegianceto White &amp; Case; indeed Mr Williams has taken offence that he could be bought by a good lunch. I accept what they say. Theseare professional men with professional attitudes looking to do the best by the institutions they represent. That said, I am satisfiedthat in the context of the allegation that Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns face under this head, the expression soliciting has a widerconnotation than its contractual counterpart in the non-solicitation provision of the Confidentiality Agreement between Deacons andWhite &amp; Case; see that part of Ma J's judgment extracted from <strong>Kao Lee and Yip</strong> (supra) at paragraph 153. What is apparent from the documents that emerged on discovery and, in particular, the Business Plan, theseries of emails between Fairbairn and Crozer and Kuzmik and those internally amongst the partners of White &amp; Case, is that itwas an essential ingredient that the BRI team bring with them key clients. I need refer only to Wall's memo to his partners in NewYork of 2 April (paragraph 38):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... One of the key issues to consider in assessing this initiative is whether Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns can retain Standard Charteredas a client if they leave Deacons because Standard Chartered is reportedly one of the two principal players in the bankruptcy andrestructuring business in Hong Kong ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a> This was recognized by Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns at least by the date the Business Plan was prepared and sent - one only needsto refer back to the contents thereof under the heading "Opportunities for White &amp; Case" (paragraph 27).</p>    <p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a> Mr Williams in his statement stated he was unable to remember when he became aware of the proposed move. The sequence of emails andmemoranda of 1 March, 6 March and 16 March (paragraphs 33 and 34) would indicate a direct approach on the Tuesday following 1 March.That was 5 March. Fairbairn had in his diary for the day: "12:30 - 14:50 lunch with Jake Williams and Guy I". It is difficult tocome to an alternative conclusion than that it was intended to gain SCB's assurance that instructions would continue to be forthcoming;the memo about a green light is to my mind very conclusive on this point, indicating of course a successful outcome. That Fairbairncharged the lunch to Deacons describing it as client entertainment was to be the source of some discomfort to him when Mr McGregortackled him about it in cross-examination; for good reason.</p>    <p><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a> The so-called due diligence meeting as between Messrs Crozer on the one hand and Messrs Williams and Isherwood was in April followingthe interviews in New York. Whilst it is the defence case that this was to assess the worth of Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns and nomore than that, it is again hard to conclude that there was no reference to the transfer of business; the extract from Mr Crozer'sdocument of 29 April "Business Discovery and Insolvency Practice" (at paragraph 44) herein suggests it was a key issue. Mr Isherwoodwas not called to give a counter version. The due diligence meeting attended by Messrs Kuzmik, Brough, Jamieson, Fairbairn and Cairnsis also held out to be for the purpose of assessing the personal worth of Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns. But Mr Crozer's document andthe extract at paragraph 44 reveals what I believe was a key issue to be established from the horses' mouths "the transfer of businessmatters".</p>    <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a> This summary and sequence of events satisfies me that there was an ongoing, concerted exercise by Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns tosolicit for White &amp; Case the transfer of client loyalty from Deacons, amounting to another breach of the core duty of good faithand fidelity owed Deacons.</p>    <p class="heading">The Strategy and Action List 38I(d)</p>    <p><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a> This is an allegation against Mr Fairbairn alone as the author of the document. The claim is that those proposals under the sub-heading"Tactical Considerations" numbers 5 and 9 (reproduced at paragraph 48) are in breach of his core duties of fidelity and loyalty.The pleaded defence is to admit the content of the document but to deny that the proposals amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty.It was submitted that there is nothing wrong with the devising of a strategy for the negotiation by a partner of his exit from thepartnership and others who might wish to do likewise. There is nothing wrong in exerting pressure to achieve appropriate objectives,provided the pressure is not unlawful. There is nothing unlawful about the content of the document.</p>    <p><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a> I have to say that I do not agree.</p>    <p><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a> The clauses have to be read in the light of the content of the remainder of the Strategy and Action List and the preceding exhibit(the Business Transition Document). It is apparent that the pressure sought to be brought was to accelerate the entry into White&amp; Case of all the BRI team members ahead of their contractual notice periods and unencumbered by restrictive covenants. Thesetactics spelt out in paragraph 6 of the Business Transition Document (see paragraph 45) make this patently clear. The tactic wasdesigned to put pressure on Deacons to release the BRI team members, to Deacons' direct detriment. I find this pressure to be improperand another breach by Mr Fairbairn of his duty of fidelity and good faith.</p>    <p class="heading">The Core Element Document 38I(e)</p>    <p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a> The complaint about this document is that it contains material confidential to Deacons and should not have been disclosed to White&amp; Case. The material complained of is the identity of Deacons' clients, the nature of work carried out for those clients andthe expectation of referral work from those clients in other areas of law. The allegation of breach of the duty of fidelity is againstthe author Mr Fairbairn.</p>    <p><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a> The defence is to admit the content but to deny liability.</p>    <p><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a> My view is that the document does not offend the obligation of confidentiality taken as to its parts and the sum of its parts. Thatwhich is complained of is as I find readily available in the public domain or is promotional puff about which Deacons has no groundsfor complaint. There is as I find no breach.</p>    <p class="heading">The Referrals - 38I(f)(g) and (h)</p>    <p><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a> These have a common theme; I shall deal with them together.</p>    <p><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a> The first is that by the emails on 26 March 2002 (referred to in paragraphs 36 and 37) Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns revealed thatthey had improperly referred work not to Deacons' affiliate in Bangkok but to a competitor; the second is that by the email of 1May (referred to in paragraph 52) Mr Fairbairn was seen to refer a client of Deacons with need of legal assistance to White &amp;Case instead of to a firm having no presence in Asia; the third was that by the email of 23 May at paragraph 53 Mr Fairbairn referredor facilitated the introduction of new business from Mr Brough of KPMG to White &amp; Case HK instead of to Deacons.</p>    <p><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a> The pleaded defence to each of these claims is as to the first: Mr Kunz was looking for a lawyer with particular skills beyond thoseof the members of the firm affiliated to Deacons in Bangkok. Moreover Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns believed the firms were and arefinancially independent, with no obligation owed by one to the other to share work; as to the second: Deacons has no presence inLos Angeles. There was no obligation to refer the work to a firm not having an Asian presence. No instructions were forthcoming;and the third: no instructions were forthcoming.</p>    <p><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a> I come now to evidence on the matters.</p>    <p><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a> Mr Cairns from the witness box said Mike Kunz of Rolls-Royce was a personal friend. He needed legal assistance in a specialized fieldideally having lender expertise and credibility with international banks. Neither Kunz nor Rolls-Royce were clients of Deacons. Hedid not believe the affiliate in Bangkok had that expertise. Indeed he had had an unfortunate experience when working for his previousemployer Peregrine; he had had cause to instruct Deacons Bangkok and had been let down. And he said he did not recommend White &amp;Case but suggested a call. He knew of no one else suitable who practised in Bangkok. He went on to say that it was his understandingWhite &amp; Case were instructed but the project has fizzled; there have been fees earned in the region of US$24,000 with not muchprospect of matters proceeding further.</p>    <p><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a> Mr Roberts stated there is no Deacons office or affiliate in Los Angeles. But there is an informal arrangement in place that referralsare made to those firms likely to reciprocate with instructions in the future. (I am unable to find evidence to support the defencethat no instructions were forthcoming, but there was no denial to that in the plaintiff's reply. I accept there were no instructions).</p>    <p><a name="p181" class="para" id="p181">181.</a> Mr Brough from the witness box said that the so-called "rubber matter" was not a referral at all but a request by him direct to MrKuzmik. Mr Fairbairn did not participate in anyway. In the event nothing came of the matter; no fees were derived.</p>    <p><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a> It seems to me as I find that the referral of Mr Kunz to White &amp; Case was not in breach of a duty owed to Deacons. Deacons hasno direct presence in Bangkok. There was nothing before me to indicate that there is a financial link with the affiliate in Bangkok.Mr Cairns' motives to direct Kunz to White &amp; Case may have been questionable but nothing adverse has been established. Therewas no significant challenge to his explanation as to why he chose not to contact the affiliate and why he chose White &amp; Case.</p>    <p><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a> I come to the same conclusion concerning the referral in Los Angeles. Deacons has no presence there and no affiliate or other connectedfirm. That the firm referred to has a base in this part of the world is neither here nor there.</p>    <p><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a> In respect of the third so-called referral; there was in fact no referral at all. I accept Mr Brough's account that he solicitedWhite &amp; Case for his own reasons without intervention by Mr Fairbairn. It is understandable that Fairbairn's email was capableof raising a suspicion. However it was ill-advised for the partner of Deacons to be hustling a partner in another local firm concerningprospective new business for that firm. It does indicate his mindset at the time.</p>    <p><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a> For the reasons given I find no breach of duty proved under these heads.</p>    <p class="heading">Post Resignation Conduct 38IA</p>    <p><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a> There are five allegations under this head, against both Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns, of activity post 11 June 2002. The pleadeddefence to all is one of general denial. I shall deal with all in turn.</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Mr Fairbairn's email to Miss Sawyer of 12 June</p>    <p><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a> That which offends are the extracts reproduced at paragraph 55 herein, and are self-explanatory. The defence to this is that whateverFairbairn proposed there was no press release until February 2003, some eight months later. There was no mention of Standard CharteredBank. And there was no discussion as between Mr Crozer and Deacons. So both suggestions of Mr Fairbairn came to nothing.</p>    <p><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a> The fact that nothing came of Mr Fairbairn's proposal does not of itself amount to a defence; that goes to the level of relief only.It was, as I find, conduct which should not have been undertaken by Fairbairn. He was of course still a partner of Deacons and obligatedto protect its client base notwithstanding his pending departure. He is in breach under this head. There is however nothing to supportthe contention that Mr Cairns was involved; the allegation fails as against him.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Mr Fairbairn's email to Miss Sawyer of 13 June</p>    <p><a name="p189" class="para" id="p189">189.</a> The passage complained of is paragraph 5 reproduced at paragraph 56 herein. The claim is that from use of the words 'we cannot, atthis stage, be <em>seen</em> to actively market our clients through White &amp; Case' can be drawn the inference that both Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns were doingjust that covertly. The defence's riposte is that there is no or no sufficient basis for such an inference.</p>    <p><a name="p190" class="para" id="p190">190.</a> I agree. Pleaded as an independent ground, the words do no more than indicate what must be seen to be happening. There is nothingto suggest that covert activity is to be pursued with sinister intent. There is nothing before me to establish that there is breachunder this head. However on the subject of this email, it is worthy of note from the remaining extracts reproduced that Mr Fairbairnwas aware of his status in Deacons, and that his core fiduciary duties owed to Deacons were an ongoing obligation.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) WorldCom in Asia</p>    <p><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a> This concerns an allegation that in or about July 2002 Mr Fairbairn notified White &amp; Case that he had been recommended to bethe Asian financial adviser in the restructuring proposed in nine jurisdictions in Asia. The allegation is that there is an inferenceto be drawn that he did so in order to shift new business from Deacons to White &amp; Case.</p>    <p><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a> I am unable to find any evidence adduced in support of this ground; it fails against both Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns.</p>    <p class="heading">(4) Email exchanges between Messrs Crozer and Fairbairn between 3 August and 6 August 2002</p>    <p><a name="p193" class="para" id="p193">193.</a> This concerns the exchanges reproduced in paragraphs 58 and 59 herein, the complaint being that Mr Fairbairn was making suggestionson how White &amp; Case should demonstrate their ability to service SCB. The defence is two-fold; whether or not the making of suggestionsamounted to a breach of fiduciary duty is wholly academic, it being for SCB to decide whom it instructs; further, no one was flownin the suggestions came to nothing.</p>    <p><a name="p194" class="para" id="p194">194.</a> In my view these emails give rise to a breach and, indeed, a blatant breach, of Fairbairn's obligation owed Deacons, paying scantregard to his perceptions of what these were in his email to Miss Sawyer. The opening email reveals that Fairbairn shared with Crozerthe content of Isherwood's email to Cole. Then he made comments about the application of useful pressure; this was advice given tofacilitate the transfer of SCB files from Deacons to White &amp; Case. It was put to Mr Fairbairn in cross-examination that thiswas grossly improper conduct. His reply was to disagree. But there was a certain contriteness in his responses. He gave his reason</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It was to update Mr Crozer precisely on what the situation was. With hindsight, perhaps I should not have done it. But at the timeI thought that was the easiest way to give him a full favour of the situation.</p>        <p class="quote">...</p>        <p class="quote">With hindsight, I regret that I actually forwarded the email.</p>        <p class="quote">...</p>        <p class="quote">I was certainly giving him information which, with hindsight, I should not have given him, yes."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p195" class="para" id="p195">195.</a> Fairbairn went on to try to justify his conduct by stating:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"As I said I was seeking to look after the interests of clients, looking after a client that has been very close to me over a longperiod of time, and yes, with the benefit of hindsight, it was probably improper."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p196" class="para" id="p196">196.</a> He was taken to clause 5 of the Deacons partnership agreement (paragraph 13 herein) and the question was asked:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="2%">                    <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>                </td>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">Q.</td>                <td valign="top" width="82%" class="quote">And you were in breach of that covenant and you knew it?</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="2%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="87%" class="quote">He answered:</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="2%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="82%" class="quote"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="2%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">A.</td>                <td valign="top" width="82%" class="quote">I did not know it at the time, but I think with hindsight, as I stated earlier this morning, I probably fell short of the requirementsof that provision, yes."</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="2%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="82%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="2%"></td>                <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="87%">[Day 24 Pages 15-27]</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p197" class="para" id="p197">197.</a> In one of his responses at it reads Mr Fairbairn sought to justify his conduct in the client's interest. This has been a common themein the defences put forward to the allegations of breach of core fiduciary duties. This is not a valid defence. By and large clientsmay pick and choose who is to represent them. But this is not an absolute right. They may not if that will amount to a conflict ofinterest and there may be other restraints. And until they shift their allegiance they are a client of the firm they are with towhom the allegiance by the individual partners is owed. A closeness so-called of a relationship as between the client and a partnerdoes not diminish the partner's obligation to his firm or permit a transfer of the loyalty owed. The Privy Council in <strong>Bridge &amp; Deacons</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20AC%20705" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] AC 705</a> dealt with the point. Lord Fraser of Tullybelton, delivering the judgment, said at p. 720:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It must be remembered that the clients are clients of the firm rather than of an individual partner."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>There is a commercial reason for this. A firm may have value in its fixtures and fittings, lease, debtors' ledger, work in progressand so on. But its real worth is measured in its client base; without clients there can be no income; no goodwill. New partners arrivingand old ones retiring are in turn buying into and selling out of a share of that goodwill.</p>    <p><a name="p198" class="para" id="p198">198.</a> Mr McGregor in his closing submissions described Fairbairn's conduct as '...a gross and inexcusable breach of the duty of loyalty'.Strong words, but ones I choose to adopt in the circumstances. The fact that no one was 'flown in' is neither here nor there.</p>    <p><a name="p199" class="para" id="p199">199.</a> There is no evidence implicating Mr Cairns; he is not liable under this head.</p>    <p class="heading">(5) The Procuring of Standard Chartered Bank to instruct Mr McDonald</p>    <p><a name="p200" class="para" id="p200">200.</a> The allegation under this head is that whilst Mr McDonald was still an employee of Deacons Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns procured SCBto instruct Mr McDonald on new business immediately after his departure from Deacons and arrival at White &amp; Case. Particularsof this allegation are pleaded. In summary, I am invited to draw inference of improper conduct by them from the contents of the emailswhich reveal active participation by them in developing a relationship between White &amp; Case and SCB; the fact that McDonald wasspecifically referred to in the 4 August email (see paragraph 59); the fact that McDonald not having worked for SCB was not boundby a restrictive covenant; that Mr Crozer made reference to McDonald arriving with new SCB instructions in his email to Wall of 8August (see paragraph 61), before McDonald's departure from Deacons.</p>    <p><a name="p201" class="para" id="p201">201.</a> The defence position is that Mr Isherwood of SCB alluded to the prospect of instructions to Mr McDonald in a social environment,without involvement or participation by either of Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns. Actual instructions were not forthcoming until afterhis departure from Deacons and arrival at White &amp; Case.</p>    <p><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a> In evidence Mr McDonald confirmed that this was how he came to be instructed and the timing. He said the file was known as the PressureVessels file, was a short matter earning fees for his new employer of $610,000. Mr Fairbairn in cross-examination said he knew thatsomething was pending but refused to concede that he played any part.</p>    <p><a name="p203" class="para" id="p203">203.</a> That being the evidence I am unable to conclude that Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns or either of them played any part in White &amp;Case getting instructions or that they or either of them acted improperly under this head; both are not liable accordingly.</p>    <p><a name="p204" class="para" id="p204">204.</a> I come now to the claims founded in tort.</p>    <p class="heading">The Tortious Claims</p>    <p><a name="p205" class="para" id="p205">205.</a> There are three. The first, against both of the White &amp; Case defendants, is that they induced, procured, encouraged or facilitatedMessrs Fairbairn and Cairns in breaching their equitable or contractual obligations owed Deacons with knowledge of those obligationsand with the intention of inducing, procuring or encouraging such breach whereby Deacons has suffered loss. That is a claim foundedin direct action by the defendants in question. The second is also against White &amp; Case; the acquisition by White &amp; CaseHK by unlawful means of clients of Deacons founded in unlawful interference with Deacons' business. That is a tort involving indirectunlawful interference. The third is against all four defendants. It is founded in the defendants having entered into a common designto acquire business from Deacons by unlawful means.

The requirement of actual knowledge has been extended to incorporate the tortfeasor 'turning a blind eye' and failingto take the elementary step of establishing what the terms of a contract are; see <strong>Emerald Construction Co. Ltd v Lowthian and Ors</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%201%20All%20ER%201013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 1 All ER 1013.</a></p>    <p><a name="p211" class="para" id="p211">211.</a> I am not satisfied that it has been made out that White &amp; Case in either form induced Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns to break theircontracts in respect of the recruitment of themselves and the other team members. I have already found as a fact that the approachcame from Fairbairn and Cairns and not the other way round. Nor do I find that Mr Crozer or anyone else representing White &amp;Case induced Mr Fairbairn to produce confidential information as per the Business Plan. It is not in dispute that he did call fordetail to support the recruitment of the candidates on commercial grounds; the fact that the information supplied was confidentialas I have found does not implicate the recipient. That Mr Crozer used that material by incorporating it into his memorandum to 'sell'the recruitment to New York does not go to the tort of inducement whatever other wrong may flow from this of which more later.</p>    <p><a name="p212" class="para" id="p212">212.</a> However, under the ground of encouraging Fairbairn and Cairns to contact clients to secure their agreement to transfer instructionsI find a case clearly made out. It was made abundantly clear, and passed on to Fairbairn and Cairns, that the transportability ofclient business was the sine qua non of a successful outcome; in particular clients such as SCB and KPMG; see Wall's memo of 2 April2002 at paragraph 38. Messrs Crozer and Kuzmik actively pursued this. The participants at the meetings that Messrs Crozer and Kuzmikhad with, respectively, Messrs Williams and Isherwood of SCB and Messrs Brough and Jamieson of KPMG consistently denied that theywere called for any other reason than to establish the credentials of Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns. But I am satisfied that thosemeetings, set up by Fairbairn and Cairns, euphemistically called 'due diligence', were not for the purpose of obtaining referencesof Fairbairn and Cairns. Whoever heard of a referee giving his views of a candidate in his presence? White &amp; Case were, as Ifind, not so much concerned about their suitability for partnership but to establish whether they were going to be supported by theseclients. They had had such assurance from the candidates but not from the clients themselves. My finding as to the true purport ofthe meetings is I believe endorsed by Crozer's memorandum to Wall of 29 April and that part of it, under the heading 'Due Diligence',that I have mentioned at paragraph 44 herein. Although he does state at the outset that they received confirmation that the Fairbairnand Cairns team are 'well known in the field in Hong Kong' he makes no reference to their personal attributes or suitability forpartnership as one would expect from a referee. Rather he goes in some length to promote the prospect of their attracting new businessfrom Deacons' key clients to White &amp; Case. There are two further, documented, indications of the support White &amp; Case cameto provide under this head. The first is the adoption, by Mr Crozer, of the Strategy and Action List and Business Transition Documentexhibited to his 29 April memorandum and his recommendation that they be utilized as 'the greater likelihood of avoiding disruptionin our access to the team's clients'; (see paragraph 44). Of course, not the team's clients; Deacons' clients. The second is theactive role displayed by Crozer in the exchange of emails with Fairbairn of early August at paragraphs 58 and 59.</p>    <p><a name="p213" class="para" id="p213">213.</a> There remains the ingredient of loss.</p>    <p><a name="p214" class="para" id="p214">214.</a> Beyond question there has been loss suffered by Deacons as a direct result of this unlawful activity. Mr Cole gave evidence thatclients have left. Turnover and profits are down. This is not challenged.</p>    <p><a name="p215" class="para" id="p215">215.</a> Thus all the ingredients of the tort under this head have been made out.</p>    <p class="heading">Unlawful Interference</p>    <p><a name="p216" class="para" id="p216">216.</a> In its pleadings, Deacons relies on the Business Plan, the memorandum of 16 March 2002 Crozer to Wall, the Business Transition Documentand the memorandum of 29 April 2002 Crozer to Wall.</p>    <p><a name="p217" class="para" id="p217">217.</a> There is a general denial pleaded by the defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p218" class="para" id="p218">218.</a> Both counsel in their addresses reproduced an excerpt from the judgment of Jenkins LJ in <strong>D C Thomson v Co.

I have already found as a fact that the Business Plan havingbeen delivered to White &amp; Case to promote the recruitment of those who compiled it is a breach of confidence. White &amp; CaseHK used the confidential material to compile the 16 March memorandum to White &amp; Case LLP. The memorandum spelt out a 'uniqueopportunity to acquire an established top tier practice at partner level' with reference to a prospective move of clients of Deacons.The 29 April memorandum and Business Transition Document reflected the way forward devised by Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns and acceptedby White &amp; Case as a means of acquiring a client base to the benefit of White &amp; Case. That there would be ultimate damageto Deacons is not only a necessary consequence of that but is in fact contemplated under Tactical Considerations (paragraph 48).</p>    <p><a name="p223" class="para" id="p223">223.</a> In his submission on this claim Mr McGregor submitted no clearer case could be made out of unlawful acts aimed at Deacons since thewhole purpose of the disclosure and use of the material was to recruit a team from Deacons with the object that there would be businessforthcoming from Deacons' clients. I agree. And that is what happened. I find that there has been loss suffered, and thus that allthe ingredients to establish this tort have been made out.</p>    <p class="heading">Common Design</p>    <p><a name="p224" class="para" id="p224">224.</a> This is founded on the basis that all four defendants were engaged in a joint enterprise to acquire business from Deacons by unlawfulmeans. It is not a discrete claim but one brought to spread the liability around all members of the joint enterprise.</p>    <p><a name="p225" class="para" id="p225">225.</a> The classic definition of the concept was spelt out by Scrutton LJ in the <strong>Koursk</strong> [1924] 140 at p. 155:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Certain classes of persons seem clearly to be "joint tortfeasors": The agent who commits a tort within the scope of his employmentfor his principal, and the principal; the servant who commits a tort in the course of his employment, and his master; two personswho agree on common action, in the course of, and to further which, one of them commits a tort. These seem clearly joint tortfeasors;there is one tort committed by one of them on behalf of, or in concert with another."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p226" class="para" id="p226">226.</a> Such a claim as this is very much fact driven as to whether it can be made out. In this case I believe it cannot. Each of the defendantshas been targeted in various causes of action, some together others separately. This is not about a series of wrongs alleged againstan active participant found, on the evidence, to have been acting on instructions by another or others in a jointly concocted illicitplan, who might but for the tort of common design escape liability. As recognized this is not a separate claim. I make no findingor ruling upon it.</p>    <p><a name="p227" class="para" id="p227">227.</a> I come next to the relief sought.</p>    <p class="heading">Relief</p>    <p><a name="p228" class="para" id="p228">228.</a> By order of 29 October 2002 Ma J (as he then was) gave directions as to trial.

He had said in evidence in that matter that the loss of business caused by a transfer of clientele might last 'one to fouryears'. Before me he adjusted this estimate; 'it certainly could be up to the duration of a year, but it is not four years'.</p>    <p><a name="p238" class="para" id="p238">238.</a> Mr McGregor submitted that his earlier, unguarded estimate was more appropriate; but I should take a conservative median, say twoyears, and injunct White &amp; Case as asked for, for that period, from either the date of the resignation of the BRI team (11 June2002) the date of the White &amp; Case undertaking to the court (10 September 2002) or the date of this judgment. However, the injunctionis not sought to attach to existing work presently being undertaken, a course which it is accepted would be contrary to the interestsof the clients. Thus it is intended to bite only on new work and only on the five Deacons' former members serving former clientsof Deacons.</p>    <p><a name="p239" class="para" id="p239">239.</a> I heard evidence on the issue of the alleged breach of the undertaking. Disclosed during the trial were time sheets which revealedthat Messrs Leifer and Darton had, during the currency of their restrictive covenants, undoubtedly spent time on the S K Global filewhich, as I have said, was one of those which, mid-transaction, moved from Deacons to White &amp; Case HK. The client was said tobe SCB; thus on the face of it there were breaches. But evidence was adduced in defence that the client so-called was in fact a steeringcommittee representing a conglomerate of banks of which SCB was a member. I was told that legal advice was sought and given, to theeffect that White &amp; Case HK representing the committee did not amount to their representing SCB. I have to say I find this anextraordinary conclusion. It is apparent to me and, I should have thought, with respect to those said to have formed a contrary view,to all who had to consider it, that SCB was and remained a client as long as it was represented on the committee which after allhas no separate legal status.</p>    <p><a name="p240" class="para" id="p240">240.</a> This was, thus, another cavalier approach by White &amp; Case to its obligations to comply with the law.</p>    <p><a name="p241" class="para" id="p241">241.</a> That said, I do not believe it is appropriate to grant the injunction asked for, not because it is without merit, but because ofthe timing. One of the principles of this sort of relief, known as springboard relief, is that the victim may not be placed in abetter position then it would otherwise be entitled to; see <strong>Universal Thermosensors Ltd v Hibben</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20WLR%20840" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 WLR 840.</a> So, it is important to get right the length of the restraint. As to what that should be, Mr McGregor made use of Mr Fairbairn's calculation.But on what basis did he come to that? And it was, to say the least, a wide spread. I do find that Deacons has made out a case, subject,I think, to a more conservative time frame being imposed. I find 2 years is too long; by how much is not material, for the followingreason. I believe the appropriate starting point should be the date of resignation of the recruits; 11 June 2002. By the time thisjudgment sees the light of day 16 months will have passed. An injunction with less than 8 months to run would seem to achieve nomore than be upsetting and would, I believe, be contrary to the public interest and, as I have said, I find a total of 2 years istoo long.</p>    <p><a name="p242" class="para" id="p242">242.</a> In the circumstances and for these reasons I do not grant the injunction sought.</p>    <p class="heading">Exemplary Damages 45A, 45B, 50</p>    <p><a name="p243" class="para" id="p243">243.</a> Claims for exemplary damages having been made in the above prayers, it is necessary for me to rule on whether the award when madeout should be enhanced under this head; see <strong>CondÃ©Nast Publication Limited v MGN Limited</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20FSR%20427" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] FSR 427.</a></p>    <p><a name="p244" class="para" id="p244">244.</a> It is pleaded:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"Liability of the Defendants for exemplary damages</em></p>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">38R.</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%" class="quote">With respect to the matters complained of herein the First to Fourth Defendants and each of them have acted with a cynical disregardof the rights of the Plaintiff and in the hope and expectation that in the event of the Plaintiff discovering the extent of theirwrongdoing that the profits that they would make would exceed any damages that they might be required to pay to the Plaintiff."</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>And the pleadings continue to the effect that Deacons relies on the Strategy and Action List, the Business Transition Document, the29 April 2002 memorandum, the email of 13 June 2002 Fairbairn to Miss Sawyer (paragraph 56) and that employees of Deacons were beinginduced to leave and join a competitor.</p>    <p><a name="p245" class="para" id="p245">245.</a> There is a general denial by all defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p246" class="para" id="p246">246.</a> Rookes v Barnard  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 1129</a> is a House of Lords case which categorized circumstances when it may be appropriate for an award of exemplary damages to be made.Lord Devlin said at p. 1226 such an award is permissible where:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The defendant's conduct has been calculated by him to make a profit for himself which may well exceed the compensation payable tothe plaintiff."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This has come to be referred to as Lord Devlin's second category.

Lord Slynn said that it is the behaviour giving riseto the wrong found to have been committed rather than the cause of action which has to be looked at to decide whether the facts fallinto one or other of the prescribed categories. Lord Nicholls said at p. 144:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...The availability of exemplary damages has played a significant role in buttressing civil liberties, in claims for false imprisonmentand wrongful arrest. From time to time cases do arise where awards of compensatory damages are perceived as inadequate to achievea just result between the parties. The nature of the defendant's conduct calls for a further response from the courts. On occasionconscious wrongdoing by a defendant is so outrageous, his disregard of the plaintiff's rights so contumelious, that something moreis needed to show that the law will not tolerate such behaviour. Without an award of exemplary damages, justice will not have beendone. Exemplary damages, as a remedy of last resort, fill what otherwise would be a regrettable lacuna.</p>        <p class="quote">...</p>        <p class="quote">Nor, I may add, am I wholly persuaded by Lord Devlin's formulation of his second category (wrongful conduct expected to yield a benefitin excess of any compensatory award likely to be made). The law of unjust enrichment has developed apace in recent years. In so faras there may be a need to go further, the key here would seem to be the same as that already discussed: outrageous conduct on thepart of the defendant. There is no obvious reason why, if exemplary damages are to be available, the profit motive should sufficebut a malicious motive should not.</p>        <p class="quote">As I have said, difficult questions arise here. In view of the limited scope of the submissions made by the parties on this appeal,this is not the occasion for attempting to state comprehensive conclusions on these matters. For the purposes of the present appealit is sufficient, first, to express the view that the House should now depart from its decision in <em>Broome v Cassell Co. Ltd</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%201027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 1027</a>, in so far as that decision confirmed the continuing existence of what has subsequently been described as the "cause of action" conditionand, secondly, to note that the essence of the conduct constituting the court's discretionary jurisdiction to award exemplary damagesis conduct which was an outrageous disregard of the plaintiff's rights."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p247" class="para" id="p247">247.</a> Lord Scott, at p. 154, expressed reservations about awarding exemplary damages at all:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" My Lords, the function of an award of damages in our civil justice system is to compensate the claimant for a wrong done to him.The wrong may consist of a breach of contract, or a tort, or an interference with some right of the claimant under public law. Butwhatever the wrong may consist of the award of damages should be compensatory in its intent. Measured by this fundamental principleof damages, an award of exemplary damages, the intention of which is not to compensate the victim of a wrong but to punish its perpetrator,is an anomaly.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Thus far I have been considering some of the general issues that are prompted by the present appeal. For the reasons I have outlined,I would be receptive to a submission that exemplary damages awards should no longer be available in civil proceedings. However, MrMansfield, counsel for the defendant, has not made that submission and, having had the advantage of reading the texts of my nobleand learned friends' speeches on this appeal, it is apparent that mine is a minority view."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p248" class="para" id="p248">248.</a> So it is apparent from these extracts that the law on exemplary damages has moved on from the views expressed by Lord Devlin nearly40 years ago; that it is the conduct giving rise to the breach and not the cause of action that is significant, and that that conductmust be so outrageous with so contumelious a disregard of the plaintiff's rights that nothing less than an award of exemplary damagewould achieve justice.</p>    <p><a name="p249" class="para" id="p249">249.</a> Finally I quote from the case <strong>British Midland Tool Limited v Midland International Tooling Limited</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%20All%20ER%20174" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] All ER 174.</a> Hart J concluded his judgment with the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Exemplary damages</p>        <p class="quote">249. The claimant seeks exemplary damages on the ground that the conduct by the defendants has been calculated by them to make a profitwhich may well exceed the compensation payable to BMT (the plaintiff) referring me to the following passages in the judgment of LordNicholls of Birkenhead delivering the majority judgment of the Privy Council in <em>A v Bottrill</em>,  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/2002/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] UKPC 44</a>, 6th September 2002.</p>        <p class="quote">"...in the nature of things, cases satisfying the test of outrageousness will usually involve intentional wrongdoing with additionally,an element of flagrancy or cynicism or oppression or the like: something additional rendering the wrongdoing or the manner or circumstancesin which it was committed particularly appalling. It is these features which make the Defendant's conduct outrageous...[para 23]"</p>        <p class="quote">"it is not surprising therefore that when describing conduct meet for an award of exemplary damages judges have often used adjectivesor phrases primarily, or even solely, aimed at advertent conduct. These include: malicious, vindictive, high handed, wanton, wilful,arrogant, cynical, oppressive, and contumelious disregard of the plaintiffs rights. [para 25]"</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>250. Interesting though the discussion in that case is, I am not clear what it has to do with this one. The issue there was the extentto which in the law of New Zealand there is jurisdiction to award exemplary damages in cases of non-intentional wrongdoing. In myjudgment the conduct of the defendants in this case which I have found to be unlawful does not meet the necessary criterion, howeverit be expressed. The Tamworth 4 did not execute their plan in the belief that it would result in a greater profit for themselvesthan the compensation payable to the claimant. Their principal motive was to be able to work for themselves rather than the AllenGroup. Had MIT (the defendant) in fact made profits which exceeded the compensation payable to the claimant, there would have beennothing, given the nature of causes of action relied on, to stop the claimant from claiming an account of those profits. The claimfor exemplary damages has plainly been conceived in a punitive spirit. If the adjectives "vindictive" and "oppressive" fit anythingin this case they fit best this head of claim. I do not think that it is justified."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p250" class="para" id="p250">250.</a> Mr McGregor took me to conduct which in his submission should give rise to the punitive award sought. That which is most compellingto his cause is the concentration of effort in March and April to ensure client loyalty to the team, being the emails, meetings,discussions, lunches; the Due Diligence; then the direction to Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns to propose how this was all to take place,from which emerged the Business Transition Document and the Strategy and Action List, and the adoption of these documents as 'theway forward'. Clause 4 under 'Tactical Considerations' (see paragraph 48) states 'Deacons could assert claims against MGF with respectto breach of fiduciary duties while a partner'. This identifies a breach, the only query being whether Deacons would sue. And atclause 11:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If MGF and others leave together, Deacons may have a claim against MGF for not reporting the intentions of the others earlier. Query;what financial damage could Deacons claim?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Thus is identified another breach, the query being what might the cost of that be. Under the head Outstanding Legal Questions (paragraph49):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"How would the issue of damages for breach of fiduciary duty be approached?..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>And the answer</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...in practice quantifying damages would be difficult..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is apparent from all this that White &amp; Case and Fairbairn and Cairns were all aware of the breaches of fiduciary duty thatwould inevitably flow from the recruiting proceeding, yet went ahead anyway knowing the prospect of profit engendered by the movementof business to White &amp; Case coffers outweighed the prospective cost of getting there. The 'without which, nothing', the acquisitionof a substantial client base, was within reach. And there was the exchange of emails as between Messrs Crozer and Fairbairn of August2002. Mr Crozer was cross-examined on the propriety of what was going on.

But even if it were so, as a senior statesman of a prestigious, worldwide practice he would knowwho to ask, or where to look it up.</p>    <p><a name="p252" class="para" id="p252">252.</a> I have to say this all amounts to a cynical disregard for the rights of Deacons, putting profit before honour; it is below the belt.But I cannot go so far as to find that it was vindictive, or malicious, or contumelious, and I am not, objectively, filled with asense of outrage. In the circumstances, on the authorities and specifically those that are current I find against the claim for exemplarydamages; but not by much. In further support of the contention is the finding I come to next; as to whether the option of an accountof profits is available to Deacons.</p>    <p class="heading">Remedy for Breach of Equitable Obligations 51</p>    <p><a name="p253" class="para" id="p253">253.</a> The prayer is for the alternative of an account for profits and equitable compensation. There will come a time, if I hold both remediesare available, for Deacons to make an election between these and damages; it cannot have both; see <strong>Island Records Limited v Tring International Plc</strong> [1995] 3 All ER. But that need not be until after it has had the opportunity to make an informed election. At this stage I am requiredto determine whether the equitable remedies are available.</p>    <p><a name="p254" class="para" id="p254">254.</a> I revert back to the findings of fact and resultant holding that Messrs Fairbairn and Cairns have been found liable by virtue ofbeing in breach of their contractual obligations. I am satisfied however that in each case there was a breach of fiduciary duty owedby Fairbairn to his partners and Cairns to his employer. All the breaches amount on the facts to breaches of their core duties ofloyalty, good faith, fidelity. Both are liable, in principle, to the equitable remedies of an account of profits or equitable compensation,as an alternative to damages.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p255" class="para" id="p255">255.</a> The orders I make as to liability are as I have recorded under the previous head of Relief.
