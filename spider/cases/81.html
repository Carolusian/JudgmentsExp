Ltd., Kyoto Insurance Limited, ScotlandInsurance Co. Ltd., China Underwriters Life &amp; Insurance Co. Ltd., and Bedford Insurance Co. Ltd. (the companies) which companieshave been wound-up compulsorily. All the companies underwrote risks of personal injury and death to third parties.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Summonses have been issued by the Official Receiver for directions in each case as to who is entitled to prove in the winding-upof the Companies and for directions on ancillary matters. The Official Receiver has no personal interest in the result, but seeksrulings, to assist him in the administration of the liquidations. Accordingly Mr. Kaplan who has been of great assistance to theCourt has argued the points raised in effect as amicus curiae.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The Director of Legal Aid represents the majority of the third party claimants, but although served with the summonses, he chosenot to be represented at the hearing. However, Mr. Warren Chan appeared on the instructions of the Attorney General on behalf ofthe Director of Social Welfare. The Director of Social Welfare was represented because the Hong Kong Government has made proposalsto introduce a scheme whereby payments out of the Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Scheme (TAVAS) will be made to third partyclaimants. Upon payment, the third parties will assign their rights, including any rights that they may have to claim in the liquidationsof the companies.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Mr. Chan submitted that all interested parties apart from third party claimants, such as the insured, unsecured creditors and contributoriesshould be before the Court and that the correct procedure should be by way of originating summons and not by summons see Re IslingtonMetal and Plating Works Ltd.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%203%20ALL%20E%20R%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 3 ALL E. R. 218.</a> However, that case is not relevant for it related to a voluntary winding-up. I am satisfied that the procedure by way of summonsis correct for by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s200.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 200(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, the Official Receiver may apply to the Court for directions in relation to any particular matter arising under the winding-up whichapplications are required to be made by summons pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/32H/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 7(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/32H" class="autolink_findacts">Companies (Winding-Up) Rules</a>. Although it may be of assistance to the Court for all parties interested to appear, it may be impracticable for them to be beforethe Court even if all of them can be ascertained. I do not therefore consider that this is a valid reason for declining to hear thesummonses.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Before consideration of the matters raised in the summonses, my attention was drawn by Mr. Kaplan to the conflicting decisions ofVinelott, J. in <u>Re Berkeley Securities (Property) Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%201%20WLR%201589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 1 W.L.R. 1589</a> and Harman, J. in <u>Re Islington Metal and Plating Works Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%203%20ALL%20E%20R%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 3 ALL E.

The time when the actual proof of debt is lodged and the date when it is admitted are frequently long after thattime, but to confuse the issue whether a creditor has a claim admissible to proof with the detail of when the creditor actually lodgesit is in my judgment fundamentally unsound.

Not only do I agree with the decision of Harman, J. but it was clearly made after a full considerationof the <u>Berkeley</u> case.

Potters could have sued for an indemnity only when their liability to the third personwas established and the amount of the loss ascertained. In some circumstances an insured might sue earlier for a declaration, e.g.if the insurance company were repudiating the policy for some reason; but where the policy is admittedly good, the insured cannotsue for an indemnity until his own liability to the third person is ascertained."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr. Chan agreed that a third party's claim against an insured is for unliquidated damages in tort, but said that an insured's claimagainst the insurers is based on the contract of insurance whilst the cause of action of the third party is based upon the certificateof insurance and the judgment pursuant to Section 10 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/272">Cap. 272</a>. He therefore contends that upon a construction of Section 10 theclaim by the third party against the insurer is not in the nature of unliquidated damages in tort for it is a claim made under thejudgment which is for a liquidated sum. On the other hand he argues that even if the demand is in the nature of unliquidated damagesthe claim can still be proved for it does not arise otherwise than by reason of a contract.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Mr. Chan submitted that the words arising otherwise than by reason of a contract' are capable of two meanings the narrower meaningof 'arising under' see <u>Gatoil International</u> <u>Inc. v.

He contends that there is a causal connection between the demands of the third partyas against the insurance company which arise by reason of the contract of insurance. That the third party demands are connected withthe contract of insurance within the wider meaning of 'arising ......... by reason of' and that the demands arise under the contractof insurance, within the narrower meaning of 'arising ........ by reason of'.

I accept Mr. Kaplan's submission that the draftsman could have retained thecontractual relationship had this been intended by making the conditions referred to in the section illegal instead of void as againstthe third party.

As I held earlier, I was forced to the conclusion that the decision of Vinelott, J. in the <u>Berkeley</u> case was wrong. I am happy that his well justified desire to see justice fairly applied can to some extent be achieved without thedifficulties which the liquidators in this case put before me as arising from the full scope of that decision."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> I am in entire agreement with the decision of Harman, J. which should bring about a just solution to the problem.

He considered the issue on threemain grounds at page 287. I do not propose to rehearse what he said, but merely to observe that the most cogent reason for adoptingthe cut off date as at the date of presentation of the petition is because the affairs of the company are in effect put into suspenseon that date. Upon the making of the winding up order it is established that the company was insolvent at the time of the presentationof the petition see <u>Wallberg's</u> case (1872) 17 SJ69. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s88.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 88</a> of the Companies (Winding - Up) Rules also supports the position that interest is payable up to the commencement of the winding up.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> I find no compelling reasons to depart from the position that applies in England.
