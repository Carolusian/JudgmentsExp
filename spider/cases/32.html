The Defence was served on 11 February 2002, with the Reply served on 23 February 2002.  The action seems then to have become dormantuntil the Plaintiff issued a Summons for Directions on 11 January 2003.  On 25 January 2003, the Defendant applied by summons tostrike out the Statement of Claim, seeking as well a dismissal of the action.  The grounds for striking out were all 4 limbs underO.18 r.19(1).</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> On 22 and 23 May 2003, Deputy High Court Judge Lam (now Lam J) heard the application.  By a judgment handed down on 11 June 2003,he struck out the Statement of Claim and dismissed the action.  It is from this judgment and order that the Plaintiff has now appealedin CACV162/2003.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Earlier in the proceedings, on 25 March 2003, Deputy High Court Judge Lam had given some directions in relation to the strike outsummons.  On that occasion, he ordered the Plaintiff to pay costs of $52,000, having assessed this on a gross sum basis under RHCO.62, r.9(4)(b).  Leave having been granted to appeal on 2 May 2003, the Plaintiff served a Notice of Appeal on 5 May 2003 (in CACV105/2003). This appeal was also initially before us but was abandoned by Mr Martin Lee SC on the Plaintiffâs behalf.  It was accordinglydismissed with costs.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> This left only CACV162/2003 to be determined.  At the hearing, the Plaintiff was represented by Mr Lee and Mr Jeremy Chan.  The Defendantwas represented by Mr Charles Sussex SC and Miss Lisa Jane Cruden.  Before dealing with the substance of the appeal, I should setout the Plaintiffâs claim in the present action.</p>     <p class="heading"><b>The Plaintiffâs claim</b></p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> I have already mentioned that the cause of action relied on by the Plaintiff in the action is one for malicious prosecution.  Therelevant prosecution was an information that had been laid against the plaintiff before Kwun Tong Magistracy on a charge of commonassault (contrary to section 40 of the Offences against the Person Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/212">Cap.212</a>).  The information was laid by one J P F Stone,the Assistant Divisional Commander Crime, Tseung Kwan O Police Station, on 16 February 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The charge related to an incident on 9 September 2000 which involved the Plaintiff and the Defendant.  This was a part of a numberof incidents that day taking place near the home of the Defendant and her husband at Wo Tong Kong Village, on Clearwater Bay Road,in the New Territories.  The Plaintiff and Defendant were neighbours in the vicinity.  Four days earlier, on 5 September 2000, thePlaintiff (together with his wife) had commenced a personal injuries action against the Defendant and her husband claiming damagesstemming from the death of the Plaintiffâs dog on 19 June 2000.  This incident was obviously deeply disturbing for the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> On the day in question, while the Defendantâs domestic helper was walking the Defendantâs dog, she came across the Plaintiff. It was alleged that the Plaintiff assaulted the helper by throwing a rock or rocks at her.  In doing so, he allegedly also damageda nearby car.  The Plaintiff was later charged with assault (to the helper) and criminal damage (to the car).</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Following this incident, the Plaintiff then went in the direction of the Defendantâs house.  It was at this point that the Plaintiffconfronted the Defendant and the alleged assault on the Defendant took place.  This was the basis of the charge with which the presentaction is primarily concerned.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The trial of the Plaintiff on this charge took place in the course of August and October 2001 at Kwun Tong Magistracy.  On 31 October2001, the Magistrate held that the Plaintiff had no case to answer.  However, the Plaintiff was later convicted on 22 November 2001of the charge of assault on the domestic helper and the criminal damage charge.  Although the Plaintiff appealed these convictions,his appeals were dismissed on 16 May 2003.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The Plaintiff alleges in the Statement of Claim that his prosecution for the alleged assault on the Defendant was a malicious onefor which the Defendant was responsible.  Paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim pleads the claim in the following way : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â8.  In fact the prosecution was without reasonable or probable cause, and the Defendant maliciously initiated and participatedin and procured the continuation of the criminal proceedings against the Plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>Particulars    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)     The Defendant deliberately provided false information to the police and/or deceived the police by supplying false informationin the absence of which the police would not have proceeded.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)     The Defendant withheld information in the knowledge of which the police would not have prosecuted.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)     The Defendant, with the intention of causing a police officer to initiate a prosecution against the Plaintiff, made allegationswhich</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)     if believed were likely to cause the police officer to initiate the prosecution;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b)     were to her knowledge false; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c)     the police officer was thereby caused to initiate the prosecution.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)     The Defendant desired to have the criminal proceedings initiated against the Plaintiff, and by direction, request or pressure,caused criminal proceedings to be instituted by the police against the Plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(5)     The Defendant made or was actively instrumental in the making or prosecuting of such a charge against the Plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(6)     The Defendant caused or procured untrue and/or tainted evidence to be tendered by third parties, intending thereby to persuadethe police to prosecute.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(7)     The Defendant gave untruthful and concocted information and evidence in an attempt to secure the conviction of the Plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(8)     The Defendant did not believe and could not honestly have believed in the justice of the prosecution.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(9)     The Defendant knew the Plaintiff was not guilty of the charge laid against him.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(10)   Thus, no ordinary person in the position of the Defendant would reasonably have been led to the conclusion that the Plaintiffwas or was probably guilty of the crime imputed.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(11)   The Defendant did not cause and/or initiate the information and complaint bona fide, and in fact did so in bad faith.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(12)   The Defendant was angry at the Plaintiff and bore him a grudge and she initiated and pursued the prosecution as stated andin the manner stated intending to cause the Plaintiff damage and harm.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The Plaintiff claims damages in the sum of $3,171,119 for the malicious prosecution as well as aggravated and/or exemplary damages.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>The issue in the present appeal</b></p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> There are 4 ingredients in the tort of malicious prosecution.  These are identified in paragraph 16-06 of <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> (18th ed.) in a passage that was said by the House of Lords, correctly to state the law : - see <i>Martin v Watson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20AC%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 AC 74</a>, at 80 : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn action of malicious prosecution the plaintiff must show <i>first</i> that he was prosecuted by the defendant, that is to say, that the law was set in motion against him on a criminal charge; <i>secondly</i>, that the prosecution was determined in his favour; <i>thirdly</i>, that it was without reasonable and probable cause; <i>fourthly</i>, that it was malicious.  The onus of proving every one of these is on the plaintiff.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This passage has also been referred to as representing the law in the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Gregory v Portsmouth City Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%201%20AC%20419" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 1 AC 419.</a></p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> We are, in this appeal, only concerned with the first of these requirements, it being accepted by the Defendant for the purposesof the strike out application that the other 3 requirements are reasonably arguable.  It was also accepted by the Defendant as apremise that in reporting to the police the incident on 9 September 2000 which led to the assault charge, she had not told the truth. Much was made of this by the Plaintiff in the submissions to us.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The issue before us is this : is it reasonably arguable, for the purposes of a strike out application, that the Defendant be regardedas the prosecutor (or one of the prosecutors) in the assault charge that the Plaintiff had to face and in respect of which it washeld he had no case to answer?  To put it in terms of the requisite criterion in a strike out application : - is it plain and obviousthat this requirement in the tort is obviously unsustainable?  The determination of this issue in the present case requires the Courtto go into facts.  The Defendantâs application to strike out is therefore not just dependent on the identification of the correctprinciples of law, but also the application of the law so identified to the facts.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> It is of course possible to refer to facts in order to found a strike out application.  O.18 r.19(1)(b)-(d) permit affidavit evidenceto be utilized in order to show, for example, that a plaintiff simply has no factual basis to support the cause of action pleadedin his claim.  Care, however, must be taken to ensure that a plaintiff is not prevented from going to trial unless the material factsbefore the Court at the strike out stage are either uncontroversial or cannot seriously be in dispute.  All this is a manifestationof the principle that it is only in plain and obvious cases that a claim can be struck out.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Law</b></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Before setting out the legal principles to be applied to the facts of the present case, I think it important first to identify therelevant context.  The Plaintiffâs claim is not against a public or official prosecutor such as the police or the Department ofJustice.  The claim in the present case is against the complainant of an offence allegedly committed by the Plaintiff, this personhaving allegedly manipulated the system for dishonest or nefarious means.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Clearly, where the complainant launches a private prosecution, the prosecutor is perhaps easy to identify.  The present case doesnot involve a private prosecution but one where the Plaintiff was prosecuted by the authorities.  In this situation, while the policeis clearly a prosecutor, it is not necessarily the only one for the purposes of the tort of malicious prosecution.  Here, as a matterof law, apart from the police or some other âofficialâ prosecutor, there may be another person or persons who may be treatedas the prosecutor or, as Brooke LJ put it in <i>Mahon and Another v Rahn and Others (No.2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%201%20WLR%202150" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 1 WLR 2150</a>, at 2205 (paragraph 267), âone of the prosecutorsâ.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> In setting out the relevant principles on the question of who is to be treated as a prosecutor where a complainant is involved, theJudge referred primarily to 3 authorities : - the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Watson</i>, of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Mahon</i> and of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in <i>Commercial Union Assurance Company of New Zealand Ltd v Lamont</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%203%20NZLR%20187" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 3 NZLR 187.</a>  With respect, I agree, although there ought to be added to them the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Gregory</i>, to which Mr Sussex helpfully referred us.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In my view, the following principles emerge from the authorities as to the question of how and in what circumstances in any givencase, a complainant (such as the Defendant) is to be treated as a prosecutor for the purposes of the tort of malicious prosecution: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)       The basis of the tort lies in the wrongful use that a person has made of the legal system (namely, the process of the Court)to set in motion a prosecution of another person on a criminal charge.  In short, there is involved the abuse of the Courtâs criminalprocess in order to secure the wrongful conviction of another person : - see <i>Commercial Union</i> at 192 and 199 per Richardson J.  As Lord Steyn said in <i>Gregory</i> at 426C-D :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA distinctive feature of the tort is that the defendant has abused the coercive powers of the stateâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)       The pre-requisite in any case of malicious prosecution is that the complaint has lied or procured others to lie to the authoritiesin order to try to have another person prosecuted on a criminal charge.  This, however, is not enough.  The lie must also âat leastâhave influenced the relevant prosecution authority to prosecute : - see <i>Commercial Union</i> at 196 (lines 20-25).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)       Even if the above is satisfied, it still does not follow even at this stage that the complainant can be treated as the prosecutor. The final step (and this, I emphasize, is critical) is it must be demonstrated that the lie and the circumstances of the case weresuch that it became virtually impossible for the prosecuting authorities to exercise any independent discretion or judgment as towhether or not to prosecute.  Put another way, where it is shown that the prosecuting authorities were able to and did exercise anindependent discretion or judgment in investigating the case and in the decision to prosecute the Plaintiff, the nexus between thelie (as told or procured by the complainant) and the prosecution is broken and the complainant will not in these circumstances beheld to be the prosecutor.  This last requirement is emphasized in the authorities, to which I now turn.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)       In <i>Commercial Union</i>, Richardson J, in a judgment that critically analyzed the authorities in a number of common law jurisdictions on this point, saidat 193 : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe tension is particularly acute where the defendant has given false and incriminating information to the police who have thenexercised their own judgment in deciding to prosecute.â</p>    </blockquote>     <blockquote>        <p>           At 199 (lines 3-38) in an important passage he continued : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â        In the modern New Zealand context particular weight should in my view be given to two considerations.  One is that thepolice have the training and experience to investigate a possible offence impartially and with skill and in that process to assesswhether the evidence justifies the invoking of the criminal process.  Then if it does to commence and conduct that process.  Andthe police have the professionalism to critically weigh and test the reliability of complaints and information which may be affectedby self-interest or ill-will.  To proceed on the premise that wherever it emerges the false information was given to the police theintelligent exercise of the discretion to prosecute was impossible, does not reflect the ordinary performance by the New Zealandpolice of their important responsibilities.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          The other is that members of the community should be encouraged to carry out their civic responsibility to support the policein the performance of the central function of investigating and prosecuting apparent breaches of the criminal law. Members of thecommunity should be secure in the knowledge that in providing the police with information they are not exposing themselves to anallegation of malicious prosecution.  So the circumstances in which they are to be regarded as having instigated a prosecution shouldbe rare and exceptional.  In this regard it needs to be remembered that there are other sanctions against misconduct on the partof those ostensibly assisting the police.  Making a false statement to the police is an offence under s 24 of the Summary OffencesAct 1981 and perjury is of course a crime; and civil liability may arise in defamation or for sale imprisonment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          It does not follow that there is any call for modifying the test which has been developed in the decisions of this Courtfor determining whether a third party is responsible in an action for malicious prosecution for criminal proceedings instituted bythe police.  What is required is a cautious application of that test where the police have conducted an investigation and decidedto prosecute.  The core requirement is that the defendant actually procured the use of the power of the State to hurt the plaintiff. One should never assume that tainted evidence persuaded the police to prosecute.  In some very special cases, however, the prosecutormay in practical terms have been obliged to act on apparently reliable and damning evidence supplied to the police.  The onus properlyrests on the plaintiff to establish that it was the false evidence tendered by a third party which led the police to prosecute beforethat party may be characterised as having procured the prosecution.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>           And at 200, dealing with the facts of the case : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe combined effect of these passages is such that the jury may well have been left with the impression that the Commercial Unionwas at law the prosecutor if its employees were actively involved in the police inquiry, or if the company had attempted to hastenthe completion of that inquiry and hoped that a prosecution would ensue.  The jury would also have understood from the final passagethat, even if the police had independently evaluated the Commercial Union evidence along with the other evidence, the company couldstill be the prosecutor.  On any application of the test I have been discussing I am satisfied that that was a material misdirection.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)       In the same case, McMullin J referred to false information which âvirtually compelsâ an officer to lay an information: - at 207 (line 54).

This is not to say that an independent discretion or judgment simply cannotbe exercised even in this situation, because if it is shown to have been exercised, the nexus is also broken.  It is all a matterof degree and dependent on the circumstances of the case.  The Judge emphasized this latter point in paragraph 44 of his judgmentreferring to the Privy Council case of <i>Pandit Gaya Parshad Tewari v Sardar Bhagat Singh</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281908%29%2024%20TLR%20884" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1908) 24 TLR 884.</a></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(7)       In <i>Mahon</i>, Brooke LJ (delivering the principal judgment with which the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed) developed the passage fromthe speech of Lord Keith of Kinkel in <i>Martin</i> set out above, as well as reviewed the relevant Commonwealth authorities.  The following points were emphasized in his judgment :-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     A distinction existed between a simple case like <i>Martin</i> (which involved 2 neighbours in Orpington, one accusing the other of indecent exposure â a âone on oneâ situation) and othercases (such as <i>Mahon</i> itself, involving an alleged commercial fraud) where the prosecutor is in receipt of evidence from a variety of sources on the basisof which he has to decide on whether or not to prosecute : - see 2205H-2206A (paragraph 268).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)     In a simple case, the following test was said to be appropriate : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn a simple case it may be possible to determine the issue quite easily by asking these questions. (1) Did A desire and intendthat B should be prosecuted?  (2) If so, were the facts so peculiarly within Aâs knowledge that it was virtually impossible forthe professional prosecutor to exercise any independent discretion or judgment?  (3) Has A procured the institution of proceedingsby the professional prosecutor, either by furnishing information which he knew to be false, or by withholding information which heknew to be true, or both?â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)     In a more complex case, the test is the same but they should cautiously applied where the prosecutor has conducted an investigationand critically appraised the evidence : - see 2206B-D (paragraph 270).  Reference was made to that part of Richardson Jâs judgmentin <i>Commercial Union</i> referred to in paragraph (4) above.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Mr Lee did not really dispute these principles but laid emphasis instead on a passage in the judgment of McMullin J in <i>Commercial Union</i> at 207-208 where he said : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA person may be regarded as the prosecutor if, inter alia, he puts the police in possession of information which virtually compelsan officer to lay an information; if he deliberately deceives the police by supplying false information in the absence of which thepolice would not have proceeded; or if he withholds information in the knowledge of which the police would not prosecute.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Mr Lee argued that the passage should be read disjunctively : if a plaintiff could satisfy one or more of the 3 situations therereferred to, it would then follow that the complainant would be treated as a prosecutor.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> In my judgment, this argument ignores what I have described above as a critical step, namely, the requirement that the lie (or dishonestwithholding of information) made it virtually impossible for the prosecuting authorities to exercise any independent discretion orjudgment.  This step was one that McMullin J himself expressly recognized in the passage at 208 of his judgment where he refers tothe importance of a supervening event (see paragraph 19(5) above).  Mr Leeâs submissions amount to saying no more than where aperson (acting maliciously and without reasonable cause) provides information or testimony to the prosecuting authorities in theabsence of which the prosecutor would not have proceeded or withheld information that, if known, would have resulted in no prosecutionbeing brought, then this is enough to make that person a prosecutor.  This is far too broad a test and is one that is not borne outby the authorities, in particular the 3 main authorities in this area.  I accept that taken in isolation, the passage in the judgmentof McMullin J may support the Plaintiffâs contention, but they must be read in the context of what the learned judge himself saidin other passages.  On analysis, all that McMullin J was seeking to do in that passage was to make good the point that a prosecutorfor the purposes of the tort of malicious prosecution, is not restricted only to the person who formally or officially lays the charges.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Where a sophisticated and established prosecuting authority such as the Hong Kong Police Force or the Department of Justice is involvedin a prosecution, caution must be exercised before identifying anyone else as a prosecutor : - see <i>Mahon</i> at 2206C.  Afterall, the tort involves the malicious prosecution of another person, not a malicious reporting to the authorities. In <i>Gregory</i>, Lord Steyn said this at 426C-F regarding the policy behind the narrow definition of the tort : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â             The paradigm is the tort of malicious prosecution of criminal proceedings.  A distinctive feature of the tort is thatthe defendant has abused the coercive powers of the state.  The law recognises that an official or private individual, who withoutjustification sets in motion the criminal law against a defendant, is likely to cause serious injury to the victim.  It will typicallyinvolve suffering for the victim and his family as well as damage to the reputation and credit of the victim.  On the other hand,in a democracy, which upholds the rule of law, it is a delicate matter to allow actions to be brought in respect of the regular processesof the law.  Law enforcement agencies are heavily dependent on the assistance and co-operation of citizens in the enforcement ofthe law.  The fear is that a widely drawn tort will discourage law enforcement: it may discourage not only malicious persons buthonest citizens who would otherwise carry out their civic duties of reporting crime.  In the result malevolent individuals must receiveprotection so that responsible citizens may have it in respect of the hazards of litigation.  The tort of malicious prosecution isalso defined against the backcloth that there are criminal sanctions, such as perjury, making false statements to the police, andwasting police time, which discourage the mischief under consideration.  Moreover, the tort must be seen in the context of overlappingtorts, such as defamation and malicious falsehood, which serve to protect interests of personality.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b>Application of law to facts</b></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> I have earlier noted the fact it has been assumed for the limited purposes of the strike out application that the second to fourthelements of the tort are reasonably arguable in the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The Plaintiff submits that the assumption must therefore be that the Defendant lied to the police when she reported the alleged assaulton her by the Plaintiff.  She being the complainant, as well as the subject matter of the charge, it simply becomes impossible atthe strike out stage to say that what otherwise might have been the independent discretion and judgment on the part of the policein prosecuting the Plaintiff, was not tainted by the lie.  Mr Lee essentially says this : - but for the lie, there would have beenno prosecution; the Defendant was the main witness, the âprima donnaâ (as he described her status).  Her lie therefore (at leastarguably) made the independent exercise of discretion or judgment by the police âvirtually impossibleâ.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Forcefully though these arguments were put, they do not in my view adequately address the critical point of the exercise of discretionor judgment by the prosecuting authorities in the present case.  The argument proceeds on the premise it is sufficient merely toshow that but for the lie, the police would not have prosecuted the Plaintiff.  I have already dealt with this view of the law inparagraphs 20 to 22 above.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> In my judgment, it is clear on the evidence (even at this stage) to conclude that however much the Defendant may have lied aboutthe assault (and I assume here she has lied totally about the incident and has acted maliciously and unreasonably), the prosecutingauthorities (meaning the police and the Department of Justice) did exercise an independent discretion or judgment on the decisionto prosecute the Plaintiff.  In short, the nexus between the Defendant and the prosecution of the Plaintiff was severed by the interventionof the police and the Department of Justice.  It is in my view not reasonably arguable that the Defendantâs lie has somehow madeit âvirtually impossibleâ for the independent exercise of discretion or judgment by the prosecuting authorities in the presentcase.  The following facts and matters lead to these conclusions : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     The police, in investigating the alleged assault and considering whether or not to prosecute, were not faced with a âoneon oneâ situation.  Statements were obtained from a number of witnesses to the incident, among them the Defendantâs husband,a houseguest, a neighbour and her friend.  All provided statements to the police in which there was described an assault on the Defendantby the Plaintiff.  It of course later transpired that the neighbour and her friend were some 60 metres away from the Plaintiff andthe Defendant at the time of the incident but given the content of their statements, there was some independent evidence for thepolice to take into account.  On analysis, this was not a case in which the facts were âpeculiarlyâ within the Defendantâsknowledge.  As the judge said in paragraph 51 of his judgment : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe Defendant might be an important witness but she was by no means the only witness which the prosecution could rely upon in establishingthe chargeâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     In the Investigation Report of DCIP Stone dated 18 July 2001, in the course of his investigations, he also interviewed andobtained statements from the Plaintiffâs wife, their maid and 2 of their neighbours.  A statement was also taken from another neighbourwho witnessed the incident, although she did not say she saw an assault.  Even a vet was interviewed.  DCIP Stone himself paced therelevant distances at the site of the alleged assault.  He was also well aware of the enmity that had built up between the Plaintiffand the Defendant originating from the death of the Plaintiffâs dog.  The police knew there was a history of ill feeling betweenthem.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     The police carried out extensive investigations before the decision to prosecute was made.  Although the incident took placeon 9 September 2000, it was not until 16 February 2001 that the Plaintiff was charged.  The Investigation Report to which I haveearlier referred, provides much detail on the police investigations that were carried out.  It is clear that the police were notsimply taking the Defendantâs word on the assault without the exercise of any independent discretion or judgment.  They evaluatedthe Defendantâs version against the whole of the evidence and against what other people were saying.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     At the Plaintiffâs trial, DCIP Stone was cross-examined on whether he had appraised the evidence before deciding to prosecute. He said he had.  DCIP Stone also said that consideration had been given to the Plaintiffâs complaint that in fact it was he whowas assaulted by the Defendantâs husband and the houseguest.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)     The decision to prosecute was not of course made by the police on its own.  Legal advice from the Department of Justice wassought.  We have seen the correspondence passing between the Defendantâs solicitors and the Department of Justice in which thisis clearly made out.  The letter dated 6 May 2003 from the Department of Justice to the Defendantâs solicitors (Messrs Deacons)states, âAfter due consideration, advice was given to the police to charge [the Plaintiff]â.  DCIP Stone also replied to theinquiry made by the solicitors.  In his letter in reply, he says this : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI can confirm that the police investigated the various allegations which arose out of the incident which occurred at Wo Tong KongVillage, Clearwater Bay Road on 9th September 2000.  A fair, thorough and impartial investigation was conducted.  The results ofthe investigation were forwarded to the Department of Justice for consideration.  The Department of Justice advised that the Plaintiffin your case should be charged.  Thereafter the case (KTCC 10357/01) was prosecuted by Government Counsel.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I can confirm that the results of the police investigation were not in any way influenced by any pressure exerted by your client.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6)     There is no doubt in the present case that the police and the Department of Justice exercised an independent discretion orjudgment in evaluating the evidence when it decided to prosecute the Plaintiff.  We have been referred to relevant passages in theProsecution Policy of the Department of Justice published in 1998, in particular those dealing with general principles and the sufficiencyof evidence to prosecute.  I have no doubt on the facts that the Policy has been adhered to.  No evidence exists in any form to suggestthat the witnesses colluded with each other in somehow inculpating the Plaintiff (even though the Statement of Claim pleads thatthe Defendant procured untrue and tainted evidence to be provided to the police).  Nor is there any evidence to support the Plaintiffâscase that the Defendant had applied undue pressure on the police to prosecute him.  In his affidavit, the Defendant referred to aletter dated 30 January 2001 from the Defendant, her husband and their maid to the police inquiring about progress.  Reference wasalso made to a letter from their solicitors (Messrs Baker and Mckenzie) to the Director of Public Prosecutions in which referencewas made to 6 summonses that the Plaintiff had privately taken out against the husband regarding his dogs.  Neither letter in myview remotely supports the point that the Defendant and her husband were applying undue pressure on the prosecuting authorities.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> I do not see how these conclusions can change at trial, much as Mr Lee has urged us to the contrary on this point.  The objectivefacts, mostly contained in documents, speak for themselves and lead inevitably to the conclusion that the nexus between the Defendantâsâlieâ and the Plaintiffâs prosecution has been broken.  This was the view of Deputy High Court Judge Lam and with respect,I agree.  Moreover, the Plaintiff has already had an opportunity to raise (and did raise) the issue of malicious prosecution duringhis trial in the Magistratesâ Court.  Although I agree that the focus of that trial was different in nature to the present proceedings,nevertheless they are obviously connected.  Nothing in the cross-examination of DCIP Stone in particular leads one to think thatany more progress can be made by the Plaintiff if the present action were permitted to go to trial.  The Plaintiff is then reallyin the position of hoping that something will eventually turn up at trial.  Nothing persuades me that this is the correct view totake in the present case.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> For my part, the Judge was entirely correct in striking out the Statement of Claim and dismissing the action.

Hence despite the presence of other witnesses who said they had witnessed the assault, the evidence from the complainantof the assault is clearly one of importance.</p>    <p><sup><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> </sup>Two of the witnesses who informed the police that they had seen the assault conceded at the trial that their view was blocked by thedefendant. </p>    <p><sup><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> </sup>The other two witnesses who likewise had said to have seen the assault were the husband of the defendant and a friend.  If, despitethe evidence of the defendant and these two witnesses, the magistrate would, without even hearing the plaintiff, find that therewas no case for him to answer on the assault charge, then something must have seriously gone wrong with their evidence.  This beingthe case the extent to which the defendantâs information had influenced the decision to prosecute becomes of vital importance. This is a question of fact.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Assumed facts</b></p>    <p><sup><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> </sup>In this case it is properly conceded by Mr. Sussex S.C., counsel for the defendant, that for the purpose of the striking out application,the second, third and fourth ingredients of the tort must be assumed in favour of the plaintiff.  This assumption would necessarilyinclude the facts pleaded by the plaintiff in support of his claim, namely the defendant deliberately provided false informationwhich she knew to be false to the police and deceived the police by supplying false information.</p>    <p><sup><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> </sup>Although the only issue that the Court is concerned with is whether the defendant is the prosecutor in this case, clearly the concessionhas a significant impact on the first issue.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Inference to be drawn</b></p>    <p><sup><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> </sup>The impact is that the plaintiff is entitled to argue that the evidence are capable of giving rise to the inference that the Policeand the Department of Justice were indeed prejudiced by the complaint and their judgment on the matter was impaired. </p>    <p><sup><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> </sup>I have to disagree with Mr. Sussexâs argument that the plaintiff had not shown an iota of evidence that the decision to prosecutionwas not the result of an independent judgment.  For the purpose of the striking out, the facts which are assumed in the plaintiffâsfavour together with the matters I will now deal with form the foundation upon which the necessary inference can be drawn.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Inquiry with the police and the prosecution</b></p>    <p><sup><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> </sup>The plaintiff had not inquired with the police inspector in charge of the case and the prosecuting counsel on their decision to prosecuteif they had known that the defendant had indeed provided false information to them.  On the other hand, the defendantâs lawyerhad made inquiries.  He asked the Department of Justice and the Police to confirm that the decision to charge the plaintiff âwasmade independently on the basis of all the material evidence and that the decision was not influenced by any pressure exerted byour clientâ.</p>    <p><sup><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> </sup>The response from the Department of Justice was that the decision to prosecute was based on Article 63 of the <i>Basic Law</i>, the Prosecution Policy, âdue considerationâ of the case and was made âaccording to lawsâ.  It refused to give the answerin an affidavit. </p>    <p><sup><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> </sup>The Police replied that âA fair, thorough and impartial investigation was conducted.  The results of the investigation were forwardedto the Department of Justice for consideration.  The Department of Justice advised that the plaintiff in your case should be chargedâ. The letter concluded by saying that âthe results of the police investigation were not in any way influenced by any pressure exertedby your clientâ.</p>    <p><sup><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> </sup>The fact that the plaintiff had not made the inquiries does mean that the matter is now conclusive against him.  Even if one is tolook at the correspondence and not merely at the assumed facts, the responses from the Department of Justice and Police do not conclusivelyanswer the real question of whether their judgment had been prejudiced.  What the Department of Justice and Police had said mustbe subject to cross examination.  In <i>Lamont</i> the answers elicited by the cross examination of the police officer in charge of the criminal prosecution in the action for maliciousprosecution were relied upon as evidence in support of that action.</p>    <p><sup><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> </sup>Apart from that, what transpired at the criminal case and its outcome further provide the evidential basis for the plaintiff to mountthis action.  First of all, if, despite the âthorough investigationâ of the police, two of the witnesses admitted in court thattheir views were blocked which contradicted their claim to the Police that they saw the assault by the plaintiff, a real questionarises as to whether an independent judgment had in fact been exercised in the investigation by the Police.  Surely it was not difficultto ascertain during the investigation whether these witnessesâ vision was blocked.  Further, if the prosecution could not evensatisfy the magistrate that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case of assault, this clearly is a very strong indication that the evidence of the defendant, her husband and their friend was totallyunsatisfactory in court.</p>    <p><sup><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> </sup>All these unsatisfactory features in fact lend support to the plaintiffâs case that first of all the Police was so much affectedby the defendantâs alleged claim of assault that it had coloured or prejudiced its judgment in the investigation.  The absenceof pressure from the defendant towards the Police does not mean that the latterâs judgment could not be impaired.  In view of therelationship between the defendant, her husband and their friend,it is arguable that the latter two could not be treated as trulyindependent witnesses which, somehow, might have provided the Police with evidence in support of the defendantâs claim.  In factthis case is more akin to the situation in <i>Martin v. Wilson</i> where the source of information came from the complainant<i>.</i>  This is not an unarguable point.</p>    <p><sup><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> </sup>Moving to the position of the Department of Justice, it is a manner of common sense that when the Police presented its investigationto the Department of Justice for advice, it would not simply provide it with statements of the witness only.  One expects that thePolice would include its own input, in terms of its assessment of the strength of the case and the credibility of the witnesses. If the advice to prosecute by the Department of Justice was based on an investigation which was prejudiced, I am not prepared tosay at a striking out application that, nonetheless, the nexus between the alleged false claim by the defendant and the prosecutionmust necessarily be broken by the independent judgment of the Department of Justice.  The plaintiffâs case is by no means a strongone, but in my view there is enough material to allow him to pursue the claim.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Opportunity to deal with the matter</b></p>    <p><sup><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> </sup>Nor am I impressed with the argument that the plaintiff had the opportunity of cross-examining the inspector at the criminal trialand could have explored this issue.  Counsel  for the plaintiff at the criminal trial was focusing on a different issue altogether. Matters relating to the timing of the criminal charge against the plaintiff, the prosecution of another offence of criminal damagewhen the owner of the damaged property did not even wish to pursue the matter and other matters were all related to the questionof whether the police itself had a grudge against the applicant.</p>    <p><sup><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> </sup>The plaintiffâs counsel at the criminal trial was not concerned with the issue that has to be decided in this case.  To decide otherwisewould be imposing too high a burden on the plaintiff who, after all, despite being a lawyer, would still have to be guided in thiscase by specialists in this area of the law.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Lamont revisited</b></p>    <p><sup><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> </sup>It must be a matter of common sense to say that one must not assume that wherever it emerged that false information had been givento the police the intelligent exercise of the discretion to prosecute was impossible (per Richardson J in <i>Lamont</i>).  Ultimately it is a matter of fact in each case as whether the independent judgment was impaired or not.</p>    <p><sup><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> </sup>Indeed <i>Lamont</i> itself is the best illustration of this approach.  In that case, the criminal prosecution of the plaintiff on insurance fraud wasconducted by the New Zealand prosecuting authority.  It was based on the investigation of the police who had received informationprovided by the insurer of the plaintiff.  At the trial the plaintiff was found to have no case to answer to the charge.  He thensued the insurer for malicious prosecution. </p>    <p><sup><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> </sup>The same question like the one in the present case arose as to whether the insurer was the prosecutor.  While there was evidence whichwas capable of showing that the police had exercised an independent judgment, it was held by Barker J that equally the jury couldfind that the insurer had dishonestly supplied false information to the police (which the jury in an earlier trial had already sofound) and the information could be said to have prejudiced the judgment of the police.  He ordered a retrial. </p>    <p><sup><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> </sup>Richardson J was of the same view.  He stated that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â   As Anderson J (i.e. the trial judge) observed, although in his evidence Detective Newman tended to diminish the extent and influenceof the companyâs (i.e. the insurerâs) involvement, the evaluation of his evidence and of the evidence overall was a matter forthe jury.  While on paper the case for the plaintiff in this respect could by no means be regarded as strong, and while DetectiveNewmanâs evidence, if accepted by the jury, pointed to an independent exercise of judgment by the police not tainted by misrepresentationsor misconduct on the part of employees of the company, there is in my view a proper basis in the evidence on which a jury was entitledto answer question 1 (i.e. Did the defendant prosecute the plaintiff?) in favour of the plaintiff.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><sup><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> </sup>Although Richardson J did not expressly say so, the basis of such evidence must be those relating to the false information providedby the insurer from which the jury may decide whether such false information if dishonestly given had prejudiced the independentjudgment of the prosecuting authority.</p>    <p><sup><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> </sup>McMullin J also ordered a retrial but on a different basis, namely, on the wrong direction by the judge.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Question of fact</b></p>    <p><sup><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> </sup>In <i>Lamont</i> the Court of Appeal was dealing with an appeal from the decision of the jury in a trial.  While Richardson and Barker JJâs decisionon the retrial is not a proposition of law which one needs to follow, clearly it highlights the point that whether an independentjudgment has been exercised or not is ultimately a question of fact depending on the circumstances of the case. </p>    <p><sup><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> </sup>It is correct that one must not assume that even in a case of false evidence being given, the prosecuting authority may necessarilybe prejudiced, equally it must not be assumed that such an impairment of judgment could never occur at all. </p>    <p><sup><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> </sup>In my view, if this can be said of a trial, this should apply equally, if not with greater force, to a striking out application wheresome fundamental facts have already been assumed in favour of the plaintiff and where there are other evidence which are capableof showing the judgment of the Police and the Department of Justice had indeed been prejudiced.  This is a fact sensitive issue. In my view it cannot be said that at this stage of the proceedings it is so plain and obvious that the plaintiff is bound to failin his claim.</p>    <p><sup><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> </sup>While it is one in rare and exceptional circumstances that a malicious prosecution can be lodged against a private individual aftera failed criminal prosecution that had been instituted and conducted by the prosecuting authority, one must not apply this principleas a matter of routine at an interlocutory stage so as to preclude a plaintiff from pursuing his claim.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>    <p><sup><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> </sup>I would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment below.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Ma CJHC :</b></p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> This court being equally divided on the outcome of the appeal, the order made by Deputy High Court Judge Lam striking out the Statementof Claim and dismissing the action with costs remains intact and the appeal is accordingly dismissed.  We also make an order nisias to costs as proposed in my judgment.  Under section 34B(5), it is open to either party to apply to have the matter re-argued beforea court comprising an uneven number of appeal judges.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Geoffrey Ma)</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Peter Cheung)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Chief Judge, High Court</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Justice of Appeal</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Martin Lee SC &amp; Mr Jeremy S K Chan, instructed by Messrs Fred Kan &amp; Co for the Plaintiff/Appellant</p>        <p>Mr Charles Sussex SC &amp; Miss Lisa Jane Cruden, instructed by Messrs Deacons for the Defendant/Respondent</p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2004/430.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
