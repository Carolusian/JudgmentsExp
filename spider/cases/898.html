D2 and D3 were the hosts of these programmes.The defamatory remarks were uttered by D1 during his interview in these programmes by D2 and D3. D1 and the Plaintiff were relatedin that he was the 1st Plaintiff's uncle and the 2nd Plaintiff's brother.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The Plaintiffs settled their claim against D4 much earlier on. Shortly before the commencement of the trial of this action, theyalso settled with D2 and D3. There is hence no need to discuss their claim against these Defendants further.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> D1 was originally represented by solicitors but later chose to act in person. On the first day of the trial, D1 failed to appear.Mr Chow for the Plaintiffs informed me that D1 had been duly served with the relevant court documents and ought therefore to knowof these proceedings and referred me to the relevant affirmation of service filed herein.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> In these circumstances, I considered it appropriate to exercise my discretion to allow the Plaintiffs to proceed with the trial ofthis action.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The Plaintiffs adduced the following evidence in support of their case:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) the transcript of the tape recording of the 2 radio programmes;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) the sworn testimony of the Plaintiffs;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) the tape recording of the 2 radio programmes.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">Further, the relevant parts of the tape recording relied upon by the Plaintiffs were played in Court. There were also other trialbundles placed before the Court. Having taken these into account, I indicated that I was satisfied that the Plaintiffs had proventheir case against D4. The "sting" of the libel against the 1st Plaintiff was that D1 falsely accused her of having an incestuousrelationship with her late natural father. The "sting" of D1's libel against the 2nd Plaintiff was his false accusation that shehad an adulterous relationship with her late brother-in-law.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The only outstanding issue is the quantum of damages payable by D4. After hearing Mr Chow's submissions, I reserved Judgment on quantumof damages. This is the Judgment on Quantum.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Mr Chow submitted that apart from the libel being published during the 2 radio programmes, there was extensive re-publication ofD1's libel in that his false accusations were widely reported in quite a number of the local newspapers. He further submitted thatthe Plaintiffs were entitled to, and did, choose to sue the original publisher (that is, D1) as being liable for the original publicationonly but seek to recover damages from D1 in relation to both the original publication and the re-publication.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> He said this is because the original publisher of the libel is liable for the damages of the re-publication of the libel if:-</p>    <blockquote>        <div align="left">            <table border="0" width="100%">                <tr>                    <td width="6%" valign="top">(a)</td>                    <td width="94%" valign="top">he authorized or intended the re-publication;</td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="6%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="94%" valign="top"></td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="6%" valign="top">(b)</td>                    <td width="94%" valign="top">the person to whom the original publication was made was under a duty to repeat the libelous statement;</td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="6%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="94%" valign="top"></td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="6%" valign="top">(c)</td>                    <td width="94%" valign="top">the re-publication was in the circumstances of the case the natural and probable result of the original publication:</td>                </tr>            </table>        </div>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><strong>Gatley on Libel and Slander</strong> (1998) 9th Ed., para. 6.30, 6.34 and 6.35.
