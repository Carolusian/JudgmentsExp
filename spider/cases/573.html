Where land is referred to it is not restricted to the land which was gazetted in accordance with the provisionscontained in the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Mr Yu SC for the DOL submitted that what was required was to consider the subsections in their proper context and then attempt todetermine what had been the intention of the Legislature when the Ordinance had been enacted.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> His authority for this was contained in the commentary in paras. 1372 and 1373 of Vol. 44(1) of Halsbury's Laws of England 4th Edition:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>1372. Ascertaining the legislator's intention</em>. The object of all interpretation of a written instrument is to discover the intention of its author as expressed in the instrument.Therefore the object in construing an Act is to ascertain the intention of Parliament as expressed in the Act, considering it asa whole and in its context, and acting on behalf of the people. The meaning of an enactment that corresponds to this intention isknown as its legal meaning. The legal meaning may or may not correspond to the grammatical or literal meaning.</p>        <p class="quote"><em>1373. Nature of the legal meaning</em>. The legal meaning of an enactment, that is the meaning that corresponds to the legislator's intention, is the meaning arrived atby applying to the enactment, taken with any other relevant and admissible material, the rules, principles, presumptions and canonswhich govern statutory interpretation. These may be referred to as the interpretative criteria, or guides to legislative intention."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Further assistance on the approach to be adopted can be found from the judgment of Bokhary PJ in <strong>Medical Council of Hong Kong v Chow Siu-shek</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%202%20HKC%20428" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 2 HKC 428.</a></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> He was satisfied that the modern tendency was to give statutes a purposive construction. This approach was consistent with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 19</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap. 1</a>:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>19.

The intention of the Ordinance as a whole.</p>        <p>2. The presumption favouring consequential construction.</p>        <p>3. The presumption against absurdity.</p>        <p>4. Interpretation in the context of other similar statutes.</p>        <p>5. The presumption that the law should not be subject to change by a side wind.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The first issue which has to be determined on this appeal is whether the approach contended for by Mr Thomas is correct or whetherit is necessary to resort to the interpretative criteria referred to by Mr Yu.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Mr Thomas submitted that it had to be clearly demonstrated that there was some doubt or ambiguity before it was permissible to callin aid the rules of construction.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> There was a commentary on these guiding principles in paras. 1391 and 1470 of Halsbury:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>1391. Plain meaning rule</em>. It is a rule of the common law, which may be called the plain meaning rule, that where, in relation to the facts of the instantcase, the enactment under inquiry is grammatically capable of one meaning only and, on an informed interpretation of that enactment,the interpretative criteria raise no real doubt as to whether that meaning is the one intended by the legislator, then the legalmeaning of the enactment is taken to correspond to that grammatical meaning; but that in any other case the basic rule of statutoryinterpretation is to be applied."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>1470. Presumption favouring literal meaning</em>. Prima facie, the legal meaning of an enactment as it applies to particular facts is presumed to be that which corresponds to theliteral meaning of the enactment in relation to those facts.</p>        <p class="quote">The literal meaning of an enactment in relation to particular facts is determined as follows. The starting point is the grammaticalmeaning of the enactment taken in isolation, that is the meaning it bears in relation to those facts when, as a piece of Englishprose, it is construed, without reference to any other text, according to the rules and usages of grammar, syntax and punctuation,including the accepted linguistic canons of construction. This grammatical meaning may be clear or ambiguous or obscure.

In other words if a party did not come within theambit of section 12(1) they likewise would not come within the scope of section 12(13).</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> We are satisfied that the primary purpose of the Ordinance is to enable the Government to obtain an involuntary easement over landand that the question of compensation is just a "connected matter".</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> There is every reason to suppose that what is intended in the Ordinance is that section 12 provides for compensation to be payableto the owners of the servient tenements involved and there is no remit for the submission that it was intended that compensationshould be payable to any owner of land adversely affected by tunnelling operations.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>2.

The presumption against absurdity.</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> It is convenient to deal with these two presumptions together.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> The guiding principles relating to these presumptions are helpfully commented upon in paras 1471 and 1480 of Halsbury:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>1471. Presumption favouring consequential construction</em>. It is presumed to be the legislator's intention that the court, when considering, in relation to the facts of the instant case,which of the opposing constructions of the enactment corresponds to its legal meaning, should assess the likely consequences of adoptingeach construction, both to the parties in the case and (if and when similar facts arise in future cases) for the law generally. Ifon balance the consequences of a particular construction are more likely to be adverse than beneficent this is a factor telling againstthat construction and may call for a strained interpretation.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Where the application of an enactment yields an adverse result, the interpretative factors may on balance indicate that the courtshould curtail its application. This is known as strict construction. Equally, where the application of an enactment yields a beneficentresult the interpretative factors may on balance indicate that the court should widen its application. This is known as liberal construction."</p>        <p class="quote">"<em>1480. Presumption against anomalous or illogical result</em>. It is presumed that Parliament intends that the court, when considering, in relation to the facts of the instant case, which ofthe opposing constructions of an enactment corresponds to its legal meaning, should find against a construction that creates an anomalyor otherwise produces an irrational or illogical result. The presumption may be applicable where on one construction a benefit isnot available in like cases, or a detriment is not imposed in like cases, or the decision would turn on an immaterial distinctionor an anomaly would be created in legal doctrine. Where each of the constructions contended for involves some anomaly then, in sofar as the court uses anomaly as a test, it has to balance the effect of each construction and determine which anomaly is greater.It may be possible to avoid the anomaly by the exercise of a discretion. It may be, however, that the anomaly is clearly intended,when effect must be given to the intention. The court will pay little attention to a proclaimed anomaly if it is purely hypothetical,and unlikely to arise in practice."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Bearing in mind that the purpose of the Ordinance is primarily to enable the Government to install and maintain sewage tunnels itis only to be expected that the class of persons who should be eligible for compensation should be limited to those directly affectedby the Government's activities.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> On the face of it there would be no logical justification to provide a benefit to the world at large the effect of which would beto make the Government assume the role of an insurer in respect of any liability which might arise consequential upon any damagebeing suffered as a result of the sewage tunnels being installed.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> This then leads to the anomalous situation outlined by Mr Yu.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> He submitted that it was clear that the legislation need only be invoked where the tunnels had to be installed under land in privateownership. It would not be necessary to have resort to the legislation where Government itself owned the land.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> The result of this was that if Mr Thomas' contentions were well founded an adjoining owner would be able to claim compensation wherethe tunnel was laid under privately owned land but not where it was under Government land. This would be a most surprising result.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Mr Thomas' answer to this was that this situation could not arise. This was because section 3 of the Ordinance was framed in mandatoryterms and this being the case even if the Government owned the land in question it was necessary for it to invoke the provisionscontained in the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> We do not think this right. The Government would clearly not need the benefit of the Ordinance and there is no reason why its provisionsshould apply.

The presumption that the law should not be subject to change by a side wind.</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> For the operation of this presumption assistance can be derived from a passage at p. 626 of the 3rd Edition of "A Code of StatutoryInterpretation" by F.A.R.

In the case of common law,or Acts embodying common law, the principle is somewhat stronger than in other cases. It is also stronger the more fundamental thechange is.</p>        <p class="quote">(2) The court, when considering, in relation to the facts of the instant case, which of the opposing constructions of the enactmentwould give effect to the legislative intention, should presume that the legislator intended to observe this principle.
