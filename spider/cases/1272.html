The matters before the judge were applications by the second,third, fourth, fifth and seventh defendants to strike out the statement of claim under the provisions of Order 18 rule 19(1) of theRules of the High Court.  Those applications were on the grounds that the pleading did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. There was also an application by the plaintiffs to amend the pleadings.  There were a multiplicity of causes of action pleaded againstthe various defendants.  The judge made orders permitting the plaintiffs to amend the statement of claim in order that various claimsmight be made against the first, second, third, fourth and seventh defendants.  He ordered that those claims which were not specificallypermitted should be struck out and that the action against the fifth defendant should be struck out.  At the conclusion of the hearingof this appeal judgment was reserved which we now give.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Before dealing with the substantive issues it has to be observed that the applications to strike out the statement of claim weremade some four years after the commencement of the action and, notably, after defences had been filed and discovery, apparently,completed.  This was despite considerable difficulties which are caused by the way in which the statement of claim has been framedwith the inclusion of what would appear to be a number of irrelevant matters and the complicated manner in which the plaintiffsâcase has been presented.  It was thus not the defendantsâ case that the statement of claim was unintelligible nor was the applicationto strike out put forward on the basis that the pleading was embarrassing.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In the second place it must be emphasised that because this application is made on the basis that the statement of claim does notdisclose reasonable causes of action there has, of necessity, been no assessment of any evidence and the truth of the allegationshas not been tested in any way.  Hence because the court is constrained to proceed upon the basis of the facts pleaded in the statementof claim nothing said in this judgment should be taken as being a proven fact.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The plaintiffsâ case arises out of losses of a sum of US$750,000 paid by the first plaintiff into a bank account of the seconddefendant and a sum of US$500,000 paid by the second plaintiff into the same bank account of the second defendant.  In essence itis alleged that the money so deposited was used in a way which was not authorised by the plaintiffs and contrary to the manner inwhich the defendants or at least some of them had indicated it would be used.  It is said that a substantial part of that money foundits way into bank accounts of the first, second and fifth defendants.  In those circumstances it is hardly surprising that the plaintiffshave brought proceedings.  What might be surprising is that only civil proceedings have ensued.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  It is alleged that the fourth defendant, who was registered as an investment adviser under the provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333" class="autolink_findacts">Securities Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333">Cap. 333</a>, and the seventh defendant were the directors and shareholders of the first defendant, which was also a registered adviser. The third defendant, who was also a registered investment adviser, had become acquainted with the plaintiffs as an investment adviserwhilst working for another company.  He persuaded the plaintiffs to transfer their businesses to the first defendant of which itis pleaded he was an employee.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  It is said that the third defendant proposed and recommended to the plaintiffs that they should invest in a âFully Secured LeverageProgrammeâ (âFSLPâ).  It is said that they were informed that the FSLP involved leveraged trading of assets,specifically purchasinginstruments, such as US treasury bills or bank debentures, for less than their face value and reselling them at a profit.  The plaintiffsclaim to have been told that there was a guaranteed high return with no risk of losing the principal investment.  Profits were saidto be in the region of at least 100% over a period of six months.  The plaintiffs also allege that they were told that the FSLP wascontrolled by the US Federal Reserve.  It is to be inferred from the pleadings that, on the basis of those representations, the plaintiffsconsidered such an investment attractive.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Thereafter it is said that communications with the plaintiffs were to a large extent by letter written by the third defendant onthe second defendantâs letterhead.  The second defendant was a British Virgin Islands registered company.  The plaintiffs weretold that the FSLP investments had to be made through an overseas registered company and hence the second defendant, whom they weretold was operated, owned and controlled by the first defendant, was to be used as the vehicle.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The third and fifth defendants were directors of the second defendant.  It is pleaded that various representations were made inletters signed by the third defendant addressed to both plaintiffs on the notepaper of the second defendant in order to induce theplaintiffs to part with their money.  For example, the second plaintiff was informed in October 1997 that the third and fifth defendantswould travel to London to effect the transaction and if they were satisfied about proceeding with the FSLP programme they would verifythe bank guarantee.  The first plaintiff was slightly later told that he could expect a profit of US$400,000 on an investment ofUS$500,000 and that there would be a security in the form of a guarantee from Barclays Bank.  He was also informed that the seconddefendant had carried out a thorough four-month investigation and was satisfied that the FSLP programmes were legitimate and operatedin conjunction with and under the auspices of âone of the top 25 banks and in this case, Barclays.â.  He was also told âwecould not have been more thorough in conducting due diligence concerning the investment.â</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  It is said that on those representations the plaintiffs paid over the respective sums of US$750,000 and US$500,000.  It is thenalleged that the first to fifth and seventh defendants were well aware that the Bank of East Asia, London Branch was anxious thatits nominee company should cease to act as a nominee of the second defendant.  It is also said that the first to fifth defendantswere well aware in March 1998 that the investments in the FSLP were likely to be a âclever documentation fraudâ in which thedefendants were likely to incur liability because of âinadequate and insufficient due diligenceâ.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  It is then alleged that further representations were made to the plaintiffs by the second and third defendants in July 1998 in answerto concerns which had been raised by the plaintiffs about the genuineness of the scheme.  It was said that there had been âgreatcaution and professionalismâ and âa very great amount of due diligence had been conductedâ.  The plaintiffs were assured thatthe investments into which their monies were to be put bore no resemblance to the supposed scams which had been reported in a leadingfinancial newspaper.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  It is finally alleged that the plaintiffsâ monies were part of a sum of US$4 million which was transferred to a bank account inBrussels; the money disappeared except to the extent that it was known that US$1.8 million was transferred to a senior officer ofthe corporation which held that bank account in Brussels.  Of that money US$512,500 was transferred to the second defendantâs accountin Jersey, US$250,000 was transferred to an account in the name of Day Ltd a company belonging to a person who was alleged to bean associate of the senior officers of the corporation that owned the bank account in Brussels and US$237,000 was paid into an accountof the fifth defendant.  As such, and not surprisingly, it is alleged that the plaintiffsâ monies had been applied in a way otherthan that in which the first, second and third defendants had asserted that they would be applied.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The plaintiffs had pleaded and argued their case on the basis of no less than what was said to be eight different causes of action. The first defendant had taken no part in the proceedings before the judge below and the allegations against it were allowed to remain. In respect of the second defendant the judge held that there were insufficient pleadings for the plaintiffs to mount a claim inrespect of negligence based on what was referred to as the <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability.  However the judge went on to say that there had been sufficient pleadings in the original statement of claim and in theamended statement of claim to found a case under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335">Cap. 335</a> (âthe Ordinanceâ).  The judge, however, referred to what had been termed in the course of argument below the âextended<i>Hedley Byrne</i> liabilityâ.  By this was meant negligent acts as opposed to negligent advice.  The judge considered that there was sufficient inthe unamended pleadings in relation to the transfer of funds from the second defendantâs account without proper safeguards includinga bank guarantee to found an action.  There was no dispute in the court below that the plaintiffs had a viable claim against thesecond defendant for breach of trust and for money had and received.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In respect of the third defendant the judge considered that there were viable claims in respect of negligence both as regards negligentadvice, following the <i>Hedley Byrne</i> case, and what was termed professional negligence as well as negligence in respect of the transfer of the funds under what had beentermed the âextended <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liabilityâ.  The judge also held that there were valid claims under the Ordinance and for breach of trust.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In respect of the fourth defendant the judge held that there were claims under the Ordinance as well as for professional negligencebut not in respect of either of the two <i>Hedley Byrne</i> heads of liability.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In respect of the fifth defendant the judge considered that there had been no pleading which would give rise to a valid cause ofaction.  In particular, although the fifth defendant was named as a director of the second defendant there had been no specific claimmade under the Ordinance in respect of him.  The judge considered that there was a valid claim under the Ordinance against the seventhdefendant.</p>    <p class="heading">This appeal</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  On this appeal Mr Smith SC, who appeared on behalf of the second, third and fifth defendants, argued first of all that there wereno representations made by the second defendant which would give rise to a liability of negligence.  In my view he took too narrowa view of the distinction between a representation and a promise which might or might not be fulfilled.  Saying that the statementson behalf of the second defendant that there would be a bank guarantee in place were merely statements of intention and in the absenceof dishonesty it could not been shown that there was any falsity in that statement, in my view takes a purely semantic point.  Clearlygiven the facts of the present case, investment in FSLPâs, which according to its name meant âfully securedâ investments, was,in itself, it seems to me, such a strange form of investment as to give rise to sufficient doubt that it could exist and the makerof statements who encouraged such an investment almost certainly has to be called upon to establish that he had been in a positionto make those statements and that those statement had not been made recklessly and without reasonable care.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Section 8 of the Ordinance which was in force at the relevant time read as follows as:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â8.

In my view there are sufficient pleadings in respect of negligence and under the Ordinance as well as inbreach of trust by reason of the fact that the pleadings show that the third defendant was intimately involved in the wrongful distributionof the plaintiffsâ monies.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  In respect of the fourth defendant I consider that the pleadings as originally framed and, indeed, as now framed do not demonstratea sufficient cause of action in negligence but they do demonstrate that the fourth defendant could have incurred liability under<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 8</a> of the Ordinance by reason of his having been a director of the first defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In respect of the fifth defendant the difficulty arose that originally there was no specific claim made under the Ordinance.  Neverthelessthe pleadings as originally framed disclosed a claim against the second defendant under the Ordinance and alleged that the fifthdefendant had at all material times been a director of the second defendant.  In those circumstances liability under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 8</a> would follow if the relevant facts were proved.  I consider that therefore that would follow was a matter of law and the plaintiffsshould be allowed to include a prayer for relief.  A claim in respect of breach of trust had always been made against the fifth defendantand in my view given the fact that the fifth defendant was at all material times a director of the second defendant and that thesecond and fifth defendants had both received proceeds of the wrongful distribution of the plaintiffsâ monies, I see no reasonwhy an action for breach of trust was not appropriate.  I would therefore allow the appeal in respect of the fifth defendant in thisrespect and restore the action against him on those bases.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In my view the same considerations apply in respect of the claim under the Ordinance against the seventh defendant as applied inrespect of the fifth defendant save in that case the seventh defendant was a director of the first defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Consideration has been given as to whether the statement of claim, whether in its original form or in the form which was beforethe judge, should be struck out and the plaintiffs permitted to replead their case in a succinct and intelligible fashion as requiredunder the Rules of the High Court.  Nevertheless, as indicated above, the defendants have hitherto taken the stance, by filing defencesand proceeding with discovery, that the pleading was intelligible.  In those circumstances should the plaintiffs wish to plead theircase in a more easily comprehensible fashion, an appropriate application would have to be made separately.  In the meantime the partiesshould attempt to agree a draft order which can be submitted.  In view of the nature of these proceedings I consider that there shouldbe no order as to costs in relation to this appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Le Pichon JA:</b></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(Anthony Rogers)<br />            Vice-President</td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(Doreen Le Pichon)<br />            Justice of Appeal</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Nigel Bedford, instructed by Messrs Weir &amp; Associates, for the 1<sup>st</sup> &amp; 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs/Appellants in CACV 165/2007</p>        <p style="text-align:left">The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in person (Absent)</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Clifford Smith SC, instructed by Messrs Tanner De Witt, for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant/Appellant in CACV 180/2007, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant/Appellant in CACV 181/2007 &amp; the 5<sup>th</sup> Defendant/Respondent</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Nicholas Pirie, instructed by Messrs John M.
