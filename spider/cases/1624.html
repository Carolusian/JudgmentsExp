Introduction</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  The plaintiff commenced this action on 28 February 2002 alleging the defendant has defamed it on 19 February 2002 by way of slander. The defendant denies the allegation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">II.  Background Facts</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The background facts are largely undisputed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The plaintiff is and was an investment adviser and dealer registered under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333" class="autolink_findacts">Securities Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333">Cap. 333</a>).  It is also a recognised sponsor for the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (â<i>Stock Exchange</i>â).  The defendant is and was an employee of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (â<i>HKEx</i>â) and was at the relevant time its Senior Vice President in the China Development &amp; Listing Promotion, Exchange Business Unit(â<i>the China unit</i>â).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In about May 2001, in relation to the possible listing of a mainland state-owned infrastructure enterprise, the Guangzhou MetroCorporation (â<i>GMC</i>â), both staff of the plaintiff and that of the Stock Exchange attended a meeting with representatives of GMC.  The exact role ofthe plaintiff at that meeting is one of the disputed matters in this action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Further, on 19 February 2002, a meeting was held at the office of the Stock Exchange (â<i>the Feb 2002 meeting</i>â).  Among other people, a Mr. Alex Leung of the plaintiff (â<i>A Leung</i>â) and the defendant were present at the Feb 2002 meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">III.  The Alleged Slander</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The statement of claim alleges that the defendant uttered the following words at the Feb 2002 meeting.  Shortly after the meetingstarted, the defendant requested confirmation of the plaintiffâs role in the listing project.  He then said to A Leung:</p>    <blockquote>        âéåé ç®æçæå©åè¤éçåé¡ï¼ç¬¬ä¸åæ¯éåé ç®çä¿è¦äººï¼ä½ ä¸æ¯éåé ç®çä¿è¦äººå§?â    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">A Leung responded by stating to the effect the plaintiff certainly wanted a role in the listing project.  The defendant then saidto A Leung:-</p>    <blockquote>        âä¸è¡â.    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">For convenience, this part of the conversation will be referred to as âthe said wordsâ below.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The plaintiffâs case is that the said words were defamatory of the plaintiff.  The statement of claim pleads that their naturaland ordinary meaning was:</p>    <blockquote>        (a) the plaintiff was wholly unsuitable to be involved as a sponsor in the listing project;        <p>(b) the plaintiff is not competent or sufficiently competent to be involved as a sponsor in the listing project;</p>(c) the plaintiff is not sufficiently reputable or does not have the required ability or capacity to be a sponsor in the listing project;and        <p>(d) the plaintiffâs credibility and standing was such that it would not be appropriate for the plaintiff to act as sponsor in thelisting project.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">This plea is denied by the defence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">IV.  Issues in this Action</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The following issues were raised by the pleadings:</p>    <blockquote>        (1) whether the defendant has uttered the said words;        <p>(2) if so, whether those words were defamatory of the plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">V.

In May 2001, Zhongjing introduced the plaintiff to the GMC listing proposal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">VI.  Credibility of Witnesses</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  There are two objective tests for assessing a witnessâs credibility regarding a matter to which he has testified:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether that part of his testimony is inherently plausible or implausible;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether that part of his testimony is, in a material way, contradicted by other evidence which is undisputed or indisputable (an exampleoften given of such evidence is contemporaneous documents).</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Further, where it is shown that a witness has been discredited over one or more matters to which he has testified (using the abovetests), this fact is relevant to the assessment of his overall credibility.  Likewise, regard may be had to a witnessâs motivefor deliberately not giving truthful testimony.  For example, telling the truth may prejudice his interest, or a just determinationof the litigation may affect his interest.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The principal witness for the plaintiff is A Leung for the obvious reason that he was the only plaintiff witness who was presentat the Feb 2002 meeting.  On the other hand, all 4 defence witnesses were present at that time.  A Leung testified that the saidwords were uttered by the defendant.  (Subject to the plaintiffâs argument set out in para. 58 to 59 below) all defence witnesstestified otherwise.  Hence, it is the words of one witness against four (or two against four if Shumâs out-of-court statementsare also accepted: see under â(b) J Cheungâ below).  Mere superiority in the number of witnesses does not mean the defence caseis stronger: quantity is, of course, not to be equated with quality.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>   The different versions of fact testified to by the witnesses cannot be the result of genuine mistake on their part, and must beresolved by an assessment of their credibility.  The credibility of J Cheung is not challenged by defence counsel (her testimonywill be dealt with below).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>   Although the credibility of each witness is discussed under separate sub-headings below, for the avoidance of doubt, I have assessedtheir credibility bearing in mind the totality of the evidence adduced at trial.</p>    <p>(a)  <u>A Leung</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  A Leungâs testimony is severely attacked by the defence.  He was cross-examined for a sustained period of time.  Out of the 41-pagewritten closing submissions, some 22 pages are devoted to why he should be disbelieved.  In addition, the defence alleges that therewas bad faith on the plaintiffâs part: see pp. 25-29, defence closing submissions.  The implication is that A Leung is trying tohelp the plaintiff (his employer) to put forth an unmeritorious legal action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  In assessing A Leungâs credibility, the opportunity for which he (and the plaintiff) may have to concoct a story about the saidwords should be taken into account.  The Feb 2002 meeting was held at HKEx located at International Finance Centre, Harbour ViewStreet, Central whereas the plaintiff was located at Ice House Street, Central.  It finished at about 5:30 pm on 19 February: para.33, A Leungâs witness statement.  So, by the time A Leung arrived at the plaintiffâs office, it would have been around 5:45 pm.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  If J Cheungâs testimony is to be believed (which, as set out below, I find it should be), the meeting on that day between heron the one part and W Lee, A Leung and Shum on the other part was arranged over the telephone between 5 pm and 6 pm (quite probablyafter 5:45 pm).  It was at that meeting J Cheung was told that the defendant uttered the said words.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Hence, if the plaintiff had in fact concocted the story regarding the said words (and unless the story was concocted before 19 February2002), most probably the concoction must have been carried out before the telephone call to J Cheung; that is, between about 5:45pm and sometime before 6 pm.  Further, according to J Cheung, the meeting took place after 6 pm and before 7:15 pm (and lasted forabout 30 minutes).  If the story was concocted after said telephone call, it would have been concocted between 5:45 pm and sometimebefore the meeting with J Cheung.  The last-mentioned period would at most be about one hour (from about 5:45 to 6:45 pm).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The defence has put forth numerous reasons in support of its argument that A Leung was untruthful.  These reasons are dealt withbelow.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  First, the defence says the plaintiffâs case is inherently implausible.  The defendant asks the court to note the following undisputedfacts:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">at the Feb 2002 meeting, the defendant knew the plaintiff was on the approved list of Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) sponsors.

The pleading alleges the defendant asked for confirmation ofthe plaintiffâs role in the listing project; this was not mentioned in the plaintiffâs letter or the witness statement.  Thewitness statement alleges the defendant mentioned the second complication relating to the listing project was the Shanghai StockExchange; however, this was not mentioned in the pleading or the plaintiffâs letter.  Finally, the plaintiffâs letter and witnessstatement allege A Leung told the defendant the plaintiff might be involved as a co-sponsor; this was not mentioned in the pleading.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The defence also asks me to note J Cheungâs account is different from A Leungâs in that, according to her, at the Feb 2002 meeting,the proposed sponsorship by the plaintiff was said to be one of the two complications and Shum said an additional investment bankwould be appointed if necessary (and the plaintiff could be a co-sponsor).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The defendant contends A Leungâs testimony is incredible because the plaintiffâs case differ as to whether the said words wereuttered shortly after the commencement, or in the middle, of the Feb 2002 meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I agree with the plaintiff that the above differences are minor and insignificant.  They are caused not by lack of credibility butby:</p>    <blockquote>        (6) differences in perception of what are matters worth mentioning by different people at different times; and/or       <p>(7) semantics differences.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Thirdly, the defence argues that one of A Leungâs answers given in cross-examination shows that his account of the Feb 2002 meetingis inaccurate in relation to the following matter.  When he was cross-examined, A Leung maintained the defendant said one of thetwo complications in the listing project was the Shanghai Stock Exchange.  While this is consistent with the plaintiffâs pleading,A Leung contradicted the plaintiffâs pleaded case as regards what was the other complication.  The defence contends A Leung testifiedthat the other complication concerned the need for approval by various mainland authorities; the pleaded case is the other complicationconcerned the plaintiffâs participation as a sponsor.

style="text-align:justify">I disagree with the defence.  A Leung has not testified that the defendant mentioned only two complications throughout the Feb 2002meeting.  I find that A Leung was truthful when he put the defendantâs statement in context.  There is accordingly no contradictionin A Leungâs own testimony.  In fact, some of the defence witnesses (and indeed the defendant) also agreed that the question ofsponsorship was raised during the Feb 2002 meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The defence also criticises A Leungâs testimony relying on his conduct during and after the Feb 2002 meeting.  Although A Leungclaims he felt questioned by the said words, he never asked the defendant to clarify what the said words meant, or to protest againstthem.  Instead he carried on with the discussion.  I accept the plaintiffâs reply that A Leung was trying to keep the atmosphereof the Feb 2002 meeting amicable.  In view that the plaintiffâs client was present and because of A Leungâs position in the plaintiffâshierarchy, it is understandable why he would want to do so.  He probably also felt he would need to seek instruction regarding thematter first.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Fourthly, the defence says that A Leungâs testimony is contradicted by the contemporaneous documents.  I understand the defenceto be referring to e-mails and other documents passing between Shum and the defence witnesses from 19 February 2002 to 22 February2002 in which, not only was there no mention of the said words, Shum thanked HKEx for the support and cooperation by their visitto GMC and Shum mentioned other matters relating to the listing project.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  I do not find the criticisms to be well-founded.  First, since the meeting with J Cheung, the plaintiff has already put forth itscomplaint regarding the said words.  Shum has supported the plaintiff regarding that matter (see under the sub-heading â(b) J Cheungâbelow).  Whether the complaint has been repeated by the plaintiff (or Shum) from 19 February to 22 February 2002 should have littleimportance.  Secondly, these e-mails and documents were intended for the purpose of the listing project.  It is understandable whytheir authors did not mention the incident relevant to this action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Moreover, the defendantâs argument that there was a lack of pre-action complaint against the defendant has to be balanced againstthe early meeting with J Cheung and the issue of the writ herein a few days after the Feb 2002 meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  There are other criticisms levied against A Leungâs credibility in the closing submissions of the defence.  I do not propose toset them out suffice it to say they have been taken into account.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  On the other hand, the plaintiff asks me to find A Leung is truthful.  First, he holds no grudge against the defendant and is onlyan employee of the plaintiff.  Moreover, his account about the said words has generally been supported by Shum on 19 February 2002(see the testimony of J Cheung regarding what Shum during the meeting with her on 19 February 2002: â(b) J Cheungâ below).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Having considered all of the above, as well as A Leungâs demeanour when he testified, I conclude that he is a truthful and reliablewitness.</p>    <p>(b)  <u>J Cheung</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  J Cheung adopted her witness statement as part of her testimony.  Her testimony is in brief as follows.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  She received a telephone call from W Lee between 5 pm and 6 pm on 19 February 2002.  She has known him for about 7 years.  W Leetold her that when his colleague A Leung met representatives of the Stock Exchange earlier that afternoon, the defendant utteredwords which were defamatory of the plaintiff.  He sought legal advice from her.  J Cheung informed him the partners of her firmâslitigation department might be able to help.  W Lee asked for a short meeting with her first.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Between about 6 pm and 7:15 pm on that day, J Cheung attended the meeting at Starbucks CafÃ© where also present were W Lee, A Leungand Shum.  A Leung told her the defendant said the defendant had seen two complications with the listing exercise of the mainlandenterprise, one of them being the proposed sponsorship by the plaintiff.  J Cheungâs witness statement then states:</p>    <blockquote>        â[The defendant] â¦ asked [A Leung], âyou are not going to be sponsor, are you?â.  When [A Leung] replied that they[the plaintiff] certainly desired a role in the listing project, [the defendant] interrupted him and said, âNo wayâ.       <p>As I was told â¦ the relevant conversation was conducted in Mandarin, I asked [A Leung] to repeat the exact words used by [the defendant]in Mandarin.  [Shum] volunteered to narrate the conversation between [A Leung] and [the defendant] in Mandarin â¦ as referred toâ¦ above.  [Shum] mentioned that when [the defendant] interrupted [A Leung], [the defendant] uttered âä¸è¡â.  [A Leung] confirmedthis to be the case.  I then reconfirmed the words âä¸è¡â had been uttered by [the defendant] with both [Shum] and [A Leung].</p>[Shum] also said at the meeting that following [the defendantâs] utterance of âä¸è¡â [Shum] immediately told [the defendant]that if required, an additional investment bank would be appointed and [the plaintiff] could take up a role as a co-sponsor â¦        <p>The meeting lasted about 30 minutesâ (para. 4 to 6 and 8 thereof).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  J Cheung was cross-examined only briefly and it was not suggested that her testimony was either untruthful or unreliable.  Whenthe defendant testified, however, he suggested that J Cheungâs relationship with the plaintiff, W Lee and/or A Leung was unknown. I understand him to be implying that J Cheung might have a motive to be untruthful and her testimony should be considered with thatin mind.  The defendantâs said suggestion was, however, not put forth in the defendantâs written closing submissions (save perhapsa slight hint at para. 37 thereof).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  I have no doubt that J Cheung is a truthful and reliable witness.  I also place great weight on her testimony.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  The defendant asks me to attach little weight to J Cheungâs testimony.  In relation to this, I understand the defence to be referringto the part of J Cheungâs testimony where she related what was said during the meeting.

in mind those provisions in assessing the testimony of J Cheung.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  As regards the narration given by Shum during the meeting, I bear in mind Shum has not been called to testify and hence the defendantwas unable to cross-examine him.  On the other hand, it has not been suggested (and there is no basis for finding) Shum has any motiveto be untruthful.  There is no evidence Shum (or Zhongjing) will stand to gain or lose.  Shum gave the narration very shortly afterthe Feb 2002 meeting.  It is generally consistent with the plaintiffâs case.  In these circumstances, I find Shumâs narrationtruthful and it is appropriate to also place weight on it.</p>    <p>(c)  <u>W Lee</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>   W Lee was not present at the Feb 2002 meeting.  He was, however, present at the meeting with J Cheung on 19 February 2002.  Hisaccount of that meeting generally supports that given by J Cheung.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  I find him to be an impressive witness.  His answers in cross-examination were spontaneous, candid and to the point.  However, becausehe was not present at the Feb 2002 meeting, he cannot provide much assistance to the determination of this action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  W Lee testified that A Leung also told him of another incident showing the defendantâs arrogance towards A Leung and/or Shum. Since I already found that A Leung is a truthful and reliable witness, it is unnecessary to make any finding regarding this matter. If it were necessary to do so, I would agree with the defence that it is strange nothing about this has been stated in any of theplaintiffâs witness statements nor was it mentioned by A Leung at any stage.</p>    <p>(d)  <u>The Defendant</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>   On the other hand, I find the defendant to be a less than impressive witness.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  In the course of cross-examination, defence counsel, by reference to various documents including newspaper articles, advanced thepoint that the plaintiff was well-known as a âbad boyâ in the Hong Kong stock market.  I do not understand this to mean thatthe plaintiff has acted unlawfully but merely that it has acted aggressively and sometimes in an unorthodox manner in some of thestock and share dealings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  When the defendant testified, he denied having any prior knowledge as to the plaintiffâs general reputation, contending in essencethat because his main duties were to market the Stock Exchange in the mainland, he has had practically no knowledge of the localsituation.  I find there is an air of artificiality about this part of his testimony for the reasons set out in the next paragraph.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  I can only infer that the said materials used in cross-examination were provided to the defendantâs legal advisers by lay client. Further, although the defendantâs post required him to market the Stock Exchange in the mainland, it is hard to believe that,being someone employed by the HKEx, the defendant has had absolutely no knowledge of the plaintiff.  In this connection, I assumethat defence counselâs point that the plaintiff is a well-known âbad boyâ in the Hong Kong market is a valid one.  Office gossipsapart, it is conceivable that exchanges regarding the Hong Kong market situation would often come up during contacts with mainlandpersonnel whose companies were interested in coming to Hong Kong to be listed here.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The defendant also asserted in testimony that as a matter of usage in Putonghua, the words âä¸è¡â would not be uttered inthe manner described in A Leungâs testimony.  The defendant has not been put forward as a linguistics expert; he is only a factualwitness.  In any event, I do not accept this assertion.  While not an expert in spoken Putonghua, I have been living in Hong Kong,an essentially Chinese-speaking community, for many years.  Chinese is my native language.  I have the chance of reading many writingworks by authors who should be Putonghua speakers, and watching Putonghua television series and movies and so on.  I have seen thosewords being used in similar manner in daily spoken language on many occasions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  In view of the above, it is strange why the defendant should put forth such an assertion.  I infer that he made up this assertionintending to create an inherent implausibility in A Leungâs testimony.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Having so concluded, I note that people may make things up even when they are honest in relation to matters of real importance ofthe litigation at hand.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In relation to the said words, which is the crucial dispute in this action, I need only to say that the points set out under thesub-heading â(a) A Leungâ have again been considered for the purpose of this sub-heading.  In addition, the defendant is generallysupported by the other defence witness regarding this (see more detailed discussion under the heading â(e) Defence Witnessesâbelow).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Having borne all the above matters in mind, and with some reluctance, I find the defendant to be truthful.</p>    <p>(e)  <u>Defence Witnesses</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>   Witnesses falling within this sub-heading are Lie, Hsu and C Cheung.  As will be set out in more detail below, each of them hasadopted their witness statements as part of their testimony.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The plaintiff has not suggested (whether during cross-examination or final submissions) that any of them has been untruthful orunreliable.  It is the plaintiffâs case that none of these witnesses can assist the defendant because (so the plaintiff contends)in their testimony, they merely said they could not remember if the defendant had uttered the said words.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  I disagree with the plaintiffâs contention.  It is true these witnesses sometimes said they could not recall some of the matters. But these remarks have to be understood in context.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Lie said the following in her witness statement (and therefore her testimony):</p>    <blockquote>        ââ¦ I understand â¦ [the plaintiff] has alleged in its Statement of Claim (as supplemented by its Further and BetterParticulars dated 23 April 2002) that the following conversation took place during the meeting â¦ [the alleged conversation (includingthe said words) was then set out].        <p>I recall that [the defendant] mentioned at the [Feb 2002 meeting] that there were âtwo complicated issuesâ that needed to be addressedâ¦</p>â¦ I have no recollection of [the defendant] saying âno wayâ or the Chinese words âä¸è¡â.  <b><i>[The defendant] definitely did not say any words to the effect that [the plaintiff] could not be a sponsor</i></b>â (emphasis supplied) (para. 12 to 14 thereof).    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Hsu said in her witness statement (and hence her testimony):</p>    <blockquote>        âI understand â¦ [the plaintiff] has alleged in its Statement of Claim (as supplemented by its Further and Better Particularsdated 23 April 2002) that the following conversation took place during the meeting â¦ [the alleged conversation (including the saidwords) was then set out].        <p><b><i>I recall</i></b> that during the [Feb 2002 meeting], [the defendant] mentioned that the listing exercise involved â<i>certain complex issue(s)</i>â â¦</p><b><i>I also recall</i></b> that there were some discussions relating to the sponsorship of the listing exercise but <b><i>I do not recall</i></b> the exchange between [the defendant] and [A Leung] â¦ set out in paragraph 10 above.  <b><i>I do not recall [the defendant] saying the words âno wayâ or the Chinese words âä¸è¡</i>â</b> â¦â (emphasis supplied) (para. 10 to 12 thereof).    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  C Cheung said in her witness statement (and hence her testimony):</p>    <blockquote>        âI understand â¦ [the plaintiff] has alleged in its Statement of Claim (as supplemented by its Further and Better Particularsdated 23 April 2002) that the following conversation took place during the meeting â¦ [the alleged conversation (including the saidwords) was then set out].        <p>â¦ I have no recollection of any discussion such as that described â¦ above.</p>I do recall, however, that [A Leung] said that [the plaintiff] had not yet been appointed as the sponsor â¦ [A Leung] also said thatthe appointment of sponsors â¦ would be put out to tender when the decision to list was confirmed.  [A Leung] mentioned that [theplaintiff] would like to be a co-sponsor â¦        <p><b><i>I cannot now recall</i></b> what [the defendant] said in relation to the topic of sponsorship.  <b><i>However, I have no recollection of [the defendant] saying âno wayâ or the Chinese words âä¸è¡</i>â, or any words to the effect that [the plaintiff] could not be a sponsor</b> â¦â (emphasis supplied) (para. 12 to 15 thereof).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  As a matter of daily language, when a person says that he cannot recall something, that statement usually has either of the followingtwo meanings:</p>    <blockquote>        (a) he cannot remember whether that matter has happened or not;        <p>(b) because that matter has never happened, it is impossible for him to have any recollection about it.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  The tenure of the testimony of the above 3 defence witnesses, when understood in proper context (that is, taking into account thepassages quoted above), is that, when they testified they could not recall the defendant had uttered the said words, they were ineffect saying the defendant has never done so (otherwise they would have recalled it).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Accordingly, I find that these witnesses support the defendantâs case that the defendant has never uttered the said words.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  I also find them to be truthful and reliable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">VII.  Were the Words Uttered?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>   Insofar as is possible, a civil court should avoid accepting the testimony of all witnesses when the factual accounts in theirtestimony differ and contradict each other.  Unfortunately, I find this to be a case where there is no valid reason to prefer thetestimony of witnesses for the plaintiff to those for the defence regarding this issue.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  It is also not a case where any satisfactory conclusion can be reached regarding the witnessesâ credibility or reliability byan observation of their demeanour when they testified.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Apart from the witnessesâ testimony, none of the documentary evidence is sufficient to establish that the said words have in factbeen uttered by the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The burden to prove that the said words have been uttered by the defendant falls on the plaintiff.  By reason of the above matters,the plaintiff has failed to satisfy me this has in fact occurred.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">VIII.  Were the Words Defamatory?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>   The defence contends that the said words were not defamatory.  By reason of the conclusion reached in relation to whether the saidwords were uttered by the defendant, it is strictly unnecessary to make any finding relating to this issue.  I shall do so for completeness.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The process to determine whether words are defamatory is well known: there are two stages, first to decide what they mean, and thento decide whether that meaning is defamatory: <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i> (2004) 10<sup>th</sup> Ed., para. 2.1.  Although it is recognised that there may be difficulty in producing a comprehensive definition of the meaning ofâdefamatoryâ, the following has been offered as (at least) a working definition of its meaning: a defamatory imputation is oneto the claimantâs discredit, or which tends to lower him in the estimation of others or causes him to be shunned or avoided; orexposes him to hatred or ridicule: <i>Gatley</i>, para. 2.1, text to nn. 4 to 7.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  The interpretation of allegedly defamatory words is to be determined by the reasonable understanding of those words by an âordinaryreaderâ, or (as in this case) an âordinary listenerâ: see <i>Gatley</i>, para. 3.14 and 3.24.

However, insofar as itmay be suggested by the plaintiff that its general goodwill has suffered (see para. 83(3) above), I find that it is unlikely thata professional client such as Zhongjing (through Shum) would be so unsophisticated as to be affected by the verbal outburst of oneindividual in its assessment of the plaintiffâs competence, reputation and/or credibility.
