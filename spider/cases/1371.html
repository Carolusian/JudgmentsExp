No defence has been filed but application for summary judgment under Rule 22 of the District Court Civil Procedure(General) Rules (hereinafter referred to as the "General Rules") was refused by the Deputy Registrar on the grounds that the claimis outside the ambit of this Rule. This matter came before me for formal proof. The Defendant was absent on the day of the hearingand Mr. Chan for the Plaintiffs moved for judgment to be entered for the Plaintiffs under Order 19 rule 3 of the Rules of the SupremeCourt in respect of damages to be assessed and for an injunction order under Order 19 rule 7. As an alternative he moved also thatjudgment be entered on the admissions contained or rather deemed to arise on the allegations contained in the Plaintiffs Particularsof Claim by reason of the Defendant's failure to traverse the Plaintiffs' allegation.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> In support of his motion for judgment under Order 19 he argued that despite the presence of Rule 22 in the "General Rules" Order19 rule 3 and rule 7 of the Rules of Supreme Court also applied to proceedings in the District Court by virtue of Rule 9 of the "GeneralRules". He distinguished the case of <u>CHOW Cho-poon</u> v. <u>MA Shiu-poon</u><sup>(1)</sup> in which in an analogous situation it was held that Order 27 rule 11 of the English Rules was not applicable to Hong Kong by virtueof Order 1 rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure which was then applicable in Hong Kong. This rule in the Hong Kong Code (Order 1rule 4) provided that in all cases with respect to which no provision was made by the Code, the English Rules should be deemed tobe in force in the colony, provided that where any subject was dealt with wholly or partly by the Code, the English Rules would bedeemed not to be in force in the colony. The Court held in that case that since the Hong Kong Code dealt with the matter of judgmentin default of defence in the specific instance of a claim for a debt or liquidated demand, either wholly or partly according to one'spoint of view, the English Rules did not apply in Hong Kong. Mr. Chan submitted in effect that Rule 9 of the "General Rules" is notso restrictive and leaves the way open for the application of Order 19 of the Rules of Supreme Court to proceedings in the DistrictCourt. I agree with him. This view is further reinforced by the schedule to the "General Rules" which specifically sets out whichprovisions of the Rules of Supreme Court do not apply in the District Court. Order 19 is not one of them. I am therefore of the viewthat it is open to a plaintiff to invoke Order 19 rule 3 and rule 7 Rules of Supreme Court in the District Court.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> In support of his alternative motion that judgment be entered on the admitted facts under Order 27 rule 3 of the Rules of SupremeCourt Mr. Chan referred to the White Book 1976 at page 448. The note there clearly supports his submission that this rule coversadmissions which are deemed to arise by reason of the defendant's failure to traverse the Plaintiffs' allegations. This rule is alsonot specifically excluded by the schedule to the "General Rules".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The mechanism is therefore provided by the procedure for judgment to be entered on the pleadings as they stand.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The Plaintiffs' Particulars of Claim are as follows:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">"1.

There are four notable exceptions to this rule, but noneof these appears to apply to the 1st Plaintiff. An exception to the general rule would appear to exist in the case of the 2nd Plaintiffunder <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21">Cap. 21</a> (taken from the Slander of Women Act 1881). Whilst a husband and wife are entitled to join as co-plaintiffs in an actionof this sort (Order 14 rule 4(1) Rules of Supreme Court) nevertheless it would appear that the husband cannot sue without proof ofspecial damage, though the wife can (see Gatley on Libel and Slander 7th Edition para. 870). This is the Common Law Rule and it hasnot been clearly overruled by the statute. (See also Street on Torts 6th Edition at page 288). The position would therefore seemto be that the 1st Plaintiff could only succeed on proof of special damage while the 2nd Plaintiff could sue both for special damageand general damages. Special damage should, however, be specifically pleaded. (<u>Rustell</u> v. <u>Macquister</u><sup>(2)</sup>) The rule therefore that applies to the 1st Plaintiff is that he can only maintain an action for slander on his suffering specialdamage which is the natural and probable result of the publications.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> In this case neither Plaintiff has pleaded special damage but each has only claimed general damages. In the circumstances judgmenthas been entered for the 2nd Plaintiff only on the above Particulars of Claim and that judgment is for general damages. So far asthe 1st Plaintiff is concerned Mr. Chan has requested that the matter be left open as he may receive instructions to apply to amendthe Particulars of Claim. He has asked that the 2nd Plaintiff's damages be assessed on the facts as revealed in the pleadings andon the evidence of one witness Mr. TSANG Sang-fat, the village elder referred to in para. 5 of the Particulars of Claim.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> It will be seen that the allegations in paragraphs 3, 5 and 7 really all relate to one particular slanderous allegation by the Defendantinsofar as the 2nd Plaintiff is concerned, which has been repeated on each and all the occasions referred to in these three paragrphs,namely the allegation that the 2nd Plaintiff had committed adultery with one CHAN Chung and was therefore unfaithful to her husband.I am of the view that for the purpose of assessing damages they should be taken to be but one slanderous allegation which has beenrepeated and that this repetition should be regarded as a factor of aggravation of damages rather than that each should be regardedas a separate allegation.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Paragraph 11 of the Particulars of Claim sets out the way in which the 2nd Plaintiff has been injured by the slanderous words. Shehas had to put up with "unwarranted strictures, remarks or jeers from her friends, neighbours and relatives". She has been "shuntedfrom social activities" in the villages in Sai Kung area. The relationship between the 2nd Plaintiff and her husband deteriorated.The 2nd Plaintiff's family relationship deteriorated and the 2nd Plaintiff suffered "great emotional distress and mental agony."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The evidence of the village elder Mr. TSANG Sang-fat also bore out the 2nd Plaintiff's claim. He first of all testified as to thegeneral attitude of the villagers to the sort of conduct attributed to the 2nd Plaintiff by the Defendant and when asked if he noticedany difference in the relationship between this couple and the whole village he testified that the villagers adopted a rather unfriendlyattitude towards them, and in fact ignored the 2nd Plaintiff. He further testified that as village elder he had requested the Defendantto apologise to the couple but that the Defendant refused to do so. Such an apology should be made at a banquet paid for by the Defendantto inform the villagers that the Defendant had made a mistake. This was not done. Mr. Tsang testified that as a year has passed sincethe slander was published "such talks just simply faded away and it hasn't done much to influence the villagers now towards Mrs.Lee" (the 2nd Plaintiff).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The position would seem to be that at the beginning Mrs. Lee suffered a good deal in the ways set out in the Particulars of Claim,but that latterly the suffering has to a very large extent subsided. The fact remains however that she has not been cleared of thisslanderous allegation and the defendant's attitude in refusing to apologise has aggravated the damages, as has her repetition ofthese words. There is clear malice to be inferred from the terms of these words and from the widespread repetition in the Sai Kungarea.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In awarding "aggravated damages" it has been said that "the natural indignation of the court at the injury inflicted on the Plaintiffis a perfectly legitimate motive for making a generous rather than a more moderate award to provide an adequate solatium ............that is because the injury to the Plaintiff is actually greater, and, as a result of the conduct exciting the indignation, demandsa more generous solatium" (per Lord Hailsham L.C. in <u>Broome</u> v. <u>Cassell</u><sup>(3)</sup>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Aggravated damages has been distinguished from exemplary or punitive damages, the former being compensatory in nature whereas thelatter being punitive. The difference is stated simply by Lord Reid in the above case (at page 1089):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The difference between compensatory or punitive damages is that in assessing the former the jury ................ must consider howmuch the plaintiff ought to receive, whereas in assessing the latter, they must consider how much the defendant ought to pay."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The present case is not a case for exemplary damages because it does not fall within the categories laid down in <u>Rookes</u> v. <u>Barnard</u><sup>(4)</sup> which decision, though under attack, was applied by the House of Lords in Broome case (supra).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> I must therefore assess a sum which in my opinion will compensate the 2nd Plaintiff for her hurt feeling and the indignation shesuffered.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Mr. Chan has referred to a number of Hong Kong authorities with a view to assisting the court in this exercise but they all relateto libel actions where subject to one exception the libellous matter was published in newspapers, and where the publication was thereforevery much more widespread.

In case 4 the allegation was very serious (that the plaintiff kept a disprderly house) andthe circulation of the newspaper was large. In case 5 an article in the newspaper falsely alleged that a respectible married womanoperated a dance hall riddled with vice which was raided by police. In case 6 the libel was in respect of drunkenness and what allegedlyresulted from the drunkenness and the article which was published in a newspaper was very offensive.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> It is difficult from these cases to obtain any guide in respect of a slander such as the present where the slander was limited tothe area of Sai Kung in which the Plaintiffs live and related a woman in the 2nd plaintiff's position in the social scale.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> In the case of <u>Russo</u> v. <u>Cole</u><sup>(11)</sup> a woman plaintiff in a similar action in respect of a slander which imputed unchastity or adultery to her was awarded $100 by thejury. The learned judge Davies L.J. commented at page 823:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It was a slander which might well have given rise to substantial damages but the jury in their wisdom did not take that view."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The impression was that the judge considered the award on the low side, but the report does not give many details as it was primarilyconcerned with the question of costs.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Taking all things into account and in particular the nature of the slander, the repetition, the obvious malice, the limited areaof publication, the attitude of the defendant, the humble background of the parties, the general attitude of people in the area ofthe parties' home, which was rather strict and would therefore make the effects more deeply felt and finally the fact that althoughlasting for some time the effects have faded quite considerably I consider that $3,000 would be a fair solatium. I therefore assessthe damages suffered by 2nd Plaintiff at $3,000.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> So far as the claim for an injunction is concerned, it does appear from para. 1379 in Gatley that in cases where slander is actionableperse, the court may grant an injunction restraining any further or future publications of the words complained of if the court issatisfied that the words are injurious to the Plaintiffs and there is reason to apprehend further publication by the Defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> It would seem from the evidence of the village elder that since the "talks faded" as a result of the passing of time, the likelihoodof further publication is fairly remote.
