At about 4:20 in the afternoon, on the roof of a 12-storeyed building at No.4 Ho Tin Street, Tuen Mun, the Hoi Industrial Building a tower under construction, with a base of 2.1M (7') x 2.4M (8') then reaching18.2M (60'), toppled over the edge of the roof parapet wall down to the ground. some 46.5M (153Â½') below. Three workmen came downwith the partially completed bamboo tower and fell to their death</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> There was no eye-witness to the accident except for Mr. Lai Tak Wah who was a metal worker in Ho Tin Street near the Hoi Cheong IndustrialBuilding. He noticed nothing unusual before the fall of scaffolding bamboo tower over the roof, followed by the three workmen. Hedid, however, see the three workmen working on the scaffolding bamboo tower before it fell.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The three deceased workmen were Fung Pat, Chau Kwok Kwong and Poon Wing Hung. I shall refer to them as "Fung", "Chau" and "Poon"respectively. Fung had been a scaffolder for some 39 years. Chau began scaffolding, work at the end of 1979. At the time of his death,Fung was earning $160 a day while Chau $140. Poon was an apprentice.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The personal representatives of Chau and Poon commenced proceedings against their former employer So Chi Keung. Poons claim is inHigh Court Action No. 3058 of 1983 and Chau's claim is made in High Court Action No. 3575 of 1984. In these two actions, the formeremployer, So Chi Keung, joined Fung as the Third Party in their respective third party proceedings. These two actions have been consolidated,but counsel have chosen to keep the pleadings separate.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The personal representatives of Fung also instituted an action against his former employer in High Court Action No. 3693 of 1984.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The Letters of Administration of the estates of Chau and Poon, deceased, were, so the court was informed, granted in 1983. The thirdparty proceedings in these consolidated actions were commenced in May 1985. These third party proceedings are solely founded on aclaim in tort, and they are both time-barred by the now repealed but then operative section (3)(b) of the Law Amendment and Reform(Consolidation) ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap. 23</a>. Therefore in substance, the court is called upon to determine the, claims by the respective estatesof Fung, Chau and Poon deceased, against their former employer So Chi, Kung subject to contributory negligence, if any, as alleged.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> So Chi Keung has throughout been the sole proprietor of his own firm. His brother So Chi Ming worked for him at the material time.He was to solicit business negotiate for the price, supply the material required and inspect the work in progress. As to the methodof construction and safety measure, So Chi Ming was expected to discuss with the experienced skilled scaffolder, Fung. The firm ofso chi Keung has been in the scaffolding building business for several generations and has been under his personal management forsome 20 years.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> So Chi Keung himself was also in charge of "obtaining contracts", but in this case on the 13th June 1981, So Chi Ming, his brother,contracted with Ng Wah Engineering Co. for the erection of a bamboo scaffolding tower of some 83' in height (25.3M) with a base of7' (2.1M) x 8' (2.4M) for $4,500. The work was expected to take 3 to 4 days.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> On the 15th June, the three deceased workers went with So Chi Ming to the roof of Hoi Cheong Building. The bamboo scaffolding towerto be erected was for putting a chimney on the roof by the said Ng wah Engineering Co. On that day, the location of the chimney andthe dimensions of the bamboo scaffolding tower were given to Fung by So Chi Ming. According to So Chi Ming's statement, the workonly started on the 16th June and he was present supervising from 9:00 to 9:30 a.m. Fung, being the only experienced skilled scaffolderin a team of three, was specifically put in charge by So Chi Ming. In the evening at about 6 p.m., Fung returned to the firm fordinner with So Chi Keung and So Chi Ming. So Chi Ming discussed the construction of the tower with Fung and enquired if buildingmaterials were sufficient. Fung disclosed that the tower reached a height of more than 30' (some 9M). As So Chi Ming "was afraidthat it was windy at such a height, (he) asked Fung Pat to tie it with wire when he worked on the next day". Fung had not expressedany personal concern as to the stability of the tower, but "he said that it would be more secure if the scaffold was tied with wire".According to So Chi Ming, as he "had previous experience of building chimney and climbing up scaffold to work", he told Fung "toattach wire to scaffold for safety sake". Therefore, evidently it was not Fung who felt any real need for wiring support. To So ChiMing's enquiry, Fung merely responded that there was not sufficient material and agreed that wiring would provide added security.So Chi Min left it to Fung as to how and where the wire was to be fixed, but So Chi Ming was quite adamant that Fung "promised (him)he would put in wire". According to So Chi Ming, Fung could not countermand his instructions to use wire.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Next day, the 17th June, some more bamboo poles were delivered to the roof together with 3 coils of wire and 4 bundles of nylon strips.There is no evidence of the time of such delivery. What were not included in the delivery are : instruments for cutting the wire,nuts and bolts for securing the wire to a safe anchorage point and drills/explosive bolts for preparing anchorage points on or inthe concrete</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> By the time of the accident, the bamboo scaffolding tower had reached a height of 18.2M (60'). It was a 4-sided bamboo tower tiedtogether by nylon strips. It stood on four main posts described as main, standards at each corner. In between every two there weretwo subsidiary posts, not necessarily touching the ground and therefore not bearing weight. There were 26 parallel horizontal bamboopoles on each side called "ledges" and these ledges were reinforced by five cross bracings called "Kau Char Cheung" all the way up.Material was inadequate on the 16th June when the base standards were erected as more was delivered the next day. For whatever reasonstwo of the main base standards were 100mm (4') in diameter and the other two were 50mm (2') in diameter.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> There was a water tank on the roof of some 6M (20') in height: with iron railings on top.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Mr Kwok, the Labour Department Inspector, visited the scene on the day of the accident. From his observation largely of remnantsof nylon strips and poles, he drew two sketches at p p 75 and 76 of Bundle A. From these observations, he postulated that there werenine bamboo ties, five attached to the railings on top of the water tank, to the scaffolding outs the parapet wall, another one tothe water pipe on the roof level in the same direction and the remaining bamdoo tie to another roof water pipe in the opposite direction.It must be accepted, in my opinion, that the possibility of there being more bamboo ties cannot be ruled out, but it would seem thatthere were no bamboo ties facing the said bounded by the two bigger main base standards, nor in the opposite direction</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The traditional method of erecting a free standing bamboo scaffolding tower is, I find, to have (1) two contraptions in the formas drawn in D1"; subject to variations in size and measurement, at each corner of the 4-sided free standing tower, reaching somewherearound 30' in height and spreading out about 90 apart, called "Tang Cheung"; (2) bamboo structures in the form of "P6" called "KauChar Cheung" with occasional diagonal bamboo reinforcement called "Chair Chiang" tied vertically onto the poles and horizontal ledges;and (3) above the converging contact the Tang Cheung"on top with the tower, sets of wire beginning at that level and upwards, atintervals of 12'to 30'. The wiring, a set of four, should be from each corner and any one wire could take a suitably different bearingto accommodate the anchorage point. Anchorage point must be safely secured to either a strong permanent fixture at embedded intothe concrete with the aid of a drill or explosive bolt. Wiring may substitute "Tang Cheungs" even at a lower level. I further findthat once the 4-sided free standing tower of a base similar to the one under construction reached 28'-30' in height, "Tang Cheungs"or in their place, wiring must be installed. Above that, sets of wire at the desired intervals would have to be attached to the tower.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Mr Wellman is an engineer and his proposed scaffolding tower for the chimney with a base of 20<sup>'</sup> x 20 and internal bracings has certainly much to commend itself, but in my view, further rigidity has not been proved to be necessaryfor any freestanding bamboo scaffolding tower constructed according to the traditional way. As a matter of fact the firmness andworkmanship of the tower were best illustrated in the photographs taken after its fall which show virtually the entire structurestill in one piece.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> I am satisfied that tower like the one under consideration or any free standing tower with whatever base can be safely constructedaccording to the common practice of the trade traditionally followed. The features in that practice are matters of necessary precautionto be taken in the erection of a free standing bamboo tower of those or some other dimensions, and, in my view, if adopted, theyare all that would be required of a reasonably careful and prudent man. In reality these proper safety measures have been habituallypractised by persons in the scaffolding trade for generations. In my judgment, the high standard of care commensurate with the gravityand imminence of the risk of a free standing tower and its erection would be regarded as wholly discharged if these safety guidelinesare observed.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Thus, the crux of the matter lies in the support and stability of the tower in question</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Mr Wellman's design would certainly give further rigidity and stability to the bamboo frame which would probably be more resistantto structural twisting and/or bending. In turn, less stress would be exerted on the smaller 50mm (2') main base standard damagedin this case. However, I have accepted that with the recommended wiring, sufficient rigidity and stability would be achieved.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> I shall deal with the effect of bamboo ties. Possibly there were more. Mr Kwok's inspection of the scene was fairly thorough, andif there had been more bamboo ties, as probably there were, they could not have been very much more.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> So Chi Ming specified the use of wire. There was hardly any warrant for using or contemplating the use of rope. Only wire, not ropewas delivered to the site Mr. Choi Keung, the scaffolding instructor from Construction Industrial Training Authority was adamantthat ropes are shown in some of the photographs, which could be used for stabilizing the tower, but his evidence on the ropes is,to say the least, highly unsatisfactory. He agreed that the string in the middle photograph on p. 120, Bundle A, could probably befor pulling up material The same string, so Mr Choi conceded, is shown in the middle photograph on p.123 Bundle A and therein marked"2". But he maintained that what are marked "1" and "3" in that middle photograph on p. 123 are parts of the same rope and that whatis marked "4" there is yet another rope. He claimed that from his observation"1"/"3" and "4" are different from the one shown onthe top right hand side photograph on p. 121 and that what is marked "3"on the left hand side top photograph on p. 121 is differentfrom the string in the middle photograph on p. 120. In the top left hand side photograph on p. 121, Mr. Choi identified two moreropes, marked "1" and "2". In essence, from the photographs Mr. Choi detected 5 ropes and one string. Possibly Mr. Choi could mean6 ropes if the one lying on the ground in the top right hand side photograph on p. 121 was regarded as different from the one marked"3" in the top left hand side photograph on the same p. 121.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Dealing first with the top left hand side photograph on p. 121, it is fairly obvious that the article marked "1" is a bamboo andthe one marked "2" is a nylon strip. Checking against the other photographs, particularly the top right hand side photograph on p.121 and the middle photograph on p. 120, it can be seen that the rope or string marked "1" and "2" in the middle photograph on p.123 and the one marked "3" on the top left hand side photograph on p. 121 are parts of the same string. "3" and "4" in the middlephotograph on p.123 are clearly bamboos "1" and "3" in the middle photograph on p. 123cannot be from the same rope - "3" is certainlyno continuation of "1". There was, I find, no rope at the scene except for a string or strings for hauling up material. Lastly, Mrchoi keung couid not say from the photographs that any of these alleged rope bad been tied down and, if so, where the anchorage pointwas</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Mr Kwok, the inspector from the Labour Denartment, saw no rope for stabilizing the tower. He also found no anchorage point.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Mr Fung Ah Shing is the present Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Scaffolders Mutual Respect Union. He has been such for threeterms. He visited the scene on the 18th June 1981 and saw no wire or rope for stabilizing the tower</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Mr Cheung Chun Yee, the proprieter of<sup>-</sup>Ng Wah, gave a statement : he visited the scene on the 17th June 1981 about 1 p.m. during the construction and saw no wiring tie.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> There were no tools, equipments for providing any anchorage delivered or found at the scene after the accident. Wire was specificallyinstructed to be used and 3 reels of wire were delivered on the 17th June. When Mr. Kwok visited the scene after the accident onthe 17th June, he saw the same coils of wire unused on the roof.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> In conclusion, I find that there was no wire or rope affixed to the free standing tower for its support/stability or at all.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The bamboo ties described as "Lai Munks" were put up as a matter of expedience, using available material, for providing some temporarysupport to the tower.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Mr So Chi Ming instructed wire to be used for stabilization. Fung was not instructed to erect "Tang Cheungs". I accept that the scaffoldingteam could not ignore the instructions and arbitrarily erect "Tang Cheungs". The diagonal pole shown on the middle photograph onp. 123 is a "Mau Pole". Mr Choi suggested that it reached 30' high to the tower from its base. I prefer Mr Fung's estimate from thephotographs that it reached a height of only '14'. Mr Fung Ah Shing described this vertical "Mau Pole" as one of the two "Lai Munk"poles at different levels for keeping erect and in position, during the initial stage, the main base standard to which other bamboosmight then be added or tied. Mr Choi found a couple of "Mau Poles" in the photographs, but I accept the evidence of Mr Kwok thathe found no sufficient material for the erection of any proper "Tang Cheungs" on the roof. Mr Kwok also detected no sign of any "TangCheung" on his visit. I find that there was no "tang Cheung" erected or, on the balance of probabilities, even attempted.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Consequently, I accept the accuracy of the sketch drawn, by Mr Kwok at p.75 of Bundle A subject to the missing "Mau pole" servedas "Lai Munk" for one of the main base standards as shown in the middle photograph at p. 123 and possibly subject also to a few more,but not too many, bamboo ties.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Mr Kwok further advised that for a tower of these dimensions, the 4 main base standards should be in fir poles and if fir poles werenot available, then bigger poles should be used. He further testified that it was unsafe to use poles of different sizes for the4 main base standards.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Mr. Bharwaney must be correct when counsel submitted that the real complaint in this case is that wire was not used as instructed.Instructions were given by So Chi Ming to have wire put up on the workmen's return to work the next day, the 17th June. The towerhad reached 30', and Mr So Chi Ming had decided, from his previous personal experience, that wiring support was needed for stability.Fung was an experienced old hand, and there is no reason to suspect that as the tower rose, he would not himself, at some stage,suggest one or the other traditional supports, althugh he was then not too concerned. On being instructed to use wire on his returnto work the next day, he only commented "that it would be more secure if the scaffold was tied with wire" If Fung had carried outhis instructions and put up wiring in the traditional way with which he ought to be familiar, on my findings no accident would haveoccurred.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> I further find, apart from the lack of support by wire, the using of different size main base standards with two of 50mm as beingnegligent. In this case "Tang Cheungs" were not contemplated and the bamboo ties were insufficient. In the opinion of Mr Wellman,a force of as little as 49 lbs, equivalent to a very slight wind, or a shifting from the centre of gravity for even l'2" would topplea stricture such as this assuming that there was no lateral support. In my judgment, the accident was caused, wholly or partly inconjunction with other possible factors, by the instability so created or aggravated.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> I further accept the postulation of Mr Wellman made on the height of the parapet wall and its distance to the tower that the 3 workmenmust have been on the tower some 30' above at the time of the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> It has been conceded that So Chi Keung owed a duty of care to his workmen either by himself, his brother or Fung. Mr Chan, counselfor the defendant, Submitted that there was no negligence in this case in which the traditional method of erection had been resortedto. In my findings, the traditional means had not been wholly followed, such as in providing lateral support by wire or rope withthe optional "Tang Cheungs" at a lower level and in using equal size main base standards for a fair distribution of weight bearing.The contention of Mr Chan, on behalf of So Chi Keung, must therefore fail. The parties are ad idem on the authorities as to liabilityand I need not repeat them.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Not only were fir poles not chosen as the main base standards, different size poles were used. The defendant must have failed toprovide sufficient and proper material, and I so find. The defendant also failed to provide adequate epuipments for cutting wireand preparing anchorage points. The tower as partially "erected was not a safe place of work, and these deceased workmen were workingon an unsafe structure. Later, I shall deal with the defendant's lack of any or any effective supervision in his negligent constructionof the bamboo tower without any or any proper wiring standing on different size main base standards.</p>    <p>How is blame to be shared between So Chi Keung and Fung, the deceased skilled scaffolder in charge? The speech of Lord Reid in <u>Ross v. Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd.</u><sup>(1)</sup> said of what is to be expected of an employee thus:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"The owner of a factory who has given proper instructions and has provided proper equipment cannot make provision against disobedienceeither of his own servant or of the servant of a contractor who is working in the factory. But it is his responsibility to see thatproper instructions are given and proper equipment is available. Whether the work is to be done by a person fully skilled in thattype of work he may say go and plan out the work and come back and discuss the matter if you have any difficulty: or cannot findthe equipment you need'. ........... No account has been taken of the reluctance which a man in Ross's position would naturally feelin going to a chief engineer uninvited to ask for extra equipment the provision of which would entail at least some delay and expense........(Theemployer's chief engineer) cannot be absolved from all blame because he ought not to have been content to use makeshift equipment,but it appears to me that the failure of the (employer) to take any step to see that proper equipment was available contributed agreat deal to the accident."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> Fung was a skilled, experienced scaffolder. He was specifically instructed to put in wire on his return to work the next day butwas not provided with the necessary paraphernalia. There was no cutting tool and there were no instruments for preparing and securinganchorage points. In hind sight, it must be counsel of perfection that he should have instantly stopped work and reported the sameto his employer or So Chi Ming with a request for proper tools and equipments. Fung was paid at a daily rate as a permanent/casualworker. There is no evidence as to whether suspension of work would or would not affect his pay or draw adverse criticism from hisformer employer. It was not unreasonable for him to expect So Chi Ming to visit the site on the 17th June. Such expectation coupledwith a probable reluctance on the part of a workman like Fung to stop work set the scene for his inaction. All this is but theoreticalguesswork. However, it is always easy to be critical after the event. Fung was working at the material time, and for a man on thejob, he could be more readily forgiven for not making a correct or wiser instantaneous decision. As a matter of fact, it is unclearas to precisely when the wire was delivered to the site. Besides, it was not a particularly windy day. He did put in some makeshiftsupport in the form of the bamboo ties or "Lai Munks". Probably he did the best he could with the available material without muchado or stopping work. In the light of his own impression the night before "that it would be more secure if the scaffold was tiedwith wire" and not that it would be unsafe not to have it done, it would be highly inappropiate, in my view, to hold Fung responsiblefor any large portion of the blame. The situation must have been the same for the smaller main base standards.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> So Chi Ming should have visited the site on the 17th June and supervised the immediate installation of the lateral wire support.So Chi Ming gave specific instructions to Fung. It is fairly apparent that he relied on his own judgment at least as much, if notmote, than the expertise of his scaffolder in charge, particularly when So Chi Ming had previous personal experience and was evidentlyconcerned on the night before. He should have ensured that the scaffolding team were suitably equipped and that his instructionsfor safety measure were duly obeyed.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> To do the best I could, I would apportion as to 70% to the defendant and 30% to Fung. Chau was a new hand. By time, he was not fully-qualified,joining the trade only at the end of 1979, although his daily wage was only $20 short of that to Fung. However, Fung was the manput in charge and not Chau, and instructions to use wire were given to Fung. There is no evidence how knowledgeable Chau was or whetherhe was aware of the wiring instructions. Contributory negligence on the part of Chau has not simply been established. Poon was anapprentice. He had every reason to be on the scaffolding even at that height for passing material despite his having the use of astring. According to Mr Choi Keung, hauling up of material was to be in a small bundle, two short poles at a time. It can be appreciatedthat handing up of bamboos, especially long poles by hand would be more efficient if not more practical. Poon was not even allowedto tie the nylon strips. There is no evidence that. Poon had, in any way, acted contrary to instructions or against the interestof the team. Poon could not in my view, be said to be himself negligent.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Subject to apportionment of the awards on account of minor interests and approval of the court, quantum is a matter of agreementbetween counsel: $300,000 for Fung's claim; $600,000 for Chau's claim and $400,000 for Poon's claim. I have been assured by counselfor the plaintiffs that the agreed quantum would not lead to complication. Subject to this, I grant judgment in the sums of the agreedquantum accordingly. The third party proceedings are statute-barred, and I need proceed no further. As for the Fung's claim, $300,000is to be reduced by 30%. Subject to what counsel have to say, costs should follow the event in favour of the plaintiff in each actionagainst the defendant and in favour of the Third Party in the third party proceedings.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(B.
