It was co-hosted by the 1st defendant and a Mr Mak Shing Fai. This was the first episode of a "new season" of theprogramme focussing on the activities of the news media.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p4" name="p4">4.</a> In introducing the programme the 1st defendant said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"ååè¬è¿åæ¯è¼ç±éåå³åªè©±é¡ï¼æè¿å¢å¤§å®¶é½å¯è½æçæå°Uhå³åªä¹éåå¾å¸«ä¿¡æ»¿å¤©é£åï¼åæ¯äººè¦ºå¾å¢ä¾å®¶ä¿åªæ½®æµèäºç¸è¸è¸åã"</p>        <p class="quote">"Let's talk about a relatively popular topic among the media. Recently everyone might notice that solicitors' letters are flying everywhereamong the media - makes people think whether there is not a trend of treading on each other."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p5" name="p5">5.</a> I will refer to this as "the first statement".</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p6" name="p6">6.</a> This statement was followed by Mr Mak saying that not only were there many disputes, but there had been a number of cases pursuedlegally. He said one day he opened the Oriental Daily News (a newspaper published by the 2nd plaintiff) and found three such casesreported on one page. The footage of various newspaper clippings was then shown on screen, with a voice-over by the 1st defendantrecounting a number of incidents in which the Oriental Daily News was suing or threatening to sue others in the news media. Amongthe matters related by the 1st defendant was the following: The 2nd plaintiff ("Oriental") had, a few days before, published a noticecomplaining of an item in another newspaper, the Hong Kong Economic Times, to the effect that a reporter facing a fraud charge wasat the time of the alleged crime an Oriental Daily News employee. Oriental threatened to institute legal proceedings. Subsequentlythe Hong Kong Economic Times had to publish a correction to the effect that the reporter was, at the time of the incident, <em>not</em> an Oriental Daily News employee, though he did become such an employee <em>after</em> the incident. An apology was issued.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p7" name="p7">7.</a> There was then a discussion between the 1st defendant and Mr Mak. The 1st defendant said a features writer had felt frightened afterreceiving a solicitors' letter concerning a programme called the "Pearl Report" in which he had taken part: This programme concernedan English language newspaper, the Eastern Express, published by the 1st Plaintiff ("Eastern"), a company in the Oriental Press Group.Mr Mak then remarked on the number of legal actions going on and asked if there was an attempt to monitor the media by means of legalprocess.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p8" name="p8">8.</a> Then the 1st defendant said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Uhæ³å¾åï¼ä½ å³åªæ¢ä¿è¦å®æ³åå¦ï¼åä½ä¿ååäººå°å³åä¿ååæå°åä½ ï¼ä½ é½è©±å¥½åæ»¿æï¼è©±è¦åä½ ï¼åå³ä¿å¥½ä¼¼æ³åäººå«äººæ¶è²ååã"</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Uh, the law, you media must abide by the law, but if every time other people mention about you only incidentally you then say youare not satisfied and want to sue, this is akin to frightening people into keeping their mouths shut".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p9" name="p9">9.</a> The plaintiffs alleged that this statement (except for the opening words "Uh, the law, you media must abide by the law") was defamatory.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p10" name="p10">10.</a> I will refer to this as "the 2nd statement".</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p11" name="p11">11.</a> The plaintiffs commenced legal proceedings in June 1995 claiming damages for libel. They complained of defamatory imputations containedin both statements. The trial judge (Yuen J) by her judgment dated 23 April 1998 found that the 1st statement was not defamatory.As to the 2nd statement the judge found that the words complained of were defamatory of Oriental, but as they constituted in substancefair comment on a matter of public interest, Oriental's claim for damages was dismissed. The judge found that the 2nd statement didnot refer to Eastern. Accordingly both plaintiffs' claims were dismissed.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p12" name="p12">12.</a> On appeal to the Court of Appeal, both plaintiffs succeeded as regards the 2nd statement, though they failed in seeking a reversalof the judge's finding in relation to the 1st statement. The Court of Appeal (Liu and Leong JJA and Yeung J) held, reversing thejudge, that the defence of fair comment failed. It also held that the words complained of referred to <em>both</em> plaintiffs and awarded damages as follows: $20,000 to Eastern and $80,000 to Oriental.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p13" name="p13">13.</a> The defendants, being dissatisfied, appeal with leave to this Court seeking a restoration of Yuen J's order.</p>    <p class="heading">The defamatory imputation</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p14" name="p14">14.</a> This piece of litigation focusses on a few words said in the course of a half-hour television programme, on a subject of considerablepublic interest. Whilst the offending words were uttered in accordance with a script prepared by the staff of Radio Television HongKong beforehand, they were nevertheless words used in a colloquial sense. Ordinary people in everyday speech do not craft their languageas if they were lawyers drawing up a legal instrument, nor would their listeners understand them in this way. People often use wordsloosely. Words used in everyday speech often do not convey precise meanings; and the sense can to some extent be affected by howthe emphasis is placed in articulation.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p15" name="p15">15.</a> The judge, in considering how the ordinary television viewer would consider the 1st statement, concluded that the words complainedof indicated nothing more than a reference to a trend of parties in a fiercely competitive business environment treading on eachother: This was not imputation of improper behaviour and the 1st statement taken as a whole was not defamatory. But as regards the2nd statement the imputation was not simply that Oriental was <em>prone</em> to threaten legal proceedings whenever it was mentioned, even incidentally, but also that it <em>appeared to want to frighten people into keeping their mouths shut.</em> The judge rejected defence counsel's submission that Oriental's action simply had the <em>effect</em> of frightening people into silence and there was no imputation of the <em>purpose</em> of the action. The judge said this disregarded the word "æ³" "want to" in the phrase. She said it was immaterial that the defamatoryimputation was conveyed by suggestion, in a hypothetical or question form (by the introductory words "åä½ä¿" "But if ..."). Shealso said that in arriving at her conclusion she had taken into account the tone of voice and the facial expression of the makerof the statement in ascertaining the message conveyed.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p16" name="p16">16.</a> These are well-reasoned and clearly articulated findings of fact.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p17" name="p17">17.</a> Mr Robert Tang SC, counsel for the defendants, submits that the meaning conveyed to the general viewer by the offending words wouldhave been nothing more than this: <em>If</em> someone threatened to sue whenever criticized, however incidentally, it <em>would</em> give the appearance of wanting to frighten others into silence by the use of such bullying means. In other words, the entire statementwas nothing more than supposition and comment and the judge was wrong to have found a defamatory imputation. Mr Pow, junior counselfor the plaintiffs, argues that this would give a stilted meaning to the words "åä½ä¿" "but if".</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p18" name="p18">18.</a> This demonstrates the fluidity of everyday language. Both shades of meaning are possible. The trial judge had carefully weighed themeaning of the words complained of, had identified the "sting" of the imputation in those words and found them defamatory: That isto say, would tend to lower Oriental in the estimation of ordinary people viewing the television programme. This was essentiallya question of fact. In these circumstances it would take a much stronger case than this for this Court to come to a view differentfrom that of the judge: Particularly where, on this issue, the intermediate appellate court has come to the same conclusion as thejudge.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p19" name="p19">19.</a> I turn then to the defence of fair comment.</p>    <p class="heading">Defence of fair comment</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p20" name="p20">20.</a> It is a defence to an action for libel that the words complained of, though derogatory of the plaintiff, are fair comment on a matterof public interest. It is a matter of balance. There is a public interest in the airing of views honestly held on matters of generalconcern even if those views be prejudiced or exaggerated. On the other hand, one cannot go too far and a defendant actuated by malicecannot rely on the defence.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p21" name="p21">21.</a> How then does the defence of fair comment arise in the present case? And how did it fail in the Court of Appeal? It is necessaryto revert to the beginning.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p22" name="p22">22.</a> The judge in considering this issue first identified the comment as pleaded by the defendants as fair comment in their defence. Itwas simply this: that "the plaintiff appeared to want to frighten others into silence". This was a comment on Oriental's behaviouras identified in the first part of the statement: "... if every time other people mention about you only incidentally you then sayyou are not satisfied and want to sue ... ". This, in turn, was an observation on, and a reference to, the various episodes shownin the voice-over.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p23" name="p23">23.</a> Plainly, if "every time" is to be taken literally, and the defendants were able to point to only <em>one</em> occasion when Oriental had acted in the over-sensitive and bullying way as suggested in the statement, then the comment on its behaviourcould be said to be unfair. But if the words "ä½ä¿åå" "but if every time" were to be taken as a figure of speech, and the firstpart of the statement were understood as no more than an imprecise comment on the footage of the various clippings shown in the voice-over,then the question must still be asked: Was the comment <em>fair</em>? A comment can hardly be <em>fair</em> if there was no substructure of fact to justify it. But where there are <em>some</em> facts underpinning the comment, the court must then look to those facts - the weight and substance of those facts - to decide theultimate question: Was the comment <em>fair</em>?</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p24" name="p24">24.</a> The episode found by the judge as justifying the comment was the Hong Kong Economic Times report of the criminal case referred toearlier in which the Oriental Daily News was mentioned 3 times. The only mistake in that news story was as to the <em>time</em> when the accused was an Oriental Daily News reporter. The prosecution case was set out in some detail. The description of the accusedin that case as "a former reporter of the Oriental Daily News" was accurate: The error was in saying that he was such a reporterat the time of the alleged crime. For my part, in reading that article as a whole, I would be inclined to agree with the judge thatthe reference to Oriental was "incidental", for the thrust of the article was on the activities of the accused person back in June1992; the identity of the accused person's employer at that time was not relevant to the charges he faced. The article did not suggestotherwise. But that is not the real point as far as this appeal is concerned. The question ultimately for the trial court to decidewas simply whether the comment that Oriental appeared to want to frighten people into silence was <em>fair</em>. Opinion may reasonably differ as to whether the reference to Oriental in that article was more than "incidental". On the assumptionthat Oriental had been seriously defamed by the reference to the accused as a "former reporter of the Oriental Daily News" in thatarticle, then the steps it took against the publisher of that article could hardly be said to show over-sensitivity or a bullyingtendency. But if the reference to Oriental was incidental, not central to the article, it could well justify the comment. This issuewas one for the trial judge to resolve, and unless the view formed by her was plainly wrong on the evidence or she had misdirectedherself on the law in some way, the Court of Appeal was not entitled to interfere.</p>    <p class="heading">The Court of Appeal</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p25" name="p25">25.</a> The Court of Appeal, in reversing the judge, took two points: (1) In that story the reference to Oriental was more than "casual"or "incidental"; (2) One incident alone could not be "regarded as evidence of a persistent attitude describable by the words åå<em>every time</em>" as used by the 1st defendant in the programme.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p26" name="p26">26.</a> As to (1) above, I disagree with the Court of Appeal, for the reasons already stated. But that is not the real point. As mentionedearlier, views may reasonably differ as to whether the reference in the article to Oriental was "incidental" "casual" or somethingmore than that. It was essentially a matter for the trial judge to resolve.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p27" name="p27">27.</a> As to (2) above, the Court of Appeal said that by the use of the words <em>every time</em> in the offending passage, it "focussed on time", and since there was only one isolated incident found by the judge as the factualfoundation for the comment, the defence of fair comment could not succeed. This was, with respect to the Court of Appeal, to takethe words "åå" "every time" far too literally. The statement was in a sense rhetorical and was not, as the Court of Appeal said,"focussed on time". It is of some significance that in their statement of claim the plaintiffs, whilst alleging the most damagingsense which the words complained of could bear, did not plead the meaning given to those words by the Court of Appeal.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p28" name="p28">28.</a> But all this is beside the essential point. The question as to whether the pleaded comment was <em>fair</em> is not reached simply by numbers. The weight and substance of the underlying facts on which the comment was based had to be weighed.In this regard, the judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Secondly, there is a sufficient substratum of supporting fact for the comment. I have found that the Hong Kong Economic Times' report(containing an error only in the time of the accused reporter's employment with the Oriental Daily News) was indeed a matter wherethe Plaintiff was referred to only incidentally, and the Plaintiff did voice its dissatisfaction and reserve its right (in its noticeof 6 March 1995) to pursue the matter against the Hong Kong Economic Times by legal means over that error. As I have found, a reasonableviewer would regard such an assertion of reservation of right to sue as a threat of legal proceedings. These supporting facts weretrue. This incident was one of the events expressly referred to in the voice-over prior to the 2nd statement, and would be clearlyunderstood by the reasonable viewer to be one of the matters on which the comments was based."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p29" name="p29">29.</a> As to the ultimate question: Was the comment "fair": the judge said that it was "cynical and even possibly prejudiced against theplaintiff, but it was a comment which an honest person could have made". She therefore found in favour of the defendants on theirdefence of fair comment.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p30" name="p30">30.</a> In my judgment, Yuen J was entitled to reach this conclusion upon the evidence. The grounds upon which the Court of Appeal reversedher were unwarranted.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p31" name="p31">31.</a> Mr Griffiths SC, in his submissions to us, took what might be described as a pleading point in dealing with the defence of fair comment.It is unnecessary to deal with it in this judgment. In neither of the courts below did the issue turn on a pleading point. This isthe type of case where the actionable harm done to the plaintiffs, if there be any, turned on what has been called an "impressionisticview" formed in the mind of the average viewer of the television programme. Finely chewing over the words used, matching them againstthe pleadings, tend more to distort the issue than to elucidate it.</p>    <p class="heading">Did the statement refer to the 1st plaintiff?</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p32" name="p32">32.</a> The offending statement did not expressly refer to either of the two plaintiffs. It is therefore necessary to turn to the newspaperclippings shown on television and to what the 1st defendant said in the voice-over to decide whether the ordinary viewer would havecome to the view that Eastern was referred to. It was the publisher of the newspaper Eastern Express, an English language newspaper.The entire television programme was in Cantonese. There were two episodes, among the 5 referred to in the voice-over, where the EasternExpress newspaper was mentioned. But the publisher was never named and in the episode relating to the newspaper's editor, Mr Vines,the voice-over named the Oriental (the parent company of Eastern) as the plaintiff in the action for defamation. And in relationto another episode involving the Pearl Report (an English language programme shown on TVB), when an apology was tendered, TVB apologizedto Oriental, even though it was the Eastern Express newspaper which was referred to in the Pearl Report and not the Oriental DailyNews. The judge, after a careful evaluation of the evidence, concluded that Eastern was not implicated in the defamatory statementand dismissed the case against it on this ground. The judge found that the offending statement referred to Oriental because it wasmentioned several times in the voice-over; it was "the high-profile entity known to be behind the Eastern Express". These are findingsof fact arrived at by a trial judge after a careful examination of the evidence.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p33" name="p33">33.</a> The Court of Appeal, in over-turning the judge's finding, referred to a number of English cases: <strong>Hayward v. Thompson</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20QB%2047" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 QB 47</a>, <strong>Knupffer v. London Express Newspaper Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1944%5d%20AC%20116" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1944] AC 116</a>, <strong>Hough v. London Express Newspaper Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1940%5d%202%20KB%20507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1940] 2 KB 507</a> and to passages in <em>Gatley</em> on <em>Libel</em> 9th edition paragraph 7.1: the purpose of which escapes me. I have found it difficult to determine the grounds upon which the trialjudge's findings were set aside. At one point in Liu JA's judgment (with which Leong JA and Yeung J concurred) he appears to saythat <em>because</em> Eastern was a member of the Oriental Press Group and the group was referred to, this pointed to the conclusion that Eastern was identifiedin the statement. If this was what the learned Justice of Appeal meant, it was plainly an error.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p34" name="p34">34.</a> It is unnecessary to analyse the Court of Appeal's judgment on this issue any further because, for the reasons I have given earlier,the defendants' appeal must be allowed on the defence of fair comment. It is sufficient to say that Yuen J's findings of fact onthe issue of identification of Eastern should have not been disturbed.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p35" name="p35">35.</a> I would allow the defendants' appeal and restore the trial judge's order, with costs to the defendants here and below.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Mr Justice Ching PJ :</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p36" name="p36">36.</a> I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the judgments of Litton PJ and Sir Anthony Mason NPJ. I agree that this appealshould be allowed for the reasons they give. I add only the following. In the course of the appeal we were informed that at trialthe parties left it to Yuen J, a bilingual Judge, to decide upon whether or not the certified translations of the passages of whichcomplaint was made were correct. That is not a practice to be recommended. It is for the parties to challenge a translation if theyare of the view that it is inaccurate and, in that case, to put forward what they say is the correct version.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Mr Justice Bokhary PJ:</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p37" name="p37">37.</a> I associate myself with Mr Justice Ching PJ's observation in regard to translations.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p38" name="p38">38.</a> I, too, would allow this appeal in regard to both respondents. There is only one issue of difficulty in the appeal. It is whetherthe Court of Appeal was right to reverse the trial judge's decision that the defence of fair comment had been established in answerto Oriental's claim.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p39" name="p39">39.</a> As far as Eastern is concerned, I have no difficulty in concluding that the Court of Appeal was wrong to reverse the trial judge'sfinding that there had been no reference to Eastern. That finding by the trial judge was, in my view, plainly right.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p40" name="p40">40.</a> Leaving fair comment to one side, the other grounds on which the appellants attack the Court of Appeal's decision in favour of Orientalinvolve challenging concurrent findings of fact. And while not abandoning such grounds, Mr Robert Tang SC for the appellants verysensibly recognized and acknowledged his great difficulty in showing that this is one of those rare and exceptional cases in whichthis Court would disturb concurrent findings of facts. In my view, this case is not such a case.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p41" name="p41">41.</a> What is left, therefore, is the issue of fair comment. I have not found this issue an easy one. But having considered what Sir AnthonyMason NPJ has added to what Mr Justice Litton PJ has said, I find myself in agreement with them and the other members of the Courtthat the trial judge's decision on fair comment ought not to have been disturbed by the Court of Appeal, and ought now to be restoredby us.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Sir Anthony Mason NPJ:</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p42" name="p42">42.</a> I agree with so much of the reasons of Mr Justice Litton PJ as relate to the conclusions that the second, but not the first, statementcomplained of conveyed a defamatory imputation and that it defamed the second, but not the first, respondent. I agree also with theconclusion that the defence of fair comment was made out.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p43" name="p43">43.</a> In order to express my reasons with respect to the defence of fair comment, I need to supplement the statement of facts containedin the judgment of Mr Justice Litton PJ.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p44" name="p44">44.</a> The structure of the programme "Media Watch" is not without significance. The relevant and principal part of the programme beganwith the so-called first defamatory statement</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Recently, everyone might notice that solicitors' letters are flying everywhere among the media, people will tend to think whetherthere is now a trend of trampling on each other."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>There followed the statement by Mr Mak</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Yes. Not only are there many disputes but there are quite a number of legal actions as well. The other day I read the "Oriental DailyNews" and surprisingly, there were 3 such cases on the same page."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p45" name="p45">45.</a> This statement was the precursor of the voice-over segment which was a substantial section of the programme. In that segment, thenarrator (the first appellant) mentioned five separate incidents, including, it seems, the three cases referred to earlier by MrMak. Of the five incidents, four related to the Oriental Press Group the publisher of the "Oriental Daily News" and the owner ofEastern Express Publisher Ltd. (the first respondent) which in turn published the "Eastern Express" newspaper. Of the four incidentsinvolving the Oriental Press Group, two were instances reported in the "Oriental Daily News", one being an alleged incorrect accountpublished in the "Hong Kong Economic Times" of an interview with Louis Cha, the other being a misreport in the same publication thata journalist charged with fraud was working at "Oriental Daily News" when the offence was committed. The narrator stated that theOriental Press Group claimed that it reserved the right "for legal actions" in relation to these two incidents. According to thenarrator, "Hong Kong Economic Times" later published a notice of correction stating that the journalist was working at another newspaperat the time of the offence and began to work at "Oriental Daily News" later. "Hong Kong Economic Times" later apologised for theerrors and in the same issue provided "coverage" of Oriental Press Group suing the ex-editor of "Easter Express" for defamation,this being the third incident involving Oriental Press Group.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p46" name="p46">46.</a> The final incident related to a coverage of "Eastern Express" in an episode of Pearl Report broadcast on Pearl TVB. According tothe narrator, TVB published a half-page notice of apology in several newspapers and admitted that part of the content about "EasternExpress" was not supported by the facts. The narrator stated that before publication of the apology, the "Oriental Daily News" provided"coverage" of TVB. The narrator said that "Hong Kong Economic Journal" also published an apology for quoting part of the "Pearl Report".</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p47" name="p47">47.</a> At the end of the voice-over segment, the first appellant, after remarking that a columnist who commented on the "Pearl Report" hadreceived a solicitors' letter, said "how frightening". Mr Mak then exclaimed.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Wow, so many legal actions, is it that legal process has to be mobilised to monitor the media?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The programme then concluded with the first appellant making the second statement complained of as defamatory, namely</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"but if every time other people mention about you only incidentally you then say you are not satisfied and want to sue, this is akinto frightening people into keeping their mouths shut".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>That statement purported to draw conclusions from the incidents narrated in the voice-over segment. First, there was the suggestionthat whenever the Oriental Press Group was mentioned, even if only incidentally, it wanted to sue. Then there was the comment thatthis was tantamount to frightening people into silence.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p48" name="p48">48.</a> The primary judge found that the "sting" of the concluding statement</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"was not only that the Plaintiff was prone to threaten legal proceedings whenever it was mentioned, even incidentally, but also thatthe Plaintiff wanted to frighten people into keeping their mouths shut".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The primary judge re-stated this formulation of the imputation on other occasions in her judgment, without departing from the substanceof it.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p49" name="p49">49.</a> The judge rejected the defence of justification because the appellants' plea of justification did not extend to the whole of the"sting" as found by the learned judge, namely the concluding words ("that the Plaintiff wanted to frighten people into keeping theirmouths shut").</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p50" name="p50">50.</a> Having rejected justification, the judge upheld the defence of fair comment, a view with which the Court of Appeal disagreed. Inconsidering the issue of fair comment, I accept that the English translation of the words spoken by the first appellant includedthe expression "every time" or "whenever" and that the imputation must be considered on this footing.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p51" name="p51">51.</a> In so far as the first part of the concluding comment rested on the use of that expression, it appeared to convey that it was a conclusiondrawn from the instances mentioned in the voice-over. Of the instances involving the Oriental Press Group, the primary judge foundthat only one involved the Group incidentally or casually and that was the incident in relation to the report of the individual chargedwith fraud. It can be said that the reference to his being an employee of "Oriental Daily News" was not only incorrect but was givenundue prominence and resulted in the name of that newspaper being featured in the headline, alongside another sensational headline,in the report in the "Hong Kong Economic Times". To give this degree of prominence to the "Oriental Daily News" in the report ofa charge of fraud with which it had no connection at all was not an exercise in responsible journalism. However, in my view, whenthe report is read in its entirety, the learned judge was correct in holding that the mention of the "Oriental Daily News" was incidentalto the thrust of the substance of the report. The reader of the report would not have gained an impression that the newspaper wasa party to the alleged fraud.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p52" name="p52">52.</a> In order to make out the defence of fair comment the Appellants had to show that (i) the defamatory imputation was comment; (ii)the comment was based on true facts; (iii) the comment was fair; and (iv) it was on a matter of public interest. It must also appearthat the publication was not actuated by malice. No question arises as to the public interest requirement or malice. It is not indispute that the publication was on a matter of public interest and malice was not raised.</p>    <p class="heading">Comment or statement of fact?</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p53" name="p53">53.</a> The question whether something is a statement of fact or a comment is, in many situations, one of great difficulty. The principalproblems arise, as Hammond J pointed out in <strong>Awa v Independent News Auckland Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%203%20NZLR%20701" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 3 NZLR 701</a> at 705-706, when the defamatory imputation ascribes bad motives to a plaintiff. At times there has been a tendency to regard statementsascribing bad motives or dishonest conduct to a plaintiff as statements of fact rather than comment so as to require a defendantto prove justification.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p54" name="p54">54.</a> Here, however, it is clear from the structure and content of the programme that the concluding remarks by the first appellant constitutedcomment, not a statement of fact. The first part of that comment represented a conclusion drawn from the instances previously discussedand the last part of the comment was an inference drawn from the first part of the comment. An inference or deduction from factsmay properly be regarded as comment (see Gatley on Libel and Slander 9th ed, 1998, para. 12.10; <strong>Kemsley v Foot</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1952%5d%20AC%20345" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1952] AC 345</a> at 356-357).</p>    <p class="heading">Was the comment based on facts truly stated?</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p55" name="p55">55.</a> The comments were based on the facts narrated in the voice-over segment. The judgments of the courts below proceed on the footingthat those facts were truly stated. Indeed, it was not argued on the appeal to this Court that those facts were incorrect or weremis-stated in any relevant particular.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p56" name="p56">56.</a> There is, however, the question whether the first part of the comment - the "every time" or "whenever" conclusion - should be regardedas a mis-statement of the facts on which the concluding part of the comment was based rather than a comment. Although this argumenthas force, it seems to me that in the context of the programme the "every time" or "whenever" inference formed part of what was anentire concluding comment. It is one of those inferences of fact which is really a comment by the person making the inference.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p57" name="p57">57.</a> In this respect, the important point, arising from the structure of the programme, is that the viewers were able to assess the entireconcluding comment for what it was worth against the background of the facts stated in the voice-over. It was not a case in whichthe basic facts were mis-stated so as to leave the viewer entirely at the mercy of the commentator. See <strong>Kemsley v Foot</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1952%5d%20AC%20346" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1952] AC 346</a> at 356; Harper and James, <em>Torts</em> (1956) ed. (at p.458), cited in <strong>Awa v Independent News Auckland Ltd</strong> at 706. The viewer of a television programme does not have as much of an opportunity to assess the worth of a commentator's commentas does the reader of a printed work. But the same principle must apply to each situation.</p>    <p class="heading">Was the comment fair?</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p58" name="p58">58.</a> The critical question in this case is whether the comment was fair. That question turns on the relationship between the facts andthe comment made upon them. The respondents make two points: first, that, in only one of the incidents was the Oriental Press Groupmentioned "incidentally"; and, secondly, that once this is accepted the first part of the comment is inaccurate when it mentions"every time" or "whenever". In other words, if the fact is that, on one occasion when A was mentioned only incidentally, A sued thepublisher, it may not be legitimate to say whenever A is mentioned only incidentally, A is prone to sue the publisher. It can bean error to universalize from a single instance.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p59" name="p59">59.</a> This criticism of the first part of the concluding comment might well be fatal if the law required a comment to be "warranted". Butthat is not the law.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p60" name="p60">60.</a> In <strong>Merivale v Carson</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281887%29%2020%20QBD%20275" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1887) 20 QBD 275</a>, Lord Esher MR stated the question in this way :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Would any fair man, however prejudiced he might be, or however exaggerated or obstinate his views, have written this criticism?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Subsequently, in <strong>Turner v Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1950%5d%201%20All%20ER%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1950] 1 All ER 449</a>, Lord Porter said (at 461) that, in that statement "honest" should be substituted for "fair" in order to avoid any suggestion thatreasonableness is required. See also <strong>Silkin v Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1958%5d%202%20All%20ER%20516" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1958] 2 All ER 516</a> where, in his summing-up to the jury, Diplock J. (at 518) described the expression "fair comment" as "a little misleading" and statedthat a verdict for the defendant only means that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"You think that a man might honestly hold those views on the facts".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p61" name="p61">61.</a> It was once thought that the defence of fair comment when applied to imputations of dishonest or dishonourable conduct required ahigher standard of justification. It was even suggested that the comment must be a correct inference from the facts (see <strong>Hunt v Star Newspaper Co. Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1908%5d%202%20KB%20309" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1908] 2 KB 309</a> at 320-321, per Fletcher Moulton LJ; <strong>Homing Pigeon Co. v Racing Pigeon Co.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281915%29%2029%20TLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1915) 29 TLR 389).</a> Later cases favoured a less stringent standard such as whether the comment was fair and could reasonably be made (<strong>Stevens v British Medical Association</strong> (The Times, 8 May 1915, cited in Gatley or Libel and Slander 9th ed. 1998 para. 12.25). Subsequently, that standard gave way to thetest whether the comment was such that a fair-minded man might honestly make it (<strong>Peter Walker &amp; Son Ltd v Hodgson</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1909%5d%201%20KB%20239" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1909] 1 KB 239</a> at 253; <strong>London Artists Ltd v Littler</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%202%20QB%20375" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 2 QB 375</a> at 392-393, 399).</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p62" name="p62">62.</a> There are strong arguments to support the view that there should be no special rule governing fair comment as applied to the imputationof corrupt or dishonourable motives (see Gatley on Libel and Slander 9th ed (1998) para. 12.26). The existence of a special rulegenerates complexity and problems of line-drawing. Moreover, in a society in which there is a constitutional guarantee of freedomof expression, no narrow approach should be taken to the scope of fair comment on a matter of public interest as a defence to anaction of defamation. And, in any event, it is likely that an honest person's opinion would necessarily take into account the needfor added caution when an accusation of corrupt or dishonourable conduct is made.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p63" name="p63">63.</a> In this case, however, it is unnecessary to decide this vexed question or the question whether the special rule would apply to acase such as the present. It cannot be said that the entire concluding comment is such that no person, whether fair-minded or not,could honestly hold that opinion.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p64" name="p64">64.</a> I agree with the orders proposed by Mr Justice Litton PJ.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Chief Justice Li:</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p65" name="p65">65.</a> The Court unanimously allows the defendants' appeal and restores the trial judge's order, with costs to the defendants here and below.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">(Andrew Li)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">(Henry Litton)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="34%">(Charles Ching)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">Chief Justice</td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">Permanent Judge</td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="34%">Permanent Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Kemal Bokhary)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Sir Anthony Mason)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">Permanent Judge</td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">Non-Permanent Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Robert C.
