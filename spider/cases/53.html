<p> </p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a> This is an action for damages for defamation and for malicious falsehood in respect of an article published in the Apple Daily newspaperon 7 October 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> It was common ground at the trial (although not before) that the article referred to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiff</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The Plaintiff, a solicitor, was born in 1961. She was brought up in Hong Kong and graduated from the University of Hong Kong witha degree in social sciences in 1984.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Whilst working as a social worker, the Plaintiff studied for the London University external degree in law. She passed the EnglishLaw Society Final Examinations in 1990 and became a trainee solicitor in a small firm in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The Plaintiff was admitted as a solicitor in 1992. For one year after that, she worked as an assistant solicitor at another smallfirm. She then moved to Deacons, where she worked in the Conveyancing Department from 1993 to 1995.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The Plaintiff left Deacons to set up her own firm in Yuen Long, New Territories after the birth of her first child.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The Plaintiff's husband, a chartered estate surveyor by profession, is an indigenous villager of Yuen Long. In 1995, their firstchild, a daughter, was born. The child was looked after by the Plaintiff's in-laws at their home in Yuen Long. The Plaintiff wantedto take care of the child personally after work, but the long working hours at Deacons and the traveling time between Deacons' officeand Yuen Long made this inconvenient.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> In November 1995, the Plaintiff established "Jessie Chu &amp; Company" in Yuen Long as a sole proprietor. In mid-1997, her officewas at Yuen Fung Centre. Her practice was mostly in conveyancing. Clients were gained through her husband's connections and alsothrough his father and brother who knew many members of the local community.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> In February 1997, the Plaintiff had become pregnant but miscarried in the first trimester. More than a year later, in April 1998,the Plaintiff conceived again as a result of a planned pregnancy. The baby was due in February 1999. The Plaintiff had some vaginalbleeding in August 1998 and she was admitted to hospital for treatment. She was discharged home after 10 days.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The article in question was published on 7 October 1998. The Plaintiff was greatly distressed by it (details of her condition appearlater in this Judgment). About a week after its publication, she started to feel abdominal pains and 5 days after that, she suffereduterine contractions and had a small amount of vaginal bleeding. She consulted her gynaecologist, who prescribed medication in anattempt to stop the uterine contractions.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The uterine contractions however increased and 8 days later, the Plaintiff was admitted to hospital where she received medical andpsychiatric treatment (details of which appear later in this Judgment).</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> After about 21/2 weeks in hospital, despite efforts to prolong the pregnancy, she gave birth prematurely to a boy on 15 November1998 after a gestation period of 27 weeks and 4 days. The child was very weak at birth and was in a life-threatening state for sometime.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The Plaintiff was discharged from hospital a week after giving birth. The child was discharged in late February 1999, more than 3months after birth.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The Plaintiff has continued to suffer from depression. In August 1999, she resumed working half-days at her firm, and in April 2000she resumed working full-time.</p>    <p class="heading">The Defendants</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> It is common ground that the 1st Defendant was the proprietor and publisher of the Apple Daily, a popular Chinese-language newspaperin Hong Kong. The 2nd Defendant was the printer and the 3rd Defendant, its editor.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> In October 1998, the average daily circulation of the Apple Daily was 415,500 copies. It also had a web-site which carried certainstories of the day.</p>    <p class="heading">The Article</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> On 7 October 1998, an article was published on the front page of the Apple Daily. It took up two-thirds of the bottom half.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> There was no dispute at the trial as to the meaning of the words in the article, nor was there any dispute as to translation.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The headline was:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Suspected to have cheated clients' building funds and second mortgage loan proceeds Yuen Long female solicitor disappeared with 2million".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The original Chinese version is set out at the end of this Judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The first four paragraphs of the article stated:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A female solicitor who operates a solicitors firm in Yuen Long is suspected to have cheated building funds and second mortgage loansfrom three clients, totalling over $2m., and disappeared with the money. The Law Society made a report to the police after havingreceived complaints from citizens. The police has now classified the case as theft and fraud.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The suspect is a female solicitor surnamed Siu, aged about 35, married, who commenced practice in 1992, operating a solicitors firmas a sole proprietor at Castle Peak Road, Yuen Long, dealing in legal matters relating to sale and purchase of properties and mortgages.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Chief Inspector Chan Tsan-wing, Assistant Commander (Crime) of the Yuen Long District Police Station, stated that a report had beenreceived last month from the Law Society that a solicitors firm suspected to be involved in criminal offence had closed suddenly.Later, the police contacted the two victims. They separately made a report to the police that they had instructed the solicitors'firm to deal with procedures, and each had lost $1m. building funds and loans.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Chan Tsan-wing stated that the police had gone to the female solicitor's residence for investigation, but was unable to make contactwith her, and her solicitors firm had also ceased business. Besides, it was learnt from the Law Society that other clients of thesolicitors firm involved in the case have no problem, and that the Law Society would refer them to other solicitors firms".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The original Chinese version is set out at the end of this Judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> There then followed four further paragraphs describing how the victims had lost money through their dealings with the "female solicitor".Although the Plaintiff's name did not appear in these paragraphs, it is clear from the article as a whole that she was the "femalesolicitor" in question.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The article was accompanied by a colour photograph of a reception area behind a pair of glass doors. The name of a firm was displayedon the wall behind the reception desk. The Chinese character of the Plaintiff's surname could be easily seen and the English name"Jessie Chu &amp; Co." could be faintly seen. There was no one in the photograph. The caption read:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The solicitors firm of female solicitor surnamed Chu located at Castle Peak Road, Yuen Long, has already been left vacant".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The original Chinese version is set out at the end of this Judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The article was also accompanied by a pictorial depiction of how clients had been defrauded of money, and there was a smaller articlewhich referred to the Law Society's professional indemnity fund for losses suffered by clients.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The article was also published on the Internet edition of the Apple Daily.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> It is this article that the Plaintiff alleges was defamatory of her, and for which she claims damages.</p>    <p class="heading">Apology</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> It is common ground that the Plaintiff had done none of the things referred to in the article. The day after the publication, anapology appeared in the Apple Daily from the Editorial Department of the 1st Defendant. It stated:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Regarding the article in the previous day's newspaper 'Yuen Long female solicitor disappears with $2m', this newspaper has receivedverification from the police that it was urgently looking for a solicitor suspected of absconding with funds, but not the femalesolicitor surnamed Siu referred to in the article.

Leading Counsel for the Defendants accepted that "the content of the libelwas very serious and the impact and injury on the Plaintiff's feeling was great". Indeed, for a solicitor who has to deal with clients'money daily, for whom honesty and integrity are prerequisite, one can think of very few defamatory statements more serious than these.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The issues at trial were:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) can the Defendants rely on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Ordinance</a>?</p>        <p>(iii) are the Defendants liable for malicious falsehood?</p>        <p>(iii) what is the proper quantum of damages?</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> The interesting issues relating to damages are:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) in law, is the Plaintiff entitled to recover in an action for defamation damages for mental and physical injury, being depressionand pre-term delivery?</p>        <p>(2) in fact, was the depression suffered by the Plaintiff and her pre-term delivery caused in whole or in part by the defamation?</p>        <p>(3) should aggravated damages be awarded?</p>        <p>(4) should exemplary damages be awarded?</p>        <p>(5) if exemplary damages were to be awarded, should the House of Lords decision in Broome v Cassell &amp; Co  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%201027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 1027</a> be followed, with the result that the exemplary damages should be limited to the lowest sum for which any of the defendants couldbe held liable, or has the Common Law rule relating to joint tortfeasors been abolished by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5</a>-<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">6</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Liability (Contribution) Ordinance</a> cap. 377?</p>        <p>(6) what was the Plaintiff's loss of business profits if any?</p>        <p>(7) what is the correct award of general damages?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(8) should special damages be awarded separately from general damages?</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(i) The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Ordinance</a> defence</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> This defence is based on Lord Campbell's Libel Act 1843. The requirements are that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) the libel was inserted in the newspaper without actual malice;</p>        <p>(ii) the libel was inserted in the newspaper without gross negligence; and</p>        <p>(iii) there was an apology before the commencement of the action or at the earliest opportunity afterwards.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This defence is not however valid unless there was a payment in "by way of amends".</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> The burden is on the Defendants to establish that the three requirements of this defence has been fulfilled. If the Defendants failto do so, the defence fails (<em>Gatley on Libel and Slander</em> 9th ed. paragraph 18.12).</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Even if all the requirements are fulfilled, however, the Defendants do not succeed in the action, in my view, unless the amount paidin meets the award of damages (see fn 87 <em>Gatley</em> paragraph 18.15). This must be so because the payment in is in full satisfaction, as a plaintiff cannot take it out and seek to carryon with the action to recover further damages. A lesser sum than the award, which the plaintiff is justified in refusing, would notbe payment of a sum "by way of amends", and would not validate the defence.</p>    <p class="heading">Insertion of apology</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> I turn to the requirements of the defence. Clearly the third requirement has been fulfilled. An apology had been inserted on 8 October1998 before the commencement of the action on 10 October 1998.</p>    <p class="heading">Insertion without actual malice</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> As for the first issue whether the libel was inserted without actual malice, it is first necessary to consider the evidence as tohow the article was inserted.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> The Defendants' evidence comprised that of Cheng Ping Wah, then the Senior News Editor of the Apple Daily.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Cheng's evidence was that on Friday 2 October 1998, a public holiday, he received a telephone call on the Apple Daily hotline froma person who did not give his full name or means of contact. This person complained that a solicitor practising in Yuen Long haddefrauded clients in the manner later set out in the article and had absconded with funds. No details of the solicitor were given.The caller said that the Law Society had reported the matter to the police. This part of Cheng's evidence was not substantially challenged.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The next day, 3 October 1998, Cheng obtained confirmation from Chief Inspector Chan Tsan-wing, Assistant Commander (Crime) of theYuen Long District Police Station, that a report had indeed been made of deception by a solicitor in the locality. However, Chengwas not given details of the solicitor involved. This has been confirmed by the police.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Cheng's evidence at trial was that on 5 October 1998 (the day of the Mid-Autumn Festival), Cheng's colleague Lau Kwong Kwun (whohad since been imprisoned for obtaining information from police-associated sources unlawfully) told him that the police had visitedpremises of the solicitor in question which were on either the 2nd floor or the 5th floor of Yuen Fung Centre.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> On 6 October 1998 (being a public holiday), Cheng visited Yuen Fung Centre himself. He said he went to the 2nd Floor but did notsee any solicitors' offices on that floor. He went to the 5th Floor, where he saw the Plaintiff's office premises, so he assumedthat the solicitor in question was the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> He also said in evidence at the trial that he had asked the watchman of Yuen Fung Centre whether police had visited any premisesin the building recently. He claimed the watchman had said that he thought the police had been to the 5th Floor.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> He then asked his friend(s) in the legal profession about personal details of the Plaintiff, such as her age, year of qualification,and type of practice. He then wrote the article in question. He embellished it, such as by writing that the police had been to thePlaintiff's residence but could not find her there. This was based on his own inference that the police were likely to try to lookfor the solicitor in question at home, and his deduction that a solicitor absconding with funds would not likely have remained athome.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> The next day, 7 October 1998, the article was published. Complaints were received the same day from solicitors acting for the Plaintiffand from the Law Society. Cheng then found out from his source that the solicitor in question was a Chan Hon Ching who had practisedfrom the 2nd Floor of Yuen Fung Centre. He sent a colleague to Yuen Fung Centre again, and Chan's previous occupation of premiseson the 2nd Floor was confirmed by the presence of a letter written to him which had been posted up on the door of one of the officeunits. Cheng said that since the letter had not referred to Chan as a solicitor, he had not been alerted during his own visit tothe possibility that Chan was the solicitor in question. This part of his evidence was not substantially challenged.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> The issue is whether the article had been inserted without actual malice. The Court would have to consider whether the article hadbeen inserted without an honest belief in its truth, or in knowing indifference to whether it be true or false, or where the personresponsible had purposely abstained from making inquiries which would have revealed the truth, or where he had deliberately stoppedshort in his inquiries in order not to ascertain the truth (<em>Gatley on Libel and Slander</em>, 9th ed. paragraphs 16.13 - 16.16).</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Cheng's evidence was tested in cross-examination. Of those parts of his evidence which were substantially challenged, I accept hisevidence that he had obtained the information on 5 October 1998 about the office premises of the solicitor in question from Lau.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> Lau's name did not appear in Cheng's Witness Statement, which in fact contained no reason for his visit to the 5th Floor of YuenFung Centre on 6 October 1998. However I accept that Lau's name had not been previously revealed because Cheng wanted to protecthim. Indeed Lau's name was only revealed by Cheng in the course of cross-examination after legal submissions on privilege and afterhe was given legal advice from leading counsel with the consent of the Plaintiff's leading counsel.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> Further I have noted that Cheng's Witness Statement did not explain why he went to the 5th Floor on 6 October 1998. I do not acceptCheng's evidence that a watchman had told him that the police had visited the 5th Floor and that was what led him to that floor.There was nothing in his Witness Statement about such an incident, it is an incident that he could not have forgotten given the factthat a writ was issued within 3 days of the article, and (unlike his colleague Lau) Cheng would have had no reason to protect thewatchman.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> However I accept that Lau had told him that the office of the solicitor in question was on either the 2nd Floor or the 5th Floor.When Chan's identity became known to Cheng on 7 October 1998, Chan's name was included in the draft apology proposed by the AppleDaily that very day (even though the name did not eventually appear in the apology published the next day). This shows that Chan'sinvolvement was not made up <em>ex post facto</em> in an attempt to explain the article. It is not disputed that Chan's office had been on the 2nd Floor. Further it is not disputedthat Chan's nameplate had been removed from the directory on the 2nd floor.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> If Cheng had known earlier that the solicitor in question was not the Plaintiff but was Chan, there would have been no reason forhim not to have published the correct identity. The article would still have been just as good news. The above is therefore consistentwith Cheng having made a most unfortunate mistake, but not with his having inserted the article with actual malice.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> The Plaintiff's counsel submitted that account should be taken of the fact that some matters in the article had been fabricated suchas the allegation that the Law Society had reported the matter to the police, that the police had visited the Plaintiff's home, andthe photograph with the caption that the Plaintiff's office had been left vacant (when the photograph had been taken on a publicholiday). Cheng admitted in cross-examination that he had made assumptions and deductions and embellished the article with them.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> However, having accepted that (a) he had first been given information from an unnamed caller on the newspaper's hotline, (b) thePlaintiff was unknown to Cheng, (c) he had obtained confirmation from Chief Insp Chan that a report had been made of fraud by a solicitorin Yuen Long, (d) his source Lau had told him that the premises of the solicitor in question was on the 2nd Floor or the 5th Floor,(e) Chan's office had been on the 2nd Floor but (f) no solicitors' nameplate appeared on the 2nd Floor at the time of his visit,I find that Cheng had not inserted the article without an honest belief in its truth, or in knowing indifference to whether it betrue or false, or had purposely abstained from making inquiries which would have revealed the truth, or had deliberately stoppedshort in his inquiries in order not to ascertain the truth, but was rushing to publish a "scoop". I find therefore that the libelhad been inserted without actual malice.</p>    <p class="heading">Failure to prove insertion without gross negligence</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Having said that, I find that the Defendants have failed to show that the libel had been inserted without gross negligence. Cheng'sassumptions and deductions had been made too carelessly. He could and should have waited the next day (7 October 1998, being a workingday) to observe whether the Plaintiff's firm would open for business. He could and should have verified the Plaintiff's identityas the absconding solicitor with the Law Society and Chief Insp Chan the next day. Whilst they might not have revealed to him theidentity of the solicitor in question, they would have informed him that the Plaintiff was <em>not</em> that solicitor (as in fact they did after the article was published).</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> There was no or no adequate explanation from Cheng as to why he could not have done those acts, any one of which would have revealedthat he had made a most unfortunate mistake. I therefore find that the s.4 defence has not been established by the Defendants.</p>    <p class="heading">(ii) Claim for malicious falsehood</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> As for the cause of action in malicious falsehood, the Plaintiff would need to prove malice. As I have mentioned above, I find thatthe Defendants had not inserted the libel with actual malice or recklessly, but had been grossly negligent in doing so. That wouldnot be sufficient to found an action for malicious falsehood.</p>    <p class="heading">(iii) Damages</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> I then come to damages. The heads of damages claimed are general damages comprising (a) compensatory damages, including a generalloss of business profits, (b) aggravated damages and (c) exemplary damages. Special damages being actual pecuniary loss suffered,including medical expenses and fees in specific cases, have also been claimed.</p>    <p class="heading">Compensatory Damages</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> I shall deal first with compensatory damages. It is well-established that general compensatory damages serve three functions: theyare to console the Plaintiff for hurt and distress suffered, to repair the harm that has been done to his reputation (including hisbusiness reputation) and to vindicate his reputation.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> The factors to be taken into account have been set out in the Elton John case, <strong>John v MGN Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20QB%20586" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] QB 586</a> at 607. First and foremost, the Court considers the gravity of the libel. The libel in the present case is an attack on the honestyand integrity of a solicitor. It is well-recognized that "a lawyer's practice is founded and maintained upon the basis of a goodreputation for professional integrity and trustworthiness. It is the cornerstone of a lawyer's professional life" (<strong>Church of Scientology v Hill quoted in Robert Chan Hung Yuen v Hong Kong Standard</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%204%20HKC%20519" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 4 HKC 519</a>, 534).</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Further, one must consider the Plaintiff's reputation. The Plaintiff had a good reputation in Yuen Long, the area referred to inthe headline and the article. This was deposed to by Chan Chee Shing, a solicitor who had been employed by the Plaintiff just beforethe publication, and by Mr Lee Yuet Man, one of the clients who gave evidence. He said the Plaintiff was the only solicitor he couldtrust in Yuen Long. The Plaintiff herself said that because of her local connections, a number of local people whom she did not personallyknow knew of her. The article would therefore have had a more acute effect on her reputation in Yuen Long, as contrasted with a libelof an anonymous lawyer in the city, not living and working in a small circle.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> The Court should also take into account the fact that the libel was published on the front page, in large eye-catching print, ofa newspaper enjoying a wide circulation. Apart from the more than 415,000 newspapers sold, the article was also carried on the internetedition, although the hit-rate is not known.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> The above factors show that this was a particularly serious libel with grave consequences. Having said that, the Court would takeinto account the fact that an apology was published the next day. Unfortunately, the apology did not explain why the Plaintiff hadbeen named in the article, and this left a query in the Plaintiff's mind which caused her continued distress.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> Dealing first with compensatory damages, I shall first turn to the distress and hurt suffered by the Plaintiff for which generaldamages are meant to be consolation. The issue in the present case is whether the Defendants are liable for injury to the Plaintiff'smental and physical well-being. The Plaintiff suffered depression, and also had pre-term delivery of the child she was carrying atthe time of the article which delivery was, on the Plaintiff's case, due at least to a material extent to the stress caused by thepublication.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> I shall first deal with the issue whether in <em>law</em>, depression and pre-term delivery are within the ambit of damages in an action for defamation. I shall then deal with the issue of<em>fact</em> as to whether the article did cause her to suffer depression and the pre-term delivery.</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Damages for mental and physical injury recoverable in law</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Mr Edward Chan SC, leading counsel for the Defendants, has referred me to a number of English decisions for his proposition thatonly damages for distress may be awarded in an action for defamation, and that injury by way of mental or physical illness is notcompensable.</p>    <p class="heading">The English cases</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Allsop v Allsop  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=5%20H%20%26%20N%20534" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">5 H&amp;N 534</a>, decided in 1860, was a case of slander, a cause of action which required proof of special damage. A slander was spoken of a marriedwoman. She fell ill and her husband incurred expense in attempting to cure her. Those expenses were relied upon as the special damagefor the cause of action. It was held on demurrer that no cause of action had been shown.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> The ratio stated was that the type of special damage required in an action for slander must be the natural or necessary result, notdepending on "the peculiarities of the particular individual".</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> There was also a fear that if such special damage for bodily injury were allowed, then mental suffering would also be included, andall slander would then become actionable, whereas the law was "jealous as to actions for mere words".</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> In my judgment, the first reason can no longer hold good. That decision was given long before the law developed the "egg-shell skull"principle in the tort of negligence. It is now clear that there is no difference between an "egg-shell" skull and an "egg-shell"personality (<strong>Page v Smith</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20AC%20155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 AC 155</a>, 185). A tortfeasor must now take the plaintiff as he finds him, whether the plaintiff is prone to a particular physical illnessor a particular psychological or mental illness.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> I see no reason why that should not also apply to the tort of defamation. In <strong>Humphreys v TWT Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20120%20ALR%20693" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 120 ALR 693</a>, the Federal Court of Australia upheld the judge's holding that on the matter of damage to the plaintiff's feelings, there was noreason why the ordinary tortious principle, that the defendant must take the plaintiff as he finds him, should not apply in the fieldof defamation as it applies to other aspects of tort law  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=113%20FLR%20402" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(113 FLR 402</a>, at 418).</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> As for the second reason in <strong>Allsop</strong>, that was clearly a policy decision relating to the cause of action of slander, which is not applicable to a libel action such asthe present one.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> I obtain some support for the view that <strong>Allsop</strong> is outdated from the criticism of the decision in McGregor on Damages 16th ed 121.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> The decision in <strong>Allsop</strong> was followed the next year in <strong>Lynch v Knight</strong> (1861) 9 HO Cas 577, also a case of slander. In that case, the plaintiff's husband forced her to leave him and to return to her father'shouse, whereby she lost the consortium of her husband. The Court held that the husband's conduct was not a natural and reasonableconsequence of the slander and was not a pecuniary loss. It added nothing to the ratio in <strong>Allsop</strong>.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> I was also referred to <strong>Wheeler v Somerfield</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%202%20QB%2094" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 2 QB 94.</a> There a plaintiff, who acted in person, sought to argue that his cataracts had deteriorated as a result of a libel. Lord DenningMR said (at 104) that he had never heard of a case where a man has been allowed to claim damages in a libel action for injury tohis health. He said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A libel action concerns injury to reputation and not injury to health. I can imagine that there might be cases in which a libel mightcause injury to health. I would not exclude the possibility of such an action. But none as yet has ever appeared in the books. Andthis will not be the first".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> In that case, the plaintiff failed on the facts as his own medical evidence could not prove that the cataracts were due to the libel.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> As for Lord Denning's comments, it is noted that he recognized that there could be cases where a libel might cause injury to health.However insofar as he was saying (<em>obiter</em>) that a libel action concerns <em>only</em> injury to reputation and not injury to health, that would appear to be at variance with one of the functions of damages in defamation,which is the consolation of distress and hurt suffered by a plaintiff, matters clearly pertinent to at least psychological health.</p>    <p class="heading">The Australian cases</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> In Australia, there have been a number of cases where the courts have held that injury to health is compensable in an action fordefamation.

The defendant failed in an attempt to strike out thepleading.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> Allsop was discussed in detail by the judge who declined to follow it for reasons consistent with those set out in paragraph 73 above.The judge held that the law of causation in relation to an action for defamation should be no different from that in relation toactions for other torts. Where illness fairly and naturally resulted from the defamation, there was no reason to limit the damages.Support was found in the American Restatement of the Law of Torts that "one who is liable to another for a libel or slander is liablealso for emotional distress and bodily harm resulting therefrom which is proved to have been caused by the defamatory publication,or in the absence of such proof, for such emotional distress as normally results from such a publication".</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> In <strong>Mirror Newspapers v Jools</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=65%20ALR%20174" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">65 ALR 174</a>, a doctor who had been the subject of a defamatory article suffered depression for which he had to seek medical treatment. The FederalCourt of Australia upheld the judge's award which included compensation for damage for the effect on the plaintiff's health.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> In <strong>Sattin v Nationwide News Pty Ltd</strong> (Sup Ct of NSW Common Law Division 20229 of 1994), the plaintiff had commenced an action in defamation against a newspaper. She thensought leave to amend her claim to include a claim in negligence for personal injury. It was held that there was no duty of careon the newspaper publisher not to publish false matter so that the claim in negligence failed, and her claim in negligence was disallowed.However she was given leave to amend her claim in defamation to include the claim for personal injury.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> In my view, damages for defamation are intended primarily to be compensatory. Thus, even though there may be <em>no</em> evidence of actual hurt to a plaintiff's feelings, the law <em>presumes</em> that a plaintiff would be distressed by defamatory words published of him and allows general damages to be awarded.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> Where hurt to the plaintiff <em>in fact</em> takes form (e.g. in emotional stress or psychiatric illness), it would be irrational and illogical that the law, which seeks to compensatea plaintiff when presuming him to be distressed, would not compensate a plaintiff who actually suffers substantial hurt caused bythe same act, so long as the form of hurt can be proved to flow naturally and directly from the tortious act of defamation.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> I can see no policy reason against awarding damages for mental or physical injury which is proved to flow naturally and directlyfrom the defamation. The plaintiff would be the primary victim of the tort. In negligence cases, a primary victim can recover forthe physical effects of shock. In <strong>Page v Smith</strong>, supra. the plaintiff was awarded damages for a miscarriage brought about by nervous shock. The situation should be <em>a fortiori</em> for an action for defamation. There is a more direct relation between the plaintiff and the defendant. The plaintiff has to provethat the defamation referred to him, so there is all the more reason that the defendant should take the victim as he finds him andshould compensate the plaintiff for injury of whatever nature which is proved to flow naturally and directly from the defamation.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> Further, since a publisher of mass media has no duty of care to the subjects of its articles, thereby rendering a claim in negligenceimpossible, it would be unjust if the victim who suffers injury would also be left without remedy in an action for defamation.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> I would hold therefore that in law, a plaintiff in an action for defamation can recover damages for injury to body and mind whichis proved to flow naturally and directly from the defamation.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Depression and pre-term delivery caused by the defamation</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> I then turn to the facts of this case to see what was suffered by the Plaintiff and whether that was the natural and direct resultof the defamation.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> The Plaintiff suffered depression and delivered the child she was carrying before term. The two psychiatrists who testified at thetrial are agreed that she did suffer actual distress in the form of depression. It is also not disputed that she delivered her childpre-term. The dispute is as to the cause of the depression and pre-term delivery.</p>    <p class="heading">Depression</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> I shall deal first with her condition of depression, which Dr K. Singer, the Defendants' expert psychiatrist, defined as a person'semotional response to external events such as the article.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> By way of background, the Plaintiff had no previous history of depression or other form of psychiatric illness, nor was there anyfamily history of such.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> Unfortunately however the Plaintiff happens to be of a timid disposition. Her reaction when she saw the article was to think thatsomeone was plotting with the newspaper to harm her, and to force her out of business in Yuen Long.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> On 7 October 1998, she was so frightened that she could not bring herself to go to her office, when a person of a bolder temperamentmay well have done so. It was the Plaintiff's husband who inserted advertisements in other newspapers to deny the truth of the articleand who instructed solicitors to send a letter before action. The Plaintiff did not in fact even contact her assistant solicitor,she said she could only stay at home constantly calling her husband on the telephone.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> The apology the next day brought her little relief. She likened it to having had her hands chopped off, followed by the assailantsaying sorry. She remained frightened and worried about who would have set out to harm her, because there was no explanation fromthe Defendants (whether in the apology or otherwise) for naming her in the article.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> The Plaintiff testified about the nightmares she suffered of being bitten by cats and falling from a height. According to Dr ChanChung Mau, who has been treating her since October 1998, these are consistent with a feeling of persecution and misfortune. The Plaintiffdid not leave her house because she felt she could not face people and even at home, was so incapacitated that her daughter had tosent away to be cared for by her husband's relatives.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> When the Plaintiff was admitted to hospital for medical treatment on 27 October 1998, her gynaecologist Dr Belinda Leung found thePlaintiff emotionally unstable and her mental condition was such that Dr Leung recommended psychiatric treatment.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> During her two and a half weeks in hospital, the Plaintiff did not want visits from family and friends because of her poor mentalstate. Although she was given psychotherapy by Dr Chan, he was hampered in the administration of anti-depressive and hypnotic drugsbecause of fears of their effect on the unborn child.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> The Plaintiff's depressive state did not improve with the birth of her child, notwithstanding the fact that it was a planned pregnancy.She was scared of the child because it was very small and Dr Chan recorded that she had ambivalent feelings towards the child.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> Her depressive state was aggravated because of the stresses caused by the child's state of health. He weighed only 1 kg at birth,had to be put on a ventilator, and suffered a dramatic deterioration 4 days after birth. He had respiratory difficulties and hadto have a blood transfusion 3 days later. Surgery had to be performed on his lungs and later his heart. His critical condition anddecisions required of his parents caused the Plaintiff further distress. He is also said to be developmentally delayed.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> When the Plaintiff herself was discharged from hospital a few days after birth, the baby had to be kept in intensive care. The Plaintiffstayed in a room at her sister-in-law's house because she felt hapless. She was unable to sleep at night, and had no energy duringthe day. She did not take drugs to help her condition as she was breast-feeding.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> Psychologically, she suffered depression, anxiety, irritability, lack of drive and impaired concentration. Physically, she sufferedinsomnia, a poor appetite, indigestion and headaches.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> She was unable to return to work until after the baby's discharge and when Dr Chan managed to persuade her to attempt to work forhalf a day. At first she was not up to it, but gradually improved.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> Evidence was given by Dr Chan and by Dr Singer. Dr Chan said that the Plaintiff suffered moderate to severe depressive illness, startingat a moderate degree, deteriorating to severe by reason of her anxiety over the pre-term delivery and condition of the baby, andreturning to moderate after the child's condition improved. Dr Singer considered that the Plaintiff started with a mild degree, butagreed to the course of the illness.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> It is in my view clear that the depressive illness was caused by the defamation. Dr Chan said that the Plaintiff showed marked hostility,irritability and anger towards the Apple Daily throughout her stay in hospital. That was within the expected range of reactions.I accept his evidence that the Plaintiff's depression was aggravated by the pre-term delivery and the child's condition, which wouldbe natural in any parent.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> Although Dr Singer's evidence was that he would have expected the initial shock to have come immediately after the publication, heaccepted in cross-examination that the gravity of what had happened might take a few days to be absorbed. Further, his opinion thatthe Plaintiff's depressive illness would only have been mild was based on his assumption that she had coped, as shown by the insertionof announcements in other newspapers denying the article. When informed in cross-examination that they had been inserted by her husband,Dr Singer accepted that that would affect his conclusion.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> It is clear that Dr Singer assumed that the Plaintiff's depression should have subsided in a few days with the apology and that hercondition thereafter was due to her anxiety about the child. However, the evidence is clear that the Plaintiff did not in fact considerthe threat to her to have subsided, because she still did not know how it came about that she (amongst the solicitors in Yuen Long)was named in the article.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> Dr Chan's notes showed that the Plaintiff was concerned about the article and the consequential litigation well after the publication.He noted that on 9 November 1998, the Plaintiff's mental condition was slightly worse when she recalled her "legal matters". On 14November 1998, he noted that the Plaintiff was also "bothered" by legal proceedings arising from the defamation.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> Dr Singer's theory that the Plaintiff may have been depressed because of a downturn in business was not substantiated. The Plaintiffhad gone on a resort holiday at Easter with her husband and daughter. She had taken on a new assistant solicitor to help with thework at her firm. Dr Chan said that at no time did she mention any financial stress or downturn in business from the time he startedtreating her in October 1998 to trial.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> As for Dr Singer's opinion that the depression was caused by the way the pregnancy was going, I accept Dr Chan's evidence that anxietyfor the unborn child was a natural reaction. The Plaintiff felt persecuted when the article was published. In that state, she wouldbe concerned about the thing most precious to her, and the unborn child would be regarded as particularly vulnerable.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> I find therefore that the depressive illness suffered by the Plaintiff was a natural and direct cause of the tortious act of defamation.Her condition in and the course of the pregnancy and the child's condition after birth aggravated the illness, but they were notsupervening acts. Further, as will be seen below, the pre-term delivery was in turn caused by stress arising from the defamation.</p>    <p class="heading">Pre-term delivery</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> The issue is whether the Plaintiff's pre-term delivery was caused by the stress she suffered as a result of the article. It neednot be the sole cause, it need only materially contribute to its occurrence (<strong>McGhee v National Coal Board</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%201%20WLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] 1 WLR 1</a>, at 11).</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> Evidence was called from Dr Leung, Dr Terence Lao (associate professor of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Universityof Hong Kong who specializes in complicated pregnancies), Dr JF Despaquale (an experienced gynaecologist but who is not an expertin complicated pregnancies as Dr Leung and Dr Lao are), and to a small extent Dr Singer (who does not specialize in this area ofmedicine).</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> The evidence of Dr Leung, who attended the Plaintiff, made it clear to me that the stress suffered by the Plaintiff materially contributedto the pre-term delivery. Dr Leung is highly experienced and has particular expertise in difficult pregnancies. She specialized inhigh-risk pregnancies whilst working as a consultant at Princess Margaret Hospital for 5 years, and since entering private practice,has been appointed the expert from the private sector on the Hospital Authority's expert panel on Obstetrical and GynaecologicalIncidence. As an expert in the area, and as attending physician, she was in the best position to speak on the Plaintiff's condition.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> Dr Leung pointed out that since the Plaintiff did not suffer from any infections, congenital abnormalities, history of pre-term deliveriesand had previously only had one miscarriage in the first trimester, that left only (a) a haematoma and (b) stress as the cause ofthe pre-term delivery.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> As far as the haematoma was concerned, I find (after considering the doctors' evidence and materials relied upon) that was not likelythe cause of the pre-term delivery. Since Dr Leung discovered the haematoma on 29 August 1998, she had specifically monitored thehaematoma with ultrasound on every visit of the Plaintiff. The ultrasound measurements showed that the haematoma had reduced on eachvisit. Moreover, the haematoma had no effect on the placenta.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> Further, the greatest impact of a haematoma was within the first 2 weeks of its formation. Here there were some 11 weeks betweenthe formation of the haematoma and the pre-term delivery.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> Dr Leung's opinion that a haematoma with vaginal bleeding did not significantly increase the chance of pre-term delivery was supportedby Table III in the article "The clinical significance of ultrasonographically detected subchorionic haemorrhages".</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> Dr Leung's opinion that the haematoma was not likely to have been the cause of the pre-term delivery was supported by Dr Lao whoregarded as significant the long interval between the formation of the haematoma and the pre-term delivery, especially when the placentalfunction was not affected.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> Dr Despaquale's opinion that damage may have been done by the haematoma notwithstanding the reduction in size and lengthy intervalwas not agreed by Dr Leung and Dr Lao, who possess greater experience and expertise in this area.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> All these three doctors were however agreed that stress had a part to play in the pre-term delivery. Dr Leung referred to a studyshowing that pregnant women who considered they were suffering from stress were more likely to have pre-term delivery. Dr Lao referredto a study showing that especially for pre-term delivery between 16 weeks and 30 weeks of gestation (which is this case), the greaterthe perceived stress, the higher the odds of pre-term delivery. Pregnant women who were stressed had 1.76 times the chance of pre-termdelivery. It would appear that stress may lead to uterine contractions, not bleeding. Dr Despaquale accepted that stress probablyplayed a role in the pre-term delivery.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> As discussed above, a defendant must take the plaintiff as he finds her. Where a defamatory article causes stress to a pregnant woman,when her condition is particularly sensitive to stress, the defendant must be liable for the natural and direct consequence of thestress including pre-term delivery. In the light of the evidence above, I find that the article did cause the Plaintiff depression,anxiety and stress and that the stress materially contributed to pre-term delivery.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) No aggravated damages</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> The Plaintiff claimed aggravated damages. It is clear law that aggravated damages are still compensatory in nature. Factors to beconsidered include the Defendants' conduct. I have found no evidence of malice in this case. Although the pleaded Defence containedsome issues which were not abandoned until trial, it was clear from the apology the next day that those defences could not reallybe sustained. Although on one or two occasions, cross-examination of the Plaintiff was unsympathetic, it was not such as to havecaused greater distress.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> I hold therefore that no aggravated damages should be awarded.</p>    <p class="heading">(4) No exemplary damages</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> As for exemplary damages, the test is to be found in <strong>John v MGN</strong> at 616, quoting certain passages in <strong>Duncan and Neill on Defamation</strong> with approval. To make a defendant liable for exemplary damages, he would have had to know that or be reckless whether he was committinga tort, and have had decided to publish because the material advantages from publication outweighed the prospects of material loss.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> I am not persuaded that the Defendants had gone so far. Cheng had been grossly negligent but not to the extent of recklessness (thatthere is a difference between these two standards was recognized in <strong>John v MGN</strong> at 623).</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> When Cheng checked out the premises on the 2nd Floor and the 5th Floor, he found only the Plaintiff's firm. There was nothing therethat would have caused him to suspect that the "sting" contents of the article to be untrue. He did not deliberately refrain fromturning any suspicion of untruth into a certainty (<strong>John v MGN</strong> at 618).</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a> The mere fact that a newspaper is published for profit is not by itself enough to justify exemplary damages (<strong>John v MGN</strong> at 619).</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> Further, given the award of general damages in this case, I consider that compensatory damages would be adequate and that exemplarydamages would not be called for.</p>    <p class="heading">(5) Effect of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5</a>-<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">6</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Liability (Contribution) Ordinance</a> cap. 377 on the Common Law rule on joint tortfeasors as held in Broome v Cassell</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> Here I should as a matter of completeness set out my views on the impact of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5</a>-<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">6</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Liability (Contribution) Ordinance</a> cap. 377 on the Common Law rule on joint tortfeasors.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> If I had found that exemplary damages were justified, they would only have been justified against the publisher and the editor (the1st and 3rd Defendants respectively), but not the printer (the 2nd Defendant). This is because it has been the law since <strong>Rookes v Barnard</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 1129</a> that exemplary damages were punitive in nature, and are meant to reflect the guilt of the particular defendant. There was no evidenceof any conduct on the part of the printer that would have justified an award of punitive damages (as was recognized by the Houseof Lords in <strong>Broome v Cassell</strong> at 1090, that would not be unusual where author, publisher and printer are sued in the same action for the same libel).</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> The issue then would have been whether this has any significance when the Defendants have been sued as joint tortfeasors in the sameaction.</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> In <strong>Broome v Cassell</strong>, the House of Lords held that since at Common Law, only one sum may be awarded in a single proceeding for a joint tort, the awardof exemplary damages would have to be the lowest common award among all defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a> However, the decision in <strong>Broome v Cassell</strong> must be subject to doubt in light of the decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in <strong>Wah Tat Bank Ltd v Chan Cheng Kum</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 507</a> and of the High Court of Australia in <strong>XL Petroleum (NSW) Pty Ltd v Caltex Oil (Aust) Pty Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%2057%20ALR%20639" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 57 ALR 639</a>, and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5</a>-<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">6</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Liability (Contribution) Ordinance</a> cap. 377.</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> In <strong>Wah Tat</strong>, the Privy Council (including 3 of the 7 law lords who decided <strong>Broome v Cassell</strong>) accepted that the attention of the House of Lords had not been directed to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.6(1)</a> Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act 1935.</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> Section 6(1) Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act 1935. provided briefly, that judgment recovered against any tortfeasorshall not be a bar to an action against any other person liable as a joint tortfeasor.</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> Section 11(1) Civil Law Act (Singapore) was identical to s.6(1) of the English Act. The Privy Council held that when construed truly,those sections abolished in its entirety the Common Law rule that a victim of a tort committed by joint tortfeasors was deemed tohave only one cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> Although <strong>Wah Tat</strong> was not a case of exemplary damages, Lord Salmon (giving the judgment of the Privy Council) recognized that it was "arguable" thatwhere punitive damages may be awarded, different sums of damage could be awarded against different joint tortfeasors in respect ofthe same tort.</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> In <strong>XL Petroleum</strong>, that very situation occurred. There was a joint tort of trespass. The judge awarded common compensatory damages but awarded exemplarydamages against Caltex only. The High Court of Australia upheld that approach. It held that the consequence of s.5(1) Law Reform(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW), which was based on s.6(1) of the English Act, was that separate judgments, differing inamounts, may be recovered on the same occasion against co-defendant joint tortfeasors, so that whilst compensatory damages were thesame, punitive damages may separately reflect the individual tortfeasor's measure of guilt.</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a> The High Court of Australia held that the statutory provisions severed the unity of the cause of action against joint tortfeasors.Once separate judgments may be given against joint tortfeasors for damages caused by the same tort, there could remain no foundationfor the rule that only one sum could be awarded by different judgments. The effect was, as Brennan J put it, that "a plaintiff nowhas as many causes of action as there are joint tortfeasors" (at 651).</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> In Hong Kong, the situation is governed by provisions in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Liability (Contribution) Ordinance</a> cap. 377. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5</a> provides that "judgment obtained against any person liable in respect of any debt or damage shall not be a bar to an action, or tothe continuation of an action, against any other person who is (apart from any such bar) jointly liable with him in respect of thesame debt or damage".</p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6</a> provides that "if more than one action is brought in respect of any damage by or on behalf of the person by whom it was sufferedagainst persons liable in respect of the damage (whether jointly or otherwise) the Plaintiff shall not be entitled to costs in anyof those actions, other than that in which judgment is first given, unless the court is of the opinion that there was reasonableground for bringing the action".</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a> These are identical to s. 3-4 of the Civil Liability Contribution Act 1978. Section 5 of the Ordinance clearly severs the unity ofthe cause of action against joint liabilities. It goes further than s.6(1) of the 1935 Act in that it applies to other legal wrongsand is not confined to torts.</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a> Further, s.6 of the Ordinance omits references to the aggregate damages recoverable not exceeding the first award of damages andso does not prevent the judgment creditor from receiving a later award which is greater than an earlier award.</p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a> It is therefore clear that the legislature has recognized the injustice to a plaintiff caused by the Common Law rule of only onecause of action against joint liabilities, and has amended the law to avoid the injustices caused by that rule. The House of Lordsdecision in <strong>Broome v Cassell</strong> was a manifestation of the Common Law rule, which caused injustice to a plaintiff who would otherwise have been entitled to exemplarydamages against 1 tortfeasor. Therefore, unless the language of the amending legislation allows no other construction, one shouldnot read it in such a way as to allow any such remnant application of the Common Law rule.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a> I do not read s.2(3) of the Ordinance, which provides that "a person is liable in respect of any damages for the purpose of thisOrdinance if the person who suffered it is entitled to recover compensation from him in respect of that damage (whatever the legalbasis of his liability, whether tort, breach of contract, breach of trust or otherwise)" as limiting the effect of s.5-6 of the Ordinancein abolishing the Common Law rule (as stated above) to cases involving compensatory damages only. If that were the intention of thelegislature, one would have expected far clearer language to be used in s.5 itself. As I read it, s.2(3) simply defines who is "liablein respect of any damages" for the purposes of the Ordinance. That is a person from whom a plaintiff is entitled to recover compensation,as compensation is the "floor" or minimum base of damages. Exemplary damages are built upon or added to compensatory damages, theyare not in substitution for compensatory damages.</p>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a> As a matter of completeness, I should record that leading counsel for the Defendants referred the Court to <strong>Jameson v Central Electricity Generating Board</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%202%20WLR%20141" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 2 WLR 141</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20573" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 Ll Rep 573</a>, a House of Lords decision which was decided after <strong>Wah Tat</strong> and <strong>XL Petroleum</strong> but which did not deal with them. Mr Edward Chan SC submitted that this showed that the House of Lords had declined to adopt thereasoning of the Privy Council in <strong>Wah Tat</strong> and the High Court of Australia in <strong>XL Petroleum</strong>. I do not think that can be assumed. <strong>Jameson</strong> was a case of concurrent torts, i.e. where the tortfeasors were jointly <em>and</em> severally liable, and where there was no claim for exemplary damages. It was not surprising therefore that the House did not considerthose decisions which related to joint tortfeasors only.</p>    <p class="heading">(6) Loss of profits</p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a> I shall now deal with loss of profits. It is clear that loss of business profits can be recoverable as and absorbed in general damagesfor loss of reputation.</p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a> Evidence was called from clients of the Plaintiff. Irrespective of whether actual loss may be proved, their evidence is illustrativeof the attitudes taken by clients as a result of the defamation. It was clear that even though individual clients may be sympatheticto the Plaintiff, realistically the further conduct of their business was governed by the attitudes of third parties such as banks.The Plaintiff's evidence was that of the three more active banks in Yuen Long, she received no further business connected with twoof them.</p>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a> It has been suggested on behalf of the Plaintiff that the loss of profits element in general damages may be quantified by eitherthe drop in gross income or the drop in profits demonstrated by the figures presented. It is clear that there was a drop in both.</p>    <p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a> However the Court must also take into account the fact that there was a decline in conveyancing work due to the fall of the stockand property markets in Hong Kong starting in the last quarter of 1997. The Plaintiff's firm dealt mainly (between 78% and 94%) inconveyancing. In September 1997, the mandatory scale charge had been effectively abolished and the Plaintiff accepted in cross-examinationthat this led to discounts of 20-30% in charges for Agreements for Sales and Purchase. Although the Plaintiff's firm did deal inintra-family transactions, they constituted only 10.4% for the calendar year 1996 and 14% for 1997. In the 5 months from May 1998,gross income was declining.</p>    <p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a> Therefore it can be seen that the Plaintiff's firm was affected by general market conditions. However it was not quite as bad asthe 86% drop referred to by Mr Ma Ho Fai. For the period between October 1997 and September 1998, the Plaintiff's firm suffered onlya 12% drop in costs income compared with the income for the period between October 1996 and September 1997. There was no evidencethat the income had been supported by Mr Chan Chee Shing's clients. The Plaintiff's evidence was that he had few clients of his own.</p>    <p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a> More importantly, one can see that for the months after defamation, there was a drastic drop in income for some 5-6 months untilthe firm resumed a 6-figure income in March 1999. In the absence of any other explanation for this obvious trough, and in the lightof the matters discussed above, I find that the difference of about $470,000 in income could be attributable to the effects of thedefamation. This is the rounded difference between $743,125 (being the average income since Chan Chee Shing left x 5 months) andthe actual income of $273,780.</p>    <p class="heading">(7) General Damages</p>    <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a> In considering the right award of general damages, I have considered as particularly relevant the <strong>Robert Chan v Hong Kong Standard</strong> case. However, the seriousness of the libel here was greater, the circulation is much higher, there was long-lasting psychiatricand actual physical illness and proven loss of business profits. On the other hand, there was an apology here whilst there was nonein <strong>Robert Chan v Hong Kong Standard</strong>.</p>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a> In my view, to console the Plaintiff for the hurt and distress suffered by her, to repair the harm that has been done to her reputation(including her business reputation) and to vindicate her reputation, I would award general damages of $3,000,000.</p>    <p class="heading">(8) Special Damages</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a> Finally there is the issue of special damages. Whilst loss of specific fees from specific cases may be claimed in addition to generaldamages for loss of business, the Court must be careful to avoid any overlapping (<em>Gatley</em> paragraph 26.32).</p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a> As it turned out, no substantial specific loss was proved after the thorough cross-examination undertaken by the Defendants' leadingcounsel. In Lee Yuet Man's case, he had not transferred the work to the Plaintiff's firm for a substantial period before the defamation,and for the Manhattan Heights flats, one transaction had been revoked by the Vendor. At most therefore the only loss was one transaction.In Tang Kam Cheung's case, the extent of fees was speculative as negotiations were still ongoing with Government valuers. In To ChungShing's case and Man Kwok Cheung's case, the projects have not proceeded.</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a> As for the other cases where no clients were called, the evidence was insufficient to prove any loss in 2 cases (971575 and 981703).In 3 cases (971607, 981701, 981687) land searches showed no transactions were done.</p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a> I would therefore not award any special damages for these loss of profits claimed.</p>    <p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a> As for medical charges, in light of my findings above, it must follow that the Plaintiff is entitled to psychiatric and pre-termdelivery-related charges. These amount to $163,842, but after deducting the costs of a normal delivery of $28,800, the award wouldbe $135,042. Future psychiatric treatment charges were assessed at between $34,000 and $50,000. I would award the median figure of$42,000.</p>    <p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a> I do not make any award for medical charges incurred on behalf of the child. This is an action for defamation. Damages would be recoverablefor the person defamed. The child is a third party and I cannot see how he can have a cause of action in defamation. As for travellingexpenses connected with the child, there was also no satisfactory evidence as to who paid for them.</p>    <p><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a> Costs of announcements to deny the defamation were properly incurred in mitigation of damages and I award the entire sum of $30,303.</p>    <p><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a> There were no submissions at the hearing on interest and I would give liberty to both parties to restore the hearing for argumentunless they can agree on the rate and period of interest.</p>    <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a> I make an order nisi that the Defendants bear the Plaintiff's costs.</p>    <p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a> It only remains for me to thank counsel for their assistance in this difficult but interesting case.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(MARIA YUEN)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Benjamin Yu SC and Mr Anderson Chow (instructed by SK Wong &amp; Lee) for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr Edward Chan SC and Mr Hin-lee Wong (instructed by TS Tong &amp; Co) for the Defendants</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>    <p align="justify">Headline:</p>    <p align="justify">æ¶é¨å®¢æ¶æ¨æ¬¾åäºæè²¸æ¬¾</p>    <p align="justify">åæå¥³å¾å¸«æ¾200è¬å¤±è¹¤</p>    <p align="justify">First 4 paragraphs:</p>    <p align="justify">å¨åæéè¨­å¾å¸«è¡çä¸åå¥³å¾å¸«ï¼æ·çé¨åä¸åå®¢æ¶çæ¨æ¬¾åäºæè²¸æ¬¾ï¼åå±äºç¾å¤è¬åå¾ï¼ç¶å¾æ¾æ¬¾å¤±è¹¤ï¼å¾å¸«ææ¥ç²å¸æ°æè¨´å¾å ±è­¦ï¼è­¦æ¹ç¾å°æ¡åçºçç«åè¨é¨æ¡èçã</p>    <p align="justify">æ¶æ¡å¥³å¾å¸«å§è­ï¼ç´ä¸åäºæ­²ï¼å·²å©ï¼ä¹äºå¹´å·æ¥­ï¼å¨åæéå±±å¬è·¯ç¨è³éè¨­å¾å¸«æ¨ï¼æ¥è¾¦æ¨å®è²·è³£åææ­ç­æ³å¾æçºã</p>    <p align="justify">åæååè­¦ç½²å©çææ®å®ï¼åäºï¼é³ç¦æ¦®ç¸½ç£å¯ç¨±ï¼ä¸ææ¥ç²å¾å¸«æå ±ç¨±å¾å¸«æ¨çªééï¼çæ¶åäºç½ªè¡ãè­¦æ¹å¶å¾æ¥è§¸å©åäºä¸»ï¼ä»ååå¥å ±ç¨±æ¾å§è¨è©²å¾å¸«æ¨è¾¦æçºï¼åèªæå¤±ç¾è¬åæ¨æ¬¾åè²¸æ¬¾ã</p>    <p align="justify">é³ç¦æ¦®æè­¦æ¹æ¾å°å¥³å¾å¸«å¯æèª¿æ¥ï¼ä½ç¡æ³èå¥¹æ¥è§¸ï¼èå¶å¾å¸«è¡äº¦ååæ¥­ãå¦å¤ééå¾å¸«æç¥ææ¶æ¡çå¾å¸«æ¨å¶ä»å®¢æ¶ä¸¦ç¡åé¡ï¼ä¸¦å°ä»£çºè½ä»å¶ä»å¾å¸«è¡èçã</p>    <p align="justify">Caption:</p>    <p align="justify">è­å§å¥³å¾å¸«ä½æ¼åæéå±±å¬è·¯çå¾å¸«æ¨å·²ç©ºç½®</p>    <p align="justify">Apology:</p>    <p align="justify">éæ­åäº</p>    <p align="justify">æ¬çæ¨æ¥å ±å°ãåæå¥³å¾å¸«æ¾200è¬å¤±è¹¤ãä¸æï¼æ¬å ±ç²è­¦æ¹è­å¯¦ï¼è­¦æ¹æ­£æ¥æ¬²ææ¤ä¸åæ¶å«æ¬µå¤±è¹¤çå¾å¸«ï¼ä½éè©²ææè¿°è­å§å¥³å¾å¸«ãæ¬å ±å ä¸æçå¿½è´ææ­¤å¤±èª¤ï¼ç¹æ­¤é­éè²æï¼ä¸¦æ¤åæéè©²å¥³å¾å¸«æ¾æ¬¾å¤±è¹¤çå ±å°åæéãæ±è­èåå¾å¸«è¡ãçç¸éåçãè©²å ±å°ååçå°æ±è­èåå¾å¸«åé¦æ¸¯å¾å¸«æé æä¸ä¾¿åå°·å°¬ï¼æ¬å ±è¬¹æ­¤è´ä»¥è¬äºåæ­æã</p>    <p style="text-align:right">èææ¥å ±ç·¨è¼¯é¨è¬¹å</p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2001/1025.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
