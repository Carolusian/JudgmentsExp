R.19 is only done in plain and obvious cases, that it is a summary procedure, that a reasonable cause ofaction means a cause of action with some chance of success, when simply the allegations on the pleadings are considered, and thatthe answer to a claim will only be struck out if it is clear beyond doubt that it is obviously unsustainable and that the defenceis not an arguable one.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> He makes the point that if I were to think the issues here to be capable of being argued in such an august body as the Privy Councilthen they should not be struck out.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> I equally accept Mr. Ching's point - he, Mr. Swaine Q.C. and Mr. Tang with him, appeared for the plaintiff - that the court shouldnot look over its shoulder at a Court of Appeal or the Privy Council - I do not think Mr. Morritt to have been making any such suggestion.As Mr. Ching has said, in respect of O.14 proceedings, however difficult the point may be it is susceptible of a ruling upon in chambersif it is clear and unambiguous.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> There is generally a relationship of debtor and creditor as between a bank and its customer but a contract: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"between banker and customer contains special terms and cannot in its entity be expressed in the phrasing of an ordinary indebitatuscount." (per <u>Atkin L.J. in Joachimson v. Swiss Bank Corporation</u><sup>(1)</sup>).</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> And there must be a valid mandate to demand payment. A forged cheque is not a demand says Mr. Ching though I note another phraseAtkin L.J. in Joachimson where he said at p. 127: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The customer on his part undertakes to exercise reasonable care in executing his written orders so as not to mislead the bank orto facilitate forgery."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> This stems from <u>Young v. Grote</u><sup>(2)</sup> - a case which runs through the argument of both himself and Mr. Morritt and which is constantly referred to in the authorisationcited.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> This was an 1827 case of a bank customer who delivered to his wife printed cheques signed by himself with blanks left for the sums.The wife was to fill up the blanks.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> She filled one out in the sum of Â£50.2 shillings, gave it to her husbands clerk to take to the bank, he altered it to three hundredand fifty pounds 2 shillings and the bank paid.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The matter went to arbitration and the arbitrator referred the matter to the Court of Common Pleas where Best C.J. said, at p.766:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Undoubtedly a banker who pays a forged cheque is in general bound to pay the amount again to his customer because, in the first instance,he pays without authority."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> And</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"But though the rule be perfectly well established, yet if it be the fault of the customer that the banker pays more than he oughthe cannot be called upon to pay again."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Having set out the precautions he thought an ordinary business person should take, and which he found were not taken there, he wenton: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It was by the neglect of these ordinary precautions that Grote &amp; Co. were induced to pay."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> And finally</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We decide here on the ground that the banker has been misled by want of proper caution on the part of his customer."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> That was a case of a "raised amount" cheque and not a nullity: and is authority for the proposition that a man could not complainof the consequences of his own default against a person who was misled by that default without any default of his own. And the linewas continued in <u>London Joint Stock Bank v. McMillan and Arthur</u><sup>(3)</sup> - again a "raised amount" case - having gone through first instance and appeal in earlier reports, now reaching the House of Lords.McMillan expressly approved <u>Young v. Grote</u><sup>(2)</sup>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Leorard J. (as he then was) had this to say of McMillan in <u>Asien-Pazifik Merchant Finance Limited v. Shanghai Commercial Bank Ltd.</u><sup>(4)</sup> : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I consider it important to remember that in that case a cheque, a valid mandate, was prepared by the customer. The valid mandatewas altered. It was not ab initio a nullity but a perfectly valid mandate to pay Â£2. This was fundamental to every reference toduty in that case."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> The reference to "ab initio a nullity" stems from <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 24</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19" class="autolink_findacts">Bills of Exchange Ordinance</a> CAP 19 which states, inter alia, that a "forged or unauthorised signature is wholly inoperative."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Therefore, when Lord Finlay L.C. says, at p. 789, in <u>McMillan</u><sup>(3)</sup> : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A cheque drawn by a customer is in point of law a mandate to the banker to pay the amount according to the term of the cheque. Itis beyond dispute that the customer is bound to exercise reasonable care in drawing the cheque to prevent the banker being misled"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">his judgment must be considered in the "raised amount" light and not as referring to a nullity.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> At page 801 Lord Finlay makes reference to <u>Kepitigalla Rubber Estates v. National Bank of India</u><sup>(5)</sup> a decision upon which Mr. Ching places great reliance.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In that decision the headnote reads: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is the duty of a customer of a bank in issuing mandates to the bank to take reasonable care so as not to mislead the bank; but,beyond the care which must be taken in or immediately connected with the transaction itself there is no duty on the part of the customerto take precautions in the general course of carrying on his business to prevent forgeries on the part of his servants."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> There the Secretary of a company forged the signatures of two of the directors of the company to a number of cheques which purportedto have been drawn by the directors on behalf of the company upon the defendants, who were the company's bankers, and the defendantspaid the cheques so drawn.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The forgeries extended over a period of about two months during which time neither the bank pass book nor the cash book of the companywas examined by the directors. In an action by the company against the defendants to recover the amounts so paid it was held that,upon the facts, the company was entitled to recover.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Mr. Morritt in a persuasive and attractive argument seeks, basically, to extend <u>Young v. Grote</u><sup>(2)</sup> to the forged signature or "non mandate" situation. He would have it that the trend of the old cases, including the Kepitigalla andMcMillan, is being overtaken by developments in the law and practice of banking so as to bring negligence as a breach of duty withinthe defences available to a bank where there is effectively no mandate as the result of the customers negligence.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Encapsulated his arguments are: -</p>    <p align="left">          (1) That a customer owes a duty to a banker to exercise reasonable care in his conduct of banking affairs so that the bankis not presented with a forged cheque purporting to be drawn on his account;</p>    <p align="left">          (2) That the duty to take reasonable case arises from the contractual relationship as between customer and banker and alsoin tort;</p>    <p align="left">          (3) That the reasonableness required to perform the duty is that which a person in the position of a customer would take;</p>    <p align="left">          (4) That the plaintiffs negligence breaches the chain of causation upon which the plaintiffs claim rests.</p>    <p align="left">          (5) That if, in consequence of the breach of duty, the banker pays upon a forged cheque the customer is not entitled torecover the amount from the banker; because the customer is estopped by his own negligence from alleging that the cheque is a forgery:because the Bank has a claim, be it in contract or in tort, for negligence against his customer in the amount of the forged chequeavailable to him by way of set off as against the claim of the customer against the bank.</p>    <p align="left">          (6) Irrespective of any duty that might be owed by the customer to the Bank, contributory negligence by the customer couldprovide a complete or, at the very least, an arguable defence to the bank.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> He accepts that the central question is whether or not there is a "duty situation".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> He does, with respect to him, attempt on the earlier cases to argue from the opposite. He submits that it can be inferred from suchcases as <u>Lewes Sanitary Steam Laundry Co. v. Barclay Bevan &amp; Co.</u><sup>(6)</sup>, that though they did not refer to such a duty as is alleged here they did not state that no such duty existed. Lewes was a bankingcase and that particular case, and other analogous cases such as <u>Bank of Ireland v. Trustees of Evans' Charities</u><sup>(7)</sup> and <u>Mayor Constables &amp; Company of Merchants of the Staple of England v. Governor of the Bank of England</u><sup>(8)</sup>, lay down that negligence must be in or immediately connected with the transaction itself. And that is their ratio.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> He goes on that Kepitigalla should be construed with <u>Selangor United Rubber Estates v. Cradock</u><sup>(9)</sup> and with <u>Karak Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Burden</u><sup>(10)</sup>, which applied Selangor.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> But Karak was a case where, in the words of Brightman J., at p. 629, the type of problem he had to deal with was: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"........, whether, despite a primary obligation to pay a cheque on demand, a bank owes to its customer a duty of care which may,in an extreme case, oblige it to question the authority of an authorised signatory."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> And went on: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"He (Ungood Thomas J. in Selangor) was not dealing any more than I am dealing with a case where a cheque is presented over the counteror is subject to the exigencies of the town or general clearing timetables nor with <u>anything approaching a normal cheque transaction</u>." (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Karak was a case where the authorised signatures were misusing their authority for the purpose of defrauding their principal or otherwisedefeating his true intentions.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Mr. Morritt is submitting throughout that there is an arguable case so that he should not be struck out in a summary manner - hecontends further that the application to strike out is, in reality, an attempt by the plaintiff to avoid discovery.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> He has cited extensively from <u>Selangor</u><sup>(9)</sup> to attempt to show that from 1968 on the duty of a bank was no longer simply to pay on demand and that there was a wider duty ofcare as between customer and banker which encompasses a situation such as exists here - where there is no valid mandate. He wouldimport into the contractual relationship an obligation to use reasonable skill and care in what might be termed a normal bankingtransaction. He would say that it is at least arguable that the customer has a similar obligation.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> But again with respect to him he has been unable to go further than submitting there must be that collateral duty and I do not thinkthe authorities cited to me to carry him that far. If I have not specifically referred to each and every one of those comprehensiveauthorities it is from no disrespect to his argument.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Mr. Mills-Owen, who with Mr. Faulkner appears for the 2nd defendant bank, referred me to <u>Electrical Development Co. of Ontario v. Attorney General for Ontario and Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario</u><sup>(11)</sup>, a Privy Council decision, on the summary setting aside of a writ. The issue in that case being whether or not a provision that noaction shall be brought against the Commission without the consent of the Attorney General was ultra vires and the issue in the PrivyCouncil was whether the action could be summarily stopped.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> Lord Finlay, in the judgment of the Privy Council, said, at page 694: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In their Lordships opinion it is impossible to treat the appellant's contentions as to the section in question on this point as merelyfrivolous. They raise points of importance which ought not to be dealt with in this summary fashion and which demand serious considerationin the ordinary course of law."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> And again at p. 695: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The elaborate argument advanced on behalf of the Attorney General for Ontario has failed to satisfy their Lordships that it is soclear that no declaration can be made against the Attorney General that the action should be summarily stopped as against the AttorneyGeneral."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Mr. Mills-Owen would rely on the phrase "raise points of importance" and "so clear" so as to illustrate the heavy burden on thosewho seek to strike out in a summary way.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> In that case pleadings had still to be delivered, which is not the case here, and the Privy Council felt that, after their delivery,evidence be taken "so far as it may be necessary".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> Lord Finlay concluded, the merits not having been properly raised before the Privy Council and the court having therefore refusedto express any concluded view, at p. 695: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"........... whatever difficulties there may be in the way the way of the ultimate success of the appellants case, it is not, in thejudgment of their Lordships, so clearly bad as to make it right that the appellants should by summary order be prevented from havingit tried in ordinary course."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The position here it is submitted is analogous.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> He would further contend that there are express duties under the contract which are pleaded and are admitted and the trial courtwill have to consider those express duties and their terms and the consequences to the parties of their non observance. There maynow be, he says, duties coexisting in both contract and tort.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> As to duties generally he cites <u>Greenwood v. March</u><sup>(12)</sup> and <u>Brown v. Western and Brown v. Western Bank</u><sup>(13)</sup> but, with respect to him, <u>Greenwood</u><sup>(12)</sup> was a matter of a joint account in the name of husband and wife where the wife forged, the husband discovered but he did not informthe bank until after her death. The Bank were thus deprived of the right of pursuing an action in respect of the wife's tort - andthis is the point upon which <u>Greenwood</u><sup>(12)</sup> turned. <u>Brown</u><sup>(13)</sup> was again a failure to inform the bank of known forgeries. Neither in my view apply to a case of the nature of the one here.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> Mr. Litton on behalf of the 3rd defendant in his argument referred me to the pleadings and made the point that, as they stand, theyare not in such watertight compartments that excision of the paragraphs of the defence as sought here would effectively deal withMr. Ching's point.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> He also criticised the particulars given in the Statement of Claim, the lengthy period over which the forgeries took place and theirnumber and submitted that a large company must keep books and full accounts. In this last he seems to be suggesting that the plaintiffsmust have known - but this of course is not pleaded as it is rather a chicken and the egg situation - discovery, can you get it?Plead from that which is discovered.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> He further submitted that it must be remembered this is a limited company and its mandate is one which involves machinery and, throughit, delegation. The real question he would suggest is what is neglect in or about the giving and operation of the mandate and thisinevitably encompasses the drawing of a cheque.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> He draws a distinction between this instant case and <u>Kepitigalla</u><sup>(5)</sup> as to the period involved and the number of cheques and seeks to argue that <u>Dorset Yacht</u><sup>(14)</sup> extends the concept of tortious negligence beyond that which, at one time, was thought to be a closed concept. Basically that thelaw has, and is, developing beyond <u>Donoghue v. Stevenson</u><sup>(15)</sup>. He urges that it is the neglect of the plaintiff that enabled the 4th defendant to pursue his course of forgery.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> On the contributory negligence issue it is significant, as Leonard J. said in Asien-Pazifik that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"There is no reference in <u>Padget on Banking to Donoghue v. Stevenson</u><sup>(15)</sup> or <u>Home Office v. Dorset Yacht Co.</u><sup>(14)</sup>."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><u>Hedley Byrne</u><sup>(16)</sup> contains no reference to cheques the signatures of which are forged.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Mr. Ching has referred me to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23" class="autolink_findacts">Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance</a> CAP 23 and it is his submission that this Ordinance, following upon the English Act, simply solidified, in its section 21. that whichwas the law and did not create any new application of the doctrine of contributory negligence.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> Mr. Morritt would argue that that the decision in <u>Donoghue v. Stevenson</u><sup>(15)</sup> - that is the foreseeability test and, in particular here, that the customer must foresee that his lack of care of his account wouldlead the bank to pay upon forged cheques - will be applied as of its own force unless there is valid reason for its exclusion. Hecites in support the <u>Dorset Yacht</u><sup>(14)</sup> - or the "Borstal Boys case".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> In <u>Midland Bank Trust v. Hett, Stubbs &amp; Kemp</u><sup>(17)</sup>, where the relationship of solicitor and client was in question, it was held that there was a duty of care imposed upon the solicitorsbecause of that very relationship and that the solicitors were "therefore liable in tort, independently of any liability in contract,for their negligence ........" But this is more on the "neighbour" principle and I am not persuaded, without specific authority,that such tortious liability applies as between customer and banker that being a relationship in contract.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> I am very conscious that the majority of the authorities cited to me on the central issue here are decisions at trial and containsuch references as "in the present case", "on the facts as proved", or, as in the <u>Dorset Yacht</u><sup>(14)</sup> :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If there is no clear cut precedent the Court may have to reach a decision whether, once the facts and circumstances of a situationare ascertained, it can be said it was a duty situation."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> I think I should make reference to <u>Lumsden &amp; Co. v. London Trustee Savings Bank</u><sup>(18)</sup> which was expressly not followed in <u>Wilton and another v. Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia; Model Investments Pty. Ltd.</u><sup>(19)</sup>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> In Lumsden, which was a case of an employee fraudulently altering cheques drawn by his employer and paying them into his own accountwith the Savings Bank, the plaintiff sued the bank in conversion and the Bank asserted the plaintiffs contributory negligence. Counselfor the plaintiff conceded that this was a good defence in law and this concession was accepted by the trial judge.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> In <u>Wilton</u><sup>(19)</sup>, Samuels J. said (at p. 653) of the reasoning behind counsels concession:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"My respectful view they were far from compelling. First it was acknowledged that there was no English authority for the propositionthat contributory negligence was a defence at common law; secondly it was indeed recognised that there was a dictum of Lord wrightto the contrary in <u>Lloyds Bank Ltd. v. E.B. Saving &amp; Co.</u><sup>(20)</sup> at p. 229 which counsel sought to explain on a ground which seems to me implausible but thirdly reliance was placed upon the majorityview of the <u>New Zealand Court of Appeal in Helson v. McKenzies (Cable Street) Ltd.</u><sup>(21)</sup>."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> He went on to state that, on examination, <u>Helsons</u> <sup>(21)</sup> case did not support the proposition and gave his reasons for that conclusion.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> In <u>Quinn v. Burch Bros. (Builders)</u><sup>(22)</sup> Paull J., considering the Law Reform (Contributory negligence) Act of 1945 - which our Ordinance follows - was prepared to acceptthat section (1) (1) of the act - in terms similar to our section 21 - could apply to a contractual situation. But he also said hedid not understand the expression "a negligent breach of contract", because at p. 379: "in contract, it matters not whether the breachis brought about deliberately or negligently or per incuriam." At p. 380 he had this to say "in order to apply the Act one has tofind that there was some term which imported a duty not to be negligent and a breach of that term."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> In my judgment a customer owes a duty to the banker to take reasonable care in giving a mandate. In <u>Bank of England v. Vagliano</u><sup>(23)</sup> Vagliano failed to exercise that duty in that his own acts - accepting the bills as genuine bills when they were not and by the givingof a letter of advice to the Bank that the bills were coming due when no such bills existed - misled the bank, and there was, ineffect, a valid mandate.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> Lord Halsbury at p. 115 said: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"My Lords, it seems to me impossible to dispute that this was, in fact, a misleading of the bankers. I pass by for the moment thequestion whose default it was, for the purpose of considering the proposition which has found favour with one of your Lordships,and which I will not dispute, that the carelessness of the customer, or neglect of the customer to take precautions, unconnectedwith the act itself, cannot be put forward by the banker as justifying his own default. In order to make the cases of the <u>Bank of Ireland v. Trustees of Evans' Charities</u><sup>(7)</sup>, and the Mayor, Sc., of <u>Merchants of the Staple of England v. Bank of England</u><sup>(8)</sup>, authorities in this case, it would be necessary to assume that the plaintiffs in those cases had by some voluntary act of theirown given credit and the appearance of genuineness to the particular powers of attorney which were forged in those cases, and ifthey had, I very much doubt whether the decision would have been what it was; but no such fact appeared; all the parties whose negligencewas relied on had done, was to leave their seal carelessly in the custody of the person who abused his trust. These decisions thereforedo not seem to me to touch the case."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> For the pleadings, with one exception to which I shall refer in a moment, to stand the banks must show the negligence of the customeron the mandate itself. The cheque is the mandate. If there be no mandate, and thus no authority to pay, there can be, in my view,no duty upon the customer in that regard a negligent breach of which would give rise to a good defence to the banks.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> It may be that there can be an estoppel by conduct or by negligence arising from events subsequent to the nonexistent mandate. Thatis not for me to say. In essence there cannot, in my judgment, be a breach of a nonexistent duty. None of the authorities cited goso far as to say that a company should take reasonable precautions to prevent its servants forging its signature. (<u>Kepitigalla</u><sup>(5)</sup> at page 1023).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> Here we are faced with a contractual not a tortious nexus. Mr. Ching accepts, as indeed he must, that there is a duty, outside thenarrow confines of contract upon a customer to tell a bank of forgeries of which he knew or ought to have known. But, as he says,this has not been pleaded.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> To the question is there a duty other than the taking of care in the drawing of the cheque I would say that on the authorities asthey now stand there is none. On the question of contributory negligence in the case of a contractual duty I would say that the authoritiesas they now stand are against.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> There is no clear cut precedent that a duty situation arises in the circumstances here as between customer and banker but the basicfacts of the forgery, as they emerge from the pleadings, are clear. In the event I do not think the defendant banks on the centralissue to have raised an arguable case when there is no mandate from the customer and therefore no representation by him to the bank.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> The authorities do not in my judgment extent tortious negligence to cover a contractual situation - despite <u>Dorset Yacht</u><sup>(14)</sup>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> I have not gone into detail as to the particulars of negligence as alleged by the 1st defendant some of which, with respect, areclearly bad, as once the central issue is decided then the whole pleading goes. I would strike out paragraphs 16 and 16A of the defenceof the 1st defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> I would strike out paragraph 12 of the defence of the 2nd defendant and I would also strike out paragraph 15.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> I said there was one piece of pleading to which I would refer "in a moment" and it is paragraph 13 in the defence of the 2nd defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> The difficulty I find myself in is this: estoppel by neglect of duty - that is the customer being estopped from setting up the invalidityof the cheques - is an arguable defence. But the neglect I have in mind is that which may - or may not - emerge from the evidenceas to the customer's conduct subsequent.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> Paragraph 13 as it stands refers to "its (the plaintiffs) aforesaid negligence" which relate; to "failing to detect the forgery and/ortaking steps to prevent the same". It goes back to a negligent breach of a duty I have found not to exist.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a> I am somewhat loath to strike this out in its entity but feel I must as it turns itself in on that nonexistent duty.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> As to paragraph 19 of the defence of the 3rd defendant: this appears to be an attempt to bring in estoppel by the back door so tospeak for it relies on that which is contained in paragraph 20 of that defence as particulars of the alleged negligence - and paragraph20 specifically pleads contributory negligence setting out particulars of it.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> I think both those pleadings to be bad and they should go.</p>    <p align="left"><u>DISCOVERY</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> I now turn to the Discovery summon of the 1st defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> Having struck out the pleadings the situation is that the plaintiff agrees to items (1) to (5) in the schedule to the summons limitedto the 54 cheques - that would mean an order in terms of the "alternative" stated in each item.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> The plaintiff joins issue on items 6(ii) and (iii) but concedes on item 6(i).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> The plaintiff also resists an order in the terms of paragraph (1) of the summons and wishes to be heard on paragraph (3): costs.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> I shall deal with paragraph (1) of the summons first.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a> I accept Mr. Li's point that on the face of it certain documents have not been disclosed. Mr. Swaine would say that the reason forthis is that the plaintiff had first to await the determination of the summons to strike out, and, in any event, an order in theterms of that paragraph would mean general discovery all over again. He referred me to the White Book at p. 418 side note 24/7/1to 0.24 - as did Mr. Li who emphasised that which appears on p. 419 commencing "The second (and more important) qualification is.........."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p93" class="pseudopara" id="p93">93.</a> Mr. Li also submitted that there is a large number of cheques involved and that the trial on the issue of forgery is not merely amatter of cold evidence. Some may be in doubt. He gives as an example that if there is genuine documentation to back up a chequeit may well be a cogent submission that the managing director signed that cheque: or that some of the payments made even on forgedcheques may have gone to discharge the indebtedness of the company.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p94" class="pseudopara" id="p94">94.</a> To all this the surrounding documents are highly relevant. And on the necessity of discovery he cites <u>George Ballantine &amp; Sons Ltd. v. F.E.R. Dixon &amp; Son Ltd.</u><sup>(24)</sup> - where in it was held that discovery would not be ordered where the application for discovery was directed solely to credit butdistinguished the basis there from that existing here. It is his case that the documents sought here are vital for the purpose ofdisposing fairly of the action.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p95" class="pseudopara" id="p95">95.</a> I confess that I have gone on from paragraph (1) itself to cover some of the arguments that relate to items 6(ii) and (iii) in theschedule.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p96" class="pseudopara" id="p96">96.</a> Mr. Swaine says as to items 6(ii) and (iii) that item 6(ii) goes exclusively to paragraph 16 and, if it is gone, then so should thisitem; that item 6(iii) goes exclusively to negligence and contributory negligence and in any event that which each item seeks inthe alternative is far too wide.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a> Generally I view discovery as a necessity here. I think the 1st defendant, so that the position is put beyond doubt, to be entitledin the circumstances which exist to an order in terms of the resisted paragraph (1) of the summons.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p98" class="pseudopara" id="p98">98.</a> I view some discovery under items 6(ii) and 6(iii) to be desirable and that the 1st defendant be entitled to it. There would be anorder in respect of the alternative portions of those items but with the dates restricted to 1st November 1977 to 1st April 1978period. Despite Mr. Li's plea for a wider period this is the period directly germane to his defence and I do not think, in the interestsof the saving of time at the trial and of saving costs he should, in his present position, go outside that period. That sought forthat period is of probative value.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p99" class="pseudopara" id="p99">99.</a> In the event there will be an order in terms of paragraph (1) and (2) of the summons: an order in terms of items (1), (2), (3), (4),and (5) of the schedule limited to the 54 cheques in each case: an order in terms of item 6(i) and in terms of items 6(ii) and 6(iii)limited to the alternative sought and to the period 1st November 1977 to the 1st April 1978 in each case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p100" class="pseudopara" id="p100">100.</a> That is the proposed order. I say "proposed" in that if I have left anything undone I should be grateful if counsel were to drawit to my attention.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p101" class="pseudopara" id="p101">101.</a> I shall hear the parties as to costs.
