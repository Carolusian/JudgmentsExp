For thisinjury the Plaintiff claims damages for breach of statutory duty, breach of contract and negligence. Liability is denied but theDefence, settled by Counsel, makes no plea of contributory negligence. At the trial both Defendants appeared in person.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The Plaintiff came to Hong Kong from China in 1974 and from about 1975 he worked as a power press operator. He had been employedby the Defendants for several months prior to the accident.</p>    <p><u>The Process</u></p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The Plaintiff's job was to place a circular metal piece of a watch case into the power press for pressing. He did this with his righthand, being right-handed, and when the metal piece was in place, he pressed a foot pedal which operated the press. After pressingthe press would automatically open ready to receive the next piece of metal. The Plaintiff told me that during an eight-hour periodhe would press approximately 20,000 pieces. This works out to something like 40 every minute.</p>    <p><u>The Sweep-Away Guard</u></p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Photographs of the machine in question (or an identical machine) were taken by the Defendants and were placed before me and markedExhibit "D1". These photographs show that the machine was fitted with a sweep-away guard. However the Plaintfiff told me that afterthe accident the machines were fitted with new arms to the sweep-away guard. These new arms were at a slightly different angle tothe old arms. However the Plaintiff further told me, and I accept, that the machine upon which he was working on 20 October 1983had only one arm, namely the right arm as you look at the machine (see photographs 7 - 9). The Plaintiff further told that the oldarms had a very limited sweeping movement whereas the newly fitted arms had a much more extensive sideways sweep.</p>    <p><u>Conviction</u></p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> On 23 May 1984 the Defendant Mr Kwan, one of the partners in Tai Hing Metalware Manufactory pleaded guilty to an offence under theFactories and Industrial Undertakings (Guarding and Operation of Mackinery) Regulations made under Chapter 59 of the Laws of HongKong. He was fined HK$1,000.</p>    <p><u>The Ordinance and Regulations</u></p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The Defendants' factory premises at 17 - 31 Kwai Fung Crescent, 8/F Flat 6, Marvel Industrial Building, Kwai Chung was clearly aregistrable workplace within the meaning of Section 2(1) of the Factories acid Industrial Undertakings Ordinance <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59">Cap 59</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> I am satisfied that the power press on which the Plaintiff was injured was required by Regulation 5 of the Factories and IndustrialUndertakings (Guarding and Operation Regulations of Machinery) Regulations <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59">Cap 59</a> to be effectively guarded by one of the means thereinset out and that it was not so guarded at the time of the accident.</p>    <p><u>Factory Inspectorate</u></p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Mr Tsoi from the Labour Departmept prepared a report solely on the basis of an interview with the Plaintiff. His report is page 21of the Plaintiff's Bundle which by consent, is now Exhibit p7. He confirmed that the conviction of Mr Kwan was in respect of themachine used by the Plaintiff on that very occasion. He agreed that a machine malfunction was a very remote possibility. He explainedthe purpose of the sweeping-guard and confirmed that it was so designed (as can be seen from the photographs) that a hand could noteasily go between the arms.</p>    <p><u>Defendants' Version</u></p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Neither Defendant elected to give evidence. Mr. Kwan said that he was in general agreement with the evidence given. He specificallyagreed that at the time of the accident there was no left-arm guard.</p>    <p><u>Conclusion on Liability</u></p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> I have no hesitation in finding that the Defendants were in breach of their statutory duty not guarding a dangerous part of a machineby any of the means mentioned in Regulation 5. I am satisfied that on the occasion of the accident there was only a right arm sweep.Photograph 10 shows how, after the accident, the new arms almost meet in the middle thus making it impossible for an operator tostart the process with his hand in between the arm. Photograph 10 shows that to insert the metal piece for pressing, the operatorhas to approach the press from the outside of the right arm, thus putting his arm in the path of the sweep. If he does not move hishand out in time the sweep will do it for him.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> However with only one arm there is nothing to stop the operator placing his hand to the left of the arm sweep thus avoiding the effectof the sweep altogether.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> I am further satisfied on the evidence I have heard that the sweep of the old arm was insufficient to achieve its purpose. No doubtthat is why it was replaced after the accidents.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The Defendant, Mr Kwan, pleaded guilty to an offence under the above regulations, and no sufficient evidence has been produced beforeme to rebut the <u>prima facie</u> effect of that conviction.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The Plaintiff could not explain how it was his thumb became trapped in the press. The most likely reason was that he was workingat great speed because he had to try and do 40 presses a minute in order to achieve the higher wage. His basic rate was $60 for a9 hour day, 26 days a month. That comes to $1,560. However the Plaintiff told me that he never earned less than $2,200. This wasnot challenged. In addition to his basic rate he was paid an unspecified number of dollars per hundred pieces. I say unspecifiedbecause the Plaintiff was unable to recall but he did remember that he never earned less than $2,200. The number of pieces he didwas recorded and he was paid twice a month. So it follows that the Plaintiff was working at speed in order to earn as much as hecould. I think what happened was that, having placed a piece of metal in the press he pressed the foot pedal too soon. This broughtinto operation the one remaining arm of the sweep and after that the press closed. It was unfortunate that the Plaintiff pressedthe pedal too quickly but this is precisely what the sweeping-guard is designed to deal with. Had there been two arms he would havehad to place the metal into the machine with his right arm to the right of the guard. When he accidentally pressed the pedal toosoon, the sweep, assuming an adequate range, would have swept his arm out of the way thus preventing the accident. With only onearm to this machine it as possible that he put his arm to the left of the right arm sweep thus avoiding its operation completely.Alternatively he could have put his hand to the right of it but the inadequate sweep was not enough to sweep away his arm. For thepurposes of liability I do not think it matters which way the accident occurred. In my view either eventuality leads to a liabilityon the part of the Defendant. On balance however I think it more likely that the Plaintiff placed his arm to the left of the right-armsweep thus avoiding its operation completely. Had the left are been in place he would not have been able to do this, at least not,with any ease, and his arm would have been to the right of the sweep and thus in its path. If the Plaintiff put his hand to the leftof the sweep then it really would not have mattered whether the sweep was adequate or not. It would simply not have come into contactwith his hand or arm. However the whole purpose of this guard is to ensure that the operator's arm is in the path of the sweep andthis was prevented in this case due to the absence of the left sweep-arm.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> I therefore conclude on the question of liability that the Defendants are liable to the plaintiff for damages for breach of the abovestatutory duty and the breach was causative of the Plaintiff's injury. I further conclude that the Defendahtsbare are liible to thePlaintiff in contract and tort for not supplying him with a safe system of work including the provision of safe equipment as pleadedin the Statement of Claim.</p>    <p><u>The Injury</u></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Three agreed medical reports were placed before me.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> They were:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Dr Chang of Princess Margaret Hospital dated 18 May 1985</p>        <p>(2) Dr R G Wedderburn dated 23 September 1985;</p>        <p>(3) Dr Philip Mao dated 22 March 1988.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> From these agreed reports it is apparent that the Plaintiff sustained a crush injury to his right thumb. A revision amputation wascarried out on that date. Post operatively he was followed up in Out Patient Clinic and given physiotherapy and occupational therapy.Because he complained of persistent pain at the stump he was readmitted to Princess Margaret Hospital on 22 March 1984 for explorationwhich showed an entrapment of a digital nerve which was released. Some improvement was shown after the second operation. In Dr Wedderburn'sreport he sets out that the Plaintiff had 50 sessions of physiotherapy after his stitches had been removed. Following the March 1984operation he experienced an improvement but continued to have discomfort in the stump of the thumb. On the second occasion he wasin hospital for three days.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> For the second operation he had a form of intraveinous injection as an anaesthetic. The injection was made into vein near the elbow.Since then he has complained of pain at the back of the shoulder and he blames this on the anaesthetic. When Dr Wedderburn saw himin September 1985 he saw a very good soft tissue over the stump of the thumb. There is good skin and fatty tissue over the bone end.X-Rays shows that the terminal phalanx of the thumb was amputated. Dr Wedderburn found good movement of the remaining stump. Therewas no injury to the fingers.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> I saw the Plaintiff's thumb on his right hand and agree with Dr Wedderburn's conclusion that there is good skin and fatty tissueover the bone end and indeed the thumb, shortened and without nail, as it is, is not cosmetically too disturbing.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The Plaintiff also complained of pressure over the scapula. Dr Wedderburn thought that he had damaged the attachment of the musclesof the scapula although he felt it was unlikely that it was a direct result of the accident because it had not developed for fivemonths. There is some limitation of arm movement at the shoulder, but only the extremes of movement. Dr Wedderburn thought that asingle injection of cortisone into the painful area would clear the matter up.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Dr Mao's report in March 1988 states that the Plaintiff's right hand has a grip of 20 1bs as compared to 110 1bs in the left. ThePlaintiff told Dr Mao that he uses his left hand to do most heavy work but can still write with his right hand and use chopsticks.The Plaintiff still has tenderness in the right scapula below the middle of the spine and seems to be affected by an inability toraise his arm above his head. Dr Mao suggests some further physiotherapy and exercise to regain this strength.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The Plaintiff told me that his right hand his useless and that he cannot work with it. This seems to be a slight exaggeration. Hesays he suffers pain in the thumb on weather changes but otherwise there was not much pain. It was painful if he knocked it. He complainedthat he could not button his clothing with his right hand or fasten knots or pick up small articles. However, there was no reasonwhy he could not do these adequately with his left hand. He accepted that he could write and could use chopsticks. He had difficultywith holding bowls of food and inserting film into his camera. So far as pain in the right shoulder was concerned, he said it commencedafter his anaesthetic injection and he had no pain prior to it. As to the shoulder pain I cannot go behind the contents of the AgreedMedical Report of Dr Wedderburn who cannot relate this to the accident. Mr Bharwaney did not contend to the contrary. The Plaintiffwas given sick leave certificates until August 1984.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> I was referred by Mr Bharwaney to ten cases the names of which I attach to an Appendix to this Judgment. On the strength of thesecases taking into account inflation and the observations of the Court of Appeal in <u>Lau Che Ping 1988 Civil Appeal 12</u>, Mr Bharwaney contended for an award for pain and suffering and loss of amenity in the sum of $100,000. In my view this was a boldsubmission.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> In two of the more recent cases referred to the awards were much lower for similar injuries. In <u>Tran Van Nho -v Cheuks Industries 1986 A719</u> Master O'Donnell awarded $35,000 to a 31 year-old man who suffered an amputation of the tip of his right thumb. In <u>Chan Hung Hoi 1986 A2709</u> a 21 year-old male was awarded $40,000 in March 1988 by Deputy Judge Danniell for a one and a half centimetre shortening of his rightindex finger. Mr Bharwaney reminded me of the differences in these cases and contended they were on the low side. He relied heavilyon an award by Master Hansen in December 1983 in <u>Chan Po Keung against Law Ping H.C.A. 3993 of 1983</u> where for a similar injury to an ambidextrous 20 year-old male an award of $36,000 was made. The Plaintiff in that cases was 17 atthe time of the accident. In my view his youth was a significant factor. This award seemed a little high or 1983. Mr Bharwaney saysthat if one takes into account inflation that award would now be at least $70,000. Allowing for the differences in these cases andtaking into account inflation and the observations in <u>Lau Che Ping 1988 Civil Appeal No 12</u> I consider the appropriate sum for pain and suffering and loss of amenity to be <u>$60,000</u>.</p>    <p>Loss of Earnings</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> After his sick leave certificates expired in August 1984 the Plaintiff told me, and I accept, that he tried to find other jobs. Hetried at Hong Kong University for and odd-job position but was unsuccessful. He went to the Vocational Training Centre in Wanchaibut was not accepted. He applied to the Fire Services Department but was rejected. He further told me and I accept that he went totan factories to look for jobs before be finally got one. He told me that as soon as the employers saw his hand they said they badenough workers. In relation to the earlier applications this was done by writing and he referred to being physically handicappedon the application form. He thought that this affected his application. The Plaintiff registered with the Selective Placement Departmentof the Labout Department in about June 1985 as can be seem from Ekhibit "P6".</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Eventually the Plaintiff managed to find a job with Foo Kai Plastic Company. He was not very precise on dates but by a process ofelimination his evidence came to this. He worked for Foo Kai for the sum of $90 day and was paid twice per month. The wage periodwas therefore every two weeks and he stayed with them for four to five wage periods. This means that he worked for Foo Kai for betweeneight and ten weeks. In the absence of any more precise evidence and on the longer figure agreed to by Mr Bharwaney I am preparedto hold that the Plaintiff worked for Foo Kai or 65 working days at $90 per day. Originally the Plaintiff was unsure in which yearhe worked for Foo Kai although he said that it was the summer. However by working back from his present employment he was later ableto say that the 65 days were in the summer of 1986. On the evidence I have heard as I have said I have found the Plaintiff workedfor Foo Kai for 65 working days at $90 a day. In his particulars of served on the 25 January 1989 the Plaintiff states that he workedfor 37 working days for Foo Kai. However, on the evidence as I have found it to be and as submitted by Bharwaney he worked with themfor 65 days at $90 a day.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> I accept the Plaintiff's evidence that he was thereafter without employment until towards the end of 1986. Again he was not too clearwhen he started working for his present employers Gar Yun Garment Factory but I think the totality of his evidence is that he startedwith them from the beginning of November 1986 and has remained with them until the present time. His particulars of claim state thathe was earning $1,600 a month with them but the evidence which was produced before me from his payslips and his autopsy credits inhis sayings book show a monthly average for $2,650.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> I am satisfied on the evidence I have heard that at the time of the accident the Plaintiff was earning approximately $2,200 per monthPage 12 of the Agreed Bundle shows that the average daily wages of power press operators engaged in metal products industry in December1983 was $58 per day which together with fringe benefits came to $71 per day. This was for an eight-hour day, 26 days per month.By September 1987 the average daily basic wage had gone up to $90 and with fringe benefits had gone up to $114. Page 17 of the AgreedBundle shows that by March 1986 the average basic wage had gone up to $108 per hour, and with fringe benefits had gone up to $135per hour, namely $3,510 per month. By consent Counsel for the Plaintiff told me that by June 1988 the figures were $118 and $141respectively but by September 1988 they had reduced to $114 and $139 respectively. At $139 a day that comes to $3,614 per month.This has been rounded down to $3,610. The median between, $2,200 and $3,610 is $2,905. The Plaintiff claims total loss of earningsfrom the date of the accident, 20 October 1983 to 19 May 1986. I am prepared to allow this period being two years and seven months.This is 31 months at $2,905 per month a total of <u>$90,055</u>.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The second period as I find is one of partial loss of earnings for 65 days. The Plaintiff worked as a casual labourer with Foo Kaiearning $90 a day or $2,340 per month. Taking the median of $2,905 this comes to $111.50 per day, less the $90 actually earned leavesa loss of $27.5 for 65 days, namely a loss of <u>$1,397</u>.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The next claim is one of total loss of earnings at the median of $2,905 per month. However as I found the Plaintiff had worked forFoo Kai for 65 days I think it only appropriate to take this total loss to be three months as opposed to the 4 months originallyclaimed, making a total of <u>$8,715 [2905 x 3]</u>.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> The final period of partial loss of earnings is from November 1986 when he started with Gar Yun Garment Factory until the presenttime namely twenty seven months. I am satisfied on the evidence that his average wages with Gar Yun is $2,650 per month. The differencebetween that figure and the median of 2905 is $255. The loss is therefore $255 per month for 27 months namely <u>$6,885</u>.</p>    <p><u>Future loss of earnings</u></p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> The Plaintiff is now aged 42 years of age. Mr Bharwaney for the Plaintiff contended for a multiplyer of 12. I think the appropriatemultiplyer is 11. The current earnings of press operators are $3,610 per month. The Plaintiff is now earning $2,650. That is a shortfallof $960 per month. 11years x 12 equals 132 x $960 equals <u>$126.720</u>.</p>    <p>Costs of Out-Patient Treatment</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The Plaintiff has produced 23 sick leave certificates. For each of these he had to travel to the hospital. The hospital registrationfee was $10. This would produce a claim for $230. However Dr Wedderburn in the agreed medical report states that the Plaintiff had50 sessions of physiotherapy in the Hand Unit. The Plaintiff had to pay $10 registration fee for each visit and this comes to $500.The figure pleaded in the Plaintiff's schedule is $760 but this should be $730. I therefore award <u>$730</u> under this head.</p>    <p><u>Travelling Expenses</u></p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> The Plaintiff told me that the round trip cost $3 and for 73 visits I therefore <u>award $219.</u></p>    <p>Nourishing Foods</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The only evidence I have on this is from the Plaintiff who said he spent between $700 - $800 on vitamins on advice from Doctor. Thepleaded figure is $2,500 but this has not been made out on the evidence. I award therefore under this head the sum of <u>$700</u>.</p>    <p>Future Labour Market Risk</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> It is submitted that I should award damages in the sum of $50,000 under this head on the basis that if the Plaintiff should losehis job, for instance because of the liquidation of his employer, he will take longer than an able-bodied man to find alternativeemployment because of his injury. It is clear that before an award can be made under this head there has to be evidence to supportit. The Court of Appeal in <u>Lau Che Ping</u> make it clear that it is not appropriate to award merely a conventional figure under this head. They also made it clear that therehas to be evidence to support an award under this head. I have set out above the Plaintiff's attempts at finding a job and the variousrejections he experienced. Although Hong Kong enjoys full employment at the moment, it does not follow this will continue duringthe whole of the next eleven years. It took the Plaintiff over a year and a half to find his first job. There was then a period ofthree months during which he was unable to get a job. He has been with his present employers for two and a quarter years. I am satisfiedon the evidence that I have heard that there is a real risk that during the next eleven years the Plaintiff as a labourer will haveproblems in finding alternative employment.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> As he is to be compensated now for a loss which has not yet occurred I consider the appropriate figure under this head is <u>$20,000</u>.</p>    <p>Employees Compensation</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Although page 7 of the Agreed Bundle shops that the Plaintiff agreed to accept $43,108 in respect of Employees Compensation I amtold and of course accept that in fact the Plaintiff received $44,621.48. He must of course give credit to that sum.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Conclusion</u></p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="21">(a)</td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="21">Pain and suffering and loss of amenity</td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="21" style="text-align:center">$ 60,000</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="21">(b)</td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="21">Total loss of earnings for two years and seven months at $2,905 31.x $2,905</td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="21" style="text-align:center">$ 90,055</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="21">(c)</td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="21">Partial loss of earnings for 65 days at $21.50 per day 65 x $21.50</td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="21" style="text-align:center">$ 1,397</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="22">(d)</td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="22">Total<sup>-</sup>loss of earnings for three months $2.,905 x 3</td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="22" style="text-align:center">$ 8,715</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="21">(e)</td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="21">Partial Toss of earnings from November 1986 to date 27 months x $255 per month</td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="21" style="text-align:center">$ 6,885</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="21">(f)</td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="21">Future Loss of earnings 132 months x $960</td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="21" style="text-align:center">$126,720</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="21">(g)</td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="21">Labour Market Risk</td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="21" style="text-align:center">$20,000</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="21">(h)</td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="21">Out patient treatment</td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="21" style="text-align:center">$ 730</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="21">(i)</td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="21">Travelling expenses</td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="21" style="text-align:center">$ 219</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="21">(j)</td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="21">Nourishing foods</td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="21" style="text-align:center">$ 700</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="21"></td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="21"></td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="21" style="text-align:center">_______</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="21"></td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="21"></td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="21" style="text-align:center">$315,421</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="21"></td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="21">Less Employees Compensation</td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="21" style="text-align:center">$ 44,621</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="21"></td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="21"></td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="21" style="text-align:center">_______</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top" height="21"></td>            <td width="63%" valign="top" height="21"></td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" height="21" style="text-align:center">$270,800</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><u>Interest</u></p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top">(a)</td>            <td width="63%" valign="top">I award 2% on $60,000 (Pain and Suffering) from 23 May 1986 until today 32.50 months at $83.33 per month</td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="63%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="28%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">$ 3,250</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top">(b)</td>            <td width="63%" valign="top">The special damages total $108,701.
