They had had business dealingsfor some years since 1961 whereby the defendant provided the plaintiff with credit facilities in respect of his export business.In consideration of such facilities the plaintiff deposited with the Dresdner Bank in Augsburg certain shares to the value of DM$190,000in favour of the defendant as security with the instructions that such shares were not to be released except by consent of the defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The plaintiff's case is that in 1967 he sold some woollen goods to a firm in Vienna named Austromercantile to be delivered in HamburgGermany by 3 shipments. He drew 3 bills in payment for the goods such bills to be payable at sight and documents to be deliveredagainst payment naming the Austromercantile to be the drawee. The plaintiff discounted the said 3 bills. The documents relating tothe goods were handed to the defendant on the plaintiff's application for discounting the said bills. The defendant then creditedthe plaintiff's account with 3 sums to the equivalent, in Hong Kong currency, of the sales value of the 3 shipments of goods. Byeach of the said applications for discount the plaintiff requested the defendant to carry out the instructions viz:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="85%" class="quote">Documents are to be delivered against payment.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="85%" class="quote">If refused, or if necessary, store and insure goods on arrival for our account.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%" class="quote">(c)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="85%" class="quote">In the event of non-acceptance and/or non-payment, please protest and advise us by airmail."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">The said 3 shipments of goods arrived at Hamburg on the 30th July, 10th August and the 17th October of 1967 respectively and the defendantsent the bills and shipping documents to its agent, the Swiss Credit Bank in Zurich for collection. The Austromercantile failed topay the said bills or for the said goods. The defendant wrongfully failed to inform the plaintiff of such non-payment until February1968 by which time the Austromercantile had failed and the principal thereof had disappeared. For this reason the plaintiff was unableto recover payment. It is also alleged that by failing to inform the plaintiff of the said non-payment immediately or within a reasonabletime the defendant and/or its agent, the Swiss Credit Bank, is estopped from denying that such payment was in fact made.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The plaintiff was able to dispose of part of the said goods to the value of DM27,340.80 at the price of DM20,505.60 was creditedby the defendant to the plaintiff's account. In October 1968 the plaintiff paid off all sums owing by him to the defendant save andexcept $96,721.60 representing the value of the said goods less DM27,340.80. However, the defendant refused to instruct the DresdnerBank to release the shares deposited as security in favour of the defendant. The plaintiff claims for a declaration that the plaintiffis no longer indebted to the defendant in the sum of $93,871.93 or any other sum, for an order that the defendant do all things necessaryto instruct the Dresdner Bank to release the said shares and damages for breach of contract.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> By its statement of defence the defendant admits that in 1967 the plaintiff sold the goods set out in paragraph 3 of the statementof claim but denies that the plaintiff drew any bills. The plaintiff made 3 applications for discount in respect of documents relatingto the sales dating respectively 3rd July 1967, 14th July 1967 and 19th September 1967 on certain terms set out in the application.These terms exempted the defendant from liability from any act, omission or default of the defendant's agent or sub-agents. The defendantmerely made advances to the plaintiff against the documents enclosed with such applications. The said documents were forwarded tothe Swiss Credit Bank in Zurich for presentment to the Austromercantile for payment. The said Swiss Credit Bank was nominated bythe plaintiff and as such was the plaintiff's agent. The plaintiff had been informed by letters dated the 5th October 1967 and 8thNovember 1967 respectively that the said items had not been paid. The plaintiff visited and held discussions with representativesof the Austromercantile on the 23rd November 1967. The defendant was not negligent; and had not misled the plaintiff in anyway andwas not in breach of contract. The defendant counterclaims the sum of $120,367.86 being the amount due and owing to the defendantfrom the plaintiff on the account on the 30th June 1972.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The issues are:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%">1.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%">Whether the defendant had committed any breach of contract or had been negligent.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%">2.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%">Whether the Swiss Credit Bank was agent of defendant.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%">3.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%">If the answer to question 2 is in the affirmative whether the Swiss Credit Bank has committed a breach of contract or been negligent.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%">4.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%">If the answer to the 3rd question is in the affirmative whether the defendant is liable for the breach or negligence on the part ofthe Swiss Credit Bank.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Neither party called any witness. Both relied on a bundle of agreed documents the authenticity of which were admitted. In the courseof the hearing two further documents were produced by consent. I shall refer to the bundle of documents as exhibits by their respectivenumbers in sequence. Thus document No.1 will be referred to as Exh.1. I shall refer to the other 2 documents as Exh.A and Exh.B.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> I find the following facts from the aforesaid documentary evidence:</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On the 3rd May 1966 the plaintiff entered into an agreement - Exh.4 - with the defendant whereby the defendant would grant overdraftfacilities to the plaintiff up to the limit of $500,000 at the rate of interest of 7 Â½% per annum and subject to repayment on 30days' written notice. On the 3rd July 1967 the plaintiff applied to the defendant for credit in the sum of DM43,195.74 in relationto a sale of garments by the plaintiff to a firm named Austromercantile in Vienna. The said sum was the sale price of the said garmentsto be paid by the Austromercantile at sight. This application, Exh.9, contained additional terms to these set out in Exh.4. I shallrefer to the additional terms later. Suffice to observe that this application was purely and simply an application for an advanceand not for a discount or for collection by the defendant. No bill or draft was attached. The documents enclosed with Exh.9 werecommercial invoices, bills of lading, certificate of origin and packing list only. The covering memo, Exh.10, from the plaintiffto the defendant referred to the same documents only and requested the defendant to forward them to a bank in Vienna for negotiation.The sum of $61,708.20 being the equivalent of DM43,195.74 was advanced by the defendant and credited to the plaintiff's account withthe defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> On the 14th July 1967 the plaintiff made a similar application to defendant for DM34,977.04 in the form of Exh.14 in respect of anothershipment to Austromercantile. This application (Exh.14) was in identical terms as the application in Exh.9 and was made with thesame type of documents. The sum of $49,833.72 being the equivalent of DM34,977.04 was credited on the 17th July 1967 to the plaintiff'saccount with the defendant. On the 19th September 1967 the plaintiff made a similar application - Exh.23 - in respect of the thirdshipment of garments to the Austromercantile for the sum of DM6,805.80. The application was also in identical terms as those in Exh.9and was made with the same type of documents. Accordingly the sum of $9,715.07 being the equivalent of DM6,805.80 was credited tothe plaintiff's account with the defendant. The three sums made a grand total of $121,256.99. The documents accompanying the applicationstogether with the plaintiff's instructions contained in the same were eventually forwarded to the Swiss Credit Bank in Zurich forcollection from the Austromercantile. This is evident because by two separate acknowledgements dated the 19th September 1967 andthe 3rd October 1967 the Swiss Credit Bank acknowledged receipt of the documents - Exh.A and B respectively to the defendant andin view of the 3rd paragraph in the plaintiff's letter Exh.36 dated the 13th March 1968. In both receipts the Swiss Credit Bank informedthe defendant that they would account to the defendant after collection and in Exh.B the former Bank added the remark "Please notethat the drawees wish to defer payment until the arrival of the goods". In passing I should add that the Swiss Credit Bank was notthe original collecting agent. It was nominated by direction of the plaintiff to replace the original agent in Vienna. The threeconsignments of garments arrived at Hamburg between the 30th July 1967 and the 17th October 1967. They were released to the SwissCredit Bank in Hamburg and were transported to Zurich where they were stored, insured and retained by the Swiss Credit Bank pendingpayment by the Austromercantile. There was no direct evidence that the Swiss Credit Bank presented the documents of title to theAustromercantile for payment. However, on the presumption of regularity and in view of the remark in its acknowledgement in Exh.Bto which I have already referred I find as a fact that the Swiss Credit Bank did present the document of title to the goods for paymentto the Austromercantile which failed to pay. No further communication was received by the defendant or the plaintiff until 1968.However on the 5th October 1967 and the 8th November 1967 the defendant rendered statement of outstanding accounts to the plaintiffshowing that the sums of money advanced by the defendant to the plaintiff in respect of the three said shipments of garments wereoutstanding. There was no further communication from the defendant until the 4th January 1968 by which time the business of Austromercantilehad been wound up and the principal thereof had disappeared. The goods were at all time stored, insured and remained in control ofthe Swiss Credit Bank. There was no evidence whether the Swiss Credit Bank presented the documents of title to the Austromercantilefor payment after the arrival of the last shipment of the goods. Nor did the Swiss Credit Bank advised the defendant or the plaintiffof the non-payment until 1968. The Austromercantile never paid for them. The plaintiff took active steps to dispose of them but onlysucceeded in selling the goods at a substantial loss. When the whole of the goods were sold a large amount of the proceeds of salewere absorbed by the storage and insurance costs.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The special terms of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant are to be found in Exh.9, Exh.14 and Exh.23 - the plaintiff'sapplications. The terms of all three documents are identical. When I consider the rights and duties between the parties I shall referto Exh.9 the terms of which apply equally to the transactions under Exh.14 and Exh.23. Under Exh.9 the defendant's duty was to forwardthe documents of title to its agent or sub-agent abroad for the purpose of collecting payment from the Austromercantile togetherwith the plaintiff's instructions contained therein. In this respect the defendant was the plaintiff's agent. This is evident inview of the contents of the second paragraph in the defendant's letter dated the 2nd April 1968 to the Swiss Credit Bank - (Exh.40)in which the defendant referred to the plaintiff as its principal. The nature of the contract was such that once a sub-agent wasappointed by the defendant the collection should be effected by the sub-agent. However, the defendant was obliged to pass on anyinformation to the plaintiff should there be non-payment. I have found as a fact that as soon as the defendant received the instructionsfrom the plaintiff he forwarded them to the Swiss Credit Bank which was nominated by the plaintiff. In the 3rd paragraph of the plaintiff'sletter dated the 13th March 1968 to the defendant (Exh.36) it was conceded that the defendant informed the plaintiff of the situationon receipt of Exhibits A and B from the Swiss Credit Bank in October 1967. The plaintiff was put in the picture that the Austromercantilewished "to defer payment until the arrival of the goods". No contrary instruction was given by the plaintiff to the defendant. Furtherthe defendant had rendered the outstanding accounts to the plaintiff in October and November 1967 (Exh.25 and Exh.26) clearly indicatingthat the Austromercantile had not paid for the goods up to early November 1967. By that time the first two shipment of the goodshad arrived at Hamburg. The plaintiff raised no objection. The plaintiff was in Vienna on the 23rd November 1967 and met the partnersof Austromercantile. He did nothing to enquire or enforce his right under the contract of sales. For these reasons I am of the opinionthat the defendant had performed its obligations in its contract with the plaintiff and had not been negligent in the performanceof its duty.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> As to the question whether the Swiss Credit Bank was the sub-agent of the defendant I am of opinion that it was the sub-agent atall material times. This was so even though the plaintiff nominated the Swiss Credit Bank as the collecting agent. The plaintiff'sinstructions plus the documents of title to the goods were forwarded to the Swiss Credit Bank by the defendant. There was no evidenceto support any privity of contract between the plaintiff and the Swiss Credit Bank.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> With reference to the third question whether the Swiss Credit Bank had committed a breach of contract or been negligent I have torefer to the terms of instructions contained in Exh.9.

The instructions were that payment was to be made at sight. On the first presentation they advised the plaintiffthrough the defendant in Exh.B that "the drawees wish to defer payment until arrival of the goods". On arrival of the last shipmentof the goods the Austromercantile still failed to pay for them. Although the Swiss Credit Bank retained control of the goods theyfailed to advise the plaintiff of such non-payment. This was clearly negligent.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> So far as the defendant was concerned the Swiss Credit Bank was negligent. In its letter to the said Bank - Exh.40 - the defendantwrote:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "We are inclined to think that both of his complaints are not without grounds. It was true that had he been informed earlier,he could have made some other arrangement when he visited the drawees in Vienna on 23rd November 1967 during his business tour inEurope. Austromercantile was then still carrying on business in Vienna and the season for woollen wear was still on, but now thesituation must be said to have completely changed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> There remains the question whether the defendant can be made liable for the negligence of the Swiss Credit Bank, their sub-agent.This is again governed by the terms of contract between the plaintiff and the defendant and signed by the plaintiff. The terms ofthe contract were contained also in Exh.9 which read as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "It is understood and agreed that, in the selection of any correspondent to whom the above mentioned item(s) may be sentfor collection, you shall not be responsible for any act, omission, default, suspension, insolvency or bankruptcy of any such correspondent,agent or sub-agent or of any drawee bank, or for any delay in remittance, loss in exchange or loss of item or its proceeds duringtransmission or in the course of collection. Until such time as actual payment shall have come into possession, we engage to reimburseyou for any advance made in anticipation of collection as well as all disbursements made in effort to effect the same. We furtherundertake to reimburse you for all commission and charges which may be incurred if not paid by drawees."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> It is quite clear that but for the exemption clause the defendant would have been liable for the negligence of its sub-agent. Mr.Ching for the plaintiff contended that the exemption clause was so wide that it must be given a reasonable and restricted interpretation.He further contended that such a clause should be interpreted as exempting the defendant from liability for breach of contract onthe part of the sub-agent but not negligent acts of the sub-agent. My attention was drawn to a number of authorities on the subjectand I shall consider them.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> In the case of <u>J. Spurling Ltd.</u> v. <u>Bradshaw</u><sup>(1)</sup>, it was held that a clause exempting the plaintiffs from liability "for any loss damaged or detention in respect of goods entrustedto them in the course of their business occasioned by the negligence, wrongful act or default of themselves their servants or agents"only availed to exempt the plaintiffs when they were carrying out their contract and not when they were deviating from it or breakingit in a radical respect. It was also held that the exemption in that case was sufficient to exempt the plaintiffs from liabilityfor negligence. But Mr. Ching's contention in the present case was that the words in Exh.9 were not wide enough to exempt liabilityfor negligence which was not expressly mentioned. It was not seriously contended that the Swiss Credit Bank was deviating from thecontract or breaking it in a radical aspect. Its failure to present the document to Austromercantile again after the last shipmentof the goods had arrived should be regarded as yet another instance of negligence. In previous dealings the Austromercantile hadbeen known to have delayed payment after the documents were presented for as long as three months. This was evidence in the plaintiff'sletter dated the 19th April 1968 (Exh.45) in which he wrote:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"For an example I draw your attention to five documentary collections on Messrs.

Bankes L.J. said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"..... A common carrier is liable for the acts of his servants whether they are negligent or not; an ordinary bailee is not liablefor the acts of his servants unless they are negligent. If a common carrier would protect himself from responsibility for all actsof his servants he must use words which will include those acts which are negligent; because words which would suffice to protecthim from liability for acts properly done by his servants in the course of their service may fall short of protecting him from theirnegligent acts ....."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In the same case, Scrutton L.J. said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"..... In construing an exemption clause certain general rules may be applied: First the defendant is not exempted from liabilityfor the negligence of his servants unless adequate words are used; secondly, the liability of the defendant apart from the exemptingwords must be ascertained; then the particular clause in question must be considered; and if the only liability of the party pleadingthe exemption is a liability for negligence, the clause will more readily operate to exempt him ....."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The aforesaid principle was repeated in the judgment of Lord Greene M.R. in <u>Alderslade</u> v. <u>Hendon Laundry, Ltd.</u><sup>(3)</sup> in which he said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"..... The effect of those authorities can I think be stated as follows: where the head of damage in respect of which limitation ofliability is sought to be imposed by such a clause is one which rests on negligence and nothing else, the clause must be construedas extending to that head of damage, because it would otherwise lack subject-matter. Where, on the other hand, the head of damagemay be based on some other ground than that of negligence, the general principle is that the clause must be confined in its applicationto loss occurring through that other cause, to the exclusion of loss arising through negligence ....."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In that case an exemption clause to the effect that "the maximum amount allowed for lost or damaged articles is twenty times the chargemade for laundering" was sufficient to limit the lanndry's liability for negligence.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> It was for this reason that in <u>White</u> v. <u>John Warwick &amp; Co. Ltd.</u><sup>(4)</sup> a clause "Nothing in this agreement shall render the owners liable for any personal injuries" did not exempt the defendant in thatcase for negligence. Having cited the principle in the case of Donoghue v. Stevenson Singleton L.J. said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"..... It is clear from those words of Lord Macmillan that there may be, arising from the same set of facts, an action for damagesfor breach of contract and an action for a tort. It is said that that position arisex in this case, and that though an action fordamages for breach of contract may be said to be barred by clause 11 of the contract, it cannot be said that the words of that clauseoperate to shut out the plaintiff from that which he would normally have, namely, an action for damages for the tort of negligence."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The words "nothing in this agreement" might be wide enough to exempt liability for a breach of contract but it was not specific enoughto exempt liability for negligence. It is of interest to note that in the contract for hire in that case the owner agreed to maintainthe cycle in working order and the plaintiff in that case sustained injury as a result of negligence in the repair of a cycle suppliedby the defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The principle, as I can gather from these autherities, is that where the words in an exemption is so wide as to be capable of exemptingfrom all liabilities they will be construed as exempting liabilities for causes other than those for negligence unless they refer,expressly or by implication, to acts for negligence. Further, in aid of the construction of an exemption clause it is necessary toconsider the nature of the contract and the parties thereto. The words in the exemption clause in this case are:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"You shall not be responsible for any act, omission, default, suspension, insolvency or bankruptcy of any such correspondent, agentor sub-agent."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">While the words "act or default" may be interpreted as wilful or deliberate act of non-feasance the word "omission" clearly refersto and include acts of negligence. From the nature of the contract and the conduct of the parties it was clearly the intention thatthe defendant agreed to provide finance facilities to the plaintiff, that the collections of the proceeds of sales was to be effectedby a banker in Europe and that defendant would be free from any involvement from acts and/or negligence of its collecting agent.Hence the plaintiff gave a further undertaking in Exh.9 that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Until such time as actual payment shall have come into possession, we engage to reimburse you for any advance made in anticipationof collection as well as all disbursements made in effort to effect the same."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In the circumstances I am of opinion that the defendant is protected from liability for the negligence of its sub-agent in the presentcase.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that since the defendant and its sub-agent did not advise the plaintiff of non-paymentand as a result the plaintiff acted on the basis that payment had been made the defendant and its sub-agent were estopped by denyingthat payment had been made. If I understood this contention properly it amounted a plea of estoppel by negligence. I have found thedefendant not negligent and not liable for the negligence of its sub-agent. Thus this contention also fails. There was no allegationof fraud. It was not a deliberate misrepresentation.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> In the circumstances the plaintiff is not entitled to a declaration absolving his indebtedness to the defendant or an order thatthe defendant do all things necessary to inform the Dresdner Bank that the defendant is no longer entitled to the plaintiff's sharesdeposited as security.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> I now come to the counter-claim. This is founded on the plaintiff's undertaking contain in Exh.6 and Exhs.9, 14 and 23. Once I havefound that the plaintiff is not absolved from his debt to the defendant the plaintiff is liable to reimburse the defendant of themoney so advanced pursuant to the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. The counter-claim must succeed. In the courseof the hearing it was agreed between the parties that as from the 30th June 1972 the outstanding debt was $120,000 of which $97,871.93represented principal and the balance represented interest.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The judgment of this court therefore is that the plaintiff's action is dismissed, with judgment to defendant on its counter-claimin the sum of $120,000 plus interest at 7 Â½% per annum on the sum of $97,831.93 as from the 1st July 1972.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Simon F.S.
