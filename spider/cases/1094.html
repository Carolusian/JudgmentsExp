Suffice to say that officers of the Customs and ExciseDepartment seized a large quantity of quartz clock movements, 199,000 pieces of which were marked "TAKANE JAPAN", and another 1,000pieces had on them the mark or description "MADE IN JAPAN". These quartz clock movements were assembled in China from parts madein Japan by a Japanese Company called Takane Sogyo Company limited and subsequently formed the subject matter of the two summonses.It was admitted that the respondent owned the goods and imported them from China after they had been assembled there. Having rejectedpleas of guilty offered by the respondent, the magistrate ruled, after hearing legal arguments and on the basis of the agreed factsbefore him, that the words "MADE IN JAPAN" and "TAKANE JAPAN" constituted trade descriptions but they did not constitute false tradedescriptions. His reasons are to be found in paragraph 9 of the case stated and these are:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="89%">        <tr>            <td width="6%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" class="quote">"(a)</td>            <td width="88%" class="quote">                The basic materials of the clock movements must be regarded for the purposes of the Ordinance as the component parts.The component parts when assembled make up a clock movement, conversely, it must follow that when the clock movement is disassembledone is left with the component parts. It cannot therefore be said, that the assembling of the component parts into a whole in anyway changes the basic materials which are the component parts.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td width="88%" class="quote">                Consequently the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/362" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Descriptions Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/362">Cap. 362</a>, deems that the place of manufacture of the clock movements is Japan. That is the place where the component parts of theclock movements were manufactured as the process of making the component parts requires a permanent change in shape, nature, formor utility of the basic materials used in the manufacture of the component parts. Whereas the assembling of component parts intoa clock movement does not result in such a permanent change.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" class="quote">(c)</td>            <td width="88%" class="quote">Following on from this argument it must equally be said that the person by whom the clock movements were manufactured was Takane SogyoCompany Ltd.

In Bischop v Toler, the general rule was laiddown that a manufactured article is "produced" in the place where it undergoes the final process in its manufacture by which it assumesthe form in which it is sold!" After outlining the facts in Bischop's case, the learned author continued: "If the place where thefinal process is carried out is the true test then it would seem that a mere assembling of mechanical parts may not be regarded asa process of manufacture in this sense."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Unfortunately this passage and the authorities to which I have referred do not provide any clear-cut answer to the problem whichconfronts us. The question remains whether the clock movements were manufactured in China so as to fall within the terms of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/362" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Descriptions Ordinance</a>. Mr. McCoy urged me to give the Ordinance the meaning that is consistent with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 19</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap. 1</a> which states:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">"An Ordinance shall be deemed to be remedial and shall receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as willbest ensure the attainment of the object of the Ordinance according to its true intent, meaning and spirit."</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>In support of this,. he further relied on the speech of Lord Scarman in Wings Ltd. v Ellis (1985) 1 AC and at page 293 his Lordshipsaid: "The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 is plainly a very, important safeguard for those members of the public (and they run intomillions) who choose their holidays in this way. If the protection is not to be undermined, the Act must be widely known (as indeedit is), easily understood (as, having heard the arguments in this case, I fear that it may not be), and must be of general applicationsave in situations specifically excepted by the statute itself. The Act is not based on the law of contract or tort. It operatesby prohibiting false description under the pain of penalties enforced through the criminal courts. But it is not a truly criminalstatute. Its purpose is not the enforcement of the criminal law but the maintenance of trading standards. Trading standards, notcriminal behaviour, are its concern."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> I am in complete and respectful agreement with this pronouncement. In determining the issue raised in this appeal, it is necessaryto adopt a realistic, practical and common sense approach. I was invited and so was the magistrate to look at one of the clock movementshaving its cover removed. From what I saw, it is quite plain that the assembling or putting together, whatever you may call it, ofthe component parts certainly requires a considerable amount of labour and perhaps some skill as well, not to mention expense. Itis also obvious that the assembling could not have been done by hand alone: it would have to go through some form of manufacturingor even mechanical process before the many small component parts could take the form of a clock movement.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> In a decision of the Court of Appeal in England in Prestcold (Central) Ltd. v Minister of Labour  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%20W%20L%20R%2089" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) W. L. R. 89</a> Lord Denning M. R. said at page 93: "It seems to me that when a person makes a machine, by getting component parts from elsewhereand assembling them together himself, he can properly be said to be "manufacturing" that machine. Take some of the large works wheremotorcars and aircraft are assembled. Those establishments are engaged in "manufacturing" the machines even though all the componentscome from other places." Lord Diplock took the same view at page 97: "The first inquiry is: Is heading 339.3, viz., "REFRIGERATINGMACHINERY. Manufacturing all types of refrigerators (including domestic) and refrigerating machinery", wide enough to cover the activityof assembling from its component parts, at the site on which it is to be installed, a complete refrigerating plant? This questionI would answer: Yes."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines "process" as a particular method of operation in any manufacture. "Process" includes, in relationto the making of goods, the assembling of parts of the, goods, it is so stated in section 40 of the Purchase Tax Act, 1963.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The magistrate was in error when he said. that once the clock movement is disassembled one is left with the component parts and thereforethere is no change in shape, nature, form or utility of the basic materials which were the component parts. The view taken by himwas too narrow and restricted indicating a degree of loss of touch with reality. He drew an unrealistic and wrong inference fromthe facts. When the component parts were assembled, they were no longer small, individual component parts they once were. They havebecome a clock movement, a different commodity in a different shape and form, having a separate identity and an utility of its own.It would require some effort and I should think difficulty as well to dismantle it and to dismantle 200,000 pieces would certainlyrequire a great deal of effort and enormous difficulties. It is quite clear that the respondent was not going and never intendedto dismantle them and common sense suggests that to do so is both financial suicide and commercial lunacy. Once the component partshave become clock movements they would remain as clock movements and there must be a permanent and substantial change in the shape,nature, form or utility of the basic materials used in their manufacture. The most obvious, logical, reasonable and indeed naturaland inevitable conclusion to be further drawn is that these clock movements would be fitted as clocks by the addition of dials, handsand cases and passed on for sale to the ultimate consumers if they had not been intercepted.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> For the reasons which I have given, I conclude that the words "TAKANE JAPAN", and "MADE IN JAPAN" are false trade descriptions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> On the question of costs, section 28 provides:-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"In any proceedings under this Ordinance, the magistrate or court hearing the proceedings may, not-withstanding any provision of anyother Ordinance, make such order as to costs as he or it may think fit.</p>            <p class="quote"> </p>            <p class="quote">The law is too clear to require explanation or elaboration. In view of the conclusion I have reached on the main issue, it is notstrictly necessary for me to deal with the question whether the magistrate properly exercised his discretion to award $17,000 costsagainst the prosecution but I would like to say that this is not at all an easy case and this has been the view shared between myselfand both counsel. This is also a matter of considerable public importance and the Crown were perfectly entitled to proceed and havea ruling from the court. The reasons given by the magistrate are therefore not valid.</p>            <p class="quote"> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> To summarize, the answers to the questions raised in paragraph 11 are:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="left">(a)     No.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b)     No.</p>            <p>(c)     Yes.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Mr. McCoy informed me from the outset that the Crown were not seeking forfeiture in this case. He further indicated that in the eventthis appeal being successful but in view of the delay he would not wish the matter to be remitted back to the magistrate and simplyasked me to record a conviction against the respondent on both summonses with no penalty to be imposed. That being so, I accede tohis request and convict the respondent on both summonses and further direct that the convictions be recorded. The order for costsmade by the magistrate is quashed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(M.
