By this action, the Plaintiff claimed the Defendanthad employed one of its former senior prototypist in breach of the agreement between the Plaintiff and that employee.  The Plaintiffalso alleged misuse of its confidential information by the Defendant.  The action was tried together with another action betweenthe same parties.  After the close of the Plaintiffâs evidence, the Defendant elected not to call any evidence in this action. This court heard closing submissions in this action before it resumed to hear the rest of the evidence for the other action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The employee in question is Mr Pennacchia [âMr Pâ].  He had been employed by the Plaintiff from 1994 to early 2001.  He wasre-employed by the Plaintiff in December 2001.  He tendered his resignation in September 2002.  When he was re-employed, Mr P signeda Non-competition Agreement with the Plaintiff.  This action concerns the alleged engagement by the Defendant of the service of MrP from January to May 2003.  The Plaintiffâs case is that such engagement is actionable as procurement of breach of contract byMr P.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Further, the Plaintiff alleged that Mr P had wrongfully disclosed to the Defendant certain confidential information belonging tothe Plaintiff and the Defendant should be liable for breach of confidence.  In Paragraph 8 of the Amended Statement of Claim, theconfidential information was pleaded as follows,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(a)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">the Plaintiffâs designs for furniture, including but not limited to the designs of sofas and armchairs; and </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(b)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">the Plaintiffâs furniture manufacturing process management system.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In the Voluntary Particulars supplied by the Plaintiff on 5 March 2004, the Plaintiff identified the relevant designs as designsfor model Nos. 2142, 2144, I139 and R681.  These were said to be items that had not been available in the market before Mr P resigned.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Plaintiff also gave particulars in the same document regarding the furniture manufacturing process management system.  Two maincomponents were identified: (a) the recording of time taken for each steps in the production process for costs accounting purposes;and (b) standardized âsewing and cutting schemesâ used for production of furniture.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Defendant denied that it had employed Mr P in breach of the Non-competition Agreement although it admitted employing Mr P from1 June 2004.  It also denied the use of the alleged confidential information.  In his closing submissions, Mr Yan SC submitted thatfactually the Plaintiff had not even established a prima facie case on these matters.  Further, Mr Yan contended that the Non-competitionAgreement was unenforceable as a restraint of trade and the information identified by the Plaintiff did not have the requisite degreeof confidentiality to sustain any cause of action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The following are the broad issues that have to be resolved by this court,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="94%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Whether the Defendant had employed Mr P during the prohibited period under the Non-competition Agreement; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="94%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Whether the Non-competition Agreement is enforceable in Hong Kong; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="94%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Whether the Defendant had used any information of the Plaintiff without authorization; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(d)</td>                <td width="94%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Whether the misuse of information is actionable on account of its confidential nature. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">I.

Drawing adverse inference from election not to call evidence</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Mr Smith SC further invited the court to draw adverse inference against the Defendant by reason of the latterâs election not tocall any evidence.  In a nutshell, counsel submitted that the Defendant and Mr P could easily testify in the witness box about MrPâs activities in Shenzhen at the material time and they chose not to take the opportunity to dispel the suspicion generated bythe matters set out above.  In this connection, counsel referred to the judgment of Brown LJ in <i>Benham Ltd v Kythira Investments Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2003/1794.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] EWCA Civ 1794.</a>  At Para. 30, His Lordship said,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="100%" valign="top" class="quote">âThe point is worth making too even in those cases where the defendant elects to call no evidence.  True, as Mance LJ made plainin <i>Miller</i>, the only issue then is whether the claimant has established his claim on the balance of probabilities.  But it must be recognizedthat he may have done so by establishing no more than a weak prima facie case which has then been strengthened to the necessary standardof proof by the adverse inferences to be drawn from the defendantâs election.  Such adverse inferences can in other words tip thebalance of probability in the claimantâs favour.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  I have discussed the relevant principles regarding the drawing of adverse inferences in a civil trial where a party does not callevidence available to him in <i>Ip Man Shan Henry v Ching Hing Construction Co Ltd (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20HKC%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 HKC 256</a> at p. 307 Para. 155.  A prima facie case has to be made out by the other evidence before one talks about tipping the balance of probabilityby the omission to call available evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Although very often the court has to draw inference from some primary facts to come to a finding and it is possible for a primafacie case to be established in such a matter, there is always a line to be drawn between conjectures and inferences.  This was highlightedrecently by Ribeiro PJ in <i>Nina Kung v Wang Di Shin</i> FACV No 12 of 2004, 16 September 2005, at Paras. 185 to 186.  From the Australian cases cited by His Lordship, I derive these twopropositions that are pertinent for present purposes,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">An inference can be drawn in a civil case if the evidence give rise to a reasonable and definite inference that is more probable thanthe other conflicting inferences; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">But the facts proved must provide a reasonable basis for a definite conclusion before one enters the realm of inference.

The primary facts and evidence</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Before I consider whether a <i>prima facie</i> case of Mr P working for the Defendant had been established, I need to examine at greater length the primary facts.  Of the severalmatters relied on by Mr Smith in Paragraph 9 above, I am of the view that some were not satisfactorily proved.  In particular, Iam not satisfied that there was any noticeable increase in security activity on Mr P alleged approach on 4 May 2003 and I have doubtsregarding the assertion that Mr P visited on that day and stayed at the unofficial factory overnight.  I also have difficulties inseeing the connection between Mr P and the documents found outside the unofficial factory.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mr Elmer cannot give any first hand evidence about the so-called increase in security activity as he was not at the scene on 4 May2003.  Mr Kuang, who seems to be the coordinator of the PRC team, was in a vehicle and therefore not an agent on foot that was beingevicted.  Paragraph 9 of his statement referred to the information he had from someone called Jacky about dramatic increase of securityin the vicinity of the main factory.  Jacky did not give any witness statement and he was not called as a witness.  I have no explanationwhy he was not called.  Without any details or particulars, I have no idea what he meant by dramatic increase in security.  I donot attach much weight to such hearsay assertion.  In any event, the main factory was not the one that Mr P allegedly visited on4 May 2003.  Hence, no significance arises from the so-called increase in security thereat. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Paragraph 10 of Kuangâs statement referred to what happened at the Pingshan factory.  Kuang was not called as a witness althoughhis statement was produced by way of hearsay evidence.  On 9 June 2005, I directed pursuant to Order 38 Rule 21 that the Defendantbe allowed to cross-examine Kuang and the Plaintiff were to make such arrangements as are necessary to secure his attendance at thetrial.  As stated below, I am not satisfied with the explanation as to why he was not tendered for cross-examination.  Mr Yan submittedthat in such circumstances, not much weight could be attached to his witness statement.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  According to Paragraphs 10 and 11 of his witness statement, Kuang must have been busy with getting hold of the taxi driver and securingevidence from him after Mr P was allegedly dropped off at the Pingshan factory.  Hence, the time he had to observe the security atthat place must have been a short one.  He said the vehicles and agents on foot were evicted from the area by factory security. It is not clear to me what was the area he was referring to and what was the measure adopted by the security guard to âevictâthem.  If the vehicles and agents had trespassed into private property, I see nothing suspicious arising from their eviction.  Ifthey were at public place blocking access to the factory (Kuang himself said in Paragraph 10 that the entrance to the factory wasvery narrow), eviction is again not surprising.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In this connection, I note that at p. 6 of the private investigatorâs report, there was reference to video taken on 4 May 2003as regards the factory entrance.  That video footage was however not included in exhibit P-52 produced to the court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  This court is not going to speculate.  The state of evidence is that without any oral testimony from those who took part in thesurveillance exercise, I do not have a clear picture as to what had happened.  I am therefore unable to find that there had beenany increase in security at the Pingshan factory upon Mr Pâs alleged arrival on 4 May 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Regarding Mr Pâs alleged visit to the Pingshan factory on 4 May, Mr Yan emphasized that Kuang did not say that he saw Mr P comingout of the taxi.  All along he just followed the taxi by reference to the registration number given to him by Mr Elmer.  The personwho supplied the registration number of that taxi to Mr Elmer was not called to give evidence nor did he make any witness statement. The statement from the taxi driver only referred to two white men.  It would have been quite simple for Kuang to show the taxi drivera picture of Mr P and ask him to confirm whether Mr P was on the taxi.  However, that was not done.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The video footage in P-52 only showed Mr Pâs arrival at the Hong Kong International Airport on 4 May 2003.  The next footage showeda white vehicle arriving at the factory.  According to the chronology set out in the report, that would be the next morning on 5May 2003.  Some time later, the white vehicle left the Pingshan factory and it was driven to a private estate of domestic residenceknown as Ngau King Fa Yuen [âthe Estateâ].  Up to that stage, contrary to what was suggested in the report at the entry relatingto 12:00 pm on 5 May 2003, Mr P was not seen on the video.  He was only captured later as he emerged from the Estate and got intothe driverâs seat of the white vehicle.  He drove back to another factory.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Kuang said in his witness statement that on 5 May 2003 he saw Mr P drive the white vehicle from the Pingshan factory to the Estate.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Without Kuang testifying in the witness box, I have no evidence as to the quality of the observation by Kuang regarding Mr P drivingout of the Pingshan factory.  It is apparent from the video tape that Kuang was in a car parking at some distance to the entranceof the Pingshan factory.  Kuang said in his own statement that the entrance was narrow.  It is unlikely that he had witnessed thedriver boarding the white vehicle.  Neither did the tape show the same.  I have no explanation why the report mistakenly stated thatMr P was captured on the video as the driver driving the white vehicle out of the factory.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Kuangâs statement and the report were admitted as hearsay evidence.  However, I do not have any satisfactory explanation as towhy Kuang was not called as a witness notwithstanding my direction of 9 June 2005.  Nor do I have any evidence as to the identityof the agents who supply the information for the relevant entries in the report and why such agents were not called to give evidence. Mr Smith had faintly suggested that the absence of Kuang had something to do with the incident on 10 June 2003.  I do not acceptthat as satisfactory explanation.  To start with, the Plaintiff had not adduced any evidence in whatever shape or form from Kuangor anyone else to put this forward as reason for his absence.  Further, Kuang did not have any difficulty in providing the Plaintiffwith his witness statement on 17 August 2004.  He was therefore expecting to testify notwithstanding what happened on 10 June 2003. Also, that incident did not have any impact on Mr Elmerâs coming to court to testify.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  I have the same problems with the reference in the report to identification of Mr P as driver parking the car at the Estate.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The movement of Mr P on 4 and 5 May 2003 had always been an issue in dispute.  It behoves the Plaintiff to prove its case properly. The Plaintiff chose to discharge its onus of proof by relying on hearsay evidence that inherently raises questions with regard toits reliability.  Having directed myself to the matters I have to consider under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s49.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 49</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a>, I come to the conclusion that I cannot accept the statements in the witness statement and report on their face value.  As I said,I see no reason why Kuang and other agents who have first hand knowledge cannot come to the court to testify.  The Plaintiff didnot raise any objection to my direction of 9 June 2005.  There are certainly questions that could be asked of these witnesses thatmight cast a very different light as to their evidence.  The witness statement and report were not contemporaneous records but weremade specifically for litigation purposes.  Statements in the report were multiple hearsay as Mr Elmer was not present at Shenzhenon 4 and 5 May 2003.  Whilst these people were private investigators and may not have any interest in misrepresenting things, thereare always possibilities of innocent or negligent mistakes.  The agents had probably consulted each other in making the report andwitness statement.  Although it might not be intentional, the absence of oral testimony from these witnesses does present a problemto this court in the evaluation of the weight of their written evidence.  Regarding the identification of Mr P as the driver drivingout of the factory at noon on 5 May, the report does not seem to tally with the video tape produced.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In assessing the weight of the hearsay evidence, I bear in mind that the Defendant did not adduce any evidence.  Mr P and Mr Riccicould probably have told the court whether Mr P visited the Pingshan factory on 4 and 5 May and for how long did he stay there. Mr Smith invited the court to draw adverse inference against the Defendant for failing to call such evidence.  However, the sameargument can be applied with regard to the absence of Kuang and the other agents who were present at the surveillance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  I am prepared to conclude that the premises at Pingshan were the Defendantâs factory.  Apart from the evidence set out in thereport of 17 June 2003 by the private investigator, the appearance of Mr Ricci on 10 June 2003 when the team of private investigatorssought information from the landlord is indicative.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  But I am not satisfied that Mr P visited the Pingshan factory on 4 May and stayed there overnight until 5 May.  I am however satisfiedthat Mr P had visited the Defendantâs factory on 5 May as he drove the white vehicle to the factory.  Mr Smith referred to thedestination of Mr P as the official factory.  The video suggests that it was the Pingshan factory.  The agent who took the videocommented on the video that he had passed the large factory (viz. the official factory) and headed to the factory where they hadbeen at that morning, viz. the so-called unofficial factory.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I do not regard the occupation of Mr P of the domestic premises at Shenzhen and his appearance at the Estate as having any probativesignificance towards proving Mr P working at the Defendantâs factory.  The report contained conflicting statements as to who wasthe tenant.  In one paragraph at p. 8, it was suggested that Mr P was the tenant.  In the other paragraph, it was said that the unitappears to be rented by a female who was the girlfriend of Mr P.  I do not see how a visit by Mr P to his girlfriendâs residencecould provide a reasonable basis for inferring that he was working for the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Neither do I see any reasonable basis for connecting Mr P with the documents retrieved outside the Pingshan factory.  Mr Smith askedthe court to infer that the documents were based on confidential information supplied by Mr P to the Defendant by reason of the letterdated 25 May 2002 from the Defendantâs solicitors to the Plaintiffâs solicitors.  In that letter, it was said,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="100%" valign="top" class="quote">âThe proptotypists at De Coro do not prepare the sketches he refers to, although we understand that this was the practice of prototypistsat Natuzzi â¦ as well as at other sofa manufacturing companies.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The sketches that were referred to were those mentioned in Paragraph 7 of the witness statement of Giuseppe Lella of 28 January2002.  They were sketches prepared by prototypists based on full scale drawings of design.  The sketches were to illustrate how aprototypist will work with the foam, fabric and covering for the sofa.  It is however clear from the context of the whole paragraphin that witness statement that these were sketches prepared prior to the design being finalized and even before the prototype wasbuilt.  They were not the same as sketches used for production purposes since it was stated in the same paragraph that there couldbe modifications and adjustments after a prototype had been built.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Hence, what the Defendantâs solicitors asserted in May 2002 did not have much bearing on sketches used for production purposes.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The Plaintiff had the opportunity to clarify from Mr Lella in respect of the use of such sketches for production purposes in theDefendantâs factory.

Conclusions on inference </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Even taking into account of the admission that Mr P worked for the Defendant since 1 June 2004 and the submission of Mr Smith thatit was likely that the Defendant took the risk to employ Mr P earlier in view of the Defenceâs challenge as to the validity ofthe Non-competition Agreement, I do not regard these primary facts as sufficient to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of employment of Mr P by the Defendant in 2003.  It is simply impossible to conclude that the purpose of Mr Pâs visit on 5May must be the provision of service for the Defendant.  It is equally likely that he went there to discuss with the Defendant abouthim being employed after the expiration of the Non-competition Agreement.  As Mr Yan submitted, had Mr P been working at the Defendantâsfactory, it would not be too difficult for the private investigator to monitor his movement for a longer period to provide a reasonablebasis for such inference.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  By reason of that, the election of the Defendant not to call any evidence does not assist the Plaintiff.

The enforceability of the Non-competition Agreement</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Parties have agreed that this court should not be concerned with Italian law or PRC law and the only question that this court hasto decide is whether the Non-competition Agreement is enforceable as a matter of Hong Kong law.  Although I am not sure if it iscorrect that I should ignore PRC law (since procurement of breach of contract is a tort and to be actionable in Hong Kong, a tortcommitted outside jurisdiction is subject to the double actionability requirement), given my above conclusion on the facts, I willconfine myself in this judgment to enforceability in terms of Hong Kong law.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The Non-competition Agreement made on 5 June 2002 prohibited Mr P from competing with the Plaintiff for a period of 18 months afterthe termination of his employment.  It is drafted in very wide terms.  The material parts of Clause 1 stipulated that Mr P âwillnot carry out any work, either as an employee or consultant of any form whatsoever, whether on a full-time, and/or part-tile basis,whether on a subordinate or freelance basis, whether directly and/or indirectly through a third party, on behalf of or at companiesâ¦ carrying on activities that directly compete with those carried out by the Natuzzi Group [and then a list of activities wereset out by way of non-exhaustive examples]â.

Even though the categories of information that might justify reasonable protection by an appropriately drafted restraint may beexpanded as the level of sophistication in the commercial world continuously to develop, I am of the view that general knowledgeas to the employerâs business organization and management of the kind referred to in <i>Herbert Morris</i> remains as the general stock in trade acquired by an employee who could legitimately use the same for the benefit of his new employer. In the words of Cross J, I do not think that any man of average intelligence and honesty would think that there was anything improperin so doing.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">II (2). The pleadings and the conduct of the case at the trial  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  In the pleadings, the Plaintiff did not plead clearly what legitimate interests it would rely upon to justify the restraint as setout in the Non-Competition Agreement.  In reply to the challenge to the enforceability, the Plaintiff pleads in Paragraph 6 of theReply that the agreement is enforceable by reference to decisions by the Court of Bari, the interlocutory decision of Recorder Wongand the payment of full remuneration during the restraint period.  At the trial, Mr Smith did not advance any arguments that thedecisions by the Court of Bari and Recorder Wong had any significance in terms of the enforceability issue.  Instead, counsel reliedon the matters set out in Paragraphs 3 to 5 above.  No objection was taken by the defence and the trial had been conducted on thatbasis.  To be fair to the pleader, particulars of those matters were pleaded as voluntary particulars of the knowledge acquired byMr P in the course of his employment with the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Since the burden of establishing the enforceability of a restrictive covenant rests on the Plaintiff, it should have pleaded thesame with full particulars including all facts and matters relied upon by it to assert that the covenant is enforceable.  A bareassertion that the clause is enforceable is not enough.  It should plead the interests it relied upon and how such interests reasonablywarrant a protection as wide as that embodied in the contract.  If a plaintiff intends to put forward a case of severance, whetherby way of alternative argument or primary argument, it should also be pleaded.  As it would be apparent from what I said below, tosome extent, the failure to plead the issues properly in the instant case had led to a failure on the part of the Plaintiff to adduceadequate evidence on some relevant issues.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">II (3). The furniture manufacturing process management system</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  With the authorities and these remarks in mind, I turn to the interest relied upon by the Plaintiff in the course of the trial tojustify the Non-Competition Agreement identified in Paragraphs 3 to 5 above.  I shall first deal with the furniture manufacturingprocess management system.  I confess I have great difficulties in understanding how the ideas of recording time for each step inproduction for cost accounting purposes and the use of sewing and cutting schemes could be anything other than general business managementof the Plaintiff.  A number of witnesses deposed that similar methods were employed by other furniture manufacturers apart from thePlaintiff although Mr Lella said the Plaintiff had pursued the same more vigorously.  I do not consider the ideas of adopting suchsystems in a furniture manufacturing business as remotely having the necessary secrecy or confidentiality to support a post-employmentrestraint of trade.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Mr Smith cited several cases for the proposition that the fact that some trade rivals already had the same information does notnecessarily negate its confidential nature.  I have no quarrel with that as a proposition of law.  However, one must still ask whetherthe information relied upon by the Plaintiff in the present case possess any quality that could legitimately support a restraintof trade.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Mr Smith submitted that the Plaintiffâs methodologies are about the use of standardized documents to facilitate the assessmentand reduction of production costs and the assembly of sofas in the manufacturing process.  He also reminded this court of the evidenceof Mr Difilippo as to the techniques and codification system of the Plaintiff.  Based on the evidence of Mr Lella, counsel suggestedthat the other furniture manufacturerâs production systems were not as sophisticated as that of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  The particulars of confidential information set out in the Plaintiffâs pleadings did not refer to the codification system andMr Difilippo was not asked to explain specifically what that was.  Given the state of the pleadings, parties did not explore muchabout the codification system in evidence and Mr Difilippo only referred to it by way of a passing remark.  Insofar as the codificationsystem was the same as the identification of different components in the templates by designated alphabets, it cannot be sufficientto justify a post-employment restraint of trade.  In the circumstances, I do not think the Plaintiff could rely on the codificationsystem to uphold the validity of the Non-Competition Agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  It does not take a lot of sophistication to come up with the ideas of recording time spent on a process by a time sheet and settingout relevant information for production in sewing scheme and diagrams.  One cannot hide away from the fact that these are featuresof the general system of business operation which an employee of the Plaintiff can reasonably be expected to learn about and incorporateas part of his stock in the trade and general skill.  He is therefore entitled to use the same for the benefit of his new employerafter he left the Plaintiffâs employment.  To hold contrary will lead to an absurd result that no competitor can legitimately adoptthese simple methods for his business so long as he employs an ex-employee of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">II (4). The new designs</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Turning to the designs for furniture, I accept that a prototypist might acquire knowledge as regard new designs which could providea proper justification for a suitably drafted restraint of trade provision.  In this context, the question has to be considered byreference to the situation at the time of the contract.  Although a lot of the designs of the Plaintiff were created by differentmix and match of recurrent features as highlighted by Mr Yan in his cross-examination of Mr Pontrandolfo and in his closing submissions,one cannot say that all the new designs of the Plaintiff were so devoid of novelty that no restraint can be justified. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The selection of a particular mix and match could be an indication of the Plaintiffâs perception as to the market trend.  Eventhough an unpublished design might not have been tested in the market, the prediction of a market leader could sometime provide usefulguidance for others.  This could be valuable information in a competitive industry like the furniture manufacturing field.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  However, the usefulness of the information would only last for a very limited duration.  Once a new design is published by way ofnew model being displayed in trade exhibition and showroom or being advertised in trade magazines, it would be known to all the competitors.The confidentiality of the information would be spent.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The Plaintiff has not adduced any evidence as regards the time frame for which a new design would generally remain unpublished andits confidentiality preserved.  As Mr Yan submitted, the burden of proving the need for protection as wide as that prescribed bythe Non-Competition Agreement falls fairly and squarely on the Plaintiff, see <i>Herbert Morris</i> at p. 715; <i>Commercial Plastics Ltd v Vincent</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%201%20QB%20623" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] 1 QB 623</a> at p. 644-5. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  There is evidence that the Plaintiff had a new model produced every two or three days and some were models based on modificationsto existing models.  Mr Scarati was said to have produced seven and eight design drawings every day.  Less experienced designerscould produce five or six drawings a day.  It took a prototypist about seven or eight days to make a prototype after the full scaledrawing had been prepared.  Judging from these matters and the evidence relating to the lead time on preparation for Highpoint exhibitions,in the absence of specific evidence from the Plaintiff pertaining to the issue, I conclude that the duration of confidentiality ofa new design could not have been longer than 6 months.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  In contrast, the Non-competition Agreement provided for a restraint of 18 months.  I cannot detect any justification from the evidencefor such a long period of restraint.  The bare assertion by Mr Campanale is of no assistance.  His evidence did not shed much lighton how the Plaintiff had determined the relevant duration of restraint for each employee.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">II (5). Payment of remuneration in full </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Mr Smith relied on the fact that the prototypist was remunerated at full rate during the period of restraint.  In my judgment thatis not a good answer.  It does not begin to address the legitimacy of the restraint from the public interest point of view.  In thisconnection, the Court of Appealâs decision in <i>JA Mont v Mills</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20IRLR%20172" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] IRLR 172</a> is relevant.  That case concerned a restrictive covenant for one year supported by payment of full remuneration.  It was held thatit was unenforceable as it was framed too widely and notwithstanding the payment of consideration, there was a distinction betweenâgarden leaveâ restraint and post termination restraint.  At p. 177, Simon Brown LJ analysed the distinction as follows at Paras.37 and 38,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="100%" valign="top" class="quote">âAnd the essence of the distinction is that because employees [on garden leave, by reason of him being still employed] owe a dutyof good faith, the courts can, irrespective of the existence of any express contractual covenant, enjoin against its breach by preventingtheir employment by trade rivals.  That is simply not the case once the contract of employment ends.  â¦ The duty of good faith,in my judgment, arises out of the obligation of loyalty inevitably owed by an employee to his employer.

I do not think those cases provide useful guidance in a different context, viz. restraint regarding ex-employee.  I respectfullyagreed with the following observations by Sir Christopher Slade in <i>Office Angels Ltd v Rainer Thomas &amp; OâConnor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%20IRLR%20214" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] IRLR 214</a> at Para. 22,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="100%" valign="top" class="quote">âA distinction is, however to be drawn between (a) a covenant against competition entered into by a vendor with the purchaser ofthe goodwill of a business, which will be upheld as necessary to protect the subject-matter of the sale, provided that it is confinedto the area within which competition on the part of the vendor would be likely to injure the purchaser in the enjoyment of the goodwillhe has bought, and (b) a covenant between master and servant designed to prevent competition by the servant with the master afterthe termination of his contract of service.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">The same point was made by Lord Parker at p. 708-9 and Lord Shaw at p. 713-4 in <i>Herbert Morris</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Mr Smith referred to the judgment of Waung J in <i>BSC Building Materials Supply Co Ltd v Cheung Chi Hung</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20HKC%20425" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 HKC 425</a> at p. 438E to H.  Unlike the usual scenario where restraint was built into the employment contract at the beginning or upon the renewalof the same, the case concerns a restraint imposed under an agreement made between the employee and the employer upon his departure. The employer agreed to pay the employee an <i>ex gratia</i> bonus of $13 million even though he was not entitled to retirement pension.  The employee had been a principal officer of the company. The company sought to enforce the restraint (which was for 2 years).  The employee applied to strike out the claim.  His Lordshiptook into account of the $13 million paid by the company to the ex-employee in deciding whether the claim should be struck out. His Lordship also found arguable three heads of legitimate interest to justify the restraint on the facts of the case, see p. 433-5. It is also clear from the judgment that whether those interests could justify a restraint of two years would be matters that hadto be investigated at the trial.  Bearing in mind that it was a decision on a striking out application, and the case of <i>JA Mont v Mills</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20IRLR%20172" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] IRLR 172</a> was apparently not cited, I do not regard <i>BSC Building Materials</i> as authority for the proposition that even if the legitimate interest of an employer were inadequate to justify a restraint too widelydrafted, it could somehow be saved by payment of full remuneration during the period of restraint.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  In my judgment, even though the payment of full remuneration might have some bearing in a marginal case, particularly when the questionis the reasonableness of the restraint as between the employer and the employee, it can never be treated as the substitute for establishingthe need for protection as wide as the restraint set forth in the contract by reference to the legitimate interest of the employer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">II (6). Conclusions on enforceability</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  In the present context, I am of the view that the Plaintiff fails to discharge the burden in satisfying this court that a 18 monthsrestraint is required in the contract with Mr P to protect its legitimate interest in terms of the confidentiality of new designs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  I therefore hold that Clause 1 of the Non-competition Agreement is unenforceable as a matter of Hong Kong law.  In the light ofmy conclusion on unenforceability by reason of the failure to justify the duration of the restraint in any event, it is not necessaryfor me to deal with the unpleaded argument of severance advanced by Mr Smith in his Closing Submissions.  That argument does notassist the Plaintiff in any way with regard to the unduly lengthy period of restraint.  I would just briefly mention that I agreewith Mr Yan that as a matter of construction, it is impossible to read down Clause 1 of the Non-Competition Agreement by deletingthe words âby way of example and are not exhaustiveâ, âbed bases and metallic furnishingsâ, âworking and tanning of leather,production and sale of polyurethane and other materials used in the packaging of furnitureâ in the clause.  It would change thesubstantive meaning of the earlier part of that clause.  In other words, the deletion of those words would render the obligationcreated by the clause substantively different, particularly in terms of construing what are the âactivities that directly competewith those carried out by the Natuzzi Groupâ referred to by the first part of the clause.  As such, the proposed severance cannotsatisfy the test set out in <i>Sadler v Imperial Life Assurance Company of Canada</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20IRLR%20388" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] IRLR 388</a> para. 19 applied in the recent case of <i>TFS Derivatives Ltd v Morgan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%20IRLR%20246" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] IRLR 246.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">III. Misuse of confidential information</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  I propose to deal with the remaining two broad issues together.  The Plaintiffâs claim on breach of confidence is based on contractas well as the equitable duty of confidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Of the information relied upon (identified in Paragraphs 3 to 5 above), for reasons given in the discussion above in the contextof the legitimate interest of the Plaintiff in respect of the Non-competition Agreement, there cannot be any claim by reference tothe furniture manufacturing process management system.  As a matter of law, such information cannot be regarded as confidential sinceit is information falling within the scope of the general stock in trade of an employee who should be free to exploit the same forthe benefit of his new employer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  As regards the new designs for furniture, there is not a single piece of evidence suggesting that the Defendant had made use ofsuch designs.  In his Closing Submissions, Mr Smith did not refer to the designs in the context of misuse of confidential information.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  In the circumstances, the Plaintiffâs claims based on confidential information also fail.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">IV.
