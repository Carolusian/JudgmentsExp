For all intents and purposes in this case there is no point in distinguishingthe two. Hence the Respondents are together referred to in this judgment as the Respondents. The Applicant was hired by the Respondentsas an assistant uniform and linen supervisor in 1996. She had been working for the Respondents in a hotel on Hong Kong island untilsome time in 1998 when she requested transfer to a hotel nearer her home in Tuen Mun. On 1st September 1998 the Respondents postedher to the Regal Kai Tak Hotel in Kowloon for training as a chambermaid. As a chambermaid, her duties were quite different. It isnot disputed that as a chambermaid the Applicant had to make up a number of guest rooms everyday. The process of making up roomsrequired lifting bed mattresses and pulling and pushing beds. It is now also common ground that the Applicant went to work on 25September 1998 - the day of the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> On the day of the accident, according to her own evidence, when she was making up the seventh (but not the last) room assigned toher, the Applicant lifted up a heavy mattress in order to tuck in a bed sheet. In the process of handling the heavy mattress, theApplicant felt pain radiating from her back bone to the right leg. She then fell to the floor. After she managed to pick herselfup, she called her immediate supervisor George Ho ("George") through the phone and reported to him what had happened to her. TheApplicant insisted in her evidence that George went to the room where she was working to see her. Eventually, she was taken to theExecutive Housekeeper's Office and put through the phone to one Mr. Lam ("Mr. Lam") the Executive Housekeeper in charge of the Applicant.It should be noted that Mr. Lam was at the time based at the Respondents' hotel in Chek Lap Kok Airport.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> By all accounts, Mr. Lam spoke with the Applicant over the telephone some time near noon time on 25th September 1998. According tothe Applicant, she told Mr. Lam that she had a bad back and requested posting back to the Uniform and Linen Room. Mr. Lam, however,responded that since she had a bad back she should know what to do. The Applicant took it as an indication that she should resign.Hence she went to the Human Resources Office of the Regal Kai Tak Hotel to hand it a written resignation and, after surrenderingstores issued to her, left the hotel some time after 1 p.m.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> After leaving the hotel, the Applicant took a bus heading for her home in Tuen Mun. When the bus was about to reach the stop whereshe wanted to get off, the evidence went on, the Applicant got up. She then felt another strike of pain in the lower back extendingto her right leg. She fell on the floor of the bus with buttocks landing first. Eventually she managed to make her way home. However,later in the evening, her condition was such that she sought treatment at the Accident and Emergency Department of Tuen Mun Hospital.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> In fact, the Applicant had a medical history. Counsel for the Applicant has very helpfully prepared a summary of the medical history:-</p>    <p class="heading">Summary of medical history of the Applicant</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="30%"><em>Date of consultation</em></td>                <td valign="top" width="30%"><em>Reasons(s)</em></td>                <td valign="top" width="30%"><em>sick leave period (if any)</em></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="30%">19/3/1997(A &amp; E)</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">pain at low back after lifting weight at work</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">17/3/97 - 25/3/97</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="30%">13/8/1997</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">sprain back on 19/7, backache</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">1 day</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="30%">10/9/1997</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">right knee pain for 3 days &amp; flu</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">Nil</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="30%">10/2/1998</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">neck pain for 1 day</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">Nil</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="30%">7/3/1998 (A &amp; E)</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">back pain radiating to right leg for 2 days</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">19 days (7-28/3/98)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="30%">25/3/1998</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">sudden increase in low back pain on 7/3/1998 while sleeping</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">Nil</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="30%">8/9/1998</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">low back pain</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">Nil</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="30%">17/9/1998</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">back pain, knee pain and finger pain since last week (no recent injury)</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">Nil</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="30%">21/9/1998 (A &amp; E)</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">back pain radiating to left leg for 1 week</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">4 days (21-24/9/98)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="30%">25/9/1998 (A &amp; E)</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">low back pain for 1 day (trauma, sudden onset)</td>                <td valign="top" width="30%">111 days (25/9/98-13/1/99)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The Respondents' pleaded defence is deceptively simple - the Applicant's alleged injury at work on 25 September 1998 is denied andthe Applicant is put to strict proof. At the trial, the Respondents attacked the Applicant's case in three ways: (1) the Applicantdid not suffer any trauma whilst working in the morning on 25 September 1998; (2) if there was any trauma on 25th September 1998,it was the result of the accident on the bus after the Applicant had resigned or it was the relapse of a pre-existing condition;and (3) even if there was industrial injury, the disability caused was no worse that what the Applicant had been suffering before.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Although both parties called medical experts, neither expert can confirm one way or the other whether the Applicant did suffer fromtrauma during work on 25th September 1998. The case, on the issue of liability, ultimately turns on the credibility of witnessesas to facts.</p>    <p class="heading">Liability</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The Applicant was alone when the alleged industrial injury took place. However, she said she did tell 3 people in the employ of theRespondents of her injury immediately after the alleged accident. The first was George, the immediate supervisor working in the samehotel. George in giving evidence denied that the Applicant reported to him of injury at work on 25 September 1998. He said he didnot know of the Applicant's complaint of injury nor of her resignation even when the Applicant did not report for work on 26 September1998. So in the morning on 26 September 1998 he reported to Mr. Lam of the Applicant's absence from work without leave.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> I have no difficulty at all in finding George an unreliable witness. Being the immediate supervisor of the Applicant and answerableto the hotel management for the making up of rooms under his charge, it is highly incredible that George did not know that the Applicantleft work at lunch time without finishing making up rooms assigned by George to her. On his own evidence, George had to check thework of the Applicant. He must have discovered on 25 September 1998 that the Applicant "disappeared" before finishing her quota ofrooms. George said he reported to Mr. Lam on the morning of 26 September 1998 about the Applicant's absence and even then he didnot learn that the Applicant had resigned. Mr. Lam, however, gave evidence and said categorically that George did not and had noreason to report to him the matter of the Applicant's absence on 26 September 1998. Besides, Mr. Lam admitted that he learned inthe afternoon of 25 September 1998 of the Applicant's resignation. This being the case, there is no reason why, if George did reportto Mr. Lam on the morning of 26th September 1998, Mr. Lam did not tell George that the Applicant had resigned. In short, George isdiscredited by another of the Respondents' witnesses.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Mr. Lam is the second person the Applicant said she complained to about back injury on 25 September 1998. Mr. Lam admitted that hedid speak to her over the telephone but she did not mention back pain at all and he had no opportunity to find out over the telephonewhy she wanted to resign. The Applicant, he said in evidence, hung up on him. Later the same day, he got a message that the Applicanthad tendered resignation and gone.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The third person is Mr. Ho. Mr. Ho ("Mr. Ho"), an Assistant Personnel Officer at the Regal Kai Tai Hotel, gave evidence that he didsee the Applicant at about noon time on 25 September 1998 when the Applicant tendered her resignation. He remembered that the Applicantdid mention to him that she had back pain. I have no reason at all to disbelieve Mr. Ho. Since the Applicant told Mr. Ho that shehad back pain, I see no reason why she did not also tell Mr. Lam of her back problem. The Applicant could have simply gone to theHuman Resources Department and tendered resignation to Mr. Ho. But she took the trouble of speaking to Mr. Lam over the telephonebefore proceeding to the Human Resources Department. Obviously she wanted to approach Mr. Lam, the head of her department, with herproblem hoping that he could solve it. So, despite all the air of caring management expressed by Mr. Lam, I do not believe him. Ithink it is much more likely that, as the Applicant stated in evidence, upon hearing the Applicant's complaint of back pain, Mr.Lam hinted to her to resign.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> As to the Applicant's own credibility, she has no other witnesses to back up her story. However, both medical experts who examinedher for the purposes of this case stated that the Applicant did not exaggerate her symptoms. So there is some independent confirmationthat the Applicant is an honest person. Moreover, if the Applicant manufactured a story to claim compensation, one can see from hermedical history that she suffered from an industrial injury in March 1997, one year before, whilst also working for the Respondentsbut she had not filed any claim for that earlier accident. As she said in evidence, she did not know on 25 September 1998 that thekind of injuries she suffered in March 1997 and September 1998 for lifting weighty objects at work amounted to industrial injuryand attracted compensation. She said it was only after she had been admitted into hospital for treatment on the 25 September 1998and the medical staff had advised her that she realized she should claim statutory employee compensation. Her evidence is borne outby hospital records. The Accident and Emergency Department record for 25 September 1998 shows that she reported the accident on thebus. There is hardly any mention of trauma at work. Had the Applicant wanted to shift the blame for her medical condition to workat the hotel, which is what the Respondents contended, she could have simply said nothing about the incident on the bus and emphasizedthe incident at the hotel.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Last but not the least, as Mr. Sakhrani counsel for the Applicant suggested, if there was no special event on the morning of 25 September1998, why would the Applicant suddenly resign and why would the hotel let her walk out before she had finished her shift? To this,I would add that if the Applicant was not suffering, if she was merely not content with the post of chambermaid, she had no reasonnot to give notice of resignation and serve out her notice. Remarkably, the Respondents, believing that the Applicant had no causefor complaint about work conditions and yet walked out of her job without giving prior notice, have not pursued the Applicant forpayment in lieu of notice.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> For all the reasons given, I believe the Applicant told the truth that she had a trauma in the lower back bone as she was liftinga heavy mattress during work on the morning of 25 September 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Once it is accepted that the Applicant suffered from trauma whilst performing strenuous duty during work, it is reasonable to deducethat the trauma was due to an accident and not relapses of a pre-existing condition. There is also a presumption of accident accordingto <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5(4)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282" class="autolink_findacts">Employees' Compensation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282">Cap. 282</a> and the Respondents have not produced a shred of evidence to rebut this presumption. And it does not matter that the pre-existingcondition had rendered the Applicant more accident prone. The old Thin Skull Principle inures to the benefit of the Applicant.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> For safe measure, Mr. Sakhrani referred me to Richard Lavis' work, <em>Compensation For Industrial Injury</em>. There, the learned author observed that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" Although an accident in the popular imagination may conjure up some dramatic event causing the emergency services to turn out inan atmosphere of crisis or even disaster, it is apparent that under the industrial scheme many other types of incident not normallythought of as accidents are included within the term. These may be of the most trivial or unsensational nature and cause injury onlyin a stealthy manner. Thus, as discussed below, even the slow onset of disease in certain circumstances can be classified as an accident.Nor, as may popularly be suppose, need an accident be completely unexpected." (p.38)</p>        <p class="quote">" Because a particular event is required it does not mean that an accident must be confined to external incidents like mishaps withmachinery. It can include an internal physiological change for the worse as long as it amounts to a personal injury as defined below.All that is required is that such a change was contributed to in a material degree by the claimant's work (as discussed under causationbelow). This means that a muscle strain, a ricked back, or a rupture caused by lifting a weight at work can all be accidents. Noexceptional or violent exertion is required. Thus the claimant who "felt something go inside" whilst pushing a hand truck, and whowas then found to be suffering from angina induced by strain, was able to claim injury by accident in <em>CI 27/49</em>." (p.41)</p>        <p class="quote">" The crucial causation question asked in <em>R(I) 73/81</em> is "was it the disease that did it, or did the work that he was doing help in any material degree?" The work need only be a materialnot the predominant cause, so that compensation arises if a minor work incident has quite disproportionate physical results and theclaimant suffers much more serious injury than would a normal worker. It does not matter then that the industrial cause is the "laststraw which breaks the loaded camel's back", for the scheme takes its claimants as it finds them, including their pre-existing weaknesses.The rule is tort law that a plaintiff can succeed despite having an unusually "thin skull" which makes the effects of his accidentmust more severe is thus reflected under the scheme. It was applied in <em>R(I) 19/63</em> where a bakery assistant with a degenerative disc condition crouched down to put dishes under a table and this was the last strawwhich caused the complete prolapsed of an already partially relapsed disc. In <em>R(I) 16/62</em> a nick of the skin had such an effect upon the claimant's existing vascular condition that his foot had to be amputated. Benefitwas nevertheless paid.</p>        <p class="quote">The decisions have emphasised the need to find some feature in the employment which brought about the injury so that it arises "outof" employment. (See also the cases cited under that heading at p.83). The employment can be shown to be causally relevant in twoparticular ways:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) The cause of strains and heart conditions</p>            <p class="quote">If it can be shown that the word caused the strain which resulted in injury (and this is more likely if the work required specialeffort), then the claimant will succeed. According to <em>Clover, Clayton &amp; Co. v. Hughes</em> (1910) an accident arises out of employment "when the required exertion producing the accident is too great for the man undertakingthe work, whatever the degree of exertion or the condition of his health"., On this basis the claimant who suffered a hernia whilstlifting a heavy steel plat succeeded in obtaining benefit in <em>8/59(II)</em>. In <em>R6/70(II)</em> the strain was a material cause of the claimant's injury despite his pre-existing osteoarthritis which contributed to it." (p.47)</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Now, I can easily identify the lifting of the heavy mattress on the morning of 25 September 1998 as the incident - the metaphoricalstraw that broke the camel's back. So no doubt there was an accident within the meaning of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282" class="autolink_findacts">Employees' Compensation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282">Cap. 282</a>. Mr. Leung for the Respondents, in a stroke of genius, contended that since the Applicant was already suffering from backproblem and could not lift heavy weight before the accident, the injury resulting from the accident did not put the Applicant ina worse situation. The answer to that is that before the Applicant was transferred to the Housekeeping Department on 1 September1998, although the pre-existing condition did relapse about once every few months, it was not sufficiently grave to put her off work.She could still keep her job in the Uniform and Linen Department earning $11,008 a month. After starting work at the HousekeepingDepartment, the Applicant had to consult doctors 3 times within a matter of 3 weeks. No doubt there was the additional strain ofphysical exertion making up rooms and then, of course, the incident on 25 September 1998 which resulted in sick leave for 111 days.After that, there is uncontradicted evidence from the Applicant that she tried at least 3 jobs but could not hold on to them. Intwo jobs, one requiring occasional effort to put grocery merchandise on shelves and another requiring occasional pushing and pullingof merchandise on a wheeled trolley, she was dismissed within days for being unable to do strenuous work. It must also be noted thatthe jobs the Applicant lost after the accident paid between $6,000 to $6,500. Clearly, I think the Applicant had suffered from permanentincapacity over and above her pre-accident conditions as a result of the injury on 25 September 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Due to the nature of the defence, Mr. Leung did not argue that, notwithstanding the accident in the morning of 25 September 1998,it was only the incident on the bus that caused the permanent incapacity. Even if Mr. Leung did so argue, I am perfectly entitledto find that the fall on the bus was brought about by the onset of trauma in the morning. And, it is trite law that liability foraggravation of injury brought about by impaired health caused by an earlier accident still falls on the party liable for the firstaccident.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In the premises, on liability, I find for the Applicant.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> I am only required to consider compensation under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 9</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">10</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s10a.html" class="autolink_findacts">10A</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282" class="autolink_findacts">Employees' Compensation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282">Cap. 282</a>. For some reason, there is no claim for sick leave allowance. I do not know whether this is because the Respondents havefully paid the Applicant for sick leave or because the Respondent is treated as having resigned on 25 September 1998 and so she isnot entitled to sick leave allowance. But I would have thought that there is a strong case for constructive dismissal and, if theApplicant has to claim it, I should think sick leave allowance is due.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> As to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10</a> compensation, the amount has been agreed at $32,584. For <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s10a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10A</a>, the amount is also agreed at $1,176. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 9</a> loss of earnings, however, remains controversial. It is the percentage of loss of earning capacity that is in dispute. Although bothcounsel agree that <strong>Lui Kwong Yan v. Shui Hing Decoration Works</strong>, Civil Appeal No. 62 of 1992 applies, the principle enunciated there does not, of course, consist of a hard and fast formula fordetermining the percentage of loss of earning capacity.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Mr. Leung for the Respondents suggested that the permanent loss of earning capacity cannot be more than 19% because the relevantstatistics for light manual work in various industries for September 1998 give an average wage of $8,962 per month. Mr. Sakhranicontended that I should reject this percentage outright. Because the Applicant could not hold for more than a few days jobs paying$6,000 a month, her permanent loss of earning capacity should be at least $(11,008 - 6,000) Ã· 11,008 = 45%. And according to statisticsfrom the Labour Department for Selective Placement of persons with disability, the Applicant could be earning as low as $4,000 amonth. On the other hand, Mr. Leung said that Selective Placement statistics are not reliable either because we do not know the jobspecifications and the disability of the persons placed by the Labour Department. Mr. Sakhrani conceded that all we have are somefigures in a table with no explanatory notes on how the statistics were compiled by the Labour Department.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> I believe the percentage must be higher than 45% because the Applicant could not hold down jobs paying $6,000 a month. It is patentlyunrealistic to use the statistical average of $8,962 per month preferred by Mr. Leung. The percentage could be as high as (110,008- 4,000) Ã· 11,008 = 63%. Doing the best I can, I should strike at the golden mean of 55%. At this figure, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9</a> compensation should be $11,008 x 96 x 55% = $581,220.40.</p>    <p class="heading">Order</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Accordingly, I give judgment for the Applicant and award compensation at</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td align="left" width="10%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="30%" valign="top"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%">                    <p style="text-align:center">$</p>                </td>                <td width="35%" valign="top"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td align="left" width="10%" valign="top">(1)</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top">for <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9</a></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%">581,222.40</td>                <td width="35%" valign="top"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td align="left" width="10%" valign="top">(2)</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top">for <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10</a></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%">32,584.00</td>                <td width="35%" valign="top"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td align="left" width="10%" valign="top">(3)</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top">for <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s10a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10A</a></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%"><u>1,176.00</u></td>                <td width="35%" valign="top"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td align="left" width="10%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="30%" valign="top"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%">$614,982.40</td>                <td width="35%" valign="top"></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>together with interest thereon at half judgment rate until date of judgment and thereafter at full judgment rate until full payment.There is also costs to the Applicant to be taxed if not agreed and certificate for counsel.
