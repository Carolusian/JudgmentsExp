Chan (as he then was) given on 4 January 2010. The matter beforethe judge was an application to strike out the writ and statement of claim in this action and also an application to join Dr BuddyWong as the fifth defendant. The judge came to the conclusion that there was no reasonable cause of action and, therefore, struckout the statement of claim and the writ of summons. Likewise, he refused the application to join Dr Wong as the fifth defendant.At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal, judgment was reserved.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  This action was brought against the solicitorsâ firm and two partners and a solicitor of that firm that acted on behalf of thedefendant in a claim for medical negligence that had been brought by the plaintiff.  In the course of those proceedings an applicationwas made which resulted in an appeal to the Court of Appeal.  The court gave its decision on 14 October 2008 and the order of costswas that the plaintiff should pay the costs of the defendant in any event.  On 5 March 2009 the plaintiff sought leave to appealto the Court of Final Appeal.  That application was refused.  Following the refusal the defendant sought an order for costs to befixed by way of a gross sum order under Order 62 Rule 9(4)(b) of the Rules of the High Court.  The statement of costs that was putbefore the court came to a total of $115,550.  The court was highly critical of the way in which the skeleton bill of costs was prepared. This court has been shown a copy of the transcript of the argument as to costs.  It suffices to say that the court came to the conclusionthat the statements of costs was grossly inflated and included costs which were, at best, unnecessary and duplicative.  It is perhapsnot inappropriate to quote extensively from the judgment handed down 11 March 2009 in relation to costs as it gives cause for realconcern at the way the draft bill was prepared:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â9. The following breakdown is given regarding the charges of the solicitor: a partner (admitted in 1998) allegedly spent 10 hourson communications including conferences, telephone calls and letters with client, the other side, counsel and court. In addition,a trainee solicitor allegedly spent 3 hours on the same head. In total, the charge under this head added up to $43,900.</p>        <p class="quote">10. Whilst the Plaintiff may have corresponded with the solicitor firm in a manner that could have contributed to the escalation ofcosts, we fail to see how such a figure can be justified in the context of a simple application for leave to appeal to the Courtof Final Appeal.</p>        <p class="quote">11. Then another $15,900 was said to be incurred on perusal of documents. The documents identified are the order of 14 October 2008,the Notice of Motion issued by the Plaintiff on 6 February 2009 and his affirmation of 16 February 2009, a further document calledâthe Plaintiffâs application for leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appealâ of 20 February 2009. The partner and the traineesolicitor each claimed 3 hours for perusal.</p>        <p class="quote">12. The affirmation of 16 February 2009 was not filed for the purpose of this application and had not been relied upon by the Plaintiffin this application. It was clearly stated to be an affirmation for checklist review request. The perusal of that affirmation cannotbe regarded as part of the work related to this application. To include that in the statement of costs is misleading and improper.</p>        <p class="quote">13. In our view, bearing in mind that the solicitors involved were engaged in these proceedings all along, the perusal of the documentsrelevant to this application should not take more than 30 minutes. There should not be any duplication in charging perusal both bythe partners and the trainee.</p>        <p class="quote">14. Then, another $12,600 was charged for âbrief to counsel, review file, Defendantâs skeleton argument and Defendantâs statementof costsâ. The partner allegedly spent 2.5 hours and the trainee solicitor allegedly spent 2 hours for these matters. We do notknow how much of the time were spent on the preparation of this statement of costs. In our view, the statement of costs is so grosslyinflated and as such singularly unhelpful to this court that no costs should be allowed for its preparation. As regards the otheritems, given the simple nature of the application, only half an hour of a partnerâs time can be allowed. That should build intoit the costs of the trainee solicitor insofar as it is necessary for the partner to be assisted by a trainee in the performance ofsuch tasks.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The judgment concluded in paragraph 17:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn view of the inherent unreliability of the proposed statement of costs, we are not minded to make a gross some assessment. Wewould simply order the Plaintiff to pay costs of the application to the Defendant, such costs to be taxed if not agreed. We furtherdirect the taxing Master to have regard to our observations above in such taxation. The costs in relation to the letter of 5 March2009 should also be disallowed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In the course of the proceedings for medical negligence the first defendant has sworn an affidavit which the plaintiff avers containsdeliberate untruths in respect of the plaintiffâs conduct of and in relation to those proceedings.  The second and third defendantsalso made affidavits confirming the veracity of what the first defendant had said.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Dr Wong provided a medical report which, in part, dealt with the probable causes of the plaintiffâs medical condition.  The plaintiffavers that that report is inaccurate to such an extent that it must be considered that that the inaccuracies were deliberate.</p>    <p class="heading">This action</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In this action the plaintiff has raised claims which he has categorised as attempted fraud, defamation by the solicitors and perjury. He also argues that the court should grant a declaration that had contingency fees been allowed he would have been able to engagea lawyer and these proceedings themselves would not have been necessary.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The defendants sought to strike out the proceedings on the basis that there was no cause of action.  The judge below acceded tothat application and dismissed the plaintiffâs claim on the basis that no reasonable cause of action could be shown.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Before dealing with the viability of the plaintiffâs claims in law, it has to be said that his first grievance, namely that aninflated bill of costs had been put before the court of appeal is a matter which is rightly a cause for concern.  There are, notinfrequently, applications for security for costs which involve imaginative or creative accounting.  In so far as the court is ableto identify that, the matter is rectified.  When it comes to a statement of work which has been done on the basis of which it issought to justify an order for costs, the court and the other parties are entitled to expect a scrupulous preparation of the account. If a claim for work is inflated to the extent that no reasonable solicitor could justify having spent the time claimed then clearlyno such costs could be allowed.  But the matter goes further, a false claim to having spent time which was not spent is a matter,at the very least, of professional misconduct.  Nevertheless, as far as these proceedings are concerned, professional misconductdoes not give rise to a cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The plaintiff opened his case in this court on the basis that he was not pursuing the claim in respect of defamation.  He has puthis case on the basis that there was an attempted fraud.  The judge dismissed the claim on the basis that no damage had been occasioned. It is clear that there is no such tort as attempted fraud.  In essence fraud is constituted by a deliberate or reckless misstatementwhich is intended to be relied upon and has been relied upon to the detriment of the party to whom the statement was addressed andas a result the party to whom it was addressed has suffered loss.  These are the necessary elements of the tort of fraud or deceit. In this case the statement was neither relied upon by the plaintiff or by the court, nor, as the judge said, did it cause damage. There is no tort of attempting to commit a tort.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Likewise perjury is not a tort.  It is a criminal offence.  Complaint can be made in the criminal courts but perjury does not giverise to a cause of action in itself nor does it give rise to a right to damages to any party who has been injured by that perjury. The plaintiff is, of course, at liberty to apply to the appropriate prosecuting authority to request that a prosecution be brought.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Although the plaintiff sought to argue in respect of the joinder of the further defendant, quite apart from the fact that the causeof action against Dr Wong would appear to fail for the same reasons that perjury is not a tort, as already indicated in respect ofthe other defendants, the papers in this appeal were not served on Dr Wong and, hence, it would not be open to this court to considerthat matter any further.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Finally, the declaration which is sought in respect of contingency fees is not a matter which this court can contemplate.  Sucha declaration is unknown.  It does not relate to any right of the plaintiff.  Furthermore, at present, contingency fees are not allowedin Hong Kong.  It may be that in the future they will be allowed.  Any declaration would, in the circumstances, be futile.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  This court does not disguise the fact that the plaintiff appears to have legitimate grounds for feeling aggrieved, particularlyin respect of the attempt on the part of the defendants to obtain an order for the payment of costs of more than $100,000 in respectof a half hour application which was unavoidably doomed to failure.  The court dealing with that application was highly criticalof the solicitorsâ conduct to such an extent that it could not accept that work that had claimed to have been done could not havebeen done.  Nevertheless, this court has no alternative but to dismiss this appeal.  There will be an order <i>nisi</i> of costs in favour of the defendants.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Le Pichon JA:</b></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="50%">(Anthony Rogers)</td>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="50%">(Doreen Le Pichon)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="50%">Vice-President</td>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="50%">Justice of Appeal</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>The Plaintiff/Appellant in person</p>        <p>Mr Paul Carolan, instructed by Messrs Boase, Cohen &amp; Collins, for the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants/Respondents</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2010/179.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
