Samantha was an employee of the School.  The 4 February 2006 lessonwas Sze Nokâs 12<sup>th</sup> lesson on figure skating with Samantha.  Just before the accident, Samantha was demonstrating a set of manoeuvres  known as the ârightleg forward arabesqueâ to Sze Nok, Sze Nok was expected to follow and copy the movements.  âForward Arabesqueâ, also knownas âthe Spiralâ, is described as a gliding forward movement on one leg, leaning the upper body forward, arching the back andraising the free leg backward extending it high in the air.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  While demonstrating the right leg forward arabesque at the lesson, Samantha suddenly heard Sze Nok cried out behind her.  She turnedand found Sze Nok kneeling on the ice holding her abdomen with both hands.  A male instructor, Vincent Yau Wing Shing (hereinafterreferred to as âVincentâ) went over to Sze Nok and carried her off to the skate changing area outside the ice rink.  Sze Nokwas found to be bleeding on the top left side of her head.  The ambulance was called, it took Sze Nok to Yan Chai Hospital for treatment.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Hospital record showed when Sze Nok arrived at Yan Chai Hospital at 9:43 a.m. she was conscious and alert with no neurological deficiton admission.  A small 2 cm laceration was found over the left parietal region of the skull, X rays showed a 3 cm depressed skullfracture over the same site with contusion.  Photographs of Sze Nokâs head taken after the surgery indicated the injury was onthe left centre top of her head.  Sze Nok was transferred to the Princess Margaret Hospital after medical staff at the Yan Chai Hospitalstopped the bleeding on Sze Nokâs head.  She was admitted into the neurosurgical unit of Princess Margaret Hospital on the sameday.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The medical notes from Princess Margaret Hospital recorded that Sze Nok had sustained an open depressed fracture of the left parietalbone with formation of a collection of blood (extradural haematoma) under the skull.  It was a mild contusion of the underlying brain. Emergency craniotomy was performed to evacuate the blood clot and repair the bone.  The contused area did not require surgical removal. There were fractured bone ends jutting and piercing into the dura (outer membrane covering of the brain) causing a 1 cm long duraltear with the cortex (outer layer of the brain) with one vein exposed.  After the bone fragments were removed and the dura repaired,the wound was sutured.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  After the operation, Sze Nok remained in the intensive care unit for 3 days, she spent 6 more days in the general ward before shewas discharged home.  Although the surgical scars were large and unsightly, she was able to walk unaided on the day of her discharge. After a monthâs rest at home, Sze Nok returned to school.  Even though her average marks dropped below 80% for the first timeimmediately following her injury, she gradually regained her previous performance level, she made a complete recovery and stayedin a band I class.  Her scar over the fracture site is permanent but fortunately it is covered by surrounding hair. There is an increaserisk of post-traumatic epilepsy in future, the accumulated lifetime risk is 3.9%, but at present she has no residual disability. Both parties agreed the quantum of damages to be $160,000.00 inclusive of interest at the start of the trial.  The only matter remainedfor the Court to decide is the issue of liability.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Issues on Liability</u></p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  According to Mr. Li, Counsel for the Defendant, in order for Sze Nok to succeed in this case she has to prove on a balance of probabilitiesthat:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)               the accident happened as she alleged; and</p>        <p>(2)               the Defendant breached its duty of care under the common law and/or the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap 314</a>)(âOLOâ)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Mr. Li argued that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)               Sze Nok has failed to prove how the accident happened;</p>        <p>(2)               even if Sze Nok has established her case, she has failed to prove that the School has breached its duty of carethat caused the accident;</p>        <p>(3)               the School is not liable for the accident on the ground of volenti non fit injuria;</p>        <p>(4)               if the School is held liable, Sze Nok was guilty of contributory negligent.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><u>How did the accident happened?</u></p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Plaintiff alleged the accident was caused by the School and/or its servants for:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)               failing to take any or any reasonable care to see that Sze Nok was reasonably safe as a student of the School;</p>        <p>(2)               instructing Sze Nok to follow behind Samantha in a manoeuvre which Samantha knew or ought to have known would exposeSze Nok to risk of injury by Samanthaâs raised leg-skate descending from a flip up;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)               failing to ensure that there was sufficient distance at all times between herself and Sze Nok to prevent the injury;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)               failing to provide and/or carry out any or any adequate or effective reasonable supervision and care of Sze Nokduring the lesson;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)               allowing the lesson to be conducted in an unsafe manner;</p>        <p>(6)               exposing Sze Nok to a risk of injury of which the Defendant knew or ought to have known;</p>        <p>(7)               failing to advise and ensure Sze Nokâs head would be protected by helmet.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Schoolâs defence is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)               the ice surface of the ice rink at the time of the accident was even and smooth;</p>        <p>(2)               while performing left leg forward arabesque at the time of the accident, Sze Nok caused the toe pick to strike theice surface, thereby causing herself to halt suddenly, lose balance and fall to the front;</p>        <p>(3)               at the time of the accident, the distance between Sze Nok and Samantha was more than 3 metres;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)               Samanthaâs skate blade did not, and could not have hit Sze Nok;</p>        <p>(5)               it was not necessary for Sze Nok to wear a safety helmet in the light of:</p>        <p>(a)              the crucial requirement of balancing in freestyle ice skating;</p>        <p>(b)             its obstruction to the skaterâs vision; and</p>        <p>(c)              the minimal risk of head injury in practicing freestyle ice skating.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><u>The Burden of Proof</u></p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  According to the authors of Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts 19<sup>th</sup> edition, paragraph 8-149:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe onus of proof, on the balance of probabilities, that the defendant has been careless falls upon the claimant. If the claimantâsevidence is equally consistent with the presence or absence of negligence in the defendant, his action will fail.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In paragraph 8-150, the learned authors stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthe question in every case is, what is the reasonable inference for unknown facts? â¦â¦â¦ Courts approach matters of inferenceon the common sense basis and where the evidence relating to negligence is particularly within the control of the defendant, littleaffirmative evidence might be required from the claimant to establish a prima facie case which it will then be for the defendantto rebut.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In Snell v. Farrell (1990) 72 DLR (4<sup>th</sup>) 289, Sopinka J. stressed that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe judge as a trier of fact, is entitled to draw inferences from the evidence and does not have to approach issues from the narrowview point of an expert witness. Hence, he was entitled to take into account the fact that in many medical negligent cases the factswould lie particularly within the knowledge of the defendant and in these circumstances little affirmative evidence on the part ofthe claimant would justify drawing an inference of causation in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Although these commentswere made in the context of proof of causation, it is suggested that there are equally applicable to proof of negligence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><u>Res ipsa loquitur</u></p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The Court may in some circumstances infer carelessness on the part of the defendant where the claimant can show the nature of theaccident suggests both negligence and the defendantâs responsibility.  Drawing the inference in such a circumstance is often describedas an application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe doctrine which stems from the judgment of Erle C.J. in <i>Scott v London and St. Katherine Docks</i>, applies where (1) the occurrence is such that it would not have happened without negligence and (2) the thing that inflicted thedamage was under the sole management and control of the defendant, or of someone for whom he is responsible or whom he has a rightto control. If these two conditions are satisfied it follows, on a balance of probability, that the defendant, or the person forwhom he is responsible, must have been negligent. There is, however, a further negative condition: (3) there must be no evidenceas to why or how the occurrence took place. If there is, then appeal to <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> is inappropriate for the question of the defendantâs negligence must be determined on that evidence.â</p>        <p>(paragraph 8-152 Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts page 497)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In paragraph 8-155 the authors of Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b>Procedural effect of doctrine</b> One view of the effect of the doctrine is that it simply raises an inference of negligence which requires the defendant to providea reasonable explanation of how the accident could have occurred without his negligence. On this view, the defendant does not haveto prove on the balance of probabilities that his explanation is the correct one. If it is equally as plausible as that of the claimant,the claimant will fail as he bears the burden of proof. â¦â¦â¦â¦.. Thus if the defendant provides an equally plausible explanation,this will redress the balance of probability, if it has tilted against him, and the claimant will be back where he started, namely,of having to establish his case by positive evidence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In the Privy Council decision of Ng Chun Pui v Lee Chuen Tat  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20HKLR%20425" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 HKLR 425</a>, the Privy Council held at page 427 H to I:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âResort to the burden of proof is a poor way to decide a case; it is the duty of the judge to examine all the evidence at the endof the case and decide whether on the facts he finds to have been proved and on the inferences he is prepared to draw he is satisfiedthat negligence has been established. In so far as the resort is had to the burden of proof the burden remains at the end of thecase as it was at the beginning upon the plaintiff to prove that his injury was caused by the negligence of the defendants.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  In the present case, there were no eyewitnesses to the accident.  Mr. Li, Counsel for the School, suggested the theoretical possibilityof Sze Nokâs toe pick hitting the ice surface causing her to fall to the front and she accidentally hit her own head.  As to howthe injury which was a dent and a pointed fracture in the left centre of the crown of Sze Nokâs head could have been caused, Samanthaand Mr. Gomes suggested that when Sze Nok lost balance, her legs could have flipped backwards and hit her own head with the pointedtop of the blade of one of her skates.  In Court, Samantha claimed that Sze Nok had the flexibility of 5% of the population, therefore,it would not be surprising for her to be able to hit her own head with her own skates as she fell forward.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The suggestion was countered by the evidence from Sze Nokâs mother who said in Court that she had consulted Sze Lokâs then balletteacher, Sze Lok was not a child with particularly flexible limbs.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Sze Lok was heard crying out in pain by Vincent who was coaching another boy at the ice rink at the time, Sze Nok was seen lyingwith her face down on the ice with her two hands holding her stomach and kneeling with her knees on the ice.  Sze Nok herself onlyremembered experiencing pain in the abdomen and falling to her knees.  No one else saw how the accident happened.  Sze Nokâs domestichelper Miss Canillo who was in the vicinity outside the ice rink did not witness the accident.  She claimed she had examined SzeNokâs ice skates after they were removed from Sze Nok at the changing area, she found no evidence of blood or hair on the bladesof Sze Nokâs skating boots.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Mr. Leung Hok Cheung, the parent of a student at the School, was present outside the ice rink, did not witness the accident.  Hesaid he heard a noise which drew his attention to the ice rink, he saw Sze Nok lying face down on the ice surface, her coach Samanthawas not close to where Sze Nok was.  It is not disputed that a patch of blood was found on the ice surface after the accident andit is believed that the blood belonged to Sze Nok who was bleeding from the head after the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In spite of Mr. Leung Yuen Fatâs (Sze Nokâs father) efforts trying to ascertain the cause of the accident, no-one was able togive him an answer and he could not find anyone who witnessed the accident.  He and his wife Madam Chan tried unsuccessfully to obtaina taped record of the video cameras from the CCTV installed at a few locations around the ice rink.  He and Madam Chan were skepticalof the explanations given by Mr. Gomes, the ice rink manager and head coach, or the Riviera Plaza building management staff.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  At the Courtâs site visit to the ice rink, the Court was shown the security room with a monitor depicting views from CCTV camerasat different areas of the Riviera Plaza including the ice rink and the School.  It was apparent that not all CCTV cameras were installedwith recording tapes; furthermore, the guard at the security office would only be able to see views of some of the 16 CCTV camerasat any given time because the monitor at the security office on the date of the accident showed only views from 9 CCTV cameras insequence, every few minutes views on the monitor at the security office would change to show views from different CCTV cameras installedat the Plaza.  Therefore, it is quite possible at the time of the accident, even if someone was sitting in front of the monitor atthe security guard room, he would not have witnessed what happened even though one of the 16 CCTV cameras was monitoring the icerink.  As no tape had ever been installed in the particular CCTV camera pointing at the ice rink, there was no recording of the accident. Consequently, one has to rely on the surrounding circumstantial evidence to determine what happened at the time of the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The School did not dispute that as a general principle an ice skating school and occupier of the ice rink, the School owes a dutyto take reasonable care to see that a student like Sze Nok would be reasonably safe while taking an ice skating lesson at the School. It is Vincent and Samanthaâs evidence that the ice surface of the ice rink at the material time was smooth and even.  Accordingto Mr. Gomes, the ice surface would be smoothened several times a day with the smoothing machine at the ice rink.  There was no evidencethere were any bumps on the surface of the ice on the morning of the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The School also accepted that a student like Sze Nok would be exposed to risks of injury should she come in contact with Samanthaâsraised leg if she was skating too closely behind Samantha while performing the forward arabesque manoeuvres.  However, the Schoolâsposition was Samantha was 3 metres ahead of Sze Nok when she performed the forward arabesque manoeuvres.  It is not in dispute thatSamantha is an experienced ice skater and a professional coach with many years of teaching experience.  She claimed she would fromtime to time watch the manoeuvres of her students from the reflective screen installed at the inside rim of the ice rink.  She admittedshe would not turn around to watch her students, as she could see them from the reflective screen on the inside rim of the ice rink.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  It was Samanthaâs evidence that Sze Nok had learnt the forward arabesque manoeuvres sometime before the accident for the forwardarabesque was required in the level 2 figure skating examination.  Samantha claimed Sze Nok was not strong on her strokes and shehad told Sze Nok to improve on her strength of movements at the 12<sup>th</sup> lesson.  Furthermore, at previous skating lessons Sze Nok had practiced the forward arabesque with Samantha.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  It is the Plaintiffâs case that the cause of accident was the close proximity between Samantha and Sze Nok.  Though Samantha insistedshe had maintained a distance of 3 metres between herself and Sze Nok that morning while performing the forward arabesque manoeuvres,Sze Nok claimed she was only 1 metre away from Samantha before the accident.  If Sze Nok is correct, there are doubts as to whetherSamantha did maintain a safe distance between herself and Sze Nok when she was demonstrating the manoeuvres to her student.  Samanthadescribed in Court she was gliding at medium slow speed in front of Sze Nok and was at least 2 to 3 metres from her.  She heard aâpopâ sound and heard Sze Nok yelling âååâ.  At this juncture, Samantha had not yet completed the forward arabesque manoeuvres,her right leg was still raised behind her.  On hearing the âpopâ sound, Vincent turned and saw Sze Nok had fallen on the ice,he called out to Samantha who was gliding behind him on his right.  Samantha denied in cross-examination that she was only one metreaway from her student Sze Nokduring the demonstration, she claimed further that if her raised leg had come into contact with SzeNok she would have felt it.  And if her skated foot had come into contact with anyone she would have fallen down for the contactwould have disturbed her balance.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In paragraph 14 of Samanthaâs witness statement she said the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI guess that the Plaintiff fell forward and down at that time, possibly because the Plaintiff was a young girl, relatively moreflexible, her leg bended backward and thus the top of her head was hit and injured by her own skate.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Her evidence in cross-examination is somewhat different when describing Sze Nokâs flexibility.  In Court, she claimed Sze Nokwas unique for she was in the top 5% (of the population) in terms of flexibility of limbs.  She also said in re-examination thatSze Nok would before each lesson do a warm up by herself; on one or two occasions, Samantha had done it with her and helped her topush her leg up to reach her head.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The medical expertsâ report</u></p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Dr. Brian Choa and Dr. Edmund K.W. Woo jointly examined Sze Nok on 11 June 2008, 2 years after the accident when she was 11 yearsold.  Their findings were similar with no major disagreements.  Sze Nok told them that during the incident she had felt a suddenpain in her abdomen, she stooped but did not fall.  She could not recall any impact on her head but noticed blood dripping from herscalp.  Dr. Choa commented that Sze Nok must have sustained head injury even though she was unaware of it at the time.  The shapeof the injured area was described as âa hole in her skull without a linear crackâ, it was more likely caused by a small sharpor sharpish object rather than a fall on a flat surface.  Both doctors concluded that Sze Nok had made an excellent neurologicalrecovery with no residual symptom or disability.  Dr. Choa concluded Sze Nok could resume normal sporting activities.  The two doctorscarried out an experiment with Sze Nok at the clinic with Sze Nok adopting the forward arabesque posture.  Her head was 42 inchesfrom the floor.  They also attempted to hyperextend Sze Nokâs legs while flexing the knees to bring one of her feet up to her head,Dr. Choa found they were many inches short of achieving such a result.  It was Dr. Choaâs opinion from the experiment conductedat the clinic that Sze Nok could not have inflicted the injury with her own skates.  Dr. Woo did not comment on the matter.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Analysis</u></p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  From the medical expertsâ findings of Sze Nokâs injury, the hole in Sze Nokâs skull without a linear crack was more likelycaused by a small sharp object rather than from a fall onto a flat surface.  Unless there was a sharp object on the surface of theice which struck Sze Nok when she fell down, or she was hit by a sharp object before she fell down, the skull fracture could notbe in the shape it was found.  The fact that the fracture was on top of her crown also indicated it is unlikely the fracture wascaused by a sharp object on the ice surface.  On the cause of the small dented fracture to the head, the Plaintiff suggested SzeNok was hit by the raised skated right foot of Samantha when she was performing the forward arabesque with her right leg raised behindher to her hip level when gliding forward on the ice.  In the Schoolâs defence, Mr. Gomes, Samantha and Vincent suggested thatSze Nok had accidentally lost her balance when the toe pick at the front of her skates got stuck in the ice surface causing her tofall forward, that her legs fell backwards and the toe pick of the blade of one of her skates hit the top of her head causing thefracture on her head.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Sze Nokâs mother, Madam Chan, claimed Sze Nok did not possess limbs so flexible that she could flip back her legs to her headand hit herself with her own blades.  At the doctorâs clinic two years after the accident, it was confirmed that she could notraise her foot up to the level of her head.  Samantha claimed in court that Sze Nok usually had a warm-up before the skating lessonand on a few occasions she had helped Sze Nok to push her leg up to her head.  Samantha used the words âI helped her to pushâ. This indicated Sze Nok could not raise her leg to reach her head without assistance.  Samantha admitted she did not consider SzeNok a strong skater, Sze Nok was told to strengthen her strokes and practice the forward arabesque manoeuvres more often even thoughSze Nok had learned them before.  Is it then possible for Sze Nok to flip her legs back when she fell forward on the ice for oneof her skated feet to hit the top of her head and fracture her own skull?  I find it unlikely that she should be able to do thatafter she lost balance on the ice particularly when she did not fall completely flat on the ice surface.  Vincent found her kneelingon the ice surface holding her stomach, Sze Nok said she stooped after she experienced stomach pain.  It is unlikely for her to havekicked herself on the head when she fell on both knees and knelt on the ice.  It is logical when one of the skaterâs toe picksgot caught in the ice, she would fall forward and flat on the ice rather than for one of her skated feet which got stuck in the iceto kick backward and hit her own head.  For this reason, I find the Defendantâs proposition implausible.  I reject it completely.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  This leaves the alternative proposition from the Plaintiff.  That Sze Nok was skating so quickly and strongly behind Samantha thatthe distance between herself and Samantha had narrowed to 1 meter and she caught up and collided with Samanthaâs raised right skateas Samantha was completing the manoeuvres.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  According to Samantha, she instructed Sze Nok to follow her and perform the right leg forward arabesque manoeuvres and to put morestrength in her strokes and to bend her back more.  According to Sze Nok, when Samantha began to demonstrate the manoeuvres to SzeNok, the distance between herself and Samantha just before the accident was about 1 metre.  Samantha admitted she did not look backwhile demonstrating the manoeuvres to Sze Nok, though she claimed she could observe Sze Nokâs movements from the reflective perplexlining of the ice skating rink, it is not known if she made sure that Sze Nok was keeping a distance of 3 metres or more behind herat all times while she was demonstrating the manoeuvres.  She admitted she did not turn back to look at her student.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  At the Courtâs site visit, the head coach at the School, Miss Linda Dean demonstrated the forward arabesque.  She performed asequence of stroking to gather momentum before starting to gliding with the left foot on the ice, leaning the upper body forward,bending the face forward while arching the back, extending the right leg backward, raising it to the level of the hip and glidingon the ice for some distance before completion.  After observing the performance of the manoeuvres, I find it quite possible if SzeNok was 1 metre or less from Samantha, as Samantha raised her right leg behind her, Sze Nok who was still stroking and gatheringmomentum, moved so fast behind Samantha that the distance between them had shortened and Samanthaâs rising right leg collided withthe top of her skull.  When Sze Nok was copying the manoeuvres, she had probably extended her upper body and her head forward, thusfurther narrowing the distance between Samantha and herself.  Samantha did not feel the impact probably because the movement whenshe was gliding forward with her free leg rising was so strong that she was able to move away from Sze Nok after the impact.  Thatwas why when Vincent noticed Sze Nok had fallen on the ice surface holding her abdomen, Samantha was obliviously completing the forwardarabesque manoeuvres and had moved behind Vincent on the ice rink.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The Schoolâs Responsibility</u></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The question for consideration is whether the School had taken adequate care and supervision of Sze Nok.  Sze Nok was only 9 yearsold at the time of the accident, she belongs the class of vulnerable potential victims undertaking a sport that is inherently hazardous.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Paragraph 8-134 of Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts page 484 stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p><b>Known vulnerability of potential victims</b>        The likelihood of harm will also depend on any vulnerability of potential victims of which the defendant knew, or should haveknown.  For example, children are known to be less aware of threats to their safety.  Hence, if the defendant is felling a tree whilechildren are watching him, it is not enough for him to warn them to go away before the tree falls; he should take more active stepsto see that they are out of the way, for children are attracted by such operations and are too young to appreciate danger.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  At paragraph 8-135 the authors said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â<b>Degree of likelihood of harm          </b> What is relevant is the degree of likelihood that harm may occur.  In Lord Dunedinâs words: âPeople must guard against reasonableprobabilities, but they are not bound to guard against fantastic possibilities.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>                   At paragraph 8-136 the author continues:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â<b>Severity of the harm</b>   The degree of care also depends on the magnitude of the consequences that are likely to ensue.  As Lord Macmillan said: âThosewho engage in operations inherently dangerous must take precautions which are not required of persons engaged in the ordinary routineof daily life.â  The more serious the consequences, the greater the degree of care which has to be shown.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The School has a responsibility to see that students learning the techniques and skills taught by the School should do so in a safeenvironment with procedures and methods of teaching that would ensure their safety.  It should provide adequate care to studentsof tender age taking part in a sport which is inherently dangerous.  Particularly when the teaching was conducted on a one on onebasis, the teacher would be expected to devote his/her full attention on the student he/she was teaching at the time.  This is paramountfor any institution specializes in sports where young children are involved.  An occasional glance at the reflective lining of therim of the ice rink by the coach cannot be regarded as adequate attention.  Perhaps that was why Samantha did not notice Sze Nokâsproximity at a distance of 1 metre behind her.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Use of helmet</u></p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Mr. Wright, Counsel for the Plaintiff, submitted that helmets should be used in the School for a sport like ice-skating.  I agreewith him.  Figure skating though enjoyable and graceful to watch requires a great deal of strength, agility, technique and skillfrom the skater.  Even though Mr. Gomes insisted that in figure skating, only beginners would wear safety helmets because the helmetwould affect the balance of the skater in performing freestyle ice-skating.  He claimed it is unlike ice hockey and speed skatingwhere skaters are required to wear safety helmets at all times due to the risk of collision with other skaters or the ice or wallsurface.  The fact that beginners in figure skating are required to wear safety helmets is evidence of the danger involved.  Iceskating is a sport of speed, thus, protective equipment worn by ice skaters whether they be figure skaters, ice hockey players orspeed skatersshould be similar.  For students practising ice skating, there are potential dangers of collision and falls on the icesurface.  In my view, the wearing of safety helmets in an ice skating school should be mandatory for young students.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Even though Sze Nok had her first skating lesson in June 2002 and had achieved level 2 in free-style skating, she was still a childof 9 years when the accident occurred.  Those in charge at the School including the coach and the School should make sure that noharm would come to the students and precautions should be taken for students taking lessons at the School.  There are nowadays manydifferent types of helmets used in different sports such as, snow skiing helmets, bicycle helmets, ice hockey helmets and speed skatinghelmets, etc.  They are made with different types of materials.  Helmets such as bicycle helmets are light weight and would not affecteither the skaterâs vision or balance in practice sessions.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Paragraph 8-174 of Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts at page 514, stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><b>âSchool responsibility</b> A teacher is expected to show such care towards a child under his charge as would be exercised by a reasonably careful parent, takinginto account the conditions of school life as distinct from home life, the number of children in the class and the nature of thosechildren.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts at page 516 paragraph 8-176 stated further:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFailure to adequately supervise contact sports such as rugby may also give rise to liability. The same is true of potentially dangerousactivities such as swimming.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  If a non contact sport such as swimming is regarded as a potentially dangerous sport activity, so should ice skating be.  The Schoolâsresponsibility when the teacher and student are on a one on one basis is high.  In a fast sport like ice skating, it can be dangerousin a limited space such as the ice rink in question.  That is why careful and close supervision should have been given to the studentunder the care of the teacher and the School at all times.  Both the teacher and the School are in loco parentis for a 9 year oldstudent such as Sze Nok.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Contributory Negligence</u></p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur may be drawn from circumstances in which the court may infer carelessness onthe part of the Defendant where the claimant can show that the nature of the accident suggests both negligence and the Defendantâsresponsibilities.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Paragraph 3-54 of Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts, page 183 stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b>Contributory negligence of children</b> Conduct on the part of a child which contributes to an accident will not necessarily be judged in the same light as similar conductby an adult. What is negligence in an adult is not necessarily negligence in a child. The exercise of âordinary care must meanthat degree of care which may reasonably be expected of a person in the [claimantâs] situationâ, which in the case of a veryyoung child could be nil.â¦â¦â¦â¦.</p>        <p>In considering whether a child has taken reasonable care for his own safety regard must be had to the age of the child, the circumstancesof the case and the knowledge by the particular child of the dangers to which the defendantâs negligence has exposed him.  In <i>Gough v Throne</i>, Lord Denning M.R. said that a very young child cannot be guilty of contributory negligence; an older child may be, but it dependson the circumstances.  A judge should only find a child guilty of contributory negligence if he or she is of such an age as reasonablyto be expected to take precautions for his or her own safety.  This is not an entirely subjective test, because the question is whetheran âordinary childâ of the claimantâs age could be expected to have done any more than the claimant, and an ordinary childis neither âparagon of prudenceâ nor âscatter-brainedâ.  Theoretically, there is no age below which, as a matter of law,it can be said that a child cannot be guilty of contributory negligence, but in practice it is unreasonable to exact a high standard.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  In this case, the School had suggested a possible cause of the accident, I do not find the proposition a plausible one for reasonsreferred to in paragraph 32 above.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In measuring the weight on the scale, I find from the surrounding circumstances before and after the accident and from the evidenceof Sze Nok, whom I find to be an honest witness who is timid and complaint, the most plausible explanation is that the distance betweenSamantha and Sze Nok had narrowed to 1 metre or below, when Samantha raised her right leg to hip level behind her, she failed toascertain Sze Nokâs close proximity to herself, her raised leg accidentally collided with the head of Sze Nok thus causing theinjury.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Volenti non fit injuria</u></p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  The latin maxim means âno wrong is done to one who consentsâ.  Mr. Li submitted that Sze Nok or her parents had agreed to theice skating lessons and therefore the School is absolved from legal responsibility by conduct.  That Sze Nok or her parent shouldhave full knowledge of the nature and extent of the risks Sze Nok had assumed.  As to this defence of consent, there is no betteranswer than the example given by the authors of Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts Chapter 3 paragraph 3-73 at page 195:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦â¦.For example, a claimant can consent to an invasion of his personal integrity through, save, participation in a contactsport, but he does not thereby agree to accept the risk of negligently inflicted damage during the course of the game. A patientcan consent to surgery, but she does not thereby assume the risk of the operation being performed negligently. The requirements fora successful plea of volenti non fit injuria are significantly more stringent than, for example, a simple consent to physical contact(whether socially, or in a sporting or medical context).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Lord Denning in the case of Nettleship v. Weston [1971] 2QB 691 at 701 said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âNow that contributory negligence is not a complete defence, but only a ground for reducing the damages, the defence of volentinon fit injuria has been closely considered and in consequence, it has been severely limited. Knowledge of the risk of injury isnot enough. Nor is the willingness to take the risk of injury. Nothing will suffice short of an agreement to waive any claim fornegligence. The [claimant] must agree, expressly or impliedly to waive any claim or any injury that may befall him due to the lackof reasonable care by the defendant.â</p>        <p>In paragraph 3-80 at page 199 of Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts the authors continued:</p>        <p>âOn this approach there must be an agreement of some kind, express or implied, before the relevant act of negligence by the defendantoccurs.  The claimantâs decision to run a known risk which had already been created by the defendantâs negligence could not constitutevolenti.  Similarly, in Wooldridge v Sumner, Diplock L.J. said that: âThe consent that is relevant is not consent to risk of injurybut consent to the lack of reasonable care that may produce that risk.â  The claimant could not have agreed to run the risk thatthe defendant might be negligent because the claimant would only play his part after the defendant had been negligent.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  I do not find Sze Nok had in any way contributed to the accident.  As a child, her conduct cannot be viewed in the same way as anadult.  It is the duty of her coach to look after her safety and to make sure that the student under her charge should learn in asafe manner.  Constant attention should have been paid to the student, that was why Sze Nokâs parents sent her to a private lessonrather than a group lesson.  The School owes a responsibility to all students of the School.  The School is liable not only as theemployer of the teacher and as an occupier, but also for failing to provide sufficient protection to its students during ice skatinglessons.  There should be safety equipment such as helmets, knee pads and guards to protect students from injury during lessons. Students should be warned and given lessons on safety on the ice rink.  There should be safety manuals distributed to all studentsand posted up in the School area.  Further, coaches should ensure that students, with the exception of those performing or takingexaminations in figure skating, have taken all precautions including the wearing of protective gear while skating on the ice rink.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Conclusion</u></p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Based on the aforesaid reasons, I find the School negligent both under common law and occupierâs liability for the injury sustainedby Sze Nok.  As the parties have agreed the quantum of damages at $160,000, the School is liable to pay to Sze Nok the sum of $160,000as compensation for her injuries.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Interests</u></p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Interests to be payable from the date of trial to the date of judgment at half judgment rate, thereafter at judgment rate untilfull payment.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Costs</u></p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Costs should follow the event.
