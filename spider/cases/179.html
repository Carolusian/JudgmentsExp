On 14 October 2003, oneday before the hearing, the Plaintiff took out a Summons to amend her Statement of Claim as <em>per</em> the draft annexed to that Summons.

Johnson Stokes &amp; Master, started off the demand with a letter issued to the Plaintiff'ssolicitors on 13 January 2003. In that letter, it was asserted that the Documents Sought relate to:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="6%">(1)</td>                <td valign="top" width="84%">the Plaintiff's claim for damages;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="6%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="84%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="6%">(2)</td>                <td valign="top" width="84%">the loss and damage the 1st and/or 2nd Defendants have suffered and will suffer; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="6%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="84%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="6%">(3)</td>                <td valign="top" width="84%">whether the Plaintiff has complied with the Undertaking to the Court recited in the Order made by the Honourable Madam Justice Yuenon 30 May 2000 ("the May 2000 Order").</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> In paragraph 8 of her Skeleton Submission filed on 13 October 2003, Ms. Wong expressly abandoned reliance on Ground (3) in paragraph6 above.</p>    <p class="heading">Relevancy: The Plaintiff's Claim for Damages</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Mr. Mok submitted that Ground (1) (that the Documents Sought are relevant to the Plaintiff's claim for damages) was no longer a groundbecause in the Amended Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff had dropped (a) the plea that by virtue of the Defendants' wrongdoings,the Plaintiff has suffered loss and damage including damage to her reputation, goodwill and image (the original paragraph 32 of theStatement of Claim) and (b) all claims for damages, i.e. "damages for deceit or negligent misrepresentation in addition to or inlieu of rescission and/or damages for mistake and/or breach of contract and/or breach of fiduciary duties" (the original paragraph2 in the prayer of the Statement of Claim).</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> That might be so, said Ms. Wong, but the Plaintiff's claims in tort are not actionable without proof of damage. According to Ms.Wong, the Plaintiff's case alleges that both Defendants have been guilty of a variety of misdeeds with the result, and in some caseswith the intention, of injuring and harassing the Plaintiff. She relied on the general principle explained in paragraphs 1-46 and2-06, <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em>, 18th ed. and argued that actual damage which is not too remote and is caused by the Defendant, is a necessary element which mustbe proved by the Plaintiff in order to ground a case in tort.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Ms. Wong also relied on the Plaintiff's allegation that the Plaintiff entered into the subject management agreement as a result ofvarious misrepresentations made fraudulently and/or negligently by a Miss Louisa Loo on behalf of the 1st and/or 2nd Defendants toinduce the Plaintiff into signing the subject management agreement. She relied on the principle stated in paragraph 15-39 of <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em> that, "Proof of damage in consequence of acting on the representation is required" and also <strong>Diamond v. Bank of London and Montreal Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20QB%20333" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 Q.B. 333</a> <em>per</em> Lord Denning M.R. at 344-349 (where there was no sufficient evidence of loss suffered by reason of the tort of fraudulent as wellas negligent misrepresentations). She submitted that to establish the misrepresentation as alleged, the Plaintiff has to prove damagesuffered as a result of acting on the alleged misrepresentations.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> If proof of damage was required in establishing misrepresentation, as Ms. Wong submitted, the Documents Sought were clearly relevant(to the question of damage), and hence subject to discovery, notwithstanding that the Plaintiff has dropped all claims for damages.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Mr. Mok submitted that the Plaintiff does not found her claims on tort. Rather, the Plaintiff's cause of action is based on contract.As I have asked Ms. Wong at the hearing, and as what Mr. Mok later on submitted, misrepresentation, if proved, is a vitiating factorwhich entitles the Plaintiff to rescind the subject management agreement. In proving misrepresentation as a vitiating factor undercontract law, there is no need to prove damage.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> When one looks at the Amended Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff's claims are indeed founded on contract and not on tort. In a nutshell,paragraphs 5 to 18 raise the plea that the subject management agreement was void or voidable for fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentationsand/or mistake. Paragraphs 19 to 22 plead the Defendants' fundamental/repudiatory breaches of the agreement and gross incompetencein performing the agreement. Paragraphs 23 to 24 deals with rescission and/or termination of the agreement. Paragraph 25 allegessome post-termination misconduct of the Defendants but no relief is sought in the prayer basing on the facts pleaded in this paragraph(with the exception of paragraphs 25(v) and (vi), where the Plaintiff in effect alleges that the Defendants still conducted themselvesas if the subject management contract was still continuing and binding on the Plaintiff). Paragraphs 26 to 27 pleads the Defendants'failure to account for sums received in respect of the Plaintiff's works as an artiste, in further breach of the subject managementagreement. Paragraph 28 pleads the Defendants' wrongful holding-out as the Plaintiff's agent and/or manager notwithstanding that,according to the Plaintiff's case, the agreement had been rescinded and/or terminated. Paragraphs 29 to 30 plead the Defendants'breach of fiduciary duties as a manager/agent under the agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Therefore, in my view, on the Plaintiff's present pleaded case, in establishing misrepresentation and/or fundamental breach of contract,it is not necessary for the Plaintiff to prove damage. Hence, the Documents Sought are irrelevant in this respect.</p>    <p class="heading">Relevancy: The Remedy of Rescission</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> However, the arguments do not rest here. Ms. Wong, at the second day of the hearing, drew me to the attention <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284" class="autolink_findacts">Misrepresentation Ordinance</a>, where it reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Where a person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him otherwise than fraudulently, and he wouldbe entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract, then, if it is claimed, in any proceedings arising outof the contract, that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded the court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsistingand award damages in lieu of rescission, if of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentationand the loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the otherparty."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Although the Plaintiff amended her Statement of Claim at the eleventh hour before the hearing, the remedy sought at paragraph 1(1)of the prayer remains unimpaired. Paragraph 1(1) seeks a declaration that the subject management agreement "is void or voidable and/orhas been validly rescinded by the Plaintiff on the ground of fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation". This is squarely within<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284" class="autolink_findacts">Misrepresentation Ordinance</a>. That being so, at the trial, if the Court is satisfied that the Defendants have been guilty of negligent misrepresentation (i.e.a misrepresentation has been made to the Plaintiff otherwise than fraudulently under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(2))</a>, in considering whether the contract ought to be rescinded or has been rescinded, the Court should then proceed to consider whetherit would be equitable to award damages instead. This is a discretion of the Court, not a right given to the Plaintiff to claim damages.See paragraph 6-095, <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>, Volume 1, 28th ed. Two of the factors that the Court is bound to consider under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(2)</a> are "the loss that would be caused by [the misrepresentation] if the contract were upheld" and "the loss that rescission would causeto the other party [i.e. the 1st and/or 2nd Defendants]". Since there can be no dispute that the Documents Sought relate to bothlosses, they are subject to discovery.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> In rebuttal, Mr. Mok argued three points. Firstly, he said this argument was raised too late, only at Ms. Wong's replying submission.Secondly, on a true interpretation of the May 2000 Order and the undertakings given by the parties thereunder, the Defendants haveno longer any right or could in any way ask the Court to uphold the subject management agreement. To illustrate, Mr. Mok submittedthat as the Plaintiff has been given liberty under the May 2000 Order to undertake any jobs without the consent of the Defendants,it is impossible to resurrect their management agreement. Thirdly, Mr. Mok orally applied to the Court to further amend the AmendedStatement of Claim by deleting, in Mr. Mok's words, "all reference to negligent misrepresentation" in the Amended Statement of Claim.He relied on paragraph 6-105, <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>, Volume 1:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The right to rescind for fraudulent misrepresentation is unimpaired by the Misrepresentation Act [the England equivalent of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284" class="autolink_findacts">Misrepresentation Ordinance</a>], but there is no longer any absolute right to rescind for negligent or innocent misrepresentation."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr. Mok submitted that if the Plaintiff was allowed to drop the claim for negligent misrepresentation, since the Court has no discretionto order damages in lieu of rescission of the subject management agreement for fraudulent misrepresentation, parties' losses wouldnot then be factors that the Court should consider. As such, the necessity for discovery of the Documents Sought is obviated.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Notwithstanding Mr. Mok's skillful submissions, I am afraid that I cannot accept these points. On his first point of rebuttal, Isee no prejudice on the Plaintiff's part. Ms. Wong's argument on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(2)</a> is a pure law point and involves no factual dispute. There is no evidence that the Plaintiff needs to produce in replying. On Mr.Mok's second point of rebuttal, Ms. Wong disputed the effect of the May 2000 Order. She submitted that it could not be right forthe Defendants to be denied of a substantive right by an interlocutory order (i.e. the May 2000 Order), the whole purpose of whichwas to maintain <em>status quo</em>. While the effect of the May 2000 Order may or may not be open for arguments, I have to remind myself that at this interlocutorystage certainly I should not fetter the trial judge's power and discretion whether under section 3(2) or otherwise, by making a findingwhich affects parties' substantive rights and liabilities. Thirdly, I cannot find any reason that enables me to accede to Mr. Mok'sbelated application for further amendment of the Amended Statement of Claim with nothing in writing. Nor can I find any justificationfor departing from the general practice of this Court in dealing with amendments of pleadings as set out in paragraph 20/8/4 of <em>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2002</em>, such as:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="6%">(1)</td>                <td valign="top" width="84%" class="quote">"If the application is before the trial, it should be made by summons before the master, or it may be made on the summons for directions,or by notice for further directions under O.25, r.7 (2)".</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="6%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="84%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="6%">(2)</td>                <td valign="top" width="84%" class="quote">"It is desirable to specify the intended amendments (see <em>Lawrence v.

This submission must also be rejected.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> I therefore hold that the Documents Sought are relating to this issue in question, namely, whether the contract ought to be rescindedor has been rescinded.</p>    <p class="heading">Relevancy: Gross Incompetence and Fundamental Breaches of Duties</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Ms. Wong submitted that the Plaintiff has pleaded extensively (some 9 pages) that the 1st and/or the 2nd Defendants had demonstratedgross incompetence and had committed fundamental breaches of their duties, and that as a result of the gross incompetence and thefailure to carry out their duties, the Plaintiff often found herself bogged down with extra responsibilities and works and eventuallyher health suffered. In Ms. Wong's submission, in order to determine these issues raised by the Plaintiff, it is necessary for theCourt to see the nature and extent of the Plaintiff's engagements after the break-up, how busy she had become or otherwise, how well-organizedher schedule had become or otherwise, how hard she had had to work or otherwise and whether she made progress in terms of statusand earnings as an artist or otherwise.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> I cannot agree with Ms. Wong's submission. What the Plaintiff seeks to prove here is breach of contract. In order to decide whethera party has breached a contract, one needs to consider the party's conduct at the relevant time to see whether that conduct amountsto a breach. It is not helpful for the Court to look at conducts of the other party <em>after</em> the alleged breach. Such subsequent conducts cannot in one way or the other prove or disprove whether a breach has been committedpreviously. Moreover, as Mr. Mok pointed out, many items of breach or gross incompetence pleaded refer to specific incidents. Thereis no use, and indeed irrelevant to look at what happened thereafter in deciding whether a breach had occurred.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Therefore, in my view, the Documents Sought do not relate to the question of gross incompetence and fundamental breaches.</p>    <p class="heading">Relevancy: the 2nd Defendant's Damages</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Although in the Defendants' correspondence and written submission, "the loss and damage the 1st and/or 2nd Defendants have sufferedand will suffer" was asserted as one of the grounds of the application, only the 2nd Defendant was averred in the Defendants' Defenceand Counterclaim to have suffered loss and damage. Therefore, in paragraph (4) of the prayer, the 2nd Defendant counterclaims:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"An enquiry or an assessment as to what damages the 2nd Defendant has suffered by reason of the wrongful acts of the Plaintiff."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Mr. Mok treated this prayer as an indication by the 2nd Defendant that the 2nd Defendant wants an assessment of damages to take place<em>after</em> the trial. I asked Mr. Mok if that was so, what was the effect of "damages to be assessed" if pleaded in the prayer. His answer wasthat the effect would be the same as asking for "assessment of damages". I then referred him to the Statement of Claim before itwas amended, where "damages for deceit ..." and "damages for mistake ..." were prayed for and asked him the effect. His submissionwas that the damages would be assessed at the trial together with the determination of liability. Therefore, the words "assessment"or "to be assessed", in Mr. Mok's submission, makes the difference. In effect, if such words are used in the prayer, according toMr. Mok, there would be an automatic split trial of liability and quantum and hence no need for any party to apply for a split trialorder.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> I cannot accept this submission as a matter of principle (and in passing I would also comment that this interpretation of the prayeris highly artificial). The general rule is that all the issues in the case are to be tried at the same time. The Court has discretionon the summons for directions, in determining the mode of the trial, to order the trial of quantum of damages to take place afterthe trial of liability. See paragraph 33/4/9, <em>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2002</em>. There is no split trial ordered in the present case. The position on discovery was explained by Mr. Justice Godfrey (as he thenwas) in <strong>Auto-Treasure Ltd t/a Albert Jewelry Creation v Noble Diamond Ltd t/a Noble Jewellery &amp; Anor</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20HKC%20117" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 HKC 117</a> at 120-121:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In an ordinary common law action for damages the practice will be different. The general policy is no doubt that all disputes inthe same proceedings should be tried together. Where, as in the ordinary case, all questions of liability and quantum are to be dealtwith at one trial, no distinction falls to be drawn, as a general rule, between discovery of those documents which relate to thequestion of liability, and those which relate to the question of quantum. But where there is an order for a 'split trial' (more accurately,where the issue of liability in the action is ordered to be tried before the issue of damages), the order for a 'split trial' providesfor discovery to be limited to the issue of liability in the action: see for example, <em>Atkin's Court Forms</em> (2nd Ed), Vol 23 (1998 Issue), at pp 155-156 and <em>Chitty and Jacob's Queen's Bench Forms</em> (21st Ed), at pp 420-421. In the absence of such an order, in an ordinary common law action, it may indeed be difficult to justifyan order for discovery which proceeds on the footing that documents relating to quantum do not fall to be discovered at the samestage as documents relating to liability."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The mode of the trial is to be determined by the Court under Order 33, rule 4 of the Rules of the High Court. Whether to order splittrial is within the Court's discretion after taking into account all relevant circumstances and hearing parties' submission. Mr.Mok submitted that with those words "assessment of damages" or "damages to be assessed" in the prayer, there is no need for his clientto apply for a split trial order. I cannot see there could be any basis for parties to the proceedings to be able to fetter the Court'spower and discretion by just adding a few words in the prayer.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> It follows that in my view, the Documents Sought are relating to the quantum of the 2nd Defendant's damages.</p>    <p class="heading">Result</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Ms. Wong must be correct that if any one of the grounds that she advanced is successful, her clients would be entitled to discoveryof the Documents Sought. As I have held that the Documents Sought are relating to the issues of rescission and the 2nd Defendant'sdamages, the Court has the jurisdiction to make such order. I see no reason (and there were neither evidence produced nor argumentsadvanced to the contrary) why having the jurisdiction to do so I should not exercise my discretion to allow the discovery of therelevant documents. Since it is plain that the Plaintiff has not produced documents relating to the issues of rescission and the2nd Defendant's damages, I am also prepared to order the Plaintiff to serve a further and better list of the same.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> The order that I make is as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(1)</td>                <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="85%">The Plaintiff do within 14 days from the date hereof file and serve a Further and Better List of the documents which are or have beenin her possession, custody or power relating to the issues of (a) whether the agreement in dispute ought to be rescinded or has beenrescinded and (b) the 2nd Defendant's damages.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="80%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(2)</td>                <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="85%">The Plaintiff do within 14 days from the date hereof file and serve on the Defendants an affidavit stating whether she has or hasat any time had in her possession, custody or power the following documents and if these documents or any of them has or have beenbut is or are not now in her possession, custody or power, stating when she parted with the same and what has become of the same:-</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="80%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(a)</td>                <td valign="top" width="80%">All contracts or agreements or other documents evidencing the Plaintiff's commitments for her service as an artist or performer sinceFebruary 2000.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="80%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(b)</td>                <td valign="top" width="80%">All documents evidencing the Plaintiff's receipt of fees paid to her as consideration for her service as an artist or performer pursuantto such contracts or agreements or commitments.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> As to costs, the costs of this application should follow the event. In the Summons, the Defendants also ask for the costs occasionedby this application, e.g. the costs of the affidavit and the further and better list. I see these steps as part of the costs in preparationfor the trial, i.e. discovery of documents relevant to the determination of parties' rights and liabilities. I do not think the costsof taking these steps should be covered by the present order. As such, I make an order <em>nisi</em> that the costs of this application be to the Defendants in any event with certificate for counsel.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> I wish to express my gratitude towards Counsel for their able assistance.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(Kenneth Wong)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Temporary Deputy Registrar</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr. Johnny Mok instructed by Messrs.
