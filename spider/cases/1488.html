In the circumstances perhaps this is unsurprising; the evidence is that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is a sole proprietorship owned by Mr Yeung Kwok Cheung, who is also an employee of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant or, at the least (on the evidence the precise situation is less than clear) of a sister company of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The factual background</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The background details of the sale and purchase of the stolen consignment of telephones do not greatly matter, save to note thatSamsung Electronics agreed to sell these telephones to Ezcom at a unit price of US$270.00, and further that, under Cargo InsurancePolicy No. 90394040000080 dated 30 April 2004, Samsung Fire &amp; Marine provided insurance cover for the shipment of telephonesin a sum amounting to 110% of the total invoice value.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The telephones were shipped by air from Korea to Hong Kong on 30 April 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The contractual arrangement was that the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff, Ezcom, had agreed with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, J&amp;C Cargo, to collect the telephones from the airport and to deliver them to the buyerâs warehouse; in turn, the1<sup>st </sup>defendant had subcontracted the actual collection and delivery of the shipment to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant firm.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  What happened was this.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  On Friday 30 April 2004 J&amp;C Cargo received by email a âpre-alertâ confirming that the telephones would be arriving fromKorea on the evening of that day; in turn, one Mr WT Lam, a driver employed by Yeungâs Logistics, physically attended at the officesof the J&amp;C Cargo to receive instructions regarding the collection and physical delivery in Hong Kong of the telephones on Monday3 May 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The evidence is that Mr Lam then drove the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs truck to a garage in order to permit certain repairs to take place, and a photocopy of the âcollection recordâwas left in the truck during the repair period over the weekend.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  On 3 May 2004 Mr Lam drove the truck to Hong Kong airport and collected the telephones; for reasons which are not evident, he instructedhis colleague, who otherwise should have accompanied him in the vehicle during the journey to Ezcomâs warehouse, to remain at theairport.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The telephones never reached their destination.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Mr Lam, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs driver, claimed that, whilst driving from the airport en route to the warehouse along Ching Hong Road, he was threatenedby a man wielding a knife.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The only evidence available as to the circumstances of the robbery come from Mr Lamâs police statements; at the time it appearsthat the windows of the vehicle were wound down and the doors were unlocked; the vehicleâs central locking system apparently wasbroken, and had been for some time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  It was further claimed by Mr Lam that he was forced to swallow some pills, which caused him to lose consciousness, and that whenhe regained consciousness the telephones were missing.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Unsurprisingly, Mr Lam was interviewed by the police consequent upon this theft.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In his third police interview record Mr Lam admitted that the test result of his blood and urine sample contained no indicationof the ingestion of any drugs, notwithstanding his story that he had been forced to swallow pills which caused him to lose consciousness.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The stolen telephones have not been recovered, and so far as is known the police have made no arrests consequent upon this theft;in particular Mr Lam himself neither was arrested nor charged with complicity in this event.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  On or about 3 September 2004, the insurer of the telephones, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, Samsung Fire &amp; Marine, paid to the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff, Ezcom, the sum of US$1,802,196.00, which figure represented the amount payable under the policy as issued.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  As a result of these events, the plaintiffs mount the present claim in order to recoup the value of these stolen telephones, whichclaim is pleaded at 110% of the invoice price.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The evidence</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In addition to the documentary evidence discovered by the parties â which contains, in particular, the records of interview givento the police by the driver of the intercepted lorry, Mr Lam Wing Tong, only two witnesses of fact were called on behalf of the defenceto give <i>viva voce</i> evidence at this trial.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  No witness evidence was called on behalf of the plaintiffs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Significantly, Mr Lam Wing Tong, to whom the task of collecting the telephones had been delegated, was <i>not</i> called by either of the defendants, despite the fact that he was the one person within the matrix of facts who was in a positionto give direct evidence in relation to the circumstances surrounding the robbery.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The witnesses as were called by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant were Mr Lam Kwok Shing, the Operations Manager of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant,J&amp;C Cargo, and Mr Yeung Kwok Cheung, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, whose firm Yeungâs Logistics was the subcontractor appointed by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant physically to collect and to deliver the telephones to Ezcom, the Hong Kong buyer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Neither man had any personal knowledge of the robbery, and it is fair to observe that the evidence of each was relatively uncontroversial.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Mr Lam Kwok Shing gave evidence that he was the Operations Manager of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, and that he had worked for that company for 10 years.  He said that for a period of some 8 years the 1<sup>st </sup>defendant had been using the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, Yeungâs Logistics, to collect and carry goods.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  He appeared to accept in cross-examination that it was the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, and not Ezcom, the buyer of the mobile phones, who had selected and had chosen to use the services of Yeungâs Logistics,although in re-examination he seemed to veer away from this version of events, and to suggest that the choice had been that of Ezcom.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Mr Lam further stated that he had no personal knowledge of any background checks conducted on employees of Yeungâs Logistics,and also said in cross-examination that Mr Yeung Kwok Cheung was an employee of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant at the time of the robbery on 3 May 2004, and that he knew that Mr Yeung then was working as a manager of the 1<sup>st </sup>defendantâs branch in Shenzhen.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  With regard to the extract from his âjob bookâ of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, Mr Lam said that relevant pages thereof would be photocopied and handed to the relevant drivers; he described the meaningof the columns in this extract from his âjob bookâ, which functioned as the driverâs âcollection recordâ, and pointed outthe columns which referred to the number of packages to be collected in terms of any particular job, and also where the weight ofthe cargo was indicated.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  He accepted that he did not know what any driver did with the photocopy of the relevant excerpt from the âjob bookâ which washanded to the driver, and stated that he became aware of the theft of the telephones at about midday on 3 May 2004; he made it clear,however, that he had no personal knowledge whatever as to the circumstances of the robbery.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  As for Mr Yeung Kwok Cheung, his testimony also was unable to throw much light on the events the subject of this claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  He stated that he had worked for J&amp;C Cargo since 1992, and subsequently had set up his own business, the sole proprietorshipâYeungâs Logistics Companyâ which, I understand, virtually solely focused upon carriage and delivery work for J&amp;C Cargo;thereafter, in 1998 he resumed employment with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant company, or at the least with an associated J&amp;C company, working as its manager in the Shenzhen branch.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  By reason of the fact that he was working in Shenzhen at the time, he was unable personally to supervise the operations of YeungâsLogistics, and although he received a monthly report from his employees in Hong Kong, he did not supervise the day to day operationsof his firm; these day to day operations were handled by Mr Lam Wing Tong, the driver of the lorry which had collected the stolentelephones, who was in charge of the business in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Nor had Mr Yeung been responsible for the repair of this vehicle, registration number KJ 4877, which was operated by his business;responsibility for the repair had been left to Mr Lam, and Mr Yeung was not aware that in 2004 there had been a defect in the centrallocking system of the vehicle.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  His evidence was that all of the income of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant firm emanated from the business of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  As for any standing instructions which may have been in place regarding the method of collecting goods and making deliveries, hesaid that the instructions he had given in 2000 did not include instructions as to the number of employees who were required to accompanya delivery, nor instructions as to the locking of the doors and windows of the relevant delivery vehicle.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Mr Yeung stated that he had become aware of this robbery only on the afternoon of 3 May 2004, when he was notified by telephonewhen he was in Shenzhen, and until that telephone call he had had no knowledge of any circumstances surrounding the robbery.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  As to the present whereabouts of Mr Lam, the driver of the vehicle on the day of the robbery, he said that he did not know whereMr Lam now was, this employee having left Yeungâs Logistics about a year ago.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Hearsay statements</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  In his final submission, counsel acting on behalf of the 1<sup>st </sup>defendant, Mr Pedruco, specifically referred to the content of certain statements which had been the subject of Hearsay Notices.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  These statements were the police statements of Mr WT Lam, the driver of the intercepted lorry and an employee of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, a statement of Mr Li Tong Wai, a director of one Ezcom Technology Limited (not the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff), a statement of Rachel Or, a clerk of Ezcom Technology Ltd, a statement of one Lo Kam Ling, a shipping supervisor of EzcomTechnology Limited, and lastly a statement of one Wong Man Kan, a marketing manager of the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff, Ezcom Electronics Limited.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  If it was intended to rely upon the evidence of these persons, I see no reason (and none has been canvassed) why they should nothave been called to give <i>viva voce</i> evidence in the witness box, and consistent with the general practice of the Commercial Court, I decline to attribute much if anyweight to such hearsay statements, notwithstanding Mr Pedrucoâs submission that nothing in these statements was inconsistent withthe evidence of those witnesses who gave <i>viva voce</i> evidence to this court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The defence of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  As canvassed by Mr Pedruco in his written closing submission, the defence mounted on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant (which for all practical purposes appeared to be adopted by Mr Yeung Kwok Cheung, the proprietor of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, who appeared in person), ran as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">that there was express agreement between the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, J&amp;C Cargo Services and the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff consignee, Ezcom Electronics, that all collections and deliveries made by the 1<sup>st </sup>defendant on behalf of the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff should be effected by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, Yeungâs Logistics, and that this conformed to the established course of dealing in place as at the date of the loss;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">thus, the fact that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, Yeungâs Logistics, effectively was the nominated sub-contractor of the 1<sup>st

defendant any loss suffered by reason of such nomination; in fact, counsel submitted, the 1<sup>st </sup>defendantâs hands effectively were tied with regard to the selection of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to collect and deliver the cargo in question, that in utilizing the services of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant for this job the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in effect had been acting as no more than the agent of the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff, and thus it was âunreasonable, perverse and disingenuousâ for the plaintiffs now to claim that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was not suitable or

see no reason not to accept the broad tenor of the evidence of the two witnesses who have given <i>viva voce</i> evidence before this court, neither of whom had first hand knowledge of this theft, save that I do <i>not</i> accept the belated assertion, in re-examination by Mr Lam Kwok Shing, that the use of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs services to collect and deliver the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiffâs cargo of mobile telephones was the subject of specific nomination by the consignee thereof, the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff, Ezcom Electronics.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Not only did this response directly contradict what initially had been said by Mr Lam in cross-examination, but in my view (andon the evidence I so find) the overwhelming probability is that the use by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant of the 2<sup>nd </sup>defendant was <i>not</i> reflective of any particular contractual agreement between the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, but merely reflected the standard practice, existing over some years, of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant utilizing the services of the 2<sup>nd </sup>defendant whenever possible, and regardless of the identity of the purchaser/consignee in any given transaction; in turn this furtherreflected the obviously very close working relationship between the two entities, wherein Mr Yeung, the eponymous sole proprietorof the 2<sup>nd </sup>defendant, was at that time also an employee of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant (or a sister company of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant), in that he then was responsible for managing the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs mainland operations in Shenzhen.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  In any event, if and so far as it be relevant, I reject Mr Pedrucoâs submission which sought to paint the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as the ânominated subcontractorâ of the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff, with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant merely acting as agent in this regard for the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  As to the circumstances of the robbery, all that this court has available to it is the account of the robbery as contained in thepolice statements of the driver of the lorry in question, Mr Lam Wing Tong, who, as earlier indicated, was <i>not</i> called to give evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  For the purpose of deciding this case, however, there is no necessity for this court to make a finding in terms of any personalinvolvement by Mr Lam Wing Tong in the robbery, tempting though it may be to speculate, and in the circumstances I do not seek todo so, not least because the police who investigated the incident did not charge Mr Lam, notwithstanding certain curious aspectswithin his account of the specific manner in which the robbery had transpired; I <i>do</i> accept, however, and on the probabilities I so find, that the lorry from which the telephones had been stolen had been in a stateof disrepair in terms of the breakage of its central locking system, that prior to the robbery the vehicle had been in the garagefor repair thereto, and further that on the probabilities the photocopied extract from the âjob bookâ detailing the collectionwhich was to be made had been left inside the cab during the period of repair.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  I am also persuaded to conclude, and on the probabilities so do, that this was <i>not</i> simply an opportunistic theft, but that it was well planned and that the lorry carrying the mobile phones was intercepted by therobbers who knew â or at the very least had a well-founded anticipation â that the goods stored in the cartons on board the lorrywere valuable mobile phones.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  On the available evidence I further find that both the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd </sup>defendants were, respectively, bailee for reward and sub-bailee for reward, and in light of this conclusion it seems to me that theissue of liability in this case can be decided by application of general principles relating to the liability of such bailees, andin particular in terms of the application of this burden of proof.  It is for this aspect of the case I now turn.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Bailee for reward: general principles</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In principle a bailee for reward owes a duty to the bailor to return the bailed goods safely at the conclusion of the bailment relationship,and if the bailee fails to do so, he is liable for the loss of the goods <i>unless</i> he is able to prove that he exercised all due care for the goods : see, eg, <i>British Road Services Ltd v.

Nor was there any attempt to challenge the propositionthat the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, <i>qua</i> bailee for reward, was obliged by itself and through its servants or agents to take proper and reasonable care of the bailed goods,and thus that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant could not escape liability <i>qua</i> bailee for reward simply by the expedient of delegating the task of looking after the goods to an independent contractors.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Accordingly, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, and also the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, was obliged to establish that it had taken all reasonable care of the goods.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  The approach to be taken by a court in determining whether the burden has been discharged in instances such as the present is illustratedby several cases involving like, or broadly similar, factual situations.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  In <i>Richmond Metal v.

The driver employedby the carrier was the sole witness to the hijack, and his evidence was wholly uncorroborated; moreover, he had a prior convictionfor theft and previously had lost the contents of another truck.  It was held by Mocatta J that the carrier had not discharged theburden of establishing the burden upon it, in particular on the facts that the copper scrap had been stolen without the negligenceof the driver, one Cantwell, or that the loss had occurred by reason of a riot as defined by the relevant authorities, and accordinglyjudgment was given for the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  In <i>Dense Billion Limited v.

The Court of Appeal held,<i>inter alia</i>, that the carrier was liable for the loss of the consignment as it had failed to discharge the burden of proving that it had exercisedreasonable care of the consignment, and (applying <i>British Road Services Ltd v.

The court also held that if a bailee for reward should entrust the duty of care to his servantor agent, he is equally answerable for the acts or omissions of that servant or agent (applying <i>Port Swettenham Authority v.

Putting to one side the somewhat dubious account of events as given in Mr Lamâs police statements, it is clear (andfor the avoidance of doubt I so find) that the most basic precautions were <i>not</i> taken to prevent theft.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Even taking Mr Lamâs account to the police at face value (which, if I may say so, requires a certain suspension of disbelief),the intruder entered the vehicle by the left front passenger door at a time when the vehicleâs windows were wound down and thedoors unlocked; moreover, the central locking system of the vehicle appears to have been broken and in need of repair since mid-February2004, and that no steps had been taken to remedy the problem; it is also clear that the passenger door could have been locked manually,so that if Mr Lam had taken the basic and most obvious precaution of so doing, on his case the robbery would not have happened, sincethe robber would not have been able to gain access to the truckâs cab.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  From that which Mr Lam told the police it seems that he had told employees of another company that the central locking system ofthe truck was broken, whilst the fact that it is not disputing that this truck was left for repair over the weekend (albeit apparentlynot for repair to the locking system) with a copy of the relevant extract from the âjob bookâ left on the front seat; additionallyno explanation has been given as to why in any event Mr Lam had instructed his colleague not to accompany him on the fateful journey,and both are matters which not only serve to stimulate suspicion but which also indicate an alarming degree of carelessness, whichultimately bore fruit in the robbery as ensured.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  As stated earlier there is no necessity for present purposes to make any finding of fact regarding any complicity by Mr Lam in thistheft, although it is difficult to read the police statements without some degree of suspicion.  Be that as it may.  On the basisof his account as given in his police statements, and on the basis that Yeungâs Logistics, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, functioned as an independent contractor and sub-bailee for reward, I have little difficulty in finding the case made outin terms of the liability of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant also.  Absent complicity on the part of Mr Lam, there can be no doubt in my view as to the causative carelessness demonstratedby the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in terms of care for this consignment of telephones, and there has been no evidence led in this case which can sufficeto discharge the burden of proof upon a bailee for reward that all appropriate care was taken with the goods as bailed; on the evidencethe contrary appears to be the case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Moreover, if and in so far as Mr Lam was complicit in this theft â which I have not seen fit to find as a fact â then it wouldfollow, if such were to have been the case, that on established principle liability for the loss would follow in terms of both thedefendants to this action; indeed, this would be an <i>a fortiori</i> case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  At the end of this day, therefore, on such evidence is available in terms of the circumstances of this robbery, the short pointis that this court has concluded that neither the 1<sup>st</sup> nor the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant has been able successfully to discharge the burden placed upon them of demonstrating that all reasonable care was takenof this consignment of telephones.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Nor, for that matter, am I satisfied that the circumstances demonstrate that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had taken steps to ensure that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was a competent sub-contractor; in this regard it strikes me that invariable usage of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs services had bred a laxity of approach on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in terms of the entity to whom it delegated control of goods the subject of the instant collection and delivery. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  It follows from the foregoing, therefore, that in my judgment the plaintiff has succeeded in this action in terms of establishingliability for the loss on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants, and I so hold.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  I turn, lastly, to the issue of quantum.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Quantum of loss</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  As Mr Wright has pointed out, the amount claimed represents 110% of the invoice value of the stolen telephones.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  The position is that in September 2004, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, Samsung Fire &amp; Insurance, as insurer of this consignment paid to the buyer/consignee thereof, Ezcom Electronics, thesum of US$1, 802,196.00, representing the amount payable under the relevant policy, namely 110% of invoice value.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82 .</a> Mr Wright submits that this amount was incurred directly from the loss of the telephones, which loss was caused by the failure ofthe defendants to take proper care of the consignment of telephones, and thus that this is the amount for which judgment should beentered against the defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  I do not agree.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  I fail to see why an amount in excess of the invoice value of the telephones should be visited upon the defendants simply by reasonof the fact that this apparently was the manner in which these goods were chosen to be insured.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Accordingly, in my view the amount of the judgment consequent upon the action herein should be the alternative sum propounded byMr Wright, namely US$1,638,360.00, which represents the loss of 6,086 units at US$270 per unit.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  As to which of the four plaintiffs should be the judgment creditor, it seems to me that this should be the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, the insurer, Samsung Fire &amp; Insurance, which already has indemnified the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff, Ezcom Electronics, and thus it is the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff which ultimately has borne this loss.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Order</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  In light of the foregoing judgment, I make the following order consequent upon the trial of this action :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">there is to be judgment for the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff against each of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants in the sum of US$1,638,360.00;
