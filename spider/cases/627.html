(H.K.)Ltd. of any cosmetic products identified by the trade mark HAZELINE and/or HAZELINE SNOW."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The authority for the order was, of course, <u>Norwich Pharmacal Co. &amp; Ors. v. Customs and Excise Commissioners</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] AC 133.</a> The judge referred to the well known passage in the speech of Lord Reid at p. 175 and then, having regard to the questions canvassedbefore him (and before this Court) to the comments on the following page:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" Protection of traders from having their names disclosed is a more difficult matter. If we could be sure that those whose names aresought are all tortfeasors, they do not deserve any protection. In the present case the possibility that any are not is so remotethat I think it can be neglected. The only possible way in which any of these imports could be legitimate and not an infringementwould seem to be that someone might have exported some furazolidone from this country and then whoever owned it abroad might havesent it back here. Then there would be no infringement. But again that seems most unlikely.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">    But there may be other cases where there is much more'doubt. The validity of the patent may be doubtful and there could well beother doubts. If the respondents have any doubts in any future case about the propriety of making disclosures they are well entitledto require the matter to be submitted to the court at the expense of the person seeking the disclosure. The court will then onlyorder discovery if satisfied that there is no substantial chance of injustice being done."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> I would refer also to the speech of Lord Cross at p. 199:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... in any case in which there was the least doubt as to whether disclosure should be made the person to whom the request was madewould be fully justified in saying that he would only make it under an order of the court. Then the court would have to decide whetherin all the circumstances it was right to make an order. In so deciding it would no doubt consider such matters as the strength ofthe applicant's case against the unknown alleged wrongdoer, the relation subsisting between the alleged wrongdoer and the respondent,whether the information could be obtained from another source, and whether the giving of the information would put the respondentto trouble which could not be compensated by the payment of all expenses by the applicant."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The plaintiffs, the Wellcome Foundation Limited ("Wellcome"), a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, are a whollyowned subsidiary of Wellcome Plc, likewise incorporated, and are said to be one of the largest pharmaceutical concerns in the world,being part of a substantial multi-national organisation with subsidiaries in 36 different countries and related companies in 3 more.These proceedings are concerned with a drug called "acyclovir", sold by them under the trade mark Zovirax, and a range of cosmeticproducts sold under the trade mark "Hazeline".</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Wellcome have a distribution policy as set out in an affidavit by Mr. Stuart Adams, their Assistant Trade Marks Manager:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"22. In order to.ensure that Wellcome's products reach consumers worldwide, Wellcome has established an extensive global distributionnetwork. Generally Wellcome owns all the intellectual property rights in relation to the products and Wellcome manufactures whereverpossible its range of products at its own manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom. These products are then marketed in differentcountries through Wellcome's subsidiaries or authorised distributors who are licensed in respect of these countries. However, ashas been seen in relation to HAZELINE products, Wellcome has also granted licences to various subsidiaries and joint venture companiesaround the world to manufacture particular products from Wellcome's product range and has licensed them the technology necessaryto do so.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">23.   As has been seen, it is a condition of all. licences granted by Wellcome that the licencee only distributes Wellcome's productswithin strictly defined territorial limits. Wellcome's subsidiaries and/or authorised distributors are prohibited from exportingproducts manufactured under licence and/or products purchased from Wellcome out of their territory. This is a well established procedureof Wellcome and it is strictly observed.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">24.   Thus, subject to Wellcome's supervision and control, the local subsidiaries and authorized distributors have responsibilityfor the sales of Wellcome products within their respective territories."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Acyclovir, a very successful product of Wellcome's research and development programme, is used extensively in the treatment of herpes,cold sores and other related infections. Wellcome hold a patent for it in the United Kingdom, which they have extended to Hong Kongpursuant to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/42" class="autolink_findacts">Registration of Patents Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/42">Cap. 42</a>. It is manufactured at their own facilities in the United Kingdom and then sold to subsidiaries for marketing in differentcountries. In Hong Kong this is by Borroughs Wellcome &amp; Co. (HK) Ltd. ("Wellcome (HK)") and in Portugal by Laboratorios Wellcomede Portugal Lda ("Wellcome Portugal"). In the latter case the Zovirax is made up in special packaging which indicates quite clearlythat it is intended for the Portuguese market.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In late 1989 it came to the notice of Wellcome (HK) that generic acyclovir was available on the market in Hong Kong. A sample providedby a local doctor, on analysis by Wellcome's Research and Development Department, was found to be of inferior quality and contaminatedby penicillin. In August 1991 another doctor provided what appeared to be a similar product. Investigation of a laboratory suspectedas the probable source led nowhere. In the meantime what was genuine Zovirax, but originally destined for the Portuguese market,was found on sale in a number of dispensaries here. Accordingly Wellcome mounted a publicity campaign in the South China MorningPost and several Chinese newspapers, and despatched letters to some 800 dispensaries advising of their patent rights. However little,if any, success was achieved and in April 1991 it was again reported that some 10 dispensaries were still known to be dealing inPortuguese Zovirax, and more were suspected. (Investigations into several suspect laboratories again produced no result.)</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> By reason of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/138A/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 36</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/138A" class="autolink_findacts">Pharmacy and Poisons Regulations</a> no pharmaceutical product or substance may be sold in Hong Kong unless that product or substance is registered with the Pharmacyand Poisons Board. A licence is also apparently required for its import. Enquiries to the Department of Health revealed that onlyWellcome (HK) were registered to sell Zovirax/acyclovir, while the Trade Department replied that only Wellcome (HK) had been granteda licence to import for local consumption; but that another company had applied for an import licence covering Zovirax for the purposeof export. (We are told that the Trade Department also consulted its records with regard to acyclovir. It may therefore be safelyassumed that no application for a licence was made in that respect.) However, following its usual practice the Trade Department declinedto divulge the name of that other company without its consent, which presumably was not forthcoming.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> It is common ground that the holder of a patent is free to dispose of his patented goods subject to any condition or restrictionthat he cares to impose, including of course a condition that they be not resold outside the territory of their original destination.It is also common ground that the unknown importer of the Portuguese Zovirax into Hong Kong would not be bound by any restrictionsimposed by Wellcome through the Portuguese licence agreement or otherwise unless he had notice of them. Authorities referred to inthis respect by Mr. Rogers, Q.C., who now appears for the Attorney General, and not disputed by Mr. Liao, Q.C., who has appearedthroughout for Wellcome, are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p><u>Betts v. Wilmott</u> [1871] 6 Chancery Appeals 239</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p><u>The Incandescent Gas Light Co. Ltd. v. Cantelo  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%2012%20RPC%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 12 RPC 262</a></u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p><u>National phonograph Co. of Australia Ltd. v. Menck  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1911%5d%2028%20RPC%20229" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1911] 28 RPC 229</a></u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p><u>Gillette Industries Ltd. v. Bernstein &amp; Ors.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1941%5d%2058%20RPC%20271" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1941] 58 RPC 271</a></u></p>    </blockquote>    <p>Whether an alleged infringer has notice of the restrictions imposed by the patent holder is inevitably a question of fact which inthe present instance is impossible of resolution to any significant extent; for without knowing the circumstances of the unknownimporter, it is impossible to form a view of whether he could reasonably be expected to have been aware of the plaintiffs' rights,as Mr. Liao suggests he must, by reason of the publicity campaign mounted in November 1990 and the small size of the pharmaceuticaltrade in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Alternatively it is suggested that the unknown importer is necessarily in breach of the plaintiffs' rights on the basic principlethat nemo dat quod non habet. The submission, as I understand it, is that having regard to all the circumstances, including the Portugueselicence agreement, Wellcome's established distribution policy, strictly observed within its group of companies, and the packagingand accompanying leaflet of the Portuguese Zovirax, when Wellcome sold to Wellcome Portugal the Zovirax it had manufactured in theUnited Kingdom the transaction did not pass to Wellcome Portugal, as otherwise it would, any of the intellectual property rightsowned by Wellcome (by reason of their patents in the U.K. and elsewhere) other than the rights which extended to Portugal. Thus whenthe unknown importer purchased from Wellcome Portugal, as it is presumed he or his predecessor in title did, he could have obtainedno greater right, and in particular no right to deal with the goods in Hong Kong, than was held by Wellcome Portugal. The decision,it is said, is analogous to that in <u>Societe Anonyme des Manufactures de Glaces v. Tilghman's Patent Sand Blast Company</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1883%5d%2025%20Ch%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1883] 25 Ch 1.</a> Mr. Liao also referred to:</p>    <blockquote>        <p><u>Bristol Myers Co. &amp; Ors. v.

Discphahrm &amp; Ors. unreported 19th May 1992</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Mr. Rogers suggests that these cases are easily explained by a necessary distinction in the authorities between a patent holder whomakes and sells the goods himself and a licensee who manufactures under licence, in which case only the extent of the licence isrelevant for consideration.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> It is conceded by Mr. Liao that an applicant for a Norwich Pharmaceutical order must show a prima facie case of infringement. Formy <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/138A#p1" class="autolink_findacts">part I</a> would hesitate to attempt a precise definition of what that phrase means in this context, but clearly the case must not be hopelessor just trumped up for the sake of the application. Thoughts of <u>American Cyanamid</u> come naturally to mind. And Lord Cross refers to the strength of the applicant's case as one of the factors to be weighed in thebalance.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> As I have already said the question of notice cannot be satisfactorily answered at this stage and the alternative argument raisesdifficult questions of law which I would be reluctant to resolve in the absence of a party directly interested. In the circumstancesit is not easy to assess the precise strength of Wellcome's case, but in the end I have come to the conclusion that there was sufficientin what they put before the judge below so that he would have been wrong to refuse the application, as Mr. Rogers suggests he shouldhave, on that aspect alone. Nor am I persuaded that he erred in accepting that the plaintiffs could not reasonably be expected tohave done more in other ways, or that he wrongly took into account the public interest in the quality of pharmaceuticals on salein the territory; or that overall he was plainly wrong.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal in so far as it relates to the first two paragraphs of the order in question. In viewof that conclusion I find it unnecessary, as did the judge below, to consider the position with regard to Zovirax as a trade mark.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The cosmetic products identified by the trade mark Hazeline and/or Hazeline Snow, referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the order,are very popular in Southeast Asia, including China, Hong Kong and Macau, and are registered in Wellcome's name both here and, interalia, in Indonesia. Wellcome's subsidiary in Indonesia (PTW Indonesia) is licensed to manufacture and distribute Hazeline productsthere, but is forbidden to supply such products outside that territory. Hazeline products for sale in Hong Kong, China and Macaucome, or should come according to the various agreements, from Singapore.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> In November 1990 it was discovered that Hazeline Snow manufactured in Indonesia was on sale in pharmacies concentrated in the SheungWan area. At the same time shops in the Border Gate area of Macau were found well stocked with similarly manufactured Hazeline products(and again in July 1991). It was also believed, by reason of a considerable fall in authorised sales to China, that Hazeline productswere being smuggled there on a vast scale from Macau. It is unlikely that they had been openly imported because China imposes a dutyof 300% on such products. There are no container port facilities in Macau, so it seems more than probable that all these goods werefirst imported into Hong Kong and then taken to Macau by lighter or barge. If that is so those involved would need a licence to import,and then export from Hong Kong, from the Commissioner of Customs and Excise (s. 17, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/109" class="autolink_findacts">Dutiable Commodities Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/109">Cap. 109</a> and regulation 1A of the regulations made thereunder) and there would be other documents of the kind mentioned in the fourthparagraph of the judge's order. However, after some exchange of correspondence with solicitors acting for Wellcome, the Commissionerdeclined to give assistance on the ground that in the circumstances no trade mark infringement had been shown to have been committedand that disclosure "would or might impair or hamper the efficient conduct of (his) statutory duties".</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> It is conceded that the import or export of goods bearing the trade mark Hazeline or Hazeline Snow is in itself an infringement ofthe rights granted to Wellcome by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 27(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/43">Cap. 43</a>. The extensive argument before us was directed to the questions of whether the goods so imported were in effect Wellcome'sown goods or whether in the circumstances Wellcome had impliedly given their consent to the use of the mark, in which case the unknownimporters or exporters would have a good defence under subs. 3 of the same section. We were taken in respect of the first questionthrough the cases of <u>Aristoc Ltd. v.

What does concern him however is the amount of time his staff would need to search for the information requested. Inan affirmation dated 12th November 1991 Mr. Leung Koon Wah, an acting Assistant Superintendent in the Dutiable Commodities Administrationof the Customs and Excise Department, estimated that such a search would take 987 man-days. He continued that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"11. Such an exercise would involve a massive expenditure of resources in terms of manpower which the Department simply does not have,particularly at the present time when the Government is pursuing a policy of strict austerity in the public sector. To be compelledto conduct such an exercise would be to jeopardise some of the Department's many other functions which include not only the assessmentand collection of duty but also the detection of contraband and the suppression of smuggling. Such tasks include preventing the illegalimportation into Hong Kong of prohibited , items such as narcotics and fire arms."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> He further explained that an award of costs would not help, for the Government's recruitment procedures, particular with regard tovetting and security checks, would make the temporary engagement to staff impracticable and would in any event still require considerablesupervision.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Mr. Leung's estimate was based on all the records then within the department's possession, i.e. for the current and the previous3 to 4 financial years. Later it was agreed that the search, if any was to be undertaken, should only commence from 1st January 1991and then be limited to those documents now mentioned in the fourth paragraph of the order, together of course with the attached invoiceswhere appropriate. Even so, dividing Mr. Leung's figure by 4, which would not seem inappropriate in the circumstances, still givesa figure of approximately 245 man-days.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>The judge below took the view that:</p>        <p class="quote">"... if it is otherwise reasonable to make an order, which I think it is, the amount of administrative inconvenience which would warrantnot making it, must be quite substantial and over and above the normal sort of inconvenience that compliance with such an order fordiscovery would inevitably entail. I am not satisfied that this has been established and I believe that the compensatory order thatI propose to make, namely that the plaintiffs should reimburse all Government departments involved the reasonable costs in complyingwith this order, should be sufficient to mitigate this inconvenience."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> With every respect to the judge, he failed to take into account Mr. Leung's evidence:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1     that an award of cost would hot be sufficient to mitigate the inconvenience, and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2     that compliance with the order would not merely "inconvenience" the Commissioner, but would seriously deprive the public ofthe Commissioner's services in areas more important than fair trade.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Wellcome possibly did not realise the extent of their request when it was first made, but in the light of Mr. Leung's evidence itseems to me that they are asking for more than can properly be expected, and for my part on this aspect alone I think that it wouldnot be right to make an order. I would therefore allow the appeal to the extent of setting aside paragraphs 3 and 4 of the orderin question.</p>    <p><strong>Kempster, J.A.:</strong></p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> I agree and have nothing to add.</p>    <p><strong>Litton, J.A.:</strong></p>    <p><u>Introduction</u></p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> The proceedings, initiated by originating summons, are for discovery against two departments of government the <u>Trade Department</u> (paras. 1 and 2 of Kaplan J's order of 4 March 1992) and the <u>Customs and Excise Department</u> (paras. 3 and 4). Paras. 1 and 2 concern acyclovir/Zovirax, a pharmaceutical product. Paras. 3 and 4 relate to cosmetics: Hazelineand Hazeline Snow.</p>    <p><u>Paras.1 and of the Judge's order</u></p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> As regards acyclovir/Zovirax, the Trade Department, as indicated in its letter of 21 June 1991, already has the name (and probablyalso the address) of the company which had applied for import licences covering Zovirax, declaring that the licences were for thepurpose of re-export. No search through its records was needed to comply with Kaplan J's order : that has already been done longbefore proceedings were initiated in September 1991. The Trade Department refused to provide the information as a matter of practice.Arguably, the importer of Zovirax has infringed Wellcome's patent : depending on whether he had notice of restrictions imposed bythe patentee Wellcome in relation to the territorial limits for the sale of Zovirax by its subsidiaries. The exploration of thatissue is plainly beyond the scope of the present proceedings, based solely upon affidavit evidence, where it was no part of the AttorneyGeneral's case to establish that the importer had notice. The Trade Department simply would not know, one way or the other. But,to the extent that the Trade Department has issued an import licence covering Zovirax to that importer, the Department might wellhave got itself "mixed up" in the tort of others, in the same way as the Commissioner of Customs and Excise did in <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] A.C. 133</a> in relation to furazolidone.</p>    <p><u>Paras. 3 and 4 of the Judge's Order</u></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> But orders 3 and 4, in relation to Hazeline and Hazeline Snow, stand on a rather different footing. No-one was able to say when KaplanJ made his order whether the Customs and Excise Department in fact had in its possession material sufficient to establish the identityof the alleged infringers of Wellcome's trade-mark. The position remains unchanged to this day. To get to the point of being ableto say, yes or no, whether that Department had also got itself "mixed up" in the alleged torts of others, it must first examine tensof thousands of documents. These documents fall into the following categories:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)    Import permits under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/109" class="autolink_findacts">Dutiable Commodities Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/109">Cap. 109</a>;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(ii)    Export permits under the same Ordinance;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(iii)    Removal permits for duty-paid goods;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(iv)    Removal permits for dutiable goods;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(v)    Invoices, shipping and other documents attached to the above.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Kaplan J's 3rd order is that "the Defendant do provide the Plaintiff with a list of the names of all persons .... other than [Wellcome(H.K.)] who, since 1st January 1991, have obtained a permit to import into or export out of Hong Kong any cosmetics identified bythe trade-mark Hazeline and/or Hazeline Snow". The 4th order is in the same terms, but relate the removal permits and attached documents.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Although the orders, in terms, identify the products only by their English names, they must have been intended to encompass alsodocuments in the possession of Customs and Excise where the information (if such exists) is given in Chinese, identifying the productsby their Chinese names (å¤å£«è®) and (å¤å£«è®éªè±è).</p>    <p><u>Practical Implications</u></p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Various estimates have been given for the amount of labour involved in going through the documents in order to comply with KaplanJ's order. These are, of course, mere estimates, and as such can be wrong.What is clear is that the present resources of the Customsand Excise Department do not permit such exercise to be done without considerable prejudice to their other responsibilities. Thepractical consequence of complying with the 3rd and 4th orders were not, in my view, sufficiently weighed by the judge. Nor did heconsider the "knock-on" effect of such an order. If it be right in this instance to make such an order, then there will certainlybe other patentees and trade-mark owners who would demand, as of right, the same facilities from the Customs and Excise Department: demands which the Department will plainly be unable to meet without a considerable expansion in personnel. How is the court tostem the flow, except by dismissing the applications of late-comers? Can such an approach be right in principle?</p>    <p><u>Scope of Norwich Pharmacal</u></p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> In my view, the 3rd and 4th orders are fundamentally wrong because they go way beyond the scope of <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] AC 133.</a> It may be helpful to recall Lord Morris' approach to the case at p.178 A.C. He said</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is important to mention certain matters.</p>        <p class="quote">(1)The commissioners by their pleadings admitted .... the validity of the letters patent."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In the present case, dealing as we are with "parallel imports", the alleged infringers could well have valid defences to the trade-markinfringements.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(2) The commissioners publish certain monthly statistics of goods imported into the United Kingdom and the importation of furazolidonehas been specifically mentioned. The plaintiffs are in a position to assert that the persons who have imported, whoever they are,must have been infringers and therefore wrongdoers. <u>The Commissioners know the names and addresses of these people</u>." [Emphasis added].</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Here, Wellcome cannot assert as a fact that the Customs and Excise Department knows the names and addresses of infringers. All theycan say is that <u>if</u> the Department went through the tens of thousands of documents dating back to 1 January 1991 in their possession, they <u>might</u> be able to identify some infringers. But, of course, the entire exercise could be in vain, yet that is what the Department wouldhave to do to comply with the judge's order. This, as it seems to me, is no more than a "fishing request" by Wellcome : not, perhaps,precisely of the nature referred to by Lord Cross in <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> at p.199-D, but equally objectionable; and it would indeed be a "thin end of the wedge", for once the Department is compelled tocomply with Wellcome's request, similar requests by other trade-mark owners would be irresistible.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The law has long distinguished the position of parties to litigation (against whom extensive discovery orders can be made) and thesituation of "mere witnesses". As to the latter the courts have been reluctant to subject them to the compulsive processes of lawunless the interests of justice clearly so demands. See for instance <u>Harrington</u> v. <u>N. London Polytechnic</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20WLR%201293" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 W.L.R. 1293</a> at 1299 F-G:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Whilst there is a public interest in achieving justice between disputing parties, there is also a public interest in not involvingthird parties if this can be avoided. It was the resolution of this conflict which gave rise to the 'mere witness' rule which wasconsidered in the Norwich Pharmacal case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] A.C. 133.</a> That rule was stated by Lord Kilbrandon, at p.203:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'You cannot get discovery against someone who has no connection with the litigatious matters other than that he might be called asa witness either to testify or to produce documents at the trial.'"</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> That is the fundamental rule. <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> provides an exception. If Kaplan J's 3rd and 4th orders were to be upheld, this court would have widened the relief available towould-be plaintiffs against innocent third parties well beyond the scope contemplated in</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> To test the correctness of this conclusion, suppose the following : that the plaintiff had taken out a <u>subpoena ad testificandum</u> directed to the Commissioner for Customs and Excise requiring him to testify in court, giving the names and addresses of all personswho, since 1 January 1991, had obtained import and export permits for Hazeline or Hazeline Snow. Without first going through thetens of thousands of documents in his possession relating to the import and export of cosmetics, the Commissioner would be totallyunable to testify in the way required by the subpoena. Would it be right, then, for the court to use its powers in these circumstancesand compel him to undertake this process so that he might (perhaps) be able to give the information as sought by the plaintiff? Theanswer, in my view, must be No. Authority for this is to be found in the judgment of Hunter J. in <u>Hsin Chong Construction</u> v. <u>Hong Kong and Kowloon Wharf</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20HKLR%20987" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] HKLR 987</a> where, following <u>Senior</u> v. <u>Holdsworth</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%201%20QB%2023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 1 QB 23</a>, a <u>subpoena duces tecum</u> was set aside as being oppressive. The subpoena required a witness to "bring.... and produce all files, papers, documents, notes,memoranda and other writings relating to or having a relevance or bearing to Phase III of the Harbour City Development". As to thisHunter J said at p.990-B:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"What he is, being asked to do, is to go to his own files; and sort out the documents that he has got there; sort out the documentswhich he thinks are relevant to the various claims ....  and bring those along to the hearing. It was said by [counsel for the applicant]that he must surely know now what the relevant documents are".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> This approach was rejected by Hunter J, and t<u>h</u>e subpoena in the <u>Hsin Chong</u> case was discharged. By parity of reasoning, the subpoena in the example I give above would, I suggest, have also been discharged.If a "mere witness" is not to be vexed in this way, why should the position be different if he were a defendant to a <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> action for discovery?</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> For these reasons I too would discharge the 3rd and 4th paragraphs of the judge's order.</p>    <p><strong>Sir Derek Cons, V.P:</strong></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> In handing down these judgments allowing the appeal to some extent we make an order nisi that the appellant shall have one half ofhis costs in this Court, the order as to costs below to stand.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(Sir Derek Cons)</p>            </td>            <td width="33%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(M.E.I.
