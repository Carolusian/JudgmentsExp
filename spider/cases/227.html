The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was the vendor of the Shop.  The 1<sup>st </sup>plaintiff was the purchaser.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff was its nominee which took up the assignment.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant acquired the premises which consisted of the ground to third floors of Cheung Hing Building, Wing Kiu Building and Ka WingBuilding (âthe premisesâ) from Staric Limited (âStaricâ) by way of a Sale and Purchase Agreement (âthe Staric/PoweriseAgreementâ) on 15 November 1996.  Completion was due on 15 September 1997.  Staric had acquired the premises from Wing Kiu EnterprisesLimited and sold the premises as a confirmor to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant initially also wished to sell the premises as a confirmor but was unable to find any buyer.  The premises used to housea department store.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant then decided to convert the premises into a shopping mall by sub-dividing the first to third floors into small retail units. Staric under the Staric/Powerise Agreement had already agreed to partition the ground floors of Ka Wing Building and Wing Kiu Buildinginto shops (Cheung Hing Building did not have any ground floor area at the relevant location).  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant appointed a property agent to be responsible for the sale of the sub-divided units.  The premises was renamed as the âInâsPointâ.  A brochure was prepared for the promotion of the sale of âInâs Pointâ.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On 5 August 1997, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant also instructed the 1<sup>st</sup> Third Party which was a well known property agent in Hong Kong to look for a prospective buyer for the Shop.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Third Party (âLauâ) was employed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Third Party as an agent and he was in charge of the transaction in question.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The judge found that Mr. Fung Kok Po (âFungâ), who was in charge of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had made the following representations about the Shop to Lau :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The shop was about 8 feet by 9 feet;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The Shop should be partitioned as shown in the plan attached to the brochure (âthe Brochure Planâ) and the Architect Plan of theground floor of the premises (âthe Architect Planâ);</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The partition between the Shop and the lift lobby would be made of glass if the purchaser so requested;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(4)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Two lifts would be installed in the lift lobby.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>Fung gave Lau the Brochure Plan and the Architect Plan.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Lau on the same day i.e. 5 August 1997 informed Mr. Chan Chi Hin (âChanâ) of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff of the Shop and also supplied him with the Brochure Plan on the next day i.e. 6 August 1997.  On 7 August 1997 Lau andChan went to the premises to view the Shop but they could not gain access to it because at that stage the Shop was enclosed by theexternal wall of the premises.  Lau told Chan of the representations made by Fung.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Chan was interested in the Shop.  After negotiation Chan agreed to buy the Shop for $14,500,000.  Lau prepared a Provisional Agreementfor the sale and purchase of the Shop (âthe Provisional Agreementâ).  He also prepared a plan of the Shop from the ArchitectPlan.  He also attached the plan to the Provisional Agreement (âthe Provisional Agreement Planâ).  As the plan did not delineatethe Shop from the lift lobby, Lau obtained directions from Fung over the telephone to draw a vertical line extending from the longside of a storeroom to identify the boundary of the Shop. </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The Provisional Agreement was signed first by Chan and later by Fung.  This agreement was dated 7 August 1997.  A deposit of $500,000was paid by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  A further deposit of $1,675,000 was paid by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff on 20 August 1997.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff later signed a Formal Sale and Purchase Agreement (âthe Formal Agreementâ).  This agreement included a plan (âtheFormal Agreement Planâ).  The Shop delineated on the Formal Agreement Plan was much smaller in size and was of a different shapeto the Provisional Agreement Plan. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Assignment of the Shop was signed by Chan.  On 13 September 1997 the balance of the purchase price of $12,325,000 was paid.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The sale was completed on 15 September 1997.  Vacant possession of the Shop which was not yet partitioned was notionally deliveredto the plaintiffs on the same day but the parties agreed that the actual delivery of possession of the Shop with proper partitionwas to be deferred to 15 October 1997. </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  On 11 October 1997, Chan inspected the partition work and discovered that the Shop was much smaller in size than what he had expectedand the partition between the Shop and the lift lobby was not made of glass but of concrete.  Complaints were immediately made tothe 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  There were negotiations between the parties which were not successful.  The plaintiffs then sought to rescind the saleand commenced proceedings against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Sale rescinded</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The judge found for the plaintiffs and ordered a rescission of the sale.  The basis of the decision was that, other than the matterconcerning the lifts, the representations made by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant through the third parties to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff were false and untrue.  This entitled the plaintiffs to rescind the sale on the basis of misrepresentation.  The judgeordered the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to repay the purchase price of $14,500,000 to the plaintiffs.  He also awarded them damages at $525,645.  This consistsof estate agent commission, legal costs and disbursements and stamp duty of the transaction.  Interest on these two sums was alsoawarded.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant sought an indemnity from the 1<sup>st</sup> and2<sup>nd</sup> Third Parties.  This was dismissed by the judge. </p>    <p class="heading"><u><b>Claim against the solicitors</b></u></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was a firm of solicitors and was engaged by the plaintiffs to be their solicitors in charge of the purchase of the Shop. The plaintiffs sued the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant for breach of duty and negligence. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The judge also found for the plaintiffs against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  He found that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was liable but he also found that the plaintiffs were contributorily negligent to the extent of 50%.  He assessed damagesat $6,704,229 which were to be reduced by half on account of the plaintiffsâ contributory negligence.  He also awarded the plaintiffsinterest on this sum. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  As the remedy against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was in the nature of an indemnity and was only payable in the event that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was unable to repay the purchase price, the judge ordered that the judgment against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant can only be executed with the leave of the court.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The appeal</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The plaintiffs now appeal against the decision on contributory negligence and the amount of damages assessed by the judge.  The2<sup>nd</sup> defendant filed a respondentâs notice, challenging the finding on liability.  It also contends that if the issue of contributorynegligence was to be reopened, then the plaintiffâs responsibility should be higher than 50%.  It also claimed that the judge waswrong to award interest at judgment rate to the plaintiffs.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The evidence</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On 9 August 1997, the 1<sup>st</sup>plaintiff instructed the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to be its solicitor in the transaction.  Instructions were given to Chau Hing (âChauâ) a conveyancing clerk of the2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  The Provisional Agreement with the plan was forwarded by the plaintiffs to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  On 29 August 1997, an architectâs certificate dated 27 August 1997 was sent by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs solicitors Messrs K. C. Ho &amp; Fong to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant certifying that the partition wall between the Shop and the lift lobby was non-load bearing and âdo not constitute anystructural alterations and/or additions and are exempted works under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41(3)</a> of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123" class="autolink_findacts">Buildings Ordinance</a></i> and therefore do not require any application to or approval from the Building Authorityâ.  The certificate enclosed a plan showingthe shape of the Shop.  The shape is similar to the subsequent Formal Agreement Plan and Assignment Plan but there are other differencesin other parts of these plans.  This plan was different from the Provisional Agreement Plan.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  On 8 September 1997, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant received from K.C. Ho &amp; Fong, a copy of the draft Assignment Plan showing the Shop.  The shape is similar to the FormalAgreement Plan and the Assignment Plan.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The Formal Agreement was signed by Chan in the office of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on 9 September 1997.  It was then signed by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and later returned to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on 11 September 1997.  The Formal Agreement was dated 11 September 1997.  Although it referred to a plan which identifiedthe Shop, however, the Formal Agreement as registered in the Land Registry on 3 October 1997 did not include any plan at all.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  On 12 September 1997, K.C. Ho &amp; Fong sent a âfinal draft Assignment Planâ to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  On 13 September 1997 Chan signed the Assignment and other documents and paid the balance of the purchase price of $12,375,000. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant sent the Assignment to K.C. Ho &amp; Fong on the same day.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  On 26 September 1997, K.C. Ho &amp; Fong sent the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant the Assignment duly executed by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  It also sent two Assignment Plans of the Property and also âAn amended Plan (for replacing the previous plan to theArchitectâs Certificate)â.

The difference in the size and shape of the Shop between the Provisional Agreement Plan on the one hand and the FormalAgreement Plan and the plan attached to the Assignment on the other is so apparent that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was clearly negligent in not drawing this to the attention of Chan and ascertaining from him what he actually intendedto buy in the first place.  Had he taken this course, Chan might have taken steps to protect the rights of the plaintiffs insteadof simply continuing with the purchase.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Mr. Whitehead S.C., counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant forcefully argued that while the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant might be negligent in not discovering the difference in the plans, it could not be held liable on the exceptional factsof this case : Chan was an experienced property speculator who had conducted a large number of transactions with a very high value;he was in as good a position to notice the difference in the plans as the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant; Chan had also not disclosed to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant the representations made by Fung to him, and the judge found that the actual subject matter of the sale was stated in theFormal Agreement which was of a much smaller size shop.  Taking all these factors into account the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant could not be criticised for not advising the plaintiffs âto walk out of a binding contractâ.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant should only be held liable for losses which fall within the scope of its duty of care, see : <i>Aneco Reinsurance Underwriting Ltd (In liquidation) v. Johnson &amp; Higgins Ltd</i> [2002] 1 Lloydâs Rep. 157.  In <i>Carradins Properties Ltd v. D J Freeman &amp; Co (a firm)</i> (1982) 126 SJ 157 it was held that the scope of that duty depends on the clientâs apparent need for advice.  An inexperienced clientrequired more advice than an experienced one.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  These are well established principles.  However in this particular transaction, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was entrusted by Chan to be responsible for the legal work in order to complete the purchase of the Shop.  At a minimumthe scope of the duty is to ensure that Chan would get what he intended to buy.  The requirement of checking plans and inquiry withthe client are duties one would expect any reasonable solicitor would do in a conveyancing transaction.  They are certainly wellrecognized duties : see <i>Jackson</i> <i>&amp;</i> <i>Powell on Professional Negligence</i> 5<sup>th</sup> ed. para. 10-194 and para. 10-199.  The experience of Chan is irrelevant to the discharge of this duty.  Whether Chan would be ina position to discover the discrepancies in the plans will be discussed later.  But this will only go towards the issue of contributorynegligence and not the primary liability of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The judge said the plaintiffs had not given full instructions to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  Chan was told by Fung that the Shop should be partitioned as shown on the Brochure Plan and Architect Plan.  The shapeof the Shop in both of these plans is the same.  The Provisional Agreement Plan was based on the Architect Plan with a line drawnon it to identify the boundary of the Shop.  Although Chan had not informed the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant of what Fung told him, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had been provided with the Provisional Agreement together with its plan.  The Provisional Agreement stated that the subjectmatter of the sale was the Shop.  The Provisional Agreement Plan identified the location and the layout of the Shop.  The Shop wascoloured yellow on the plan.  It also contained the handwritten words âThe area â¡[coloured yellow] in the plan shows Shop 1Aon G/F, Ka Wing Building, Nos. 534-538, Nathan Road, Kowloonâ.  Hence as far as the subject matter of the sale and the layout ofthe Shop are concerned the plaintiffs really had provided the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant with all the instructions it needed to proceed with the sale.  The fact that the Provisional Agreement Plan mentioned thatit was not to scale and for identification purpose only will not assist the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant at all given the obvious differences in size and shape between the Shop as shown in that plan and as shown in the laterplans.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Chan had of course not informed the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant of the other representations made by Fung, namely the size of the Shop, the glass partitions and the location of the lifts,but in the context of this case, these are strictly speaking not essential instructions because the focus here was on the differencesin the plans which the judge held the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant ought to have noticed and raised with Chan.  On this basis, even if Chan had not provided the other information to the2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, I fail to see why it should not be held liable in the first place.  In my view, the failure of Chan to disclose the representationsand the issue concerning the actual subject matter of sale (the finding of which is challenged by Mr. Neoh S.C., counsel for theplaintiffs) are irrelevant to the duty arising.  This is because the scope of duty of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant clearly required it to find out what Chan actually intended to buy in the first place.  The discrepancies in the plansshould have alerted the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant that his client might not be getting the property he intended to buy in the first place and he should have raised thiswith his client so that his client could consider his position.  In this connection, even if the plan to the Formal Agreement hadbeen the same as the Provisional Agreement Plan, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant would still have had a duty to draw the plaintiffsâ attention to the discrepancy that plainly existed between the areashown on that plan and the area to which the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was able to deduce title which was considerably smaller.  This is what is expected of a reasonable solicitor in a situationsuch as this.  Had the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant drawn the discrepancies to Chanâs attention, it is inconceivable that the representations would not have come to light. Those representations, as the court found, entitled the plaintiffs to rescind the contract.  This failure caused the plaintiffsto suffer loss because they ended up paying for something different instead of rescinding the sale.  This loss was clearly causedby the breach of duty on the part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Contributory negligence</u></b></p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The Principle</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The principle of contributory negligence is well established and is correctly set out by the judge.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant has to establish that the plaintiffs failed to take such care as a reasonable man would have taken in protecting theirinterests in the transaction and that the failure to take such care was a substantial or material cause leading to the damage theysuffered. </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  As a solicitor is remunerated for his services and it is his duty to advise his lay client and protect his interest, public policyrequires that such a professionalâs claim of contributory negligence by the client may only be successfully raised in very limitedcircumstances : first, where the lay client is particularly well placed to spot or correct the professionalâs mistake, second,where the lay client has done something quite separate which aggravates the consequence of the professionalâs breach of duty :<i>Jackson &amp; Powell</i>,para. 5-115.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  In my view it is the first situation that is of relevance here.  Despite Mr. Whitehouseâs contention, I really do not see anyevidence in this case which would suggest that the plaintiffs had done something which aggravated the consequences of the breachby the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The judge found that the plaintiffs were contributorily negligent to the extent of 50%.  The judge held that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â On the facts of the present case, the only act which the Plaintiffs were guilty of was their failure to give full and proper instructionsto the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  However, on the facts as I found, Chan was shown the Formal Agreement Plan and the Assignment Plan.  Had he examinedthe plans with some care, it would not have been difficult for him to realise that the Shop to be conveyed was much smaller or atleast different from the Shop he had in mind to purchase.  He was particularly well placed to spot or correct the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs mistake.  He did not inform the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant at the time of signing the Formal Agreement or the Assignment of any of the representations.  I find as a fact that hisinaction or silence in the circumstances was a substantial cause to the damage he suffered.  I consider that a serious neglect andassess his contributory negligence to be 50%.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b><u>My view</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  I have difficulty in accepting the judgeâs finding on contributory negligence.  I have already dealt with the issue of the plaintiffsnot giving full instructions to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant when I considered the liability of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  What is said there equally applies to the issue of contributory negligence : the focus was on the difference of the plans;the plaintiffs by providing the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant with the Provisional Agreement and the plan had provided it with the information on the intended purchase and this wouldbe sufficient to alert the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to take appropriate steps when it received the subsequent plans.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Further I do not agree that the plaintiffs should be held liable for not pointing out the discrepancies in the plans to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. If Chan had provided the Provisional Agreement Plan to Chau, could he not assume that the plans in the Formal Agreementand the Assignment would be the same?  What was there to alert him as a purchaser, although an experienced one, that there mightbe differences in the plans?  The partiesâ case on the plans was of course completely different.  Chau of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant said that the differences in the plans were in fact drawn to the attention of Chan.  This was rejected by the judge.  Chansaid that he was not shown the plans at all.  This was also rejected by the judge.  But since the judge had rejected Chauâs evidencethat the differences in the plans were drawn to Chanâs attention, there really was no other evidence to show that somehow Chanmust still pay attention to the plans when he signed the legal documents to see if there was any discrepancies. </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The judge made the following observations :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â ......As Chau had the plan on 8 September 1997, there was no reason why he would not have done the very minimal of showing Chanthe plan when explaining the Formal Agreement or the Assignment or Deed of Mutual Covenant to him.....â  (paragraph 73)</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â As I find both Chan and Chau incredible.  I have to resolve the dispute of fact on the basis of the burden of proof.  The Plaintiffsbear the burden of proving negligence on the part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  For reasons as I have explained above, <u>I cannot be satisfied that Chau had not shown Chan</u> the various plans attached to the Formal Agreement, Assignment and Deed of Mutual Covenant, though I reject Chauâs evidence thathe has drawn the difference between the Formal Agreement Plan or Assignment Plan and the Provisional Agreement Plan to â Chan.â (emphasis added) (paragraph 74)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The judge did not make a positive finding on this issue.  Specifically he did not make an express finding as to when the plans wereshown to Chan.  Reading between the lines a possible view is that the judge was in effect saying that the plans were shown to Chanat the time when he signed the Formal Agreement and the Assignment.  But even on that basis it is unclear what plans were shown toChan.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  The Formal Agreement Plan was not registered in the Land Registry.  The plan was only found attached to the Formal Agreement whenthis document together with other documents were supplied to the plaintiffsâ new lawyers on 28 October 1997.  The Formal AgreementPlan was different from the âAssignment Planâ supplied by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs solicitors on 8 September 1997.  The plan that was dated 19 September 1997 and attached to the Assignment was alsodifferent from the âfinal draft Assignment Planâ supplied to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on 12 September 1997.  The plan dated 19 September 1997 could only have come into existence after Chan had signed the Assignmenton 13 September 1997. </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In view of the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence on the plans, how could it be said that Chan would necessarily have discoveredthe differences in the plans and then drawn it to the attention of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Again much had been said of Chanâs vast experience in property transactions and the huge value of these transactions.  But I reallydo not see how on the facts of this case these matters would assist the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant at all.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  In my view, the judgeâs finding on contributory negligence is incorrect.  The plaintiffs are not liable for contributory negligence.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Whether contributory negligence is available as a matter of law</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Since I have found that the plaintiffs were not contributorily negligent, it is not necessary for me to decide on the interestingbut difficult question of whether contributory negligence was available to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as a matter of law.

This isbecause the contract for services contain an implied promise to exercise reasonable care and skill in its performance : see <i>Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 145</a> at 193-4.

As I understand the argument, section 4consists of two limbs : the first is referable to the defendantâs conduct but the second is referable to the plaintiffâs conduct. The defendantâs conduct relates to the plaintiffâs cause of action.  If the plaintiffâs cause of action is based on tort (i.e.one involving the defendantâs conduct), then it is covered by section 1(1) and the damage has to be reduced by the plaintiffâsown contributory negligence.

The court was concerned with provisions of section 27A of the <i>Wrongs Act</i> which is identical with the relevant provisions of the <i>English Act</i>.  Gleeson C.J. and the majority of the judges held that those decisions which followed the <i>Vesta</i> approach were wrong because :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Their interpretation was strained.

The plaintiffs had obtained a winding up order against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and misfeasance summons had been issued against the directors of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  He argued that the notional value of the Shop should not be taken into account in the assessment of damages.  </p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  It is difficult to understand why the judge adopted the approach he had made in this case.  He held that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Had the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant properly advised the Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs would not have paid the further deposit and balance of the purchase pricetotalling $14,000,000.  Had it not been for the breach of contract on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, the Plaintiffs would have obtained a shop of 47.8 square feet of the value of $7,295,771 on 15 October 1997.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  The first part of this passage is easy to understand but the second part is somewhat cryptic.  May be the judge meant that the plaintiffswould <u>not</u> have obtained a smaller shop had it not been for the breach of contract on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  But even if it is to be read in such a way it is still difficult to see why the value of the notional shop should be taken intoaccount. </p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Although the judge had rescinded the sale, the Shop had not been reassigned back to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the plaintiffs still have the Shop.  As a matter of fact the actual size of the Shop is even smaller than 47.8 sq.ft.  It is only 28.5 sq. ft.  In order to mitigate the loss, the value of this Shop has to be taken into account in the ultimatedamages to be awarded to the plaintiffs.  But this is quite different from the approach taken by the judge.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  The judge had found that the subject matter of the sale based on the terms of the Formal Agreement was the shop as indicated onthe Formal Agreement Plan i.e. a shop of a smaller size and of a different layout.  While this finding is challenged by the plaintiffsin the Re-Amended Notice of Appeal, Mr. Neoh did not seek to rely on this because it was not necessary to do so in order to succeedon the appeal. </p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  But even if the subject matter of the sale is that of a shop with a smaller size, the cause of action relied upon by the plaintiffsagainst the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was based on the misrepresentation that, among other things, the Shop to be sold to the plaintiffs was as indicated inthe Provisional Agreement Plan which was of a bigger size.  Had the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant performed its duty and drawn the plaintiffsâ attention to the discrepancies in the plans the plaintiff would rely onthis cause of action in not continuing with the sale.  They did not wish to buy a different shop.  Hence the notional shop is reallya red herring and its notional value has no bearing on the loss sustained by the plaintiffs as a result of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs breach except for the purpose of mitigation of damage. </p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Interest</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant also argued that it should not be ordered to pay interest at judgment rate on the award from the date of issue of the writuntil payment because of the punitive element.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The rate of the pre-judgment interest is a matter of discretion for the judge.  He ordered both the awards against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to carry interest at judgment rate.  I think this is to achieve uniformity so that if the plaintiffs are unable to recoverthe damages from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant they would not be prejudiced in case a different rate is used as against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  Accordingly I will not disturb the award of judgment rate interest.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Accordingly I will allow the appeal and set aside the judgment below except as to costs.  In its place there will be judgment forthe plaintiffs against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in the sum of $14,500,000 with interest at judgment rate from the date of the service of the writ to judgment less theamount they may recover by way of mitigation of damage.  The parties are required to submit an agreed form of judgment for the courtâsapproval.  The judgment will not be enforced without the leave of this court.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The respondentâs notice of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is dismissed with an order <i>nisi</i> that costs be to the plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  There is also to be an order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiffs are entitled to the costs of the appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Barma J :</b></p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Doreen Le Pichon)</td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Peter Cheung)</td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Aarif Barma)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:justify">Mr. Anthony Neoh, S.C. and Mr. Valentine S.T.
