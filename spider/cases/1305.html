The products of the Works all bear the trade names of respectively â WORLD SOCCER WINNING ELEVENâ and âKONAMIâ, both ofwhich marks are registered trade marks in Hong Kong and owned by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff is the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs Hong Kong subsidiary.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The Defendant, a retailer of magazines and newspaper, is allegedly to have displayed for sale and sold on 8 December 2005 strategyguide books of the Works which books (âthe Booksâ) bear the said trade marks.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> As a result of the said alleged unlawful conduct, the Plaintiffs through their solicitors sent a letter to the Defendant on or about20 January 2006 to demand the Defendant to sign a Deed of undertaking and pay for compensation for the alleged passing off and infringementof the copyright and registered trade marks.  When the demand was unheeded, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff issued the writ of this action on 27 February 2006 for the alleged act of passing off and infringement.  This was thenfollowed by a summons issued on 28 March 2006 under O.14 r.1 of the Rules of the District Court  (âthe Summonsâ) for the usualorders of injunction, delivery up and inquiry to damages. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The Plaintiffsâ O.14 application however has taken quite a convoluted path. After the issuance of the Summons, the Plaintiffs thenapplied for and were granted leave to amend the Writ and the Statement of Claim to add the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff as one of the parties to this action on 19 May 2006.  No application however was made to amend the Summons to add the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff as one of the applicants of the O.14 application until at the hearing of the Summons on 7 August 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> After I had granted leave to the Plaintiffs to amend the Summons by adding the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, counsel for the Plaintiffs, Mr. Feng, further informed this court that the Plaintiffs in this application would only askfor an injunction to restrain the Defendant from infringing and passing off the Plaintiffsâ copyright subsisting in the Works andthe said registered trade marks and would not pursue any other relief stated in the Summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> After the hearing on 7 August 2006, the courtâs attention was drawn to the provisions of Trade Mark Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559">Cap.559</a>, which requireactions for infringement of a registered trademark and for passing off to be brought in the Court of First Instance. After a briefcorrespondence passed between this court and the solicitors for the parties, I directed the parties to attend a direction hearingwhen it was clear that the jurisdictional issue could not de disposed of without a hearing.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> At the direction hearing on 30 August 2006, the parties were both represented by their solicitors who did not dispute that the DistrictCourt- this court - has no jurisdiction to deal with any part of the trademark claim. As the Plaintiffs however wished to keep theaction in the District Court rather than applying to transfer it to the Court of First Instance, they elected to abandon the trademarkaction.  Leave was then sought to re-amend the Summons to reflect the said election.  After I gave leave to the Plaintiffs to re-amend the Summons, the O.14 application which I had to deal with has been substantially truncated.  In the trimmed-down O.14 application(âApplicationâ), the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs seek the following order:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âAn injunction to restrain the Defendant, whether acting by itself or by its officers, employees, servants or agents or any of themor otherwise howsoever, from infringing the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs copyright in the Works specified in the schedule hereto and/or passing off or attempting to pass off, causing procuring,assisting, instigation or enabling others to pass off products not of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs manufacture or merchandise.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote"><u>Schedule Above referred to</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The Works:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">- World Soccer Winning Eleven 9</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">- Castlevania Curse of  Darknessâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">ISSUES</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The issues - after the Plaintiffs have elected to leave out the trademark claim - as distilled from the evidence adduced in the Applicationare:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  Whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff is the owner of the copyright entitling it to bring this copyright action and the scope of the Works in which the copyrightsubsists; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  Whether the Defendant had infringed and/or passed off the</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">Plaintiffsâ copyright.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Before I deal with said issues below, it is perhaps convenient to remind myself at this juncture the undisputed principles of anO. 14 application I should apply in the Applicationâ if a plaintiffâs application is properly constituted, the plaintiff is primafacie entitled to judgment unless the defendant shows cause to the contrary or the application is dismissed.  Thus, before the burdenof requiring a defendant to satisfy the court why judgment should not be entered against him, the plaintiff will be required to establisha prima facie case of his claim ( see <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2006</i> , para.14/4/1).    </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The application of this principle and an analysis of the issues can only be properly done by firstly considering the evidence ofthe Application.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">THE EVIDENCE</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The Copyright Ownership</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The evidence of the copyright ownership is found in the affirmation filed on or about 28 March 2006 by a Mr. Bamba, a director andgeneral manager of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff (âBambaâs 1<sup>st</sup> Affirmationâ).  In Bambaâs 1<sup>st</sup> Affirmation, Mr. Bamba verifies that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff became the copyright owner of the Works since the dates of the first publication of âWorld Soccer Winning Eleven 9âand âCastlevania Curse of Darknessâ respectively on 4 August 2005 and 24 November 2005 â both of which video games were createdby Japanese authors and published in Japan.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The a<i>lleged infringement and passing off</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The evidence of the Defendantâs alleged unlawful act is from the Affidavit of Jor Cheuk Wing exhibited to Bambaâs 1<sup>st</sup> Affirmation. It is not clear if this Mr. Jor was instructed as an investigator (for the convenience of description, I will referhim as  âthe investigatorâ below).  In his Affidavit, the investigator stated that he was instructed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff to pay a visit to the Defendantâsshop at Queensway Plaza on 8 December 2005 and in it, he saw video game strategy guidebooks with titles of  âWorld Soccer Winning Eleven 9 Perfect Guide Bookâ and â Castlevania Curse of Darknessâ being on display. The investigator bought the Books and paid altogether $86 â which payment was evidenced by a copy of the receipt describing thepurchased items as â story bookâ and âmagazineâ respectively costing $38 and $48 each.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The Defendant in the Affirmation of Leung Tat Poon (âLeungâs Affirmationâ) denied any sale or display for sale of the infringingarticles.  The Defendant stated that the magazines and comic books sold by its shop at that time were supplied by two distributorsand it was never in possession of any of the said strategy guide books.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">OWNERSHIP OF THE COPYRIGHT AND THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE WORKS IN WHICH COPYRIGHT SUBSISTS</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The subject matter of the copyright</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> According to paragraph 4 of the Amended Statement of Claim, the Plaintiffs describe the subject matter of the works in which copyrightsubsists as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âAt all material times, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff was and is the copyright owner of and the world-renowned manufacturer of, inter alia, video games âWorld Soccer WinningEleven 9â âCastlevania Curse of Darknessâ(the Worksâ) which are original artistic works and were made by authors domiciledin Japan at all material times.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> From the above, it is clear that the copyright in this action subsists in the artistic works in relation to the said video gamescreated by the authors in Japan and is owned by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  The evidence contained in Bambaâs 1<sup>st</sup> Affirmation as referred to in paragraph 11         above supports this pleaded case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The trademark claim, broadly speaking, is based on the registered trade marks of âKONAMIâ AND âWORLD SOCCER WINNING ELEVENâ - which marks are found in âall products of the Worksâ( See paragraph 4 of the Amended Statement of Claim set out in paragraph14 above).  Hence, the said trade marks are in relation to the products of the Works.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> An analysis of the Plaintiffsâ two different heads of claim â the copyright action and the trademark action â is necessaryas it shows that there is a clear difference in the subject matters underlying the respective actions. The Plaintiffsâ copyrightaction is based on the subsistence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs copyright in the said video games, not in the products of the video games. The trademark claim, on the other hand,attaches to any goods or products bearing the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs said trade marks. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The alleged infringing goods according to the facts of this case are clearly not video games but the Books â products bearing thesaid trade marks. Accordingly, I am unable to find, on the Plaintiffsâ evidence, that the Books form part of the Works in whichthe 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs copyright subsist.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> From the above discussion, I am inclined to conclude that the evidence adduced in the Application shows that the followings are thePlaintiffsâ prima facie case:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff is the copyright owner of the Works:</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(a) The 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff -apart from being the wholly-owned subsidiary of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff carrying on similar business as the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff â has no connection with the copyright claim.  An action on passing off and infringement of copyright is only actionableby the owner.  It is not asserted by the Plaintiffs that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff has acquired any of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs right in relation to the copyright.  Thus, I agree with the Defendantâs contention that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff, prima facie, has no remedy in relation to the copyright action.  I am unable to find from the evidence in this Applicationthat there is a prima facie case showing the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffâs right to apply for the remedy sought in the Application.</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs copyright subsists in the video games, that is, the âWorksâ only:</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(a)  There is no evidence that the Books are part of the Works.  The Books exhibited by the investigator only show that they bearthe said registered trade marks of WORLD SOCCER WINNING ELEVEN and KONAMI.  The Books may arguably be said to have infringed the1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs said trade marks -  which action the Plaintiffs have abandoned for the purpose of this Application -  but not the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs copyright.    I am therefore unable to find on the evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs copyright also subsists in the Books.  The threshold requirement laid down in O.14 r.3 of requiring a Plaintiff toshow a prima facie case â on the evidence adduced by the Plaintiffs â cannot be met.  The Plaintiffs therefore should not beentitled to judgment at this stage without proceeding to full trial.</p>            <p style="text-align:justify">(b)  Hence, having come to the said conclusion regarding the 1<sup>st</sup> issue, it is sufficient for me to dispose of this Application by granting unconditional leave to the Defendant to defend. If, however,I am found to be wrong to come to this conclusion, I should consider whether on the evidence there are any triable issues which precludethe Plaintiffs from obtaining the relief sought- a final injunction â the only remedy sought in the Application.  For the purposeof this analysis, I would therefore assume that the Books are part of the Works in which the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs copyright subsist.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">ARE THERE ANY TRIABLE ISSUES OF  THE ALLEGED ACT OF INFRINGEMENT AND PASSING OFF?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Passing off</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> In considering if there is a triable issue in the claim regarding passing off, I should perhaps refer to the three essential elementsof the torts of passing off set out in the case of <i>Reckitt &amp; Coleman Products Ltd. V Borden Inc. and Ors.</i> [1990RPC341referred to by Deputy Judge Fung in the case of <i>Creative Technology Ltd v Videocom TechnologyLtd &amp; Ano.</i> [2003] HKEC442.  The three essential elements are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) that the plaintiff enjoys reputation and goodwill in the name mark or indicia which it wishes to prevent the defendant from using;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) that the defendant has made the representation which was likely to lead members of the public to believe that his business, goodsor services are the business, goods or services of the plaintiff; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) that the plaintiff was suffering and was likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendantâsmisrepresentation.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> On the evidence adduced in the Application, the Defendant - subject to its denial of the allegation of the said unlawful activity- has not taken any issue of whether the Books amount to passing off in accordance with the said elements.  The parties also madeno submissions on this issue.  In the circumstances, I do not find it appropriate or necessary for me to make any determination inrespect of this issue. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Infringement</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Does the alleged conduct of the Defendant constitute infringement?  In <i>Halsburyâs Laws of Hong Kong- Intellectual Property:Trade Marks, Copyright and Plant Varieties Rights</i>, Vol.15(3) (para.225-844) it contains a very succinct passage on what constitutes infringement:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â Copyright in a work is infringed by a person who without the license of the copyright owner does, or authorises another to do,any of the acts restricted by the copyright.  References to the doing of an act restricted by the copyright in a work are to thedoing of it:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"> (1)    in relation to the work as a whole or any substantial part of it; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"> (2)    either directly or indirectlyâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> In this case, it is not in dispute that the Defendant did not have any license or authority by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff to sell or offer to sell any strategy guide books or the Books. Thus the evidence on the issue of whether the Defendanthad or had not committed the alleged unlawful act needs to be considered.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The Defendant opposes the Application by adducing evidence to show that it had never taken any supplies of any of the alleged infringingarticles. In Leungâs Affirmation, Mr. Leung of the Defendant deposed that the Defendantâs supplies of the books and magazinescame from only two distributors, namely, âNg Hing Kee Book &amp; Newspaper Agencyâ and a âTung Tak Hing Book &amp; NewspaperCompany Limitedâ (transliteration).  Copies of invoices issued by these two distributors to the Defendant for the month of December2005 â which invoices do not show any of video game strategy guide books having been supplied to the Defendant â were exhibitedto Leungâs Affirmation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The Plaintiffs â with a view to undermine the credibility of the Defendant â exhibited to Bambaâs 2<sup>nd</sup> Affirmation two declarations in Chinese from representatives of two magazine houses that the said Ng Hing Kee had supplied to thesehouses similar strategy guide books bearing the said trade marks. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The evidence of the parties therefore comprise of both direct and indirect evidence.  The direct evidence of the Plaintiffs is theevidence of the investigator and that of the Defendantâs, the evidence of Mr. Leung himself.  The indirect evidence will be thedistributorsâ invoices issued to the Defendant and the Chinese declarations produced by the Plaintiffs. When looked at all theevidence in the round, I am inclined to take the view that the Defendantâs evidence cannot be said to be unbelievable.  In comingto this view, I have of course borne in mind the principle governing an O. 14 application - that the onus is on a defendant to showit has a defence or a triable issue by credible evidence and that a court is not encouraged to embark on a mini-trial on the affidavitevidence. (See <i>Ng Shou Chun v Hung Chun San</i> [1994]1HKC155). </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> In the circumstances, In order to decide if the Defendantâs assertions are believable, I consider that I cannot properly come toany view without also taking into consideration of all the circumstances of the case including the nature of the evidence adducedby the Plaintiffs. In the Plaintiffsâ evidence, the evidence of the Defendantâs alleged wrongdoing only comes from one singlesource, that is, the investigatorâs affidavit. According to his evidence, during the alleged visit to the Defendantâs shop, heonly purchased two copies of the strategy guide books â the Books.  I find it little bit surprising that there is a complete lackof evidence as to approximately how many strategy guide books he found in the Defendantâs shop.  This information should be, inmy view, within the investigatorâs knowledge.  The lack of particularity can be found in paragraph 2 of his Affidavit:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âI noticed that the subject infringing video game strategy guide books, namely World Soccer Winning Eleven 9 Perfect Guide Bookand Castlevania Curse of Darkness were displayed for sale at HK$4.8 and HK$3.8 respectively at the subject stall.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> After having paid for the Books, the investigator however was not able to obtain a receipt containing detailed description of theBooks.  The receipt the investigator exhibited in his affidavit refers the purchased items respectively as âbookâ and âmagazineâ. The receipt seems to be a computer-generated receipt.  I accept that it is not uncommon these days for a newspaper and magazinestore such as the Defendantâs to issue receipts without specifying the titles of the books or magazines purchased by customers. However, the investigator was not just an ordinary customer - he was sent especially for an âevidence-colleting missionâ togather unlawful evidence against the Defendant.  Armed with such a specific instruction, the investigator- as expected in such asituation  -would be least contented with just an ordinary, non-specific receipt printed out by a computer. He would ask for moreâ something with proof that the items he purchased were indeed the infringing articles.  This in my view does not seem to be logical.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Thus, when all the evidence is considered, I am unable to say that the Defendantâs assertions are unbelievable.  Whether the Defendantâsassertions can ultimately be borne out would have to be dependent on the rigour of a trial process rather than on the assessmentof the credibility of witnesses on the affidavit evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> For this reason, I find that there are factual issues in dispute.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> If however I am wrong to come to this view and that there is no triable issue, I would still have to consider if I should exercisemy discretion to grant an injunction against the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">INJUNCTION- A DISCRETIONARY REMEDY</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The only remedy that is now sought by the Plaintiffs in this Application is injunction â the Plaintiffs having elected to leaveout the other remedies pleaded in their claim and the Summons.  There is no dispute that even if the Plaintiffs are able to showthat the Defendant had infringed and/or passed off the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs copyright,  there remains a residual discretion of this court whether to grant a final injunction to restrain the Defendant.  The tests as distilled in <i>Creative Technology Ltd</i> (ibid.) for the grant or refusal of an injunction are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)   The threat of future infringement;</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)   Whether the infringement was malicious or intentional;</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)   Where a defendant has infringed, the court will assume it is not a one-off activity and will grant an injunction to stop repetition.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The principles governing the exercise of discretion in this sort of case are settled and I will therefore apply them in this case. However,  in view of  the Defendantâs complete denial, it would not be possible for the Defendant to adduce evidence on whetherit had any malicious intention or any intention and whether it would repeat the unlawful act. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> I further recognize the principle that in an O.14 application, âonce infringement was found, the plaintiff was prima facie entitledto an injunction to protect his right, it is then upon the defendant to show that the infringement was either innocent, one-off,and where there was no threat or possibility of future infringement and it is not necessary for the injunction to be grantedâ (<i>Creative Technology Ltd</i> (ibid.) at para. 44). </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> In this case, in view of a defence of complete denial, it is therefore purely academic to strictly apply the assumption without examiningall the evidence to see if there is sufficient evidence for the court to apply the assumption by drawing of an inference from theavailable evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> After having examined the evidence in its entirely, I am not satisfied that the nature of the evidence is such that I can draw anysuch inference of the existence of an intention or threat of future infringement and I therefore do not think it is appropriate tostrictly apply the assumption. I would not therefore be disposed to, if I need to,  exercise my discretion in favour of the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">CONCLUSION</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> For the reasons above, I am satisfied that there are issues in dispute in both law and facts, which make it inappropriate for meto accede to the Application.  I therefore grant an order that the Defendant be given unconditional leave to defend.  I further makea costs order nisi that costs, including all the previous costs reserved in the Application (if any), be in the cause of this action,which costs are to be taxed if not agreed.    </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Katina Levy)<br />            Deputy District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p style="text-align:justify">   </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:justify">Mr. Lin Feng instructed by Messrs.
