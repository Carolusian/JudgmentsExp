</p>    <p class="heading">Introduction</p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  The applicant is a well-known figure in the securities and property investment industry. In about 1985 or 1986, he came to knowMr Gilbert Leung Kam Ho (âMr Leungâ), a qualified land surveyor who had experience in acting as agent for the acquisition anddevelopment of land properties in Hong Kong. Sharing a common business interest, they had since become good friends and close businessassociates.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  In the early 1990s, Mr Leung was elected a legislative councilor. One day, he arranged a lunch meeting with the applicant at theLegislative Council Building. Mr Chan Chun Chung (âMr Chanâ), whom the applicant had not seen before, also joined. Mr Leung introducedMr Chan as his <i>feng shui</i> master. That was the only occasion when the applicant met with Mr Chan.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  As widely reported in the media, Mr Chan and Chinachem Charitable Foundation Limited (âCCFLâ) were recently embroiled in thefight over the estate of the late Ms Nina Kung in <i>HCAP8/2007</i> (âthe Probate Actionâ).</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  One of the witnesses called by CCFL at the trial of the Probate Action was Mr Leung. On 21 May 2009, Mr Ian Mill, QC, representingMr Chan, showed a document prepared by Mr Leung (âthe Documentâ) for the purpose of attacking his independence as CCFLâs witnessand credibility. The Document was an investment proposal for a land development project in Tai Po, which Mr Leung had shown to potentialinvestors. Mr Chanâs case is that it came into the possession of his legal representatives shortly before the hearing on that day.Lam J, the trial judge, asked Mr Mill as to the provenance of the Document. Mr Mill replied :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âYes, I can, my Lord.  The individual who provided it to us is a Mr Edmund Tsang [a reference to the applicant].  He says that hewas given that by Mr Gilbert Leung.â(âMr Millâs Addressâ)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  What Mr Mill told Lam J added further fuel to the sensational trial. On the following day, it was widely reported in the newspapersthat Mr Mill had submitted in open court during his cross-examination of Mr Leung that the applicant had provided a copy of the Documentand other information to Mr Chan and his legal representatives to discredit Mr Leung. The applicant, who did not provide the Documentor indeed any information as alleged and in fact does not have any interest whatsoever in any of the matters in or the outcome ofthe Probate Action at all, was taken aback and extremely upset by the news reports. He received telephone calls from family members,business associates, clients of his security brokerage firm and friends regarding his alleged involvement in the Probate Action.They asked the applicant about the accuracy of what had been reported. Some of them queried why he sided with Mr Chan. Worse still,some accused him as âäºäºä»â, that is, âtraitorâ or âbackstabberâ.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The applicant was most disturbed. He considered that he had been defamed. He wanted to take action against the true informant. Hissolicitors wrote to Mr Chanâs, asking them to disclose his/her identity. The request was, however, refused. The applicant thentook out this application for a <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> order compelling Mr Chan to disclose his/her identity and the contents of his/her communication with Mr Chan or his legal representativesto the effect that it was the applicant who provided the Document.</p>    <p class="heading">Mr Chanâs stance</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Mr Chan readily accepted that the applicant did not provide the Document to his legal representatives. Somebody else did. As towhy Mr Mill told Lam J that it was the applicant who provided the Document, Mr Midgley of Haldanes, solicitors acting for Mr Chanin the Probate Action had this to say :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â4.  On day 9 of the trial in High Court Action no. 8 of 2007 between Chinachem Charitable Foundation Limited and the Respondent,who is the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in that action, Mr Ian Mill Q.C. as the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs Counsel was asked by the trial judge, the Honourable Mr Justice Lam, as to the provenance of a document in Chinese,a copy of which is exhibited to this Affidavit marked âJNM-1â (âthe documentâ).  Mr Mill replied as follows : âThe individualwho provided it to us is a Mr Edmund Tsang.  He says he was given that by Mr Gilbert Leungâ.  The learned judge then asked Mr Millabout his knowledge of Mr Tsang.  Mr Mill replied that, as he understood it, Mr Leung was trying to interest Mr Tsang in an investment,but that this was the extent of his understanding.  (As to the spelling of the name âTsangâ, Mr Mill informs me that, althoughthis does not appear in the transcript, he recalls Mr Leung giving this spelling of the surname to the transcriber when asked forit.  That is how the name appears in the transcript of the proceedings for that day).</p>        <p class="quote">5.  No reference at Court was made to any other information having been provided to the Respondent or his lawyers by Mr Tsang.</p>        <p class="quote">6.  I understand that the Applicant contends in these proceedings that the reference to Edmund Tsang was a reference to him.</p>        <p class="quote">7.  The information that the document had been provided by Mr Tsang was not information provided to the Respondentâs legal teamby the Respondent.  It was provided by a third party.  Moreover, it was provided directly to the Respondentâs legal team and notto the Respondent himself.  The same applies to the document itself.  I can also confirm that the document was put to Mr Leung withoutany advice or instructions having being sought about it from the Respondent.  I should explain that the document was used in thecourse of cross-examination of Mr Leung as to his credit.  Neither the document nor the questions relating to the transaction withwhich the document was concerned were relevant to any issue in the action.  Accordingly, the document had not been disclosed in theaction and was merely shown to the witness when he was giving evidence.</p>        <p class="quote">8.  The circumstances in which Mr Mill came to understand that the document had been provided by Mr Tsang are as follows. On the dayin question, I spoke on my mobile telephone shortly before Court to a representative of the persons who had provided us with certaininformation concerning Mr Leung. To the best of my recollection, I asked the representative where the document had come from. Therepresentative responded that it was a Mr Edmund Tsang. Unfortunately, due to the haste in taking instructions, I assumed and didnot check that what I was being told was that Mr Tsang (whose name had been unknown to me) was not only the person to whom Mr Leunghad given the document but also the person who had made it available to us. This was the basis upon which Mr Mill addressed the Courtin the way that he did.</p>        <p class="quote">9.  I have subsequently talked to the representative again. In fact, the representative (whose mother tongue is not English) had understoodmy question to have been simply as to the identity of the person to whom Mr Gilbert Leung had given the document with which we hadbeen provided. Further, so the representative has now told me, whereas it was correct that Mr Leung had handed the document to MrTsang, it is not correct that it was Mr Tsang who had provided the document to the Respondentâs legal team. It therefore appearsthat the identification of Mr Tsang in Court as the provider of the document to the Respondentâs legal team was incorrect, as theresult of an unfortunate but innocent mistake.</p>        <p class="quote">10.  I should add that Mr Leung was asked in cross-examination about Mr Tsang. He confirmed that he had indeed spoken to Mr Tsangin the middle of 2007 about the acquisition or potential development of the plots of land referred to in the document. He also confirmedthat he had prepared the document in order to encourage investors in the land and in its development and that as a development consultanthe would normally provide information to clients. However, he was unable to recall whether he had given the document to Mr Tsang.</p>        <p class="quote">11.  The information which was volunteered to the Court in answer to the Judgeâs question contained in part, as explained above,an innocent error and the Respondent has asked me to extend his apologies both to Mr Tsang and to the Court for the fact that thisoccurred (although of course he bears no personal culpability in relation thereto). Mr Mill and I extend the same apologies.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Mr Chan thought that the informant had rendered assistance to him in connection with the Probate Action on the understanding andin the expectation that his or her involvement would be kept confidential.  Mr Chan considered that it is incumbent on him to protectthat confidentiality so far as he reasonably could.  He has therefore not been willing to provide the name voluntarily.  He shouldonly do so if the court so orders, having had the relevant issues properly ventilated according to the applicable principles.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  To those principles I now turn.</p>    <p class="heading">The law</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The applicable legal principles are well-settled.  They were admirably summarized by Ma J (as he then was) in <i>A Co. v B Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%203%20HKLRD%20111" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 3 HKLRD 111</a> at paras. 10-13, cited by this court in <i>Cinepoly Records Co.

A helpful summary of the principles can be found in <i>A Co. v.

Where innocent parties are caught up or have become involved in the tortious or wrongful activities of others, thus facilitatingthe perpetration(or continuation) of such activities, justice may require (and therefore the court may order) that such innocentpersons come under a duty to assist the victim of the tort or wrongful activities, by the provision of full information even thoughsuch innocent persons cannot be shown to incur any personal liability at that stage.  The foundation of the courtâs jurisdictionhere is its equitable jurisdiction.  The courtâs ability to make such orders was confirmed by the House of Lordâs decision in<i>Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs and Exercise Commissioners</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] AC 133:</a> see in particular the speech of Lord Ried at pp. 173F-175E.  The principles and approach established by that decision have consistentlybeen applied in Hong Kong.</p>            <p class="quote">11.  The jurisdiction is a wide one.  It is not restricted, as was at one time thought, to the disclosure of the names of wrongdoersonly.  In particular, where a plaintiff wishes to investigate the passage of monies in and out of bank accounts in aid of a tracingclaim, discovery can be ordered of a bankâs books and documents; see <i>Bankers Trust Co v. Shapira</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20WLR%201274" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 WLR 1274</a> at pp.1281F-1282F.</p>            <p class="quote">12.  Though founded ultimately on notions of justice, nevertheless, it is important to emphasise the extraordinary nature of thisrelief because it is not a usual order and is not one that a court would lightly grant in the absence of powerful factors. I emphasisthe following characteristics of this type of order:</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(1)  It is made against an innocent party whose only involvement is to become mixed up in the tortious or wrongful activities of others. There is, at that stage, no evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of the innocent party.</p>                <p class="quote">(2)  Instead, whatever wrongdoing there is, exists only on the part of a person or persons against whom no relief may be sought atthat stage and indeed against whom there is probably insufficient evidence to found an action.  In order words, this person or thesepersons will most probably not be before the court and would not be able to answer what are often very serious allegations made againstthem.</p>                <p class="quote">(3)  Usually, there will, moreover, exist a legal relationship between the innocent person against whom a discovery order is soughtand the alleged wrongdoer and this relationship may involve strict duties to be observed on the innocent partyâs part.  The presentcase offers what is a common scenario: the innocent defendant is a bank and the alleged wrongdoers its customers.  In this situation,any discovery to be made by the innocent party may well, apart from a court order, expose that innocent party to liability, bothcivil and possibly even criminal.  At the very least, a breach of confidentiality is involved.</p>                <p class="quote">(4)  The court, accordingly, in applications for <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> relief must, in its discretion, balance the competing interest of the victim of the alleged wrongdoing and an innocent party caughtup in the wrongdoing.</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="quote">13.  Given these characteristics as I have outlined, such orders are therefore not lightly made as I have said. In my view, it isessential for the court to bear the following in mind before a <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> order is made:</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(1)  There must be cogent and compelling evidence to demonstrate that serious tortious or wrongful activities have taken place.  Andwhere fraud or similar serious allegations are made, the degree of proof must correspondingly be high: see <i>Re H (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20563" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 563</a> at p.586CâH.  All the more so when the alleged wrongdoer is not and will not likely be before the court.</p>                <p class="quote">(2)  It must also be clearly demonstrated that the order will or will very likely reap substantial and worthwhile benefits for theplaintiff.  Where, as in the present case, the plaintiff is likely to make a tracing claim, there must be a serious possibility thatthe discovery sought must either allow the plaintiff to preserve what may well be his assets or realistically lead to the discoveryof such assets: see <i>Arab Monetary Fund v. Hashim (No.</i> <i>5)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20ALL%20ER%20911" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 ALL ER 911</a> at pp. 916DâE, 918Jâ919A.</p>                <p class="quote">(3)  The discovery sought must not be unduly wide.  There is no entitlement to general discovery (by general discovery is meant discoveryin the <i>Compagnie FinanciÃ¨re et Commerciale due Pacifique v. Peruvian Guano Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281882%2d83%29%20LR%2011%20QBD%2055" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1882-83) LR 11 QBD 55</a> sense): see <i>Arab Monetary Fung v Hashim (No. 5)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20ALL%20ER%20911" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 ALL ER 911</a> at pp.918D-E, 919H.  It follows therefore that not only must any order be specific, it must also be restricted to those or thoseclasses of documents that are necessary to enable the plaintiff to preserve or discover assets.  This is not to say that discoveryorders cannot be wide; what is important is that the discovery, whether wide or narrow, is necessary.â</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">19.  In my view, the application of the above principles requires an applicant for <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery of the identity of an alleged wrongdoer to first establish the following essential elements :</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1)  Serious tortious or wrongful activities have been committed.</p>            <p class="quote">(2)  The alleged wrongdoer is a person whom the applicant <i>bona fide</i> believes to be infringing his rights in the sense that he can reasonably be assumed to be the wrongdoer <i>vis-Ã -vis</i> the applicant : see <i>Norwich Pharamacal</i>, <i>supra</i>, <i>per</i> Lord Kilbrandon at p.205GâH and Lord Morris at p.179BâC.</p>            <p class="quote">(3)  The innocent party, against whom discovery is sought, has caught up or has become involved in such activities, thus facilitatingthe perpetration or continuation of the same.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">If the applicant fails to establish any of these elements, his application must fail at this stage.</p>        <p class="quote">20.  After establishing the above elements, the applicant needs to go further and demonstrate that it is just and convenient in allthe circumstances of the case for the court to exercise its discretion to grant the relief.  The factors that the court will takeinto account may vary from case to case.  For example, the court may consider if the innocent party is the only practical sourceof information : see <i>Norwich Pharmacal, supra</i>, <i>per</i> Lord Kilbrandon at p.205H.  If the innocent party is subject to a duty of confidentiality, imposed by contract or otherwise, notto disclose the information, the court will bear in mind the competing interests in ordering or refusing disclosure.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  I would add one more point.  The courts have extended the application of the basic principles, <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> relief being a flexible remedy capable of adaptation to new circumstances : <i>Mitsui &amp; Co. Ltd v Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%203%20All%20ER%20511" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 3 All ER 511</a>, <i>per</i> Lightman J at paras. 19 and 20 at pp. 517f-j.  Its application is no longer confined to cases (like the <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> case itself) where the applicant had been able to demonstrate that a wrong had been committed.  It may be invoked if the applicantis able to show a <i>prime facie</i> case of a wrong having been committed in the sense that the case must not be hopeless of just âtrumped up for the sake of the applicationâ: see <i>Attorney General v Wellcome Foundation Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20HKC%20158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 HKC 158</a>, <i>per</i> Cons VP at p. 164H.  Or where the applicant has shown reasonable grounds to support his belief that a wrong had been committed againsthim : <i>P v T Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20WLR%201309" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 WLR 1309</a>, <i>per</i> Sir Richard Scott VC at pp. 1318c-1319A.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Further, it should be noted that in <i>P v T Ltd</i> where the applicantâs complaint was based on libel, the matters ordered to be disclosed included not only the identity of the wrongdoerbut also the precise details of the allegations made by him : see p. 1315D.</p>    <p class="heading">Discussion</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  With these principles in mind, I first consider if the applicant has discharged the requisite burden to enable the court to exercisethe jurisdiction.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Generally speaking, a person committed defamation against another when he published matters, usually words, of the latter conveyinga defamatory imputation, that is, an imputation that tends to harm his reputation so as to lower him in the estimation of right-thinkingmembers of society generally. See <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i>, 11<sup>th</sup> Edn, para. 2.7 at p. 46.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  For present purposes, it will be sufficient if the applicant can show a <i>prima facie</i> case of or reasonable basis for claiming that defamation had been committed against him arising from Mr Millâs Address and thenews reports based on it. Three requirements need to be established :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  the words complained of referred to the applicant;</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  the words complained of are defamatory; and</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  the informant published the words complained of.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  First, on reference, it is accepted by Mr Chan, and rightly so in my view, that Mr Millâs Address and the ensuing news reportsdid refer to the applicant.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Second, on defamatory meaning, Mr Millâs Address and the ensuing news reports plainly carried the defamatory meanings as contendedby the applicant.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Third, on publication, when the representative of the informant had the telephone conversation with Mr Midgley as to who providedthe Document, it must be reasonably obvious to both of them that Lam J would inquire as to the source of the Document, which wasproduced for the first time in the course of cross-examination of Mr Leung to discredit him. It follows that it must be within theirreasonable contemplation that the identity of the person who provided the Document had to be revealed to the court and, given theimmense publicity the Probate Action had attracted, would be widely reported in the press. If the representative did tell Mr Midgleythat it was the applicant who provided the Document, the informant, who acted through the representative, would be liable for MrMillâs Address and the subsequent publications in the press. Even if, as Mr Midgley now said, the representative had misunderstoodhim, and what he meant was that the Document was given by Mr Leung to the applicant, it is reasonably arguable that he must be intendingMr Midgley to infer that the Document came from the applicant. Arguably, the informant would still be liable for Mr Millâs Addressand the subsequent publications in the press.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Mr Harris, SC, for Mr Chan argued that what the applicant complained of is slander, which is not actionable in the absence of specialdamage. But as I have endeavourered to demonstrate, I think the applicant has a <i>prima facie</i> case or reasonable grounds to support his claims based on libel arising from the news reports on Mr Millâs Address to Lam J.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the applicant has discharged the initial burden.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  I next consider if it is just and covenant to order disclosure. Mr Harris submitted that it is not by taking essentially two points.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  He first submitted the identity of the informant is protected by legal professional privilege. However, even if that is the case,as rightly submitted by Mr Tong, SC, for the applicant, the privilege must have been waived when Mr Mill revealed, <i>albeit</i> mistakenly, to Lam J in open court who provided the Document. It does not lie in Mr Chanâs mouth now to say the identity of thetrue informant should be kept confidential by privilege.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Mr Harris next submitted that no real or substantial benefit would be gained by ordering disclosure because Mr Chan had offeredto issue a joint statement with the applicant to clarify the mistake in Mr Millâs Address and the news reports. I disagree. Theapplicant is quite entitled to sue the informant who had harmed his reputation. The proposed joint statement with Mr Chan, a supposedlyinnocent person who had unwittingly become involved in the tortuous act, is simply insufficient.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  In my view, in the circumstances of the present case, justice demands that a disclosure order should be made to arm the applicantwith the information necessary for the bringing of an action of defamation against the true informant.</p>    <p class="heading">Orders</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  I will make an order in terms of paragraphs 1 to 3 of the originating summons dated 12 June 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  On costs, the normal order is that the applicant should pay the innocent party costs, including the costs of providing the information.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Mr Tong submitted that while the applicant should pay the costs of taking out the originating summons, compliance with the disclosureorder and the first hearing on 30 June 2009, he should not be held liable for the costs thereafter. Mr Chan, counsel complained,had acted unreasonably in opposing the application after 30 June 2009. I agree. The reasons advanced in both Mr Midgleyâs affidavitsand Mr Harrisâs submissions are plainly untenable. Mr Chan should have provided the information sought after 30 June 2009. In thecircumstances, he should not be entitled to costs thereafter. I will order the plaintiff to pay Mr Chan costs of the action up toand inclusive of the hearing of 30 June 2009 and the costs of complying with the disclosure order on an indemnity basis, to be taxedif not agreed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(J.
