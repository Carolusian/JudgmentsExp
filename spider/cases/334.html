The terms of the second contracts were identicalto the first ones except for the salaries (â<b>the 2<sup>nd</sup> contracts</b>â).  The salaries under the 2<sup>nd</sup> contracts were about half of those under the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts.  The salaries that the employees in fact received were those under the 2<sup>nd</sup> contracts.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In 2005, armed with the letters from Compass repeating the false salaries, the employees had their visas extended by the Department.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The matter came to light in 2007.  Toledo was prosecuted for conspiring in the employment of the employees at wages lower than thoseapproved by the Department in granting the employment visas. He was convicted as charged after trial and sentenced to 6 monthsâimprisonment by the Shatin Magistracy (Case No. STCC 7239).  Similar charges were not pursued against Compass.  This also ended theworking relationship between the employees and Compass.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In March 2008, 7 of the employees, together with 3 others not being parties to these actions, filed claims with the Labour Tribunalagainst Compass (LBTC 1152/2008).  The claims were for underpayment of wages on the basis that the salaries under the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts were the contractual salaries.  The employeesâ claims were eventually struck out for want of prosecution.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The order striking out the employeesâ claims in the Labour Tribunal was dated September 2008.  But prior to that, the employeesalso commenced the present actions in August 2008.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In November 2008, Compass took out these applications for striking out.  In the same month, the Plaintiffs obtained leave to amendtheir statements of claim.  Toledo was joined as a defendant and their pleadings were amended to its present forms.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>The pleaded case</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The amended statements of claims in these 8 actions are almost identical.  The cause of action is the tort of conspiracy.  It isalleged that Compass combined with Toledo to recruit the employees to work for Compass by unlawful means.  The conspiracy is saidto be one between Compass and Toledo and the unlawful means was the fraud on the Department to obtain the employment visas.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The pleaded basis is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  During the interviews, Toledo induced the employees to sign the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  Compass submitted the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts to the Immigration Department.  The salaries were within the approved range for imported workers and the Department issuedthe employment visas.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)  Some of the employees signed the 2<sup>nd</sup> contracts at the same time when they signed the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts or shortly afterwards.  Some signed the 2<sup>nd</sup> contracts after they had arrived at Hong Kong.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)  The employees had little choice but to accept the 2<sup>nd</sup> contracts, having no other employment, families to support at home, and being dependent upon Compass for their livelihood and accommodationin Hong Kong.  The wages offered, although only about half the approved rates, were still higher than what they could earn in thePhilippines.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(5)  Compass therefore profited by employing the employees at wages lower than those on which the employment visas had been granted.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(6)  The employees have suffered loss and damage being the difference in the amount of wages under the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts and the amount actually paid.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>The application</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Compass used to complain that the claims have failed to identify precisely the cause of action alleged against Compass.  Mr Katfor Compass accepted that this is no longer in issue after the last amendment of the statements of claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Nevertheless, these actions, Compass contends, ought to be dismissed as being frivolous or vexatious and/or abusive of court processfor the following reasons:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  The statements of claim cannot be cured by amendment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  The employees have signed written statements to the Department and/or given their evidence on oath or by way of affirmationsto the court in Case No. STCC 7239/2007 which directly contradict the matters now pleaded as the basis for their claims against Compass.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)  In particular, the employees signed their first contracts knowing them to be false, as parties to a conspiracy to obtain employmentvisas by fraud upon the Director of Immigration, and knowing that their true salaries were to be the lower ones.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)  The employees suffered no loss.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Discussion</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Mr Kwok for the employees described this as essentially a case of exploitation of imported employees.  As a result of the conspiracy,the employees agreed to, and did, serve Compass but were paid less than what they should have been entitled to.  The salaries underthe 1<sup>st</sup> contracts that the Department approved provide the measure of what the employees should have been entitled to and therefore the extentof their loss.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Indeed the pleadings (particularly para.7 thereof and as summarised under paragraphs 13(4) above) give the impression that the employeescontracted to work for the salaries under the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts but only to be offered or to find out that they had little choice but to accept the lower salaries under the 2<sup>nd</sup> contracts afterwards.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The affidavits filed by their solicitor on their behalf somehow reinforce such impression.  Invariably, the affidavits say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â5.   The Plaintiff duly worked for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant <b>but was paid the salary of HK$10,000</b>.  The only contract that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant submitted to the Immigration Department, and on which the visas was granted for the Plaintiff to come to Hong Kong wasat the salary of [<i>HK$18,000.00-21,000</i>] per month.  <b>The salary of HK$10,000.00 may have been mentioned but it is the Plaintiffâs case that the binding salary is that in the contractapproved by the Immigration Department.</b> The Plaintiff would not be privy to information on the market rate for salaries in Hong Kong; that was the responsibility of theImmigration Department in granting the visa.  It is correct that <b>the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant later required the Plaintiff to sign a contract of a lower salary, but that was after the Plaintiff had entered Hong Kong</b> and was totally dependent upon the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant for all the terms of [<i>her/his</i>] existence in Hong Kong.  Because of [<i>her/his</i>] immigration status, [<i>she/he</i>] was not free to find any other work in Hong Kong.  <b>The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was in a position of undue influence, when imposing a salary lower than that stipulated in the contract which had beenapproved by the Immigration Department.</b>â  (<i>emphasis added</i>)</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  It should be noted that contrary to their solicitorâs affidavits, not all the employees were asked to sign the 2<sup>nd</sup> contracts after they had arrived at Hong Kong.  Some of the employees signed the 2<sup>nd</sup> contracts at the same time as they signed the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts while some signed them shortly after the interviews.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  But more importantly, contrary to the impression so created, the employees had confessed in writing to the Department to the followingeffect:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  During the interviews by Toledo, they were actually offered, and they agreed, to work for the lower salaries.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  They signed the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts with Compass for the higher salaries, knowing them to be false, and merely for the purpose of obtaining their employmentvisas.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)  They signed the 2<sup>nd</sup> contracts with Compass for the lower salaries as offered to and accepted by them.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)  They were paid the lower salaries as agreed.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(5)  They applied to extend their visas by submitting Compassâ letters confirming their employment at the higher but bogus salaries.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The employees were charged with Toledo as parties to the conspiracy to defraud the Department for obtaining the employment visas. The employees were eventually spared on condition that each would give evidence for the prosecution.  Nevertheless each of themremained named as the conspirator in each count of charge against Toledo.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In the criminal proceedings, the Magistrate accepted the employeesâ evidence.  In convicting Toledo, the Magistrate found, inparticular, that the employees in fact agreed to work for Compass for the lower salaries; and the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts were manufactured merely for the applications for their employment visas.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The employees now claim that they are effectively victims of the conspiracy originated as one between Compass and Toledo and dueto which they suffered loss.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Mr Kat argued that it is an abuse of process of this court for the employees to claim that they have lost the benefits of the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts which they knew and admitted were for the sole purpose of obtaining their employment visas.  This was what the employeesdid in the Labour Tribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  On the date of commencement of these actions, the employeesâ claims in the Tribunal had been adjourned sine die and were stillpending.  There was on that date multiplicity of proceedings in respect of the same subject matter.  This was per se abuse of thecourt process.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  But Mr Kat mainly argued that allowing these actions to proceed would give rise to a risk of factual findings inconsistent withthose in the criminal proceedings, which were based on the Magistrateâs acceptance of the employeesâ evidence on oath.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  So far as the employees are seeking to substantiate the impression so created by paragraph 7 of their pleadings as mentioned above,I agree with Mr Kat.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Mr Kwok pointed out that Compass and the employees were not parties to the criminal proceedings.  The employees were merely witnesses. Factually this is correct.  But if Mr Kwok is suggesting that the employees are therefore not bound by the findings of facts inthe criminal proceedings on the basis of what they said on oath, I cannot agree.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Much was also argued about the <i>res judicata</i> principle.  Mr Kat submitted that it is an abuse of process for the employees to re-litigate their claims for the benefits of the1<sup>st</sup> contracts, which had been disposed of by the regular orders of the Labour Tribunal, by these actions in the guise of an action onthe cause of conspiracy.  He submitted that Compass should not be vexed twice in respect of the same claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The <i>res judicata</i> principle may apply in its narrow and broad sense: see <i>Henderson v Henderson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1843%5d%203%20Hare%20100" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1843] 3 Hare 100</a>, 145; <i>Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng Bank Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20581" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 581</a>, 590; <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 AC 1</a>, 31.  But by striking out the claims for want of prosecution (for want of appearance of the employees), the Tribunal had disposedof the employeesâ claims without embarking on adjudication of their merits.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  In terms of <i>res judicata</i> proper, the employees are, in my view, neither re-litigating what had been adjudicated nor litigating what could and should havebeen raised for adjudication in the earlier proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The employeesâ enforcement of the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts in the Labour Tribunal would have doomed to fail, had the claims not been struck out.  In his supplemental submissions,Mr Kwok seemed to accept the difficulty in the employeesâ pursuing a contractual claim on the basis of the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts.  Needless to say, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over a common law claim in the tort of conspiracy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The above having been said, is it therefore obvious that the employees have no case in claiming in the tort of conspiracy?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Mr Kwok emphasized that the employees are neither claiming in contract nor seeking to enforce the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts in the present actions.  Mr Kat acknowledged that as a matter of pleading but his position was that the claims remain thosefor the benefits of the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts under the guise of the conspiracy cause.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Mr Kwok submitted that the reference to the salaries under the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts relates only to the measure of damages for the pecuniary loss.  He referred to the case of <i>Lonrho Plc v Fayed (No.5)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20WLR%201489" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] WLR 1489 (CA).</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  In <i>Lonrho (No.5)</i>, the plaintiffs (individuals and the company) alleged that the defendants were guilty of a conspiracy to injure the plaintiffs andthat the plaintiffs had suffered damage.  No particulars of the damage were given.  The action was struck out on the ground of abuseof process.  The plaintiffs appealed and applied for leave to amend the pleadings by giving particulars of, among others, pecuniaryloss of the company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The English Court of Appeal allowed the appeal to the extent of the companyâs claim for pecuniary loss caused by the alleged conspiracy. It was in this context that the Court expressed the view that a plaintiff injured by a conspiracy must prove pecuniary loss, thoughif he proves actual pecuniary loss the damages are at large in the sense that they are not limited to a precise calculation of theamount of such loss actually proved: see <i>Lonrho (No.5)</i> at 1494B-G.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The issue in the present cases is whether the employees can be said to have suffered pecuniary loss due to the conspiracy.  As mentionedabove, it was submitted on behalf of Compass that the employees have suffered no loss due to the conspiracy and the cause of actionwill not be complete: see <i>Clerk and Lindsell on Torts</i> (19<sup>th</sup> ed) at 25-116.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Mr Kat submitted that without becoming parties to the conspiracy, the employees would not have come to be employed and to earn thesalaries under the 2<sup>nd</sup> contracts, not to mention to expect to be paid the salaries under the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts.  The employees managed to come to work here and got what they were offered and what they accepted.  Therefore they havesuffered no loss.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The employeesâ solicitor explained the employeesâ understanding when agreeing to work for Compass.  The affidavits invariablysay:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â3.   â¦â¦ it was the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant who hired Plaintiff.  The Defendants prepared all the documents and submitted them to the Immigration Department with thepurpose of obtaining the Plaintiffâs labour and skillsâ¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â¦â¦      </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">5.     â¦â¦ The Plaintiff would not be privy to information on the market rate for salaries in Hong Kong; that was the responsibilityof the Immigration Department in granting the visaâ¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">10.   â¦â¦ each Plaintiff admitted â¦â¦ in taking part in the scheme to obtain visas, it was all at the demand of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant â¦â¦ Each Plaintiff expected the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to observe the requirements of the Hong Kong Government and likewise expected the Hong Kong Government to enforce thosestandards, as required under the Migration for Employment Convention.  The Plaintiffs believed that they were taking part in a schemeto work legitimately in Hong Kong.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Mr Kat observed that despite the standard introductory paragraph in each of the affidavits, the employeesâ solicitor never actuallystated the source of his information to enable him to depose to such effect.  Strictly, O.41 of the Rules of the District Court hasnot been complied with.  Yet in the circumstances where it was the employeesâ solicitors who spoke on behalf of them, I am notminded to say that this is so fatal that such parts of the affidavits should be disregarded.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  It is indeed the pleaded case of the employees that they were induced to sign the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts (para.4 of the amended statements of claim) and therefore taking part in the conspiracy.  There is no suggestion that theemployees had confessed having knowledge about the meaning and significance of the false salaries under the 1<sup>st</sup> contracts when they were signed, apart from that the salaries were so stated and the contracts were so arranged by Compass for thepurpose of obtaining the employment visas.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Indeed the employees got what they were offered and what they accepted for working for Compass.  But pertinent to the alleged inducementis the question of whether they could have chosen not to accept Compassâs offer at the time, had they realised the truth then. In that case, the employeesâ agreeing to take part in the conspiracy and to work for Compass was the consequence of the conspiracynow pleaded.  So was the eventual loss to the extent of the difference between their salaries and what they should have been entitledto in serving Compass.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In the circumstances of the present cases, the question is not as simple as whether the employees are entitled to claim that theyhave suffered loss as a result of the conspiracy of which they were parties.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The employees admitted that the salaries under the 2<sup>nd</sup> contracts were higher than what they could earn in their home country.  Mr Kat went further by referring to the evidence tendingto show that there was in fact no substantial difference between the salaries paid to the employees and those prevailing in HongKong for local employees in similar positions; and hence no exploitation.  Yet for the purpose of an application like the presentones, this is probably not the kind of exercise that the court should carry out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Policy arguments were also raised on behalf of the employees.  However, these remain, as these could only be, civil actions fordamages for pecuniary loss as pleaded.  Whether the claims should be allowed depends on whether they stand the test of legal andfactual proof, not as a public policy measure.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  For the reasons explained above, I am not satisfied that the employeesâ claim for loss due to the conspiracy originated betweenCompass and Toledo is obviously unsustainable.  The existence of the pecuniary loss and the measure of the damages for such lossshould be matters for trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Conclusion and order</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  The applications for striking out in each of these actions are dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Mr Kwok suggested that costs upon dismissal of the applications should be awarded to the employees on an indemnity basis.
