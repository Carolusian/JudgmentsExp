Written submissions on costs have now been received from the parties.  The costs with which we are concerned are those in theCourt of Appeal (where the Director had been ordered to pay the costs) and the costs of the proceedings before this Court. </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The parties are sharply at odds as to who was the substantive âwinnerâ and as to the costs order which ought consequently tobe made.   PBIL contends that it should have all the costs, certified fit for three counsel, on the basis that the Court essentiallyendorsed the position that it had consistently maintained and rejected the Directorâs arguments on the questions of law determined. For her part, while conceding that the Court decided one of three main issues in favour of PBIL, the Director argues that she succeededon the other two issues and secured a financially favourable outcome so that PBIL ought to be ordered to pay 75% of her costs.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  To resolve this difference between the parties, it is necessary briefly to examine the Courtâs decision regarding the three issuesidentified.  The facts are set out in the judgment of Lord Hoffmann NPJ.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>  In summary, on 5 May 1995, the Director gave notice of a proposed reclamation which, if carried out, would eliminate PBILâs accessto the sea and put an end to its ship building and repairing business.  This was done in the context of plans published in 1994 forthe construction of a container terminal on the site of the proposed reclamation.  The Government then changed its mind and, on 10April 2000, revoked the 1995 authorisation and then issued a new notice concerning reclamation for the purpose of constructing aDisneyland theme park on the site.  In the meantime, PBILâs shipbuilding business had not been disturbed.  The Government lateracquired a surrender of PBILâs lease for about $1.5 billion on 3 April 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  As Lord Hoffmann NPJ explained, the question in the appeal was âhow the compensation which had become payable by virtue of the1995 authorisation should be calculated and, in particular, the effect (if any) of the subsequent eventsâ.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a>  More particularly, the dispute was âabout how the compensation should be assessed in the light of the facts that the originalauthorisation had been revoked and that there had been no actual interference with marine access before the company surrendered itslease.â<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The first issue identified by the Director was as to whether the events which occurred subsequent to the 1995 notice were relevantto assessing the compensation.   Lord Hoffmann NPJ summarised the respective arguments of the parties as follows:<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âPBILâs view was that subsequent events were irrelevant. The compensation should be the difference between the value of its landon 5 May 1995 without the reclamation and its value on the assumption that on that date the reclamation had taken place. ...â</p>        <p class="quote">âThe Governmentâs view was that the notice of authorisation should be treated as if it had been a tort by which PBILâs marinerights were wrongfully extinguished on that date. In accordance with general principles of tort law, damages should be the loss which,at the time of the hearing in the Tribunal, could be proved to have been caused by the notional tort, together with an estimate ofany loss which would occur in the future. In this case, that would mean any loss which was caused by the situation of the ship buildingbusiness being precarious after the authorisation and before the sale, together with the difference in the price for which the leasehad been surrendered and what its value would have been with marine rights.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  On this issue, it is plain (as the Director accepts) that PBILâs argument was preferred to that of the Director.  The Court heldthat on the true construction of the Ordinance:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... the reclamation is treated as having taken place on the date of publication of the authorisation and the compensation is thedifference between the open market value of land in actual enjoyment of its marine rights and its open market value when deprived<i>de facto</i> as well as <i>de jure</i> of its access to the sea.â<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p>And that nothing which happened after that date can affect the valuation:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe value of a property means the price which it would have fetched on a sale in the open market between a willing seller and awilling purchaser on the relevant date. That obviously cannot be affected by what happened afterwards.â<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The second issue is where the real controversy regarding costs arises.  It involves what Lord Hoffmann NPJ called the Governmentâsalternative argument, running as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf the correct measure was the difference between the value on 5 May 1995 with marine rights and its value after their extinction,the latter valuation should also take into account that the container terminal scheme was expected to bring road connections to PBILâsland which would increase its value, probably more than any diminution caused by the loss of marine rights. So no compensation wouldbe payable.â<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Director contends that this issue was decided in her favour âin that account is to be taken in the comparative 1995 valuationsof the effect on value of the then anticipated container port.â This is an argument based on paragraphs 44 to 46 of the judgmentin which the Court recognized that in valuing the land before and after the extinguishment of PBILâs marine rights respectively,it would be appropriate to take into account the existence of expectations, if any, regarding possible enhancement to the value ofthe land arising from road transport improvements that might accompany the proposed container port.  The Director submits that, accordingly,if her evidence is accepted âit may mean that the present huge claim is eliminated or reduced to comparatively small proportionsâ,justifying a costs order in her favour.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  We cannot accept the Directorâs submission.  In the first place, Lord Hoffmann NPJâs remarks in paragraphs 44 to 46 were notan acceptance of the Governmentâs alternative argument.  That argument was that enhancement to the value of the land by reasonof an anticipated road network associated with a container port should only be taken into account in âthe latter valuationâ,that is, the valuation after extinction of the marine rights, thereby effectively nullifying PBILâs claim.  That argument was rejected. The Court held that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â...the prospect of new uses for the land, and the increased value which that may have generated, would have entered into the valuations<i>both</i> with and without access to the sea.â (emphasis supplied)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The Court saw no basis for taking the increased value into account only in the âafterâ valuation and ignoring it on the âbeforeâside of the ledger.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Secondly, the Court was certainly <i>not</i> purporting to decide that any such expectations in fact existed or, if they did exist, what their impact on the valuation might be. Far less was the Court purporting to decide that such expectations would result in a valuation financially favourable to the Director,as opposed, for instance, to being mutually off-set in the âbeforeâ and âafterâ valuations.  The Court emphasised that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhether such expectations existed and the extent, if any, to which they would have affected the open market value of the land isa matter for evidence when the valuation comes to be done.â<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  PBIL were accordingly substantively the âwinnersâ on the second issue as raised and argued by the Director.  The Courtâs decisiondoes not deal with any evidential issues or outcomes and does not necessarily mean that a financially favourable result will be achievedby the Director in the exercise of assessing compensation.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The third issue identified by the Director involved PBILâs attempted reliance on Article 105 of the Basic Law.  Although canvassedin the written cases, the point was not addressed in oral argument.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In our view, costs should follow the event, being awarded in favour of PBIL which succeeded on both substantive points.  It is fairto regard the Basic Law point as a weak one, but it played an insignificant part in the proceedings and does not affect the applicationof the usual costs principle.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Neither should its operation be affected by two other features of the present appeal.  First, it is true that the Director was theAppellant in this Court and that the appeal resulted in the Court of Appealâs Order being set aside.  However, that did not reflecta victory on the Directorâs part.  It was necessary to set that Order aside because it was, with respect, self-contradictory andconfusing.  By its paragraph 2, it directed that the valuation should take place on a âbefore and afterâ basis as at 5 May 1995,but it then went on (in paragraph 3) to direct the Lands Tribunal to âconsider and determine howâ certain subsequent events wererelevant and might be taken into account.  As Litton NPJ pointed out, this was an unsatisfactory order that effectively determinednothing.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Secondly, while the Court criticised adoption of the preliminary issue procedure, PBIL should not be singled out for blame regardingany unsatisfactory consequences of taking that course.  As Rogers VP pointed out,<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a> PBIL were driven to seek the trial of preliminary issues by the Governmentâs âvacillating approach coupled with the imprecisecontentionsâ put forward in correspondence so that its attitude to compensation was unclear ânearly 10 years after the 1995 authorizationâ.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a>  Moreover, although the preliminary issue approach did give rise to analytical difficulties, the Courtâs judgment clearly providesthe parties with guidance on the legal principles applicable to the assessment of statutory compensation, resolving difficult questionsof construction and narrowing the issues which will require evidential investigation.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  We accordingly direct that the Director do pay PBILâs costs of this appeal and of the appeal before the Court of Appeal, includingthe costs of the written submissions on costs, certified fit for three counsel, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Kemal Bokhary)<br />            Permanent Judge</td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(Patrick Chan)<br />            Permanent Judge</td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(R A V Ribeiro)<br />            Permanent Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>     <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Henry Litton)  <br />            Non-Permanent Judge</td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Lord Hoffmann)<br />            Non-Permanent Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Written submissions by Mr Michael Barnes, QC and Mr Valentine Yim (instructed by the Department of Justice) for the appellant</p>        <p>Written submissions by Mr Denis Chang, SC, Mr Johannes Chan, SC and Mr Jeremy S K Chan (instructed by Messrs Wilkinson &amp; Grist)for the respondent</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <div>        <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />        <p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="" id="_ftn1">[1]</a>          FACV No 8 of 2009.</p>        <p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="" id="_ftn2">[2]</a>          <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/127">Cap 127</a>.</p>        <p><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="" id="_ftn3">[3]</a>          At Â§Â§12-14 and 23-26.</p>        <p><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="" id="_ftn4">[4]</a>          At Â§14.</p>        <p><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="" id="_ftn5">[5]</a>          At Â§27.</p>        <p><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title="" id="_ftn6">[6]</a>          <i>Ibid</i>.</p>        <p><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7" title="" id="_ftn7">[7]</a>          At Â§42.</p>        <p><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8" title="" id="_ftn8">[8]</a>          At Â§43.</p>        <p><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9" title="" id="_ftn9">[9]</a>          At Â§28.</p>        <p><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10" title="" id="_ftn10">[10]</a>         At Â§44.</p>        <p><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11" title="" id="_ftn11">[11]</a>         CACV 3/2004, 22 November 2004.</p>        <p><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12" title="" id="_ftn12">[12]</a>         At Â§17.</p>    </div>    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2010/42.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
