It invokedthe relevant provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/519" class="autolink_findacts">Railways Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/519">Cap 519</a> (âthe Ordinanceâ) and notified the Applicant the period for occupation would be for 23 months.   Needless to say theApplicant would be dispossessed accordingly.  The TOA was at the edge of a lot of land of the Applicant.  At all material times,the Applicant was in the process of developing the land into a number of 3-storey blocks of flats for sale.</p>    <p class="heading">(II) Impact of TOA on the Original Scheme</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Though the TOA is small, of area about 188 m<sup>2</sup>, it would have been necessary to have it reverted back to the Applicant before an Occupation Permit for the project would be issued,even if the Applicant chose to proceed with the project as planned.  Without an Occupation Permit, the Government would  not issuethe  Certificate of Compliance which must be obtained before any sale of flats could be launched.  Mr. Wong, the Applicantâs expert/salesagent in his report explained how and why this was the case. His contention  was not challenged.      </p>    <p class="heading">(III)Uncertainty as to Date of  Reversion of TOA </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> It would have been within the right and power of the KCRC to extend the occupation period when the progress of its work so required.This gave rise to uncertainty as to the date when the Applicant could have the TOA back. As a consequence, not only the date of commencementof sale of flats would be delayed but delayed for an uncertain period.   This proposition is one of the reasons put forward to justifythe Applicantâs  abandonment of the original scheme and its adoption of a revised scheme.  It so turned out that KCRC did not seekto extend the occupation period. That being the case, it is arguable that this particular worry of the Applicant did not arise fromor was caused by the TOA and could not be used to justify the change or revision of scheme so far as mitigation of loss or damagewas concerned.  This point has become academic as the Government does not challenge the revision of scheme as a legitimate measureof mitigation of loss.  </p>    <p class="heading">(IV) Revising the Development Scheme to Mitigate Loss</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Mr. Wong asserted in his report that there were three options considered by the Applicant. The one adopted by the Applicant was tocarry on with the development of the site with a view to realize the profits of investment in the site as soon as possible by disposingthe flats to be built.  This option required the modification of the Original Scheme and piling work already done would have to bewasted. It also involved some other incidental expenditures.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> There is no direct evidence from the Applicant as to hatching out and deliberation of these options. Mr. Wong must have simply relatedwhat he came to know from others personally involved in the process and /or has deducted from the circumstances.  His assertion issupported by evidence of documents and surrounding circumstances. It cannot be disputed that there was such Original Scheme and thatit was abandoned. A new scheme was made and approval for it obtained from the Government.  The change of scheme must have been aresponse to the TOA.  It cannot be imagined that this move was not aimed at achieving some economic and monetary benefit for theApplicant.

However, Government wouldnormally grant an extension of the deadline by way of Lease Modification subject to payment of a premium and an administrative fee.The premium fee for the first 12-month extension is 2% on the open market site value of the land, increasing to 4%, 8%, 14%, 22%,and 32% for subsequent 12-month extensions.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>The Applicant claimed that because of the âTOAâ, an additional extension from 10 December 1999 to 9 December 2000 with premiumcharged at 14% of open market site value had become necessary. The total amount claimed is $3,370,440 (premium and administrativefee at $3,204,600 plus consultancy fee $165,840 for application for extension of Building Covenant and negotiation of premium). Anothersum of premium and administrative fee of $1,258,950 for extending the deadline for a further 3 months from 10 December 2000 to 9March 2001 was also paid but subsequently refunded by Government as the OP of the development was issued on 31 January 2001, withinthe 3 months grace period allowed by Government. Thus, the claim excluded this sum of $1,258,950.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The Respondentâs expert argued that there should be no compensation for the extra premium paid for the extension of Building Covenantin this case. He said in his report dated 22 June 2006 (Hearing Bundle No.1, Page 25): âIt is arguable that compensation shouldnot be payable by Government because of an expectation or hope that without the scheme that Government would give an extension tothe Building Covenant period specified in the lease.â However, the Applicantâs expert in his report pointed out that there wasan established Government policy to grant extension of Building Covenant provided that the Lands Department was satisfied that thedeveloper was genuinely proceeding with the development project. He added in his closing submissions that the Lands Department hadin fact extended the Building Covenant, so there had been no hope value at all. Further, he considered that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 12(c)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124" class="autolink_findacts">Lands Resumption Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124">Cap.124</a>, which excluded hope value from compensation for resumption under that Ordinance, had no application in this case whichwas a claim under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/519" class="autolink_findacts">Railways Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/519">Cap.519</a>, because <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/519/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 43(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/519" class="autolink_findacts">Railways Ordinance</a> excluded the application of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124" class="autolink_findacts">Lands Resumption Ordinance</a> to any claim or determination of compensation for land resumption. He also pointed out that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 12(c)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124" class="autolink_findacts">Lands Resumption Ordinance</a> only applied to resumption of land, whereas the present case did not involve any land resumption but temporary resumption of land.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Having considered all the arguments and available evidence, we determine that the Applicant is entitled to compensation for the extrapremium and the administrative fee paid for the extension of Building Covenant amounting to $3,370,440. We are astonished by andcannot agree with the Respondentâs Expertâs suggestion that the Government could probably have chosen not to extend the BuildingCovenant and to exercise the right of re-entry so as to avoid payment of compensation.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> As a fallback position, the Respondentâs expert reasoned that since it had been the Applicantâs failure to complete the developmentwithin the original Building Covenant period that had   led to the penal fate of 14% on open market site value, the compensationfor extra premium should be based on the rate of 2% for initial extension rather than the penal rate of 14%. In that case, the compensationfor extra premium would be assessed at $ 457,800 plus consultancy fee $50,000 totalling $507,800. The Applicantâs   counsel arguedthat before the Respondent decided to compulsorily occupy the âSiteâ, the Respondent had had full knowledge of the fact thatthere had been previous extensions of the Building Covenant and the premium for the next extension would be calculated at 14% ofopen market site value, then because of Governmentâs compulsory occupation of the âSiteâ, an additional extension of the BuildingCovenant had become necessary and the premium for this additional extension had been charged by the Lands Department at 14% and paidby the Applicant. He thus submitted that the Respondent must take the victim as they find himâthe thin skull rule must apply. Weaccept this argument and rule that the compensation should be awarded on the basis of 14% on open market site value.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The Respondentâs counsel did not pursue the argument for âhope valueâ any further in his closing submissions but instead arguedthat the Applicantâs entitlement for compensation under this head should be nil because the extension would have been needed inany event even if there were no âTOAâ. It is understood that the estimated date for the issue of OP would have a bearing on thecalculation of premium for Building Covenant extension. We have  under Head A ruled that the estimate date for the issue of CC forthe âOriginal Schemeâ be 4 April 2000, i.e. 14 months before the actual date for the issue of CC for the âRevised Schemeâ.Normally, OP would be issued about 2 months before the issue of CC. Following from this, it is reasonable to estimate that the datefor the issue of OP for the âOriginal Schemeâ be 4 February 2000. As the Building Covenant had previously been extended to 9December 1999, the estimated date of 4 February 2000 for the issue of OP for the âOriginal Schemeâ fell within the 3 months graceperiod allowed by Government and hence there would have been no need for the additional extension of the Building Covenant for anotheryear from 10 December 1999 to 9 December 2000 in this case had it not been for the âTOAâ. We therefore determine compensationunder this head at $3,370,440, the full amount claimed by the Applicant.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Heads C --- Cable Trench</b></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The evidence or rather the reasons for incurring the cost for these items were given by Mr. Wong in his report as follows:</p>    <p> Bundle B1-63:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">  âBut when the project was practically completed in December 2000, <b>construction of KCRCâs West Rail viaducts</b> outside the Site was under active progress such that KCRC refused to approve underground cable connection works to be carried outby CLP within the cartilage of KCRCâs work site. <b>In order to minimize further delay on project completion</b> -----had to agreeâfor power supply to be routed along---</p>        <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">  <i>â---had there been no TOA the construction of project would have been completed âKCRC should have no ground to disapprove ---theunderground cable connection works---â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is plain and obvious that the cost of installing the cable trench was the direct result of KCRCâs disapproval which is unconnectedwith TOA.  Therefore there is some force in the argument of Mr. Houghton, counsel for the Government that this item should not beallowed.  However he was in a difficult position. There was some delay in connection with this cable trench matter, there had beenprior delay and subsequent delay. The total of these delays was agreed by the Government expert to have been reasonably caused byTOA. That being the case, it would be difficult to argue that the cost of routing the cable trench had not also been caused by TOA. Bearing that in mind we have made assessment of this head of claim as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The Applicantâs expert in his report dated 23 June 2006 (Hearing Bundle No.1, Page 63) gave the following justification for theclaim: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">   âThe creation of the TOA and the consequential delay on project completion had resulted in Lingrade having to incur extra expenditurein obtaining electricity supply from China Light and Power Company (âCLPâ) for the completed development. The reason being thatfor permanent electricity supply to the completed development, CLPâs planning was to have electricity supply cable to run belowground form Castle Peak Road to the Site passing underneath the LRT tracks, the West Rail viaducts, the bicycle track and the publicfootpath before entering the Site. But when the project was practically completed in December 2000, construction of KCRCâs WestRail viaducts outside the Site was under active progress such that KCRC refused to approve underground cable connection works tobe carried out by CLP within the cartilage of KCRCâs work site. In order to minimize further delay on project completion, Lingradehad to agree with CLP for power supply to be routed along the temporary vehicular bridge by providing a cable trench. The necessaryworks for the cable trench were carried out by Hoo Cheong in June 2001 at a cost of $191,980 and electricity power was availableto Lingrade Garden in the same month.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">Similar to the temporary covered walkway referred to in Paragraph 13.6, works for installing cable trench for temporary electricitysupply would not have been required had there been no creation of TOA- had there been no TOA, construction of the project would havebeen practically completed by December 1999 and at that time, construction of the West Rail viaducts had not started outside theSite and KCRC should have no ground to disapprove the carrying out of underground cable connection works by CLP. In other words,as a result of the creation of TOA and hence delay of the project, Lingrade had suffered in having to incur extra expenditure ininstalling cable trench for power supply and such expenditure should therefore be a claimable item.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In his subsequent report dated 12 September 2006 (Hearing Bundle No.1, Page 91), the Applicantâs expert produced copies of 3 letters(Hearing Bundle No.2, Pages 294-297) showing (a) KCRC had disapproved China Light and Powerâs proposed routing of permanent electricitysupply cable as it would affect their entire access; (b) China Light and Power had proposed the routing for the temporary electricitysupply cable to run across the bridge west of the development site; and (c) construction of the cable trench along the temporaryaccess bridge had been completed.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The Respondentâs expert was of the view that to lay a cable trench over a temporary bridge might not have been the best solutionand KCRC would probably have been able to solve the access problem for electricity supply at a much lower cost (Hearing Bundle No.1,Page 106). We are unable to see the logic of this view point, as firstly there should not be any incentive for the Applicant notto seek a better solution at a lower cost and secondly the Respondentâs expert did not suggest what the best solution would havebeen or any better solution. Further, it seemed to the Respondentâs expert that the problem of electricity supply would have beenexisted whether or not the âTOAâ had been created because the problem was that the routing of the electricity supply cable submittedto KCRC by China Light and Power would affect their entire access (Hearing Bundle No.1 Page 106). On the other hand, as already mentioned,the Applicantâs expert reasoned that should there be no âTOAâ, the development could have been practically completed by December1999 when KCRC had not yet started construction works for the West Rail viaducts outside the subject site and should therefore haveno objection to the carrying out of cable connection works by China Light and Power.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> It have been accepted by both parties that âTOAâ had delayed the project. We have already ruled that the estimated date for theissue of OC for the âOriginal Schemeâ be 4 February 2000 and this supports the estimated practical completion date of the projectby December 1999 or early January 2000. The Applicantâs expert gave evidence that at that time, KCRC had not started the constructionworks for the West Rail viaducts outside the âSiteâ. We agree with the Applicantâs expert that KCRC would have no ground todisapprove the routing of electricity supply cable submitted by China Light and Power when KCRC had not started construction of theWest Rail viaducts outside the âSiteâ. We consider that the need for the installation of the cable trench to obtain temporaryelectricity supply along the temporary vehicular bridge was caused by the creation of the âTOAâ which delayed the completionof the project. The works of the cable trench had been completed, invoiced and paid (Hearing Bundle No.2 Page 297 &amp; 299 and ExhibitA2). Having considered all the evidence available, we on balance determine to award the claim of $191,980 under this Head.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Head D---Fence Wall</b></p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Mr. Houghton criticised the Applicantâs failure to produce cogent evidence of payment. Apart from showing that such cost relatingto this head is reasonable it is equally necessary for the Applicant to prove that it had actually incurred such cost.  The documentaryevidence to support this head of claim is an estimate by a quantity surveyor.  Indeed this is the shortcoming of the state of evidencewhich we should bear in mind in evaluating this head of claim. </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The Applicantâs expert in Paragraph 13.8.1 of his report dated 23 June 2006 (Hearing Bundle No.1, Page 64) reported: âBoth theOriginal and the Revised Schemes provided for fence walls to be erected along the entire site boundary. But due to the existenceof the TOA, a section of the front fence wall of 2.5m tall and about 73.9m long had to be erected temporarily behind the TOA. Afterthe issuance of OP and CC and the expiration of the temporary occupation period with possession of the TOA reverted back to Lingrade,that section of the temporary fence wall had therefore to be demolished and a new permanent section was erected along the front siteboundary.â We note there is no dispute between the parties on these facts. Whilst accepting the claim of $342,000 as costs forconstruction and demolition of the temporary fence wall, the Respondentâs expert did not agree to the claim of $249,000 for theextra cost on the construction of the permanent fence wall, being the difference between the actual cost of construction of thatsection of permanent fence wall in question ($620,000) and the estimated cost of construction of the same section of permanent fencewall ($371,000) had this been included in the original construction contract, on grounds that this section of the permanent fencewall had to be constructed in the original contract anyway and that there was no evidence that the cost of construction would havebeen lower had the cost been incurred earlier in view of the falling tender prices for construction works during the relevant period.The Applicantâs expert explained that the cost of constructing the permanent fence wall, almost 9 months after practical completionof the project under a separate contract for a single work item, would inevitably be higher than what would have been had such workbeen included in the main construction contract for the development. He further elaborated that after completion of the development,occupation by residents necessitated the removal of all construction equipments, including the construction crane, from the site,thus everything had to be virtually carted into the site for the construction of the permanent fence wall, causing extra labour costs.In addition, he pointed out that with residents already moved in, the site condition would be comparatively more inconvenient towork in because of residentsâ safety considerations (e.g. children running around). He also told the Tribunal that extra preliminarycosts had been involved, such as taking out another insurance policy. We consider that these explanations are reasonable althoughthe Applicantâs expert appeared to give explanations for the contractor to charge more. To justify the amount of claim, the Applicantâsexpert produced detailed assessments of each item of work as well as an estimate of the additional cost for the relocation of thefence wall, all prepared by Levett &amp; Baily, Chartered Quantity Surveyors Ltd (Hearing Bundle No.2, Pages 239-247).

However, the Applicantâs expert in giving evidence had already shown that the sum for constructing the permanent fencewall had been included in the final account between the contractor and the Respondent (Bundle No.2, Page 236, 244 and 245).</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>With the evidence before us, we are convinced that the fence wall works were in fact carried out. It is unreasonable to assume thatthe Applicant was not required to pay for the works done. We also accept the assessments for the actual fence wall works done andthe estimate for what would have been the cost of building the permanent fence wall had it been included in the original main contractfor the development, both prepared by Levett &amp; Baily, Chartered Quantity Surveyorâs Ltd.

There is no dispute as to the actual sales proceeds of flats of the RevisedScheme. It took 47 months for the Applicant to sell all of the flats. Mr. Wong then made an estimate of the sale proceeds for thehypothetical sale of flats under the Original Scheme which would have been completed on a hypothetical date had there been no TOA. According to Mr. Wongâs estimate, the hypothetical sales proceeds exceeds the actual sales figure by about 24 millions.  The Applicantargued that it should be compensated for the same amount as a disturbance payment.</p>    <p class="heading">Evidence Required</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Applicant must show he has actually suffered loss and damage as if in an action in tort. For example if the owner is building theblocks of flats for donation on their completion to charity, say to one operating a home for the old age and if a mere delay in completionand handing over the flats to the charity does not make him liable for damage, he would not have suffered any damage. Under thesecircumstances, he could not claim compensation as if he had intended to sell the flats for profits and claims for loss of sales proceeds. Take another example, if the Applicant had had a much larger but otherwise identical project concurrent in the adjoining land andthe flats of which larger project the Applicant found it difficult to sell, stock-piling a large number of flats during the relevantperiod, he could not have claimed any loss.  This illustrates the point that evidence is needed to show exactly in what way a Applicanthas suffered loss and damage because of the delay.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Mr. Houghton contended that loss in value of land is not recoverable. He is right to a certain extent. The value of the Applicantâsland has fallen between the hypothetical date of completion under the Original Scheme and the actual date of completion. The fallin value per se is not recoverable. Evidence must be adduced to show that the Applicant has suffered loss and damage and that itwas caused by the delay, there being no dispute that the delay was caused by the TOA. The ordinary test of remoteness of damage intort applies, not the simple âbut forâ test as appears to be adopted by both experts.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Mr. Houghton argued that the Applicant is framing its claim in a way claiming for loss in value of land. He had good ground for sayingso. Be that as it may, implicitly the Applicant is claiming loss of profits though it relied on  the fall in value of its land insupport.  From the documentary evidence and its conduct it is an irresistible inference that the Applicant is a developer for profits.The blocks of flats were built for sale and not for rentals or other purpose.  The flats or land formed his stock in trade.  It canbe rightly inferred that he had been deprived of an opportunity during the delay period of dealing with his stock in trade. Thisis a disturbance of trade within the meaning of the Ordinance.  The ability of his making a profit of its investment or reducingits loss for that matter must depend on the value of his stock in trade.  The starting point of assessing its loss of profits isexactly that amount of fall in value of his flats during the period when he could not trade with its stocks.  Unless there is evidenceto show that the Applicant would have held on to these hypothetical flats up to the point when it was able to commence the sale,it  has suffered loss and damage in the amount representing the fall in value. </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Both experts did not make an estimate of the bulk values of the flats at these two relevant dates.  Mr. Houghton had reservationabout our belated invitation to the experts to give us assistance in the valuation in this respect. Even though Mr. Wong was ableand ready to give his, we did not allow him to do so in view of the stance quite rightly taken by Mr. Houghton.  Nonetheless we areable to do the valuation from the data and evidence of the experts.  Needless to say this valuation can only be as good as the dataand evidence before us.   The figure we arrived at is 13.9 million. The details of valuation are to follow.  This figure representsthe loss as at the date of issue of Certificate of Compliance, i.e. 4 June 2001. We do not know what Mr. Wongâs assessment wouldhave been in this respect, though, as said before, he was ready to give us his figure.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> It took Mr. Wong about 47 months to complete the sale of flats incurring a loss of proceeds of sales of about 24 million much greaterthan the loss as at 4 June 2001.  As a matter of law the Applicant  can recover from the Government further losses beyond 4 June2001 but only if the Applicant suffered such loss in mitigation of loss or damage.  To succeed in claiming further losses, evidenceof mitigation of loss and damage is required.  The  merits of counselsâ respective argument on its sufficiency or insufficiencyis no longer relevant.  It is because the assessment of the loss we made adopting the framework used by the experts, we arrived ata figure even smaller than the loss as it stood at 4 June 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> A few factors we must bear in mind in assessing the evidence of the experts. Firstly, Mr. Wong played two roles in the Applicantâsclaim. He gave expert opinion on the estimation of proceeds from the hypothetical sales. Secondly he was also the sales agent responsiblefor marketing the flats of the Revised Scheme.  In the course of arguing for his assessment he had to assume there is nothing wrongor unreasonable in his marketing strategy.  There is no evidence before us to judge what he said was correct.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>Both experts in fact used the same or similar framework for assessing loss of sale proceeds. We accept that it is no surprise forvaluation experts to adopt this framework under similar circumstances.  The experts in this case differ mainly in the valuation methodsto be employed. The relative merits would be noted even if not mentioned specifically  in our assessment and determination that follows. Had it not been for the TOA the Applicant could have started selling the units in April 2000. By relying on the R&amp;V Index (August2001=76.5 and April  2000=93.5---see New Bundle, Page 174) and using the August 2001 average unit price of $26,458 per m<sup>2 </sup> (see valuation schedule above) as base, the April 2000 average unit price can be calculated at $32,338 per m<sup>2. </sup> (26458 Â¸ 76.5x93.5). The total estimated value of the completed âOriginal Schemeâ as at April 2000 can then be calculated bymultiplying the April 2001average unit price of $32,338 per m<sup>2</sup> by the total saleable area of the development of 2631.733 m<sup>2</sup>  (see New Bundle page 116) and this will give a valuation of $85,104,982, say <b>$85,100,000</b>. Similarly, the Applicant could start selling the units in the Revised Scheme in June 2001 after the issue of Certificate of Compliance.The total value of the completed Revised Scheme as June 2001 can likewise be calculated by multiplying the June 2001 average priceof $27,047 per  m<sup>2</sup> (see valuation schedule above) by the total saleable area of the development of 2631.733 m<sup>2</sup> and this will give a valuation of $71,177,851 say $71,200,000. With these valuations, the loss in value by comparing the valuationsas at these two dates is therefore $13,900,000.</p>    <p class="heading">Assessment</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The Applicant alleged that the âTOAâ had delayed the completion of the development and the sales of the units and these had causedloss of sales proceeds in a falling property market. Neither the fact of delayed completion nor the fact that the property markethad been falling was in dispute. We were told by counsel of both parties that the extent of delay had been agreed between the expertsof the parties at 14 months. However, the experts disputed on the method of valuation and on the estimated length of time requiredfor completing the sales of units in the âOriginal Schemeâ.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>Firstly, the Respondentâs counsel canvassed that the claim in truth purported to be for loss of profits but as there was no evidenceof anticipated or actual profits, there should be no compensation. We note that the wording of the definition of âdisturbance paymentâin Paragraph 2 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part I</a> of the Schedule to âthe Ordinanceâ does not contain the word âprofitâ or the term âloss of profitâ. The definition merelysays that âdisturbance paymentâ means a sum equal to the expenditure and loss of money actually and reasonably incurred or tobe reasonably incurred and arising from dispossession of land; and for disturbance of a trade or business on any land, the expenditureand loss of money actually and reasonably incurred or to be reasonably incurred and arising from the disturbance of that trade orbusiness. So all expenditure and/or loss of money as defined can be compensated under âthe Ordinanceâ. Furthermore, the amountof loss of sales proceeds must form a part of the loss of  profit or a part of the loss in the business of property development.We therefore rule that the loss of sales proceeds is eligible for a âdisturbance paymentâ under âthe Ordinanceâ.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Having been affected by the âTOAâ, the development (the âRevised Schemeâ) was eventually completed in 2001, with OccupationPermit (OP) issued on 31 January 2001 and Certificate of Compliance (CC) issued on 4 June 2001. The Applicant finally completed sellingall the units in the âRevised Schemeâ in May 2005 producing sales proceeds totaling $59,538,600.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>The Applicantâs expert estimated that had it not be for the âTOAâ, the âOriginal Schemeâ should have been completed at theend of 1999, with OP issued in January 2000 and CC issued on 31 March 2000. This means that he estimated the delay caused to theissue of OP to be12 months (from January 2000 to January 2001) and the delay of the issue of CC to be 14 months (from 31 March 2000to 4 June 2001). He further estimated that all the units in the âOriginal Schemeâ should have been sold within a period of 15months starting from the issue of CC for the âOriginal Schemeâ. By comparing with the sale prices in a medium-scale estate knownas Botania Villas completed in 1998 in the same area (Lam Tei), he valued the amount of total proceeds for the âOriginal Schemeâat $84,057,500. He then calculated the loss of sales proceeds at <b>$24,518,900</b> (i.e. estimated sales proceeds for the âOriginal Schemeâ $84,057,500 minus the actual sales proceeds from the âRevised Schemeâ$59,538,600).</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> The Respondentâs expert, while not disputing the 14 month delay period, he estimated June 2000 as the starting date for the saleperiod of the units in the âOriginal Schemeâ, 14 months before the date when the first unit of the âRevised Schemeâ was sold.He opined that the sale period for the âOriginal Schemeâ should be 47 months, that is the same as that for the âRevised Schemeâ.Applying reverse indices of 14 months backwards to the actual sale prices of units in the âRevised Schemeâ by reference to atable of indices entitled âIndex for Sale Prices of Selected Popular Developments in the New Territoriesâ published by the Ratingand Valuation Department, he estimated the total sale prices of the units in the âOriginal Schemeâ at $64,536,000 before arrivingat his calculation for the loss of sale proceeds at $4,979,000 (i.e. total estimated sale prices for the âOriginal Schemeâ of$64,536,000 minus the total actual sale prices for the âRevised Schemeâ of $59,539,000).</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> The difference in valuation between the experts is the result of the different bases they adopted in their valuations, namely (i)the different starting dates for the hypothetical sale of units in the âOriginal Schemeâ, (ii) the different time frames forthe sale period of the âOriginal Schemeâ and (iii) the different methods of valuation. It was the latter two that made a hugedifference in their valuations.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> The difference of 2 months for the starting dates of the sale of flats in the âOriginal Schemeâ is not much. There was littlechange in market value of these flats in a matter of 2 months. Having said that we still like to make a ruling on this point as theruling will make the assessment more definite and the same may affect the calculation of other losses.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> The Respondentâs expert in Paragraphs 11.1 to 11.5 of his report dated 23 June 2006 (see Hearing Bundle No.1, Pages 47-50) gavea full account of how the development had been affected by the âTOAâ resulting in a delay of 12 months for obtaining OP and 14months for obtaining CC. He justified with considerable detail that were it not for the âTOAâ, the âOriginal Schemeâ wouldhave been completed with OP and CC issued at the end of January and the end of March 2000 respectively. We note that the CC for theâRevised Schemeâ was issued on 4 June 2001.Working backwards to account for the delay of 14 months will mean that the estimateddate for the issue of CC for the âOriginal Schemeâ should be 4 April 2000. This supports the argument that the Applicant couldhave started selling the flats in the âOriginal Schemeâ in April 2000 after the issue of CC which is a prerequisite for startingthe sale of the flats under the Government lease conditions for the âSiteâ.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> In his closing submissions, the Defendantâs counsel submitted that the delay described in Paragraph 11.3 of the Respondentâsexpertâs report dated 23 June 2006 (see Hearing Bundle No.1, Page 47 and 48) relied on matters all of which stemmed from the KCRCworks, not the âTOAâ. He then worked out 19 August 2000 as the possible date for obtaining the CC for the âOriginal Schemeâ.He also pointed out that by 5 February 2001, the contractor, Hoo Cheong, was threatened with liquidated damages for late completion,thus the delay to completion of construction work was not because of âTOAâ but because of some default on the part of the contractor.We have examined the delays as described in the above-mentioned experts report and are satisfied that they are delays reasonablycaused by the âTOAâ. As for the possible delay of construction work by the contractor, the so called threats with deduction ofliquidated damages merely appeared as footnotes on Architectâs Certificate No.MC-8 (dated 5 February 2001), No.MC-9 (dated 2 April2001), No.M-C10 (dated 12 June 2001), No.MC-11 (dated 5 February 2002) and No. MC-12 (dated 17 May 2002)âsee Exhibit A5. The standardfootnotes on these certificates read: âThe certificate is issued without prejudice to the right of the Employer to claim futuredate, Liquidated and Ascertained damages for the non-completion of the works by the date for completionâ. We also note that theOP of the development was actually issued on 31 March 2001 while the above-mentioned footnotes only appeared on architectâs certificatesissued on or after 5 February 2001. We do not consider these standard footnotes give concrete evidence to prove that the delay wasbecause of some default on the part of the contractor. Considering all the evidence before us, including the agreement by the expertsof both parties of a 14-month delay caused to the development, we on balance rule that the CC for the âOriginal Schemeâ wouldhave been issued on 4 April 2000 and that the Applicant could have started selling the flats in the âOriginal Schemeâ in April2000.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Now we turn to the probable speed of sale for the âOriginal Schemeâ. It took the Applicant 47 months to finish selling all theflats of the âRevised Schemeâ. However, the Applicantâs expert opined that as the selling of flats in the âOriginal Schemeâcould have started in April 2000, the flats could have been sold much faster in view of the better economic conditions in 2000 ascompared with those in 2001. He compared the GDP growth rate, the unemployment rate and the Heng Seng Index figures for these twoyears to support his point. He further quoted 3 projects in Tuen Mun, Hung Shui Kiu and Yuen Long, first put up for sale in Februaryto May 2000, indicating that all the flats in these developments were either completely sold or mostly sold within periods of 4 to14 months ( see Hearing Bundle No.1, Page 68). As these projects were built by big developers (Cheung Kong, the Sino Group and theEmperor Group), he reckoned that it would take longer than 4 to14 months for a small developer as in the present case to disposeof the flats in the âOriginal Schemeâ and consequently arrived at a disposal period of 15 months.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> The Respondentâs expert regarded that while the 15-month sale period and sale prices assumed by the Applicant for the âOriginalSchemeâ was reasonable in the hypothetical situation, there seemed to be no reason to adopt a length of time any different fromthe actual 47 months spent for the disposal of the â Revised Schemeâ. Accordingly, he adopted the same length of time of 47 monthsfor the sale of the âOriginal Schemeâ in his valuations. In addition, he was of the opinion that secondary sales were a betterindicator of demand than the overall or primary sales as the primary market (new home sales) tended to be distorted by flat releasesand special marketing tactics in large developments. He produced a table (Hearing Bundle No.2, Page 122) showing the number of secondaryresidential sales in the New Territories over a 5-year period: 24,766 sales in Year 2000; 24,711 sales in Year 2001; 22,058 salesin Year 2002; 20,800 sales in Year 2003; and 33571 sales in Year 2004. This table, in our view, does provide a good indication ofthe level of activities in the residential sales market in those years and provides useful guidance for estimating the speed of saleof residential units in the New Territories in 2001 to 2004.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>We consider that it is more probable than not that the delay in the competition of the development would affect the speed of salein changing property market conditions. In the present case, the property market was falling and there was a definite fall in thenumber of sales in 2002 and 2003. It is therefore more probable that the sales of flats in the âOriginal Schemeâ would have beencompleted in a shorter period than the 47 months actually took place for the âRevised Schemeâ. The question is how much shorter.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The applicantâs expert relied on three developments with primary sales completed in 4 to 14 months to arrive at his estimate of15 months for completion of sales for the âOriginal Schemeâ, taking into consideration that those three developments could achievequicker sales as they were sold by big developers. We consider that this is unreliable and over simplified. Big developers have hugeresource of funds to embark on all sorts of vigorous and aggressive marketing campaigns including advertisements in all media. Itis extremely difficult and unreliable to estimate a reasonable sales period for the âOriginal Schemeâ in this way with limitednumber of comparables and information about them.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> In his second report dated 12 December, 2006(Hearing Bundle No.1, Page 94), relying on the information in the aforementioned tableâSecondary Residential Sales in the New Territoriesâ (the â NT Sales Tableâ) which indicated a relatively steady sales marketfrom April 2000 to September 2002, and by adopting the rate of sales achieved initially by the âRevised Schemeâ before the steadymarket ended, he illustrated that the âOriginal Schemeâ would have been fully sold by February 2002, that is 23 months from thestart of sales in April 2000. According to this illustration, the Applicantâs expert regarded that the disposal period for theâOriginal Schemeâ would at most be 23 months. We consider that this is a more reasonable and reliable approach although we notethat the Applicantâs expert still maintained that the âOriginal Schemeâ could have been fully sole in 15 months from the startof the sale in April 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> A table recording the actual sales of units in the âRevised Schemeâ (âRevised Scheme Sales Tableâ) produced by the Respondentâsexpert is found in Hearing Bundle No.2, Page 124. We observed that whilst the CC for the âRevised Schemeâ was issued on 4 June2001 when sales could start, the first unit was only sold on 1 August 2001. A 14-month delay of the project means that the CC forthe âOriginal Schemeâ would have been issued on 4 April 2000 and the first unit, on the same basis as for the âRevised Schemeâ,should be assumed to have been sold on 1 June 2000, not in April 2000 as suggested by the Applicantâs expert. Based on this observation,we have made an amendment to the Applicantâs expertâs calculations. Generally, we accept that the speed of sale achievable forthe period May 2000 to September 2002 as illustrated in the âNT Sales Tableâ should be more or less the same. For the initial14-month sales period (June 2000 to July 2001), we estimate the number of sales for the âOriginal Schemeâ at 27, which is thesame number achieved by the sale of the âRevised Schemeâ in its initial period of sale of 14 months starting from August 2001.Then by following the actual sale dates for the units in the âRevised Schemeâ which started in August 2001, we estimate thatthe remaining 17 units in the âOriginal Schemeâ could have been sold by May 2002, 26 months from the estimated date for the issueof CC in April 2000 or 24 months from the estimated date for the sale of the first unit on 1 June 2000. Whilst the estimate of thehypothetical sale period for the âOriginal Schemeâ is a difficult exercise, we consider that given all the available evidence,24 months from 1 June 2000 is the best estimate one can achieve. We therefore rule that for assessing the loss of sales proceedsand extra finance costs, the sales period for the units in the âOriginal Schemeâ are to be taken to be 24 months from June 2000to May 2002.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>We note that the Defendantâs expert queried the actual sales period of 47 months for the âRevised Schemeâ more severely thanhe queried the 15 months estimated for the âOriginal Schemeâ. He said in his second report dated 6 November 2006 (Hearing BundleNo.2, Page 108): âThe sale of units in the actual situation and the hypothetical situation could have been achieved in a much shorterperiod (even one or two months) if the pricing and marketing had been different.â and â In my view the Applicant could have soldthe units in less than 15 months commencing in 2000 or 2001 but he did not do so when commenced in 2001 and the limited differencein liquidity in the market (as shown by transactions) would indicate that the probability is that the sales would have taken on similartime frame if sales had commenced in 2000 or 2001.â However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Applicant deliberately heldup prices and unreasonably delayed the sales of the flats of the âRevised Schemeâ so as to inflate its loss and claim for morecompensation, bearing in mind that there was no benefit of hind sight when the Applicant decided to adopt its marketing and pricingstrategy. Although it is generally accepted that sales could have been sped up by reducing prices, but then what would be the rightamount of reduction without being queried at a later date? Who should make such pricing decision? Obviously, the Applicant made thedecision without the benefit of hind sight. There is no evidence to prove that the Applicant did not make an honest decision. Wetherefore decide that the actual 47-month sales period for the âRevised Schemeâ need not be changed.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> In valuing the units sold for the âOriginal Schemeâ, the Applicantâs expert made comparisons to the sales of units in BotaniaVillas, a medium-scale medium-size residential estate in Lam Tei, the same area in which the subject development Lingrade Gardenis situated, containing flats of sizes and prices similar to those of the flats in Lingrade Garden. He reported that he had madeadjustments for differences between the comparable development and the subject development in terms of location, view and type ofrecreational and other facilities provided but he did not disclose the details of such differences and adjustments. He adopted abroad brush approach by making comparison to the average prices of Botania Villas flats omitting prices which he thought were outof line without disclosing such omissions. He did not make adjustments to take account of different aspects (e.g. size, floor level,view, parking etc.) of individual flats. His explanation was that in valuing a group of flats by comparison with a group of comparables,the advantages and disadvantages of individual flats tended to even out. Finally, by adopting a spread of sales in the ratio of 70:20:10for the three 5-month periods of the total 15-month sale period justified by him, he calculated a weighted average unit rate of $31,940per square metre. Applying this unit rate to the total floor area, he arrived at his valuation of $84,059,500. However, in a muti-milliondollar claim such as this, a more detailed valuation is expected.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> Despite regarding that the use of Botania Villas as a comparable by the Applicantâs expert is not unreasonable, the Respondentâsexpert preferred the use of a reverse indexing method. He made use of the âIndex for Sale Price of Selected Popular Developmentsin the New Territoriesâ published by the Rating and Valuation Department to calculate reverse indexes to apply to the actual saleprices of flats in the âRevised Schemeâ, bringing the price level back 14 months to arrive at the estimated price level of salesfor the âOriginal Schemeâ to account for the 14-month delay caused by the âTOAâ, assuming that the sale period for the âOriginalSchemeâ was also 47 months, same as that for the âRevised Schemeâ. By this method, he calculated the total estimated salesproceeds for the âOriginal Schemeâ at $64,536,000 (Hearing Bundle No.2, Pages 123-125). He opined that using the actual saleprices for the âRevised Schemeâ as bases would eliminate the need for making adjustments for the advantages and disadvantagesfor each flat. We consider that this method can only provide rough valuations and should only be used when there are no sales evidenceof suitable comparable properties. Generally, whenever there are suitable and reliable comparables the Comparable Method is preferred.However, valuation by using an index can sometimes be used for making value adjustments for a time span which is not too long, thegreater the time span the less reliable would be the valuation. The expert for the</p>    <p>Applicant criticized that this index was not for a particular class of property. It was only a general index covering 8 large distractsin the whole of New Territories: Sha Tin, Tai Po, Fan Ling, Sheung Shui, Tsuen Wan, Kwai Chung, Tuen Man and Yuen Long. Moreover,it covered 3 ranges of flat sizesâType A (less than 40 sq. m.), Type B (40-69.9 sq. m.) and Type C (70-79.9 sq. m.).  Obviously,a more detailed valuation based on suitable comparables as opposed to the Applicantâs expertâs broad-brush approach is preferred.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>At the final submission stage, the Applicant applied for permission to submit a more detailed valuation at a later date showing clearlythe choice of comparables and valuation adjustments. As a more detailed valuation will greatly assist the Tribunal to arrive at afair assessment of the loss of sales proceeds as well as provide a fall back position for the Respondent to produce their valuationbased on comparables, we have granted the application to ensure fairness to both parties.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The hearing resumed in August 2008.  The parties produced a new bundle (the New Bundle) containing new valuation reports from theApplicantâs expert and the Respondentâs expert. Three additional exhibits A11 to A13 were also submitted by the Applicantâsexpert during the resumed hearing.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> The Applicantâs expert produced revised valuations for various estimated sales periods for the âOriginal Schemeâ based on detailedanalyses of sales of units in Lingrade Garden, the subject development, and in Botania Villa.  However, the Respondentâs expertdid not regard units in Botania Villa are good comparables and produced revised valuations based on sales of units in Kam Fung Gardenwhich is a New Territories village type house development in an nearby village area named Nai Wai.  The relative positions of LingradeGarden, Botania Villa and Kam Fung Garden are shown on page 173 of the New Bundle.  In the light of the substantial difference inopinion expressed by the experts the Tribunal carried out a site visit to the above-mentioned three developments on 26 August 2008in the presence of both parties.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> The Claimantâs expert carried out revised valuations in commendable details after considering all actual transaction informationin Lingrade Garden between July 2001 and May 2005 and those in Botania Villa between January 2000 and May 2005.  In a mass valuationexercise such as this involving 44 units, we accept the valuation method based on an average unit, (a bench mark unit) adopted bythe Applicantâs expert.  We find that the adjusted average unit prices for different months for units in Lingrade Garden are reasonableand can mostly be adopted for the assessment of sales proceeds for the âOriginal Schemeâ.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> The Applicantâs expertâs adjusted average unit prices for units within Botania are on the whole reasonable, although the adjustmentsfor mortgagee sales units and second sale units are a bit arbitrary.  The question is whether these adjusted average unit pricescan be adopted for the valuation of units in Lingrade Villa.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>The Applicantâs expert tried to relate the adjusted average unit prices of Botania Villa to those of Lingrade Villa as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="235" valign="top" class="quote"></td>                <td width="284" valign="top" class="quote">                    <div align="center">                        <strong>Valuation Adjustments on Botania Villa</strong>                    </div>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="235" valign="top" class="quote">Location</td>                <td width="284" valign="top" class="quote">                    <div align="center">                        +3%                    </div>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="235" valign="top" class="quote">Development Density/Design</td>                <td width="284" valign="top" class="quote">                    <div align="center">                        +10%                    </div>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="235" valign="top" class="quote">Facilities Provided</td>                <td width="284" valign="top" class="quote">                    <div align="center">                        -8%                    </div>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="235" valign="top" class="quote">Building Age &amp; Quality</td>                <td width="284" valign="top" class="quote">                    <div align="center">                        -3%                    </div>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="235" valign="top" class="quote">Building Management Services</td>                <td width="284" valign="top" class="quote">                    <div align="center">                        -2%                    </div>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="235" valign="top" class="quote">View</td>                <td width="284" valign="top" class="quote">                    <div align="center">                        0%                    </div>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="235" valign="top" class="quote">Resultant Adjustment</td>                <td width="284" valign="top" class="quote">                    <div align="center">                        0%                    </div>                </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>Whilst we accept that the suggestion of the Respondentâs expert witness of some -70% total adjustment is highly exaggerated, anyreasonable variation of the adjustment for location (no vehicular access as compared to close to public transport) to 0% and forDevelopment Density/Design to 5% or below would make the valuation significantly off the mark.  More importantly, we noticed fromthe site visit that Botania Garden is a completely different type of development with 9 blocks each of 11 storeys with a total of726 flats, 363 carparks and numerous residentâs amenities.  It is built to a standard much higher than that of Lingrade Gardenwhich comprises eight 3-storey blocks providing 44 units with limited amenities, without vehicular access but close to public transport. With the benefit of site visit we are convinced that a valuation by comparing Lingrade Garden and Botania Villa is not comparinglike with like.  In our view, therefore, the sales in Botania  Villa cannot be accepted as suitable comparables and should be discarded.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> The Respondentâs expert produced revised valuations based on sales of units in Kam Fung Garden.  Again, with the benefit of sitevisit, we noted that it is an average New Territories village type house development in the middle of a village environment withno amenities and built to a quality significantly inferior to that of Lingrade Garden.  Its access from Castle Peak Road is througha lengthy village road which makes pedestrian access very difficult.  We consider that Kam Fung Garden is not a suitable comparablefor the valuation of units in Lingrade Garden.  Furthermore, we agree with the Applicant counselâs closing statement âHis methodologyinvolves applying the R &amp; V Index to produce prices for those months where there were no transactions.  But by constantly switchingthe base figure every time where a new comparable arises, he comes up with a set of adjusted value which totally does not tally withthe trend of the R &amp; V index which he relies so heavily on.  It is submitted that Pendletonâs methodology is wrong, hence hisfinal adjusted values cannot be relied upon.â</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>As sales in both Botania Villa and Kam Fung Garden are not regarded as suitable comparables, we may only resort to the remaining availableevidence which is sales in Lingrade Garden and the Rating and Valuation Department Index for the estimate of sales proceeds for theâOriginal Schemeâ.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Now that we have made a decision that the sale period for the âOriginal Schemeâ is estimated to be 24 months from June 2000 toMay 2002 with 27 units to have been sold from June 2000 to July 2001 and the remaining 17 units to have been sold from August 2001to May 2002.  We consider that in the absence of  exact evidence it is reasonable to assume that during the first period (June 2000to July 2001) units would have been sold at a more or less even rate.  For the sale of units during the second period (August 2001to May 2002), we decide to adopt the actual sale dates of the âRevised Schemeâ with actual sales starting from August 2001 (seeBundle 2, page 124 and 125).

relying on the R &amp; V Index and using the August 2001 figure as base.</p>    <p>The estimated total loss of sales proceeds for the delay in completion of the development Lingrade Garden will be the difference betweenthe estimated total sales proceeds for the âOriginal Schemeâ ($69,727,637) and the actual total sales proceeds for the âRevisedSchemeâ ($59,538,600) which is $10,189,037, say $10,200,000.  We therefore determine the loss of sales proceeds caused by suchdelay at $10,200,000.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> In the premises, the loss stood as at 4 June 2001 has been mitigated and reduced and we determine that estimated loss of sale proceedsto be 10.2 million.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Head E</b><b>- Extra Finance Costs</b></p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> It is the Applicantâs case that the Applicant financed part of the development project from banks. The delay of the completionof the project by the âTOAâ caused additional interest payments for bank loans. Against the background of falling property marketconditions the delay decreased the amount of sales proceeds as well as prolonged the sales period and all these caused increasesin interest payments because of the delay in the repayment of bank loans. In addition, the âTOAâ entailed the modification ofthe project and additional items of development cost, which are also additional items of claim, necessitating additional bank loansand interest payments.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> The Applicantâs expert produced 5 schedules of interest calculations (Hearing Bundle No.2, Pages 261-276). Schedules 1, 2 and 3,relating to the âRevised Schemeâ, showed interest calculations for development costs of the project under 3 separate bank accountsat different rates of interest charges. Schedule 4, also relating to the âRevised Schemeâ, indicated interest charge calculationsfor additional items of development expenses that were drawn from a separate overdraft account bearing rates of interest differentfrom those charged under the 3 bank accounts earlier mentioned. Whenever there were cash inflows from the project, e.g. sales proceedsand provisional compensation payments from Government, they were credited to the bank accounts to reduce the amount of outstandingloan and interest charges. The interest charges shown in Schedules 1-4 added up to the total interest charges for the developmentexpenses for the âRevised Schemeâ.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> The Applicantâs expert also produced a Schedule 5 which contained estimated development expenses and interest charges for the âOriginalSchemeâ. Again the estimated sales proceeds, based on an estimated sales period of 15 months at his own valuation, were creditedback to set off the amount of the estimated outstanding loan and reduce the amount of estimated interest charges. The estimated interestcharges in Schedule 5 added up to the total estimated interest charges for the âOriginal Schemeâ. The claim under this Head isthe difference in total interest charges between the âRevised Schemeâ and the âOriginal Schemeâ, i.e. the sum of interestcharges shown in Schedules 1 to 4 minus the total interest charges shown in Schedule 5.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> During the hearing, the Applicantâs expert produced a schedule (Exhibit A5) containing development expenditure items tallying withdevelopment expenses of the âRevised Schemeâ shown in schedules 2 to 4. After much examination and cross-examination, we wereable to follow all the schedules (i.e. Schedules 1 to 5 and Exhibit 5) though not without difficulties.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67</a> As a fallback position in case the Tribunal considered that the Applicant was entitled to compensation under this Head, the Respondentâsexpert worked out a much lower figure for extra interest costs (Exhibit R3). He adopted the Applicantâs expertâs Schedules 1to 3. For extra development items, he substituted the Applicantâs expertâs Schedule 4 with a ânew Schedule 4â (Appendix lato Exhibit R3) omitting items he regarded as not claimable and making adjustments to items he regarded as only partly claimable.For estimated development costs and interest charges for the âOriginal Schemeâ, he substituted the Applicantâs expertâs Schedule5 with a new âSchedule 5â (Appendix ll to Exhibit R3) based on a sales period of 47 months and using his lower valuation forthe sales proceeds. He then added up the interest charges for Schedules 1 to 3 and the ânew Schedule 4â to arrive at the totalinterest charges for development expenses for the âRevised Schemeâ. From this sum he deducted his estimated interest chargeson estimated development costs in respect of the âOriginal Schemeâ (the ânew Schedule 5â) to come to a much lower figureof $835,171.54 for extra finance costs.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> It is noted that the methods of calculation adopted by both experts wire very similar. Their difference was attributable to theirdifferent assumptions for (a) the claimable heads and the amounts of claims to which the Applicant was entitled under the variousheads of claim, (b) the estimated length of the sales period for the âOriginal Schemeâ and (c) the valuation of the sales proceedsfor the âOriginal Schemeâ. We have already made decisions on (a) and (b) under various heads of claim (Heads A to D) but stillhave to make a decision on (c) after considering further evidence and submissions to be submitted by the parties. After we have madea decision on (c), the parties should be able to agree on the calculations for extra finance costs, failing which they may applyto this Tribunal for a decision.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> The Respondentâs counsel argued that the claim should fail on grounds that (i) the amount of claim could not be ascertained and(ii) an expert witness could not give hearsay evidence as to the facts of transactions which lie outside his personal knowledge.He referred us to <i>Tate &amp; Lyle v GLC</i> [1982] 1WLR 149 to support his first ground of argument and to <i>English Exporters v Eldonwall</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%201%20Ch%20415" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] 1 Ch 415</a> to support his second ground. We have looked at these decided cases. In the first case, the claim for managerial and supervisoryexpenses failed because the plaintiffs had kept no records of the time expended on such work and hence such expenses could not bequantified either in cash or as a percentage of the damages awarded.. We consider that the facts in the present case are differentfrom those in the cited case. In the present case there are records based on which interest expenses could be calculated. It is thereforeour view that the authority does not lend any weight to the Defendantâs counselâs argument. The second cited case contained a<i>per curiam</i> that a valuation expert could not give hearsay evidence as to the facts of transactions which lied outside his personal knowledge.However, we agree with the Applicantâs counselâs submission that by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/17/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10(6)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/17" class="autolink_findacts">Lands Tribunal Ordinance</a> (together with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a>), all hearsay evidence is admissible in this court. The Respondentâs counsel pointed out that there were neither an accountingexpert nor any Applicantâs accounting staff was called to give evidence and that the schedules showing interest calculations weregiven to the Applicantâs expert by a junior employee of the Applicant and the Applicantâs expert merely told the Tribunal whathe had been told by the Applicantâs staff. However, we consider that this alone does not render the evidence inadmissible.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> With the evidence before us and the expertise we have in this Tribunal, we are convinced that in a case such as the present one,where development had to be modified and consequently delayed against the background of a falling property market, there would oftenbe an increase of development expenses and decrease in sales proceeds, which would in turn increase the amount of interest charges.The only question is how much. Now that experts of both parties adopted a similar method in calculating the extra finance costs basedon similar schedules showing interest charges, the amount of extra finance costs can be calculated without much complication in accordancewith this Tribunalâs decisions under Heads A to D in previous paragraphs, after a decision is made by the Tribunal at a later dateon the valuation of the sale proceeds for the âOriginal Schemeâ. We now determine to award the claim for extra finance coststo be calculated in compliance with this Tribunalâs decisions as just said. We hereby ask the parties to come up with an agreedcalculation on the amount of extra finance costs after such later date, failing which parties may apply to this Tribunal for a decision.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Both experts calculated the extra finance costs on a cash flow bases for the whole development project. However we feel it is relevantto point out here that the additional items of development costs which are also additional items of claim, even if considered alone,should by themselves entitle the Applicant to the claim for interest costs.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> The Ordinance specifies clearly the procedure of claim.  Procedure for submitting claim to the Government and for settlement betweenthe parties are laid down in the Ordinance. The function of this Tribunal is to determine residual dispute between the Governmentand the Applicant.  What has been submitted to the Government and what items have been submitted before commencement of proceedingsin this Tribunal is helpful especially when is not set out in the pleadings.  In this particular case, we can only guess from theglimpses of comment on the claim contained in the Governmentâs expert report. We do not have the complete picture of the historyof dispute. Therefore we may not be able to fully grasp the weight of argument of the Applicant.  We must mention by passing thatwe failed to understand and would not guess at present what is the difficulty of producing some documents evidencing actual paymentof interest. Some thing in the nature of certificate of payment of interest and bank statements would dispose of the lack of evidencepoint.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Costs</b></p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> Order for costs is reserved.</p>    <p>   </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" height="17">(H.
