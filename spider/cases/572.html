I now give reasons.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The plaintiff, which has its offices in Tsim Sha Tsui is a trading company in the paper products business.  It is owned by a familynamed Ho, through a company named Man Sang Envelope Co. Ltd (âMan Sangâ).  The plaintiffâs shareholders and directors wereMs Chin Kuk Hung, Daisy, and the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant who held their shares on trust for Man Sang.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant had been recruited some time in 2002 to be, he says, the public face of the plaintiff; he had been working in the paperproducts business for many years.  He started work for the plaintiff in early 2003.  He resigned with effect from 30 June 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was the plaintiffâs sales manager.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant recruited him in late 2003.  Before that, he had been working for another company in the same line of business.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was incorporated on 19 April 2005.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is its only shareholder and director.  It has its registered office in San Po Kong. </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> According to Ms Chin, in early May 2005 it was found that there was a problem with the quality checking of products to be shippedto a customer, William E. Connor and Associates Ltd (âWECAâ).  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant told Ms Chin that he would follow the matter up but if the problem could not be resolved, WECA might cancel its orders. Ms Chin later discovered by chance from the shipping company that the products had been shipped but that that company had been toldthat she was no longer working for the plaintiff.  She contacted the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant who told her that he had set up the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and delivered the products to WECA in its name.  He asked her to amend a letter of credit issued by WECA in favour of theplaintiff so as to cancel it, but she refused.  Then she met with representatives of WECA and was told that it had received a letterfrom the plaintiff to the effect that it had been restructured and its name changed to âSencon (Holdings) Ltdâ, and so WECA hadtransferred all its business to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The plaintiff put the matter in the hands of its solicitors, who advised WECA that there had been no re-organisation, and it hadbeen deceived.  Following a meeting on 15 June between WECA, Ms Chin and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant confirmed to WECA that payment for goods shipped to it in the name of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant should be made to the solicitors, on trust, and that outstanding orders would be met by the plaintiff.  The parties thenhad a meeting at which the plaintiff attempted to obtain the defendantsâ consent <i>inter alia</i> to provide a full account of business taken away and a refund of the profits, to de-register the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and restore all business to the plaintiff.  No agreement could be reached.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> At this stage, it appears, the involvement of the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant was not known to Ms Chin.  He had tendered his resignation to take effect from 30 June 2005.  When he left, it was foundthat most of the e-mails had been deleted from his computer.  Also e-mails on a computer used by a former employee, Raymond TsangWai Tong had been deleted.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> On 6 July 2005 the plaintiffâs solicitors received a letter sent from WECAâs solicitors to the solicitors acting for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants.  This enclosed the letter from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant dated 4 May 2005, which had been referred to by WECAâs representatives in their meetings with Ms Chin, but which shehad not yet seen.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> This letter is on headed notepaper bearing the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs name along with the same logo as that used by the plaintiff and it is to the effect that :</p>    <blockquote>		<table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">âour 				companyâ has been re-organised;</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the name of 				âour companyâ has been changed to Sencon (Holdings) Ltd;</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c) </td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the address 				has been changed to that of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs registered office;</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(d)</td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the 				telephone and fax numbers and the bank have also been changed;</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(e)</td>			<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the support 			team of Tic (the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant), Ronald and Raymond (existing employees of the plaintiff ) would still be provided; and</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>			<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(f)</td>			<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">all the jobs 			handled by Daisy (Ms Chin) would be handled by a new member, Mr Nic Wong.</td>		</tr>	</table></blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The letter is chopped with the chop of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and signed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as director.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Realising the involvement of the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, Ms Chin then put further inquiries in train, including the use of a computer expert to retrieve deleted e-mails.  Accordingto her it was discovered that a customer had cancelled various purchase orders placed with the plaintiff and dealt with by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant had asked another customer to settle further invoices to the bank account of âNew Senconâ.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Further investigations were carried out, and application was made for the <i>ex parte</i> order and <i>Anton Piller</i> order.  When the latter was executed, documents came to light in the possession of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant which appear to show that purchase orders apparently cancelled by one Concept Merchandiser Ltd (âCMLâ) in June 2005had simply been transferred to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  The retrieved e-mails appear to show a pattern of communications between the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant and this company, from about 11 May 2005 arranging for the diversion of its business to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  E-mails also appear to show the diversion of the business of a company named Form+pac from the plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant from April 2005.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was found to have a customer list, of which all the customers except one were those of the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> In his affirmation the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant says that he was recruited by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant to work for the plaintiff as a commission agent.  He brought in the business of various of his existing customers; in otherwords, they followed him from his previous employer.  He looked after their orders with the assistance of the plaintiffâs employees,Raymond Tsang Wai Tong and Ronald Chan Hoi Kit.  Later, his relationship with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant deteriorated.  There were problems with the quality of goods ordered from the plaintiffâs designated supplier so the2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant decided to change the supplier.  However, the original supplier was associated with the Ho family and the change provokedanimosity on their part.  The relationship had broken down by March 2005, and in April 2005 the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant accepted the termination of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs sales agency with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, although it was agreed that he would complete the existing orders on his account by the end of the month. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant says that he decided to set up a new company for his business.  He decided to use the name of âSencon (Holdings) Ltdâbecause WECAâs complicated audit checking process necessitated it, and indeed some staff in WECA suggested this course to him. He says he did this without legal advice and did not intend to pass off the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs services as those of the plaintiff.  In any event, he says, the services he and the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant provided were personal to the customers they had brought in, and any goodwill attached to the defendants and not the plaintiff. Nor did he intend, in his letter of 4 May, which was sent to other customers as well as WECA, to say that the plaintiff had beenre-organised.  His English failed him in properly expressing himself.  What he intended was that he would follow up orders placedwith the plaintiff, and make sure that they were fulfilled, but that if the customers wanted to give him their future business, hewould be happy to oblige them. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant also says that he brought business with him when he was recruited.  He gives much the same account of the deteriorationin the relationship with his employer as does the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  He says that because of this he also decided to resign, and he agreed to join the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in his new business after he had sorted out all the existing business he had with the plaintiff.  He too did not intendto solicit away the existing orders the customers had placed with the plaintiff but would follow them through.  If the customerswould give him their new business, he would take it.  In fact CML decided on its own to cancel orders placed with the plaintiff andtransfer the business to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> It is not in dispute that the employees, Raymond Tsang Wai Tong and Ronald Chan Hoi Kit resigned from the plaintiff in May 2005 andwent to work for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  They say that they were not solicited but went of their own accord. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In any event, there are no contractual provisions between the plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants or the other employees restraining them from competition after termination of employment. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> It is not in dispute that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs customer list consisted of 12 customers.  The plaintiff had no such list.  Of those 12 customers, all but one werebrought in by the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants; one was new.  Of the 11 customers so brought in, all but two had been customers of the 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant in his previous employment.  The other two were introduced to the 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant by their other long term customers.  There was no communication between the plaintiff and either defendant about the customers.</p>    <p class="heading">The plaintiffâs claim</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The Statement of Claim has not yet been filed but counsel advises that the plaintiffâs claims will be that in addition to fraudulentconduct by each or all of the defendants, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants are in breach of their duty of good faith, confidence and fidelity to the plaintiff, in that they or both of them removedclient data and set up a business, not just in competition with the plaintiff but fraudulently and dishonestly to take away its business,and they continued to use information from the plaintiff to carry on such business after leaving the plaintiff. </p>    <p class="heading">Injunction</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The principles are set out in the leading case of <i>American Cyanamid Co. v</i><i>. Ethicon Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 396</a>, expanded in <i>Fellowes &amp; Son v</i><i>. Fisher</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20AC%20122" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] AC 122.</a>  In the first place, the plaintiffâs claim must not be frivolous or vexatious and there must be a serious question to be tried. Then the court should first consider whether if the plaintiff succeeds at trial he would be adequately compensated by damages forany loss caused by the refusal to grant an interlocutory injunction.  If damages would be an adequate remedy, and the defendant wouldbe in a position to pay them, no injunction should be granted.  If damages would not be an adequate remedy, the court should considerwhether, if the injunction were granted, the defendant would be adequately compensated by the plaintiffâs undertaking as to damages. If so, and the plaintiff would be in a position to pay them, there would be no ground to refuse the injunction.  It is where thereis doubt as to the adequacy of the respective remedies in damages that the question of balance of convenience arises.  Where othermatters are evenly balanced it is prudent to preserve the <i>status quo</i>.  The extent to which the disadvantages to each party would be incapable of being compensated if he succeeds at the trial is a significantfactor in assessing where the balance of compensation lies.</p>    <p class="heading">Serious question to be tried</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> I approach this in three parts; on the claims for injunction against passing off, injunction against what I will call, for the sakeof simplicity, âpoachingâ the plaintiffâs customers, and injunction against poaching the plaintiffâs staff. </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> As to passing off, this requires the plaintiff to show some goodwill or reputation attaching to its goods or services in the mindof the purchasing public; misrepresentation by the defendant leading the public to believe that the goods or services offered byhim are those of the plaintiff; and damage suffered thereby.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> There is ample evidence of misrepresentation here, as well as evidence of damage.  The defendants do not deny that there is a seriousquestion to be tried as to the use of the plaintiffâs name and logo by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant; and they offered an undertaking not to do so in future.  But they do not accept that there is a serious question to betried on passing off.  They say that in this case the goodwill attached, not to the plaintiff, but to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants who had brought in almost all of the customers. </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> It is true that some of the customers have since the institution of proceedings sent e-mails to the effect that they did businessbecause of confidence in one or other of the 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant.  CML says so in terms.  Unity Merchandise Co. says it is happy to continue its relationship with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  Three others simply confirm a previous relationship with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  WECA however clearly intended to deal with the plaintiff, even if it had dealt with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant before.  There is no evidence as to whether the goodwill in respect of the other customers attached to the plaintiff orone or other of the defendants.  In fact these customers had all been doing business with the plaintiff since, at the latest, theend of 2003 when the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant brought his customers with him.  I do not see how, in the circumstances, there could be no serious question to be triedon passing off, as against all three defendants because the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant could only act through the other two.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> As to the poaching of customers, the defendants argue that the injunction sought is in restraint of trade.  There was no contractualprovision between the plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants in restraint of trade.  They are no longer employed by the plaintiff so any implied term as to the duty of fidelity tothe plaintiff no longer exists.  There is no property in customers.  A former employee can solicit them.  The only way the employeecan be prevented, absent a binding restrictive covenant, is where there is breach of a duty of confidence recognised by common law. Reference is made to <i>Coco v</i><i>. Clark</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%20RPC%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] RPC 41</a> where Megarry J (as he then was) set out the essential elements for an action for breach of confidence.  In employment cases, inorder to restrain an ex-employee from using confidential information, the information must not be merely confidential but must amountto a trade secret, or of such a high degree of confidentiality as to be equivalent to a trade secret; <i>Faccenda Chicken Ltd v. Fowler</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20Ch%20117" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 Ch 117.</a> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Here, say the defendants, there was nothing confidential.  The information about the customers was not a trade secret or equivalentto a trade secret.  It was not confidential.  It was not the plaintiffâs information; it was not communicated to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants in the course of their employment; rather they had it already.  So even if the information was confidential while the2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants were working with the plaintiff it would not qualify for protection once they left.  Therefore, it would be unjust torestrain the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants (and hence the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant) from using this information.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> There is no dispute that, in the course of employment, (which I take to include agency or directorship) the employee (whom I taketo include an agent or director) owes a duty of fidelity, whether express or employed, to the director; and this duty would precludehis using information belonging to the employer to the employerâs detriment.  This means that he cannot set up in competition andpoach the customers while he is still in the same relationship.  He cannot do that, even if the customers are already known to himfrom before he took up the employment.  Once he comes in, the information about them which he brings effectively belongs to the employer,while he is working for the employer.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Equally, I do not see that there is any dispute that, absent an enforceable covenant in restraint of trade, the employee may setup in competition once he has left.  He can solicit and do business with customers whom he has come to know in the course of hisemployment, and whom he later remembers, as well as those he knew already.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> This means that if the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants had left the plaintiff and set up on their own account, or through a company which was clearly different from the plaintiff,to try to trade with the same customers as before, but openly and above board, the plaintiff could have had no claim against them.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> However, where has been some breach of the duty of fidelity in the course of the employment, such as by the copying or deliberatememorising of customer information, the position is different.  The former employee may be prohibited from using that informationin competition with the former employer.  See <i>Robb v</i><i>. Green</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1895%5d%202%20QB%20315" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1895] 2 QB 315</a> and <i>Wessex Dairies Ltd v</i><i>. Smith</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1935%5d%202%20KB%2080" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1935] 2 KB 80.</a></p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The point is that this is not a case of the innocent use by a former employee of information which, while confidential as betweenhim and his employer in the course of employment, cannot be regarded as such once the employment terminates.  Here the evidence pointsto breach of duty of fidelity in that the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants while in employment conspired, probably with their colleagues who later went to work with them, to divert the plaintiffâscustomers to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  They did this while the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant was still a director.  Although the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant says that he had told the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant that he was leaving, he does not appear to have made this known to anyone else; according to Daisy Chin, he was still workingwith the plaintiff at least up to the time the problem with WECA came to light, and thereafter he simply disappeared.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> If that is what happened, it means that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was conceived in fraud and received the information belonging to the plaintiff, as a result of the breach of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendantsâ duty to the plaintiff.  It must have known, for its <i>alter ego</i> was the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, of the breach of duty.  It could not be regarded as an innocent recipient of the information.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> As to the other employees, if there was such a conspiracy it would mean that the 2<sup>nd</sup> and/or 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants had committed the tort of interfering with the contracts between the plaintiff and those other employees; no matter howwell this was covered by the apparently innocuous resignations on their part.  Again, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would have taken on the employees in the knowledge of such tort.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> There is obviously a serious question to be tried, on the question of a permanent injunction against passing off, poaching customersand poaching employees as against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  As against the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants, the position is perhaps less clear but I think there would be grounds for restraining them at least for a period frombenefiting from the âspringboard effectâ of their breach of duty to the plaintiff.  The question of âspringboard effectâwas not specifically argued, nor was a fixed period of injunction, rather than injunction until further order suggested, but theconcept is referred to in some of the cases cited, and the plaintiffâs claim in the writ is for injunctions for a two-year period.</p>    <p class="heading">Damages as an adequate remedy</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> If damages would be an adequate remedy, and the defendant would be in a position to pay them, no injunction should be granted.  Ifthe defendants were permitted to go on dealing with the plaintiffâs customers by passing off the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as the plaintiff, and the plaintiffâs former âteamâ of customer support personnel including the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant as still working for the plaintiff, then obviously damages would not be an adequate remedy.  In any event, it is unlikelythat the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant could pay damages.  As to whether damages would be an adequate remedy against the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants, I think it probably would be, because given that they cannot be restrained from approaching the customers or employingthe employees honestly and above board once the employment has ceased, the only damages obtainable would be for the breach of dutywhile in employment. </p>    <p class="heading">Balance of convenience</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> If the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is allowed to continue to do the acts complained of, there will obviously be continuing losses to the plaintiff broughtabout as a result of fraud and misrepresentation.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> It is said that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant cannot fulfil existing orders (not placed with the plaintiff before) from the customers, which will damage its reputationand goodwill with customers beyond repair.  Since it has just commenced business this is a crucial period for it to get on its feet. The continuation of the injunctions will be a commercial death warrant.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> I do not see why the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant should have any reputation and goodwill at the expense of the plaintiff, given that on the evidence it appears to havebeen conceived in fraud against the plaintiff; and in any event, if, as is argued for the defendants, the customersâ goodwill attachesto the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiffs, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has no goodwill anyway. </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> There is no question that the balance of convenience and justice is in favour of the plaintiff as against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> If I am wrong and damages are not an adequate remedy against the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants, it is necessary to consider balance of convenience as between them and the plaintiff.  The object of injunction is notto punish; no doubt that can be achieved by damages and costs at trial.  Given that there is no objection to their honestly settingup on their own, either on their own account or through a legitimate company, to trade with those customers who will follow themand employing the same employees to do so, I think it would be wrong to restrain them from those acts.  They would suffer considerablehardship and loss of livelihood. </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> For these reasons I continued the injunctions against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant but discharged them against the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants.</p>	<p> </p>	<p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">		<tr>			<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>			<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(G.P.
