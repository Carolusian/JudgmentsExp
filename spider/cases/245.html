The Bus was travelling along the 2<sup>nd</sup> lane of Sha Tsui Road, Tsuen Wan, New Territories towards Tsuen Wan Pier.  A light goods vehicle with registration number FH 2696(âthe LGVâ) driven by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant (âD2â) was travelling along the 1<sup>st</sup> lane of the Road towards the same direction.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  When the Bus reached near lamppost FA1768, Bosun Industrial Building, 364-366 Sha Tsui Road, the Plaintiff left her seat and proceededtowards the stairs leading to the exit downstairs, and was standing on the upper deck and holding the handrail with both hands, theLGV suddenly cut into the Busâs lane causing the Bus to brake sharply to avoid a collision. As a result of such a sudden brake,the Plaintiff lost her balance and was thrown into the front part of the Bus and sustained injuries to her head, shoulder and wrists(âthe Accidentâ).</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant (âD1â) was the registered owner of the LGV. D1 was and is a main contractor employed by the Government of HKSAR viaHighways Department under a Contract no.19/HY/2004 (âthe Main Contractâ) to carry out maintenance works in New Territories. Onthe day of the Accident, D2 was driving the LGV on the way back to a site at Tai Lin Pei owned by D1 (âthe Siteâ).</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Plaintiff originally sued D1 and D2 as the registered owner and driver of the LGV. The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant (âD3â) and the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant (âD4â) were joined as Defendants after D1 issued Third Party Proceedings against them, claiming contribution and/orindemnity from D3 and/or D4 pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Liability (Contribution) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377">Cap. 377</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  D1 also issued Notice to D2 claiming contribution from D2.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  D2 has issued Notice of Contribution and/or Indemnity against D1, D3 and D4 pursuant to O.16, r.8 of the Rules of the District Court.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  D3 was and is a subcontractor to D1 under a Sub-Contract No.SC-038 (âthe Subcontractâ) to the Main Contract. D4was the subcontractorof D3. D1 and D2 state that the D2 was the employee of D4. D4 admitted it was the employer of D2.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Plaintiffâs case is that the Accident was caused by the negligence of D2 for which D1, D3 and/or D4 were vicariously liable.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  As a result of the Accident, D2 was charged with and convicted of careless driving.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  D2 has, before trial, admitted liability. D2 maintains the defence of contributory negligence and also alleges the other Defendantsare vicariously liable for his negligence. D2 admitted to be D4âs employee.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  D4, before its solicitors ceased to act, has admitted liability on 20 October 2011.

D4 thus admits to the Plaintiffâs allegation that it was vicariously liablefor D2âs negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In light of the above, the issues for this trial can be narrowed down as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) whether D1 and/or D3 are vicariously liable for D2âs negligence;</p>        <p>(b) whether there was contributory negligence on the part of the Plaintiff;</p>        <p>(c) question of contribution and/or indemnity amongst the Defendants.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiffâs Case against D1</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  It is common ground that D1 was the registered owner of the LGV at the material time.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In the Re-Amended Statement of Claim, it is pleaded that D2 was the driver of the LGV and was driving the same as the servant/agent/employeeof D1.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  As the registered owner of the LGV, Mr. Wong submits that D1 is prima facie vicariously liable for the negligent acts of D2.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  However, for vicarious liability to attach, it must normally be established that the driver of the vehicle was driving it as theservant or agent of the owner. </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr. Wong refers to <b><i>Rambarran v.

Whilst in absence of other evidence, an inference can be drawnfrom ownership that the driver was the servant or agent of the owner; this inference can nevertheless be rebutted should there beevidence that the owner had merely given his permission to another to use the vehicle for his own purposes.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Mr. Wong submits D1 should be held vicariously liable for D2âs negligence, as D2 was its employee or agent.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiffâs Case against D3</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Pursuant to the terms of the Subcontract, D3 have purchased plant and equipment, including the LGV, from D1 before the Accident.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  At the time of Accident, D3 has already taken delivery of the LGV and was in possession, control and management of the LGV.  Thelegal ownership of the LGV was with D1 until D3 fully paid the purchase price by instalment. </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mr. Wong submits that D3 had an interest in the trip, and that D3 had control of the LGV and allowed D2 to drive.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  D3 should therefore be vicariously liable for D2âs negligence.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>D1âs Case</u></p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  D1 denies that D2 at the time of the Accident was its employee nor its agent.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  It is further contended that D1 was not vicariously liable.

On the day of the Accident, D2 was asked to transport equipment and workersto carry out maintenance work at various sites under the Subcontract.

He supports his opinion with the medical report of Dr.Ng Ming Shing  stating that by 28 March 2009 the Plaintiff only had residual mild pain with improved range of movement.  The shoulderwas non-tender.  The Plaintiff also expressed that she wished to resume work in view of the recovery and planned to return to workfrom 1 April 2009.  The Plaintiff defaulted physiotherapy after March 2009 which confirmed that her shoulder condition had well recoveredat that time. </p>    <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a>  Dr. Ko on the other hand opines that it develops into frozen shoulder resulting in pain, stiffness and weakness which needs a relativelylong period for recovery (varies from 6 months up to 18 months).</p>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  Dr. Ko does not agree that the Plaintiff defaulted from physiotherapy after March 2009 could confirm that her shoulder conditionhad well recovered.  From the physiotherapy report, it is noteworthy that at the latest assessment, the range of motion of both shoulderswas still limited and not yet fully recovered.</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  Regarding the wrist pain, Dr. Fu remarked that the Plaintiff had not reported any wrist pain after the day of injury, which reflectsthat any wrist injury should be mild and should have well recovered after a few days of rest.  During examination there was no abnormalitydetected except the reported pain and tenderness over the wrist region.</p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  Both doctors agree that treatment received so far is appropriate and the Plaintiff does not need further treatment in view of hercurrent condition.</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  Dr. Ko opines the prognosis for the soft tissue injury involving the Plaintiffâs left shoulder and both wrists should be satisfactoryin the long run.  Based on the present condition and also the physical findings in the joint assessment, the Plaintiff may have furtherimprovement in the range of motion of her left shoulder with appropriate conservative treatment and continue to have self-mobilizationexercise. </p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  With regular stretching and strengthening exercises, Dr. Ko believes that the Plaintiff should have further improvement althoughshe may not be able to have full recovery of the range of motion of the shoulders and the strength of the wrists. Dr. Fu opines thatthe prognosis for this kind of mild soft tissue injury is good.  With regular stretching and strengthening exercise, the Plaintiffshould regain her normal range of movement and power.  She should recover will with minimal residual impairment.</p>    <p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a>  Dr. Fu opines that the Plaintiffâs original work did not require heavy manual lifting.  In view of her current condition she shouldbe able to return to her original work as cleansing worker.  Her efficiency will be decreased in the first few months as she hasnot worked for so long and has de-conditioned.  However, with further exercise and training she should be able to return to her originalworking capacity with minimal impairment.</p>    <p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a>  Dr. Ko opines that the Plaintiffâs original duty as a cleaning worker and cook in an old aged home does not require heavy manualwork.  However, this kind of job requires the worker to have repetitive, stereotyped work with the same tasks repetitively throughoutthe working hours.  This is the exact situation which precipitates attacks of the wrist tendinitis as well as her shoulder pain. The Plaintiffâs work efficiency and effectiveness will be affected in a mild to moderate degree.  In fact, the Plaintiff statedthat she had tried to resume work on 1 April 2009 but found herself unable to cope with the job demand after half day of work dueto her wrists and shoulder pain.</p>    <p><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a>  Dr. Ko recommends that the Plaintiff consider changing to other jobs that requires less physical demand and decreased requirementof repetitive, stereotyped work in her job task including cashier at shroff, storekeeper, worker at gas petrol station, securityguard, etc.</p>    <p><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a>  Dr. Ko opines that sick leave period up to 1 year is considered to be appropriate and reasonable for treatment and investigationof the Plaintiffâs multiple injuries involving her wrists and also left shoulder.</p>    <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a>  Dr. Fu opines that the sick leave from the day of injury to 31 March 2009 should be appropriate.</p>    <p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a>  Dr. Fu opines that the Plaintiffâs total impairment of whole person and loss of earning capacity as a result of the Accident shouldboth be 1%.</p>    <p><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a>  Dr. Ko recommends that for the left shoulder residual pain, stiffness and weakness to have 5% upper extremity impairment which isequivalent to 3% whole person impairment.  Dr. Ko recommends 1% whole person impairment for the Plaintiffâs bilateral wrist painand weakness.  Therefore the total whole person impairment should be 4%.</p>    <p class="heading">PSLA</p>    <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  The Plaintiff claims a sum of $230,000.00.
