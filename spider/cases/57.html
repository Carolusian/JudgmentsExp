The first in time is the plaintiffâs summons dated 13 July 2006 under O.14 for summary interlocutoryjudgment for damages to be assessed and for interlocutory injunctions.  On the undertakings given by the defendants as recorded inthe order of Deputy Judge Gill made on 26 July 2006 the plaintiff does not pursue the application for interlocutory injunctions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The second summons is the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs summons dated 15 July 2006 seeking a declaration that this Court has no jurisdiction in respect of the plaintiffâsclaims against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and for an order that the writ and subsequent proceedings be set aside or stayed as against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Counsel agreed that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs application should be determined first.  It seems to me that it is both logical and desirable that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs application should be determined first.  I proceeded to deal with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs application.  The plaintiffâs summons was adjourned pending the decision on the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs application with liberty to restore.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The plaintiffâs claims against the defendants are for injunctive relief and damages as set out in the statement of claim.  Theplaintiffâs case as pleaded is that it has been carrying on business as a merchandiser and trader sourcing for and supplying itscustomers with Lycra fibre yarns of various specifications, qualities and colours as required by its customers.  Lycra fibre yarnis a synthetic premium stretch fibre invented by Du Pont.  There are a limited number of Lycra accredited mills in the world.  Inthe Mainland one such accredited mill is Nanhai Guanxing Knitting Co. Ltd (âNanhaiâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The plaintiffâs case is that in the course of its business the plaintiff spent much time, effort, skill and expenses working withNanhai to develop and test the composition, knitting process,dyeing materials and process to ensure the yarns meet the strict requirementsof each of its customers.  Upon the customerâs approval, each customer would be assigned by the plaintiff a specific set of colournumbers for each specific type of yarn required by the customer.  The plaintiffâs customers would order yarns in bulk and Nanhaiwould accept such orders, produce and supply yarns by reference and according to the colour numbers of that customer.  The plaintiffâscase is that the plaintiffâs lists of colour numbers for each customer was confidential information and the property of the plaintiff. The plaintiffâs pricing system in respect of each type of Lycra yarn for each customer is also said to be confidential information.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Since about 16 February 2005, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was employed by the plaintiff as a sales executive entrusted with the responsibility of accepting orders from the plaintiffâscustomers and liasing on behalf of the plaintiff with the customers and Nanhai.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The plaintiffâs case is that when the plaintiff employed the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant the plaintiff made known to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant that he would be entrusted with confidential information.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Para. 11 of the statement of claim pleads :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â As an employee, the 1st Defendant owed the Plaintiff the duties or alternatively it was implied term in the contract of employmentbetween the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant that :-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(a) the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant shall serve the Plaintiff with fidelity and in good faith;</p>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(b) the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant shall not act to the detriment of the Plaintiff;</p>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(c) the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant shall not solicit and/or deal with the  plaintiffâs customers on his own behalf and/or for his own benefit; and</p>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(d) the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant shall not use the Plaintiffâs property, including the Plaintiffâs Confidential Information for his own personal benefitand/or to the detriment of the Plaintiff.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The complaint is made at paragraph 12 of the statement of claim that :  âWrongfully and in breach of his contract of employment,his said duties as an employee and the obligation of confidentiality and since about April 2006 during his employment by the plaintiffthe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant secretly and behind the Plaintiffâs backâ did the acts complained of.  These include whilst in the plaintiffâs employsetting up and operating the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in direct competition with the plaintiff and soliciting the plaintiffâs customers to place order for Lycra yarn withthe 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant by using the plaintiffâs confidential information.  There is also the allegation that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant misused the confidential information by placing orders on behalf of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant with Nanhai.  Particulars are given of orders placed by the plaintiffâs customers with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant these being orders diverted by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant whilst in the plaintiffâs employ.  On the evidence, the total value of these orders which were diverted to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is about HK$5.5 million.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> According to the plaintiff, the plaintiff dismissed the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant because of his wrongful acts and the employment was terminated on 20 May 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> There is a claim for an injunction against the defendants to restrain them from using the confidential information.  There is alsoa claim for an injunction to restrain them from soliciting or canvassing the plaintiffâs customers and Nanhai in relation to anybusiness connected with the sourcing and supply of Lycra yarn.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Apart from injunctive relief, the plaintiff also claims by prayers 4, 5, and 6 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td align="left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td align="left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">4.</td>                <td align="left" width="85%" valign="top" class="quote">Damages for breach of confidence to be assessed;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td align="left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td align="left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">5.</td>                <td align="left" width="85%" valign="top" class="quote">Damages for breach of employment contract or breach of the duties of an employee to be assessed or alternatively an account of profits;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td align="left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td align="left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">6.</td>                <td align="left" width="85%" valign="top" class="quote">Exemplary damages to be assessed;â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> A defence has not yet been served by the defendants.

It has not been suggested on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant that the Labour Tribunal is the more appropriate forum to determine this dispute between the parties.  However, Mr Cloughsubmitted that the Labour Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction over the plaintiffâs claims and that the proceedings should be stayedas the High Court has no jurisdiction over the matter.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The question to consider is whether the plaintiffâs claims are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> In <i>National Ebauch Ltd v Rishi Kaumar Bhatnagar</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20HKLR%20114" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] HKLR 114</a> it was held by Roberts CJ that the words âa claim for a sum of moneyâ in the Schedule did not include a claim for unliquidateddamages.  As the claim in the case before him was for unliqidated damages for breach of contract, he held that the Labour Tribunaldid not have exclusive jurisdiction.  The effect of his decision is that the Tribunalâs jurisdiction was limited to claims forliquidated damages and the High Court had jurisdiction to hear claims for unliquidated damages for breach of contract.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> That view was disapproved of in <i>Panalpine (Hong Kong ) Ltd v Ulrich Haldemann</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20HKLR%20275" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] HKLR 275.</a>  Hunter J held that the legislature anticipated a âquantifiedâ claim.  And a claim that was âascertainedâ or ascertainabledoes not make the claim one for liquidated damages nor does it limit the Tribunalâs jurisdiction to such claims.  Hence he heldthat the Labour tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction to hear claims for unliquidated damages which arise from the breach of a termof a contract of employment.  He stayed all proceedings on the counterclaim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> In <i>Panalpine</i> the counterclaim was by the employee who sought damages for wrongful dismissal and the claim was for unliquidated damages.  Thatwas clearly a claim for breach of the contract of employment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The Court of Appeal in <i>Citipost (Asia) Limited v Julian Robert Holliday</i> (unreported CACV 111/2004, 8 February 2005) considered <i>National Eubach</i> and <i>Panalpine</i> and came to the view that Hunter J was correct.  Rogers VP in his judgment agreed with Hunter Jâs judgment in <i>Panalpine</i>.  Le Pichon JA agreed with Rogers VPâs judgment. </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> It is now clearly established by Court of Appeal authority that a claim for unliquidated damages for breach of a term, whether expressor implied, of a contract of employment is a claim within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> If that were the only claim of the plaintiff in this action then I would agree with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant that the Labour Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction and the High Court has no jurisdiction.  But it is clear that the plaintiffis not only seeking damages for breach of contract.  There is also the claim for the injunctive relief as set out above in paragraph11.  Paragraph 1 of the Schedule deals with a claim for âa sum of moneyâ and not injunctive relief.  It is clear that the LabourTribunal has no jurisdiction to grant injunctions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> There is also a claim by the plaintiff for damages for breach of confidence.  I accept that the dispute between the parties arisesfrom the relationship of employer and employee but that does not mean that the causes of action are founded merely in contract. The claim for damages and injunctive relief for breach of confidence is founded both in contract and in tort.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> In <i>Citipost</i> there was also a claim for an injunction to restrain the defendant from breaching a restrictive covenant.  There was also a causeof action for breach of confidence.  However, as is clear from the judgment of Rogers VP both those matters fell by the wayside andthe only real claim left was the claim for damages for breach of contract.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> At paragraph 8 of his judgment Rogers VP said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â Indeed, nearly a year has passed since the judge heard the matter and it can now be said that the injunction claim, limited asit is to the Restrictive Covenant in the contract of employment, is now a matter of history.  The periods of the Restrictive Covenanthave now expired save for clause 7 which prohibits the divulgence of confidential information.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> It was conceded by counsel for the plaintiff in <i>Citipost</i> that the pleading did not contain the necessary allegations to found a breach of confidence action.  Also at paragraph 8 Rogers VPsaid :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â Indeed, Mr Yuen acknowledged that the pleading did not contain the necessary allegations to found a breach of confidence action. In those circumstances, it seems to me that the allegations in respect of confidential information would fall to be struck out shouldany such application be made.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Thus it is clear that in <i>Citipost</i> the claim for an injunction and the claim for breach of confidence fell by the wayside and the only real claim left was one for damagesfor breach of the contract of employment.  That being so, it was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Mr Clough submitted that the plaintiffâs claims for injunctions were window dressing.  I am unable to accept this submission. Because of the wrongful activities of the defendants as alleged by the plaintiff the plaintiff applied for interlocutory injunctions. At the hearing before Deputy Judge Gill on 26 July 2006 the defendants gave undertakings to the court.  The claims for injunctiverelief are important claims for the plaintiff and in no way can they be said to be window dressing.  The defendants took these mattersseriously and offered undertakings in lieu of interlocutory injunctions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Mr Clough also submitted that all the claims of the plaintiff are founded in contract and not in tort.  I am also unable to acceptthis submission.  The claim for breach of confidence is founded both in contract and in tort.  That being so, it seems to me thatparagraph 3 of the Schedule comes into play.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Paragraph 3 of the Schedule was considered by Kwan J in <i>Estinah v Golden Hand Indonesian Employment Agency</i> (unreported HCSA 6/2001, 21 August 2001).  Kwan J held that two of the three causes of action that she was concerned with were withinthe exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal as coming within paragraph 1(b) of the Schedule.  However, the third cause of actionwas founded in tort as being a cause of action for breach of statutory duty.  This came within paragraph 3 of the Schedule.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> At paragraphs 37 and 38 of her judgment Kwan J said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â37. On the plain wording of paragraph 3, it would seem to me that the claim insofar as it is based on breach of statutory dutyis excluded from the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal, as it is a cause of action founded in tort arising from a breach of dutyimposed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 57(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>.  An action for breach of statutory duty is an action in tort, this is the established view and it has been recognized in textbookson the law of torts.  I am unable to accept Miss Poâs submission that the claim based on breach of statutory duty is not âa causeof action, founded in tortâ because it is in essence a claim for refund for overpayment. I do not propose to go over the legalbasis of the claim founded on breach of statutory duty as I have analysed this when I rule (<i>sic</i>) that there is a valid cause of action on this ground.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">38. Miss Po also submitted that the claim should not be excluded under paragraph 3 of the Schedule as this would give rise to tensionbetween paragraphs 1(b) and 3 and might make it difficult to apply the provisions in the Schedule in practice.  I agree with Mr Lingthat it is clear from the opening words of paragraph 3 (i.e. ânotwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2â), it was envisaged that therewould be an element of overlap between the claims in paragraphs 1 and 2 and the claim in paragraph 3.  Take for instance a claimfor a sum of money which arose from the breach of an express or implied term of a contract of employment to provide a safe systemof work.  This would fall within paragraph 1(a) and yet one would have no difficulty in seeing that it would be excluded from thejurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal as this claim is in respect of a cause of action founded in tort whether arising from a breachof contract or a breach of duty imposed by the common law or by statute.  As for paragraph 1(b), Mr Ling has suggested that thisis meant to cover simple claims in which there is an express provision in the <i>Employ</i><i>ment</i> <i>Ordinance</i> or the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/47" class="autolink_findacts">Apprenticeship</i><i> </i><i>Ordinance</a></i> governing the right of recovery in the event of failure to comply with the statutory provision.  He mentioned as an example <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/47/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 40</a> of the <i>Employ</i><i>ment</i> <i>Ordinance</i> which governs the payment of holiday pay.  Where there is failure of a person to comply with the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a></i> and the means of enforcing the right which arose is provided in the <i>Ordinance</i> itself, there is no need to rely on a cause of action founded on breach of statutory duty.  I agree with his submission that wherea claimant is driven to rely on a private right of action impliedly conferred by statute, as in this case, the claim is excludedfrom the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal by virtue of paragraph 3 in the Schedule.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Kwan J held that the claimant could advance a claim founded on breach of statutory duty and as the claim was not within the exclusivejurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal by virtue of paragraph 3 of the Schedule, the Small Claims Tribunal had not exceeded its jurisdictionin trying the claim.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> I agree with the views of Kwan J.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> The words âNotwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2â in paragraph 3 of the Schedule must mean something.  The meaning is in my viewclear.  In spite of the fact that the Labour Tribunal has jurisdiction under paragraphs 1 and 2, the Labour Tribunal shall not havejurisdiction to determine a claim for a sum of money in respect of a cause of action âfounded in tort whether arising from a breachof contract or a breach of duty imposed by a rule of common lawâ¦..â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Here there is an overlap between the claim in paragraph 1 and the claim in paragraph 3 of the Schedule.  The claim for damages forbreach of confidence is founded both in contract and in tort.  It would fall within paragraph 1(a) as being within the jurisdictionof the Labour Tribunal but it would be excluded from the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal under paragraph 3 as being a claim fora sum of money in respect of a cause of action âfounded in tort whether arising from a breach of contract or a breach of duty imposedby a rule of common law â¦â¦..â  The intention of the legislature was to exclude such claims from the jurisdiction of the LabourTribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> In my judgment the plaintiffâs claims are not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.
