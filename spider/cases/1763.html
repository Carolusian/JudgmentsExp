Hua Lien in that when she was sent out from HUD"s yard to be moored at a typhoon buoyduring the passage of Typhoon Ellen in September 1983, HUD had failed to take all reasonable precautions to prevent her from creatinga danger to life and property.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The Hua Lien, a vessel of almost 10,000 gross tonnage, was a roll on roll off passenger and cargo ferry operated by the Taiwan CarFerry Company, Since dissolved, normally plying between Hua Lien and Keelung. On the 19th April 1983 she struck a submerged rockoff Hua Lien, causing severe damage to her bottom plates with consequential flooding in the engine room and other compartments. Toprevent her sinking she was beached in shallow water.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> There was no dry dock in Taiwan capable of taking a vessel with the draft of the Hua Lien. She was brought instead to Hong Kong,arriving on the 29th May, where Mr. Temple, at that time the Senior Project Manager of HUD and generally in charge of all ship repairwork in the yard, accepted her into the custody of HUD. Temporary repairs were carried out. In particular a "D shackle" was attachedto the port anchor cable and one shackle's length of the cable itself, i.e. 90 feet, was slacked out, so that in the event of a typhoonthe Hua Lien could be moored to a typhoon buoy in the harbour. It is the policy of HUD not to permit vessels to lie alongside theirrepair berths the passage of a typhoon close to Hong Kong. At the same time the yard carried out a simulated drop of the starboardanchor to ensure that it was in working order. It is advisable, when moored to a buoy and the conditions so warrant, to drop a vessel'ssecond anchor to minimise excessive yawing.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> By reason of her stranding the Hua Lien had become a "dead ship", i.e. in this instance, a vessel unable to proceed under its ownpower. As such the Hua Lien could not enter the waters of Hong Kong except with the permission of the Director of Marine. Permissionhad been provisionally given, subject to inspection on arrival, at a meeting attended, inter alia, by representatives of the MarineDepartment, including one Captain Shearman, and Mr. Temple on the 26th May. Subsequently a Dead Ship Permit was issued. Endorsedthereon were various conditions, the first being that the Hua Lien should take up a berth as and when directed. Thus on the 7th September,when Typhoon Ellen was perceived to be approaching, Hong Kong a direction was given for "the Master or officer in charge of the vesselto remove (her) to south of Kau Yi Chau, to Western Anchorage or to sea within two hours upon the No. 3. Typhoon Signal being hoisted".In fact a particular buoy in the Western Anchorage had already been allocated by the Marine Department.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> More general conditions were that the Hua Lien should have on board a sufficient complement of deck and engine room officers, and"a qualified master during the period that any local storm signal is hoisted". To that end, Eastern World wide Shipping Ltd., thelocal agents of the owner, had appointed a master, engineer and second officer, all with appropriate certificates, and a furthercrew of three. The master accepted custody of the vessel on behalf of the owners on the 16th June, signing a formal letter to thiseffect. HUD were then able to dispense with the security guard which HUD had engaged meanwhile. Nine days earlier the owners hadappointed a Mr. J.D. Wort of Hong Kong to act as their local superintendent.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Between the initial drydocking at the beginning of June, which had been necessary to effect the temporary repairs, and the arrivalof Typhoon Ellen in September, the Hua Lien had been dry-docked for a second time so that further investigation could he made intowhat was necessary to restore her to 1st class condition. As a result various tenders and estimates were made, including a suggestionby Mr. Wort, albeit rejected by the underwriter's, that the vessel be written off as a constructive total loss. However by the timethe No. 1. Signal was hoisted on the 7th September no agreement had been reached and such work as had been done was long past, otherthan a small correction to the ship's ballast on the 24th August. The Hua lien was simply lying alongside the berth, awaiting theoutcome of the negotiations between the owners, the underwriters and the yard HUD had no other present interest in her.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The No. 3 Signal went up at 7.45 on the morning of the 8th September. At 10.15, In accordance with the policy of HUD and the expressorder of the Director of Marine, and with the assistance of three tugs and a pilot cutter, the Hua Lien was made fast by her portanchor cable to Buoy A42. On board were the master, the two officers and the crew of three.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> At 4.45 that afternoon the No. 8 was hoisted, signalling winds of gale force, followed later by the 9, and then, at 2 o'clock thenext morning by the highest signal No. 10, indicating that winds of hurricane force might he expected. So it remained until 10 a.m.During that period, when the typhoon was at its height, probably at about 7.45 a.m., the Hua Lien's mooring cable snapped, leavingher completely at the mercy of the elements. The starboard anchor, which the crew had attempted to drop earlier, was apparently jammedsolid at the guillotine stopper. The tug Lamina, which had been called shortly before the cable parted, was standing by, but in theappalling conditions was unable to do more than at one stage to nudge the Hua Lien to one side as she drifted towards another vessel.Soon afterwards the crew did manage to free the starboard anchor, but it proved insufficient to hold the vessel against the wind.The tug continued to stand by as the Hua Lien dragged westward, at one time threatening the Tsing Yi bridge, and was instrumentalin rescuing the crew when she eventually grounded on the island, causing substantial damage to the installations of the two Plaintiffsin the process. The assessment of the damage has been reserved for the time being. The action below proceeded on the question ofliability alone. The hearing occasioned some 37 working days, the judge having the assistance of a marine assessor.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The "Shipmasters' Guide" is published in Hong Kong by the Director of Marine. It is a small hook intended, so the preface runs, "toprovide masters of vessels called at Hong Kong with information on subjects of particular local maritime concern or application".Part I is, headed "Tronical Cyclones Affecting Hong Kong". Section 2 thereof refers to Related Port Regulations.

The length of cable necessary toachieve this purpose has to be left to the discretion of each individual shipmaster as the length, draught and trim of the ship mustbe taken into account when making a decision on this point. However, experience over the years has indicated that for the averageocean going cargo vessel, at least two shackles of cable on deck is required on the majority of occasions."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> It is apparently the custom of HUD to hand a copy of the Shipmasters' Guide to the master of any foreign vessel which comes intoits yard. That custom was followed with regard to Hua Lien, although unfortunately it was not appreciated at the time that the masterwas part of the Japanese salvage team due to leave Hong Kong almost immediately. No copy was given to the master who assumed custodyfrom the yard on the 16th June or to the master who replaced him during July and was the master at the time of Typhoon Ellen. Bothhe and the First Mate were foreign certificated officers, although the master was a local man and had received at least some of histraining in the Hong Kong Sea School. More importantly I have to observe that in any event the requirements listed in the Shipmasters'Guide, and endorsed on the Dead Ship Permit, were no more than would be expected as basic good seamanship. Certain Shearman observedthat "generally speaking, a shipmaster will take these precautions without being told.  It is in his training to do so". CaptainThird, a marine consultant with Brookes Bell &amp; Co., having wide seafaring experience and bolding a United Kingdom Extra MasterCertificate, described them as "commonsense and fairly basic precautions."</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> It is accepted that certain of those "fairly basic precautions" had not been taken. There was no "auxiliary power capable of workinganchors, windlass and ballast pumps'' (e). Repairs required to restore sufficient emergency power would have taken approximatelyone week to complete at a cost of approximately US$10,000, a not insubstantial sum in itself, but small when set against the totalbill incurred at the yard which was for HK$4.5 million. There were no alternative means (f) of working the mooring chain or the starboardanchor, save of course, that either could be let go.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Likewise it is not disputed that there were no "towing lines available fore and aft ready for use" (j) and no "spare bower anchorprepared and ready for releasing (k)". Mr, Steel, who has appeared for HUD both here and below, endeavoured strenuously to persuadeus that the failure to take these two particular precautions was not in fact negligent. Tow lines rigged around the ship were, hesuggested, intended primarily against the risk of fire and could not in any event have been picked up by the tug during the courseof the typhoon. He castigated Captain Third's suggestion of streaming a buoyed messenger astern as "original thinking" which wouldnot be expected as a general practice. The rigging of a spare anchor for emergency release, by either of the two methods canvassedin evidence, was, he contended, unusual in Hong Kong, although perhaps not otherwise unique, and was therefore no derogation fromprevailing standards of care.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> We have been taken carefully through the relevant evidence by both Mr. Steel and by Mr. Griffiths, who has appeared for the Plaintiffsboth here and below. For my part I do not think it necessary to say more than that in my view there was evidence to support the judgewhen he found, as it seems to me he did, that it would have been prudent to heed all the advice contained in the Shipmasters' Guide.These two particular precautions would have been useful reserve measures in the event a vessel should find herself adrift, as indeedthe Hua Lien did.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The anchor cables of the Hua Lien, in accordance with the requirements of the China Register in which she was entered, were of U2steel 52 mm diameter with a normal breaking strain in the order of 150 tons. The Classification Societies however permit a maximumacceptable limit of 11% for wastage and wear, which would give a breaking strain at that level in the order of 118 tons.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> On the 16th March 1984, that is several months and one typhoon later, in which incidentally history repeated itself in that the portanchor chain of the Hua Lien again parted, Captain Third inspected a sample of the cable that had failed on the later occasion. Itwas part of the original cable which had been severed by the salvors in Taiwan. He took measurements of ten links, finding that someexhibited wear greater than was permitted by class standards. As however these had been taken in a manner not acceptable to the ClassificationSocieties, in September 1986 he took further measurements, finding, as his report then indicated, "wastage/wear at levels in excessof classification allowances and are consistent with our findings upon survey in 1984".</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Gellatly Hankey Marine Services Hong Kong, a firm which is part of an international group of marine surveyors, carried out actualtests on part of the chain used during Ellen, and found the breaking factors to be either 151 or 155 tons. The judge however feltunable to rely upon these results as they did not accurately reflect the type of load that would have been placed on a chain in typhoonconditions at the buoy. Mr. Steel suggested that the judge misunderstood the evidence in this respect. He further pointed Out thatthe requirements of the China Register are not necessarily the same as those of Lloyd's Register referred to in the Shipmasters'Guide and the Permit Conditions. Lloyd's Register allows ferries on certain restricted services indicated in the Register Book, (whichI understand does not include the service between Hua Lien and Keelung), to be equipped with cables one grade below those which wouldotherwise be required. Had a reduced standard been adopted only two of the links measured by Captain Third would have fallen belowrequirements.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The judge does not appear to have given consideration to this last argument, but in my view it is of little importance. Computerexercises carried out by Mr. Byrne, a research expert, with British Maritime Technology, showed that the load factor on the cableduring Ellen was at times such that even a new cable would have parted. No doubt, as the judge found, the wastage of` the cable playeda part but the real cause of its snapping was not its condition but its length. When the Hua Lien was put on to the buoy the cablewas fixed at one shackle. But the guillotine stopper, which is designed to hold the cable at the desired length, was faulty, andduring the course of the typhoon allowed further cable to slip out. By the time Ellen was at her worst the Hua Lien was riding toseven shackles, a length agreed by all witnesses to be grossly excessive. The effect is for the ship to yaw wildly from side to side,sailing up on her chain until she is brought up at the end of the arc with a violent jerk, to repeat the process the other way. Tremendousimpulse loads are imposed on the chain each time, and it must have been at such a moment that the Hua Lien's gave way parting atthe link just forward of the guillotine stopper.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The principal fault in the stopper, as the judge found, was the lack of a securing pin. The securing bar, which is the part intendedto hold the chain firmly in position, was thus able to ride up and let the chain pass out beneath. I gain the impression that thiswas a gradual or intermittent process, eventually stopped when a pin was found, or taken from the starboard stopper, and inserted.The chain was then held, as can be seen in the photographs, with a joining link hard against the securing bar. A joining link isvery slightly lily larger than the common, open or intermediate links which form the rest of the chain.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Apart from the lack of the pin, the stopper generally was in a rusty and worn condition. The judge came to no definite conclusionas to whether, even with the pin in, it would have allowed the lesser links to slip by, but felt it reasonable to conclude that theslackness in the mechanism must have had "some influence on the release of the cable".</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> It is apparent from the transcript of recorded radio messages passing between the Master and the HUD Dock Master during the typhoonthat at sometime before the mooring chain snapped the Master had indeed attempted to drop the starboard anchor, but found it impossible.We do not know why this was so. One suggestion is that, following the simulated drop in June, the chain had been allowed to rideup hard against the securing bar. This is a sensible procedure, for it takes the strain off the windlass brake, but in the absenceof power to take the weight off the bar it would have been more difficult to raise it. All that the Master said over the radio wasthat the guillotine was "jammed dead and rusting".</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> No computer exercises were carried out to discover what loads would have been imposed upon the mooring cable had the starboard anchorbeen dropped in time. It is not possible to say therefore whether the assistance given would have been enough to save the cable,although clearly it would have been a help. It is obvious though, that the state of the anchor would have been revealed by inspectionbefore leaving the berth, when it could, of course, have been put right with no difficulty. The same applies to the missing pin inthe port guillotine stopper.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> This brief resume of the basic facts indicates beyond doubt that the Hua Lien was negligently prepared for the typhoon. Even if theabsence of wind lass power is ignored - Mr. Griffiths has not pressed strongly in this respect - there was no safety pin in the Portguillotine stopper and no back up system by way of towing lines and spare anchor.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The question for this Court in who is to be responsible for that negligence, or in particular, is HUD to be responsible for we arenot concerned with any other liability. Put in the form appropriate to the approach taken by our law to this question, it becomes"Did HUD in the circumstances owe a duty of care to the Plaintiffs?"</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Like the judge below we have been referred to a host of authorities. I mean no disrespect by not referring to each individually,but speaking for myself, I would suggest that the present state of the law is succinctly set out in a passage from the judgment ofBalcombe L.J. in <u>Clarke</u> v. <u>Bruce Lance &amp; Co.</u> <u>[</u> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1988%5d%201%20WLR%20881" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1988] 1 W.L.R. 881</a> at 884, to which my attention has been drawn by my Lord Clough J.A. -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"    The circumstances in which the law will impose a duty of care on a person, such that a breach of that duty causing damage willgive rise to a right of action in negligence on the part of a person to whom the duty is owed, have been the subject of much recentconsideration in the higher courts.

The firstis to take care not to over emphasize the fairly obvious fact that if the Plaintiffs fail in these proceedings they will have tohear the whole of the loss themselves. I accept that in <u>Donoghue</u> v. <u>Stevenson</u> Lord Atkin spoke of the need to avoid denying a legal remedy where there was so obviously a social wrong, but there would be no completedenial, in law that is, if HUD are not to be liable in the present instance.

But it must notbe overlooked that a problem arises when the pursuer is seeking to hold the defender responsible for having failed to prevent a thirdparty from causing damage to the pursuer or his property by the third party's own deliberate wrongdoing. In such a case it is notpossible to invoke a general duty of care; for it is well recognised that there is no general duty of care to prevent third partiesfrom causing such damage. The point is expressed very clearly in Hart and Honore, Causation in the Law, 2nd ed.

Lord Keith's bystander on a cliff could certainlyshout, and it would cost him or anyone nothing.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> I take the remaining three items together. Capt. Shearman spoke of a policy of the Marine Department to require repair yards to bepersonally responsible for dead ships within their keeping. It is a policy that, so far as he was aware, had never been officiallypromulgated but depended instead upon mutual understanding. His view is probably best summarised in an answer under cross-examination-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <p class="quote">"I can say that in those days there was a great deal of mutual trust between the yards and the Department. An explicit contract betweenthe Department and the yard whenever a disabled ship was to be brought into Hong Kong was never considered. But in each case wherea disabled ship was to come into Hong Kong, discussions did take place between the yard and the Department in order for us all tobe satisfied that that ship was not going to be a liability to the port, to itself, to other users. This was a custom which had evolvedover the years and as far as I know, is still in force to-day."</p>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> To the contrary was the evidence of Mr. Gough, the Executive Manager of HUD, who said that the first he had ever heard of such apolicy was at the trial itself.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Capt. Shearman's reference to discussions is consistent with the meeting on the 26th May. But it has to be remembered that at thatstage HUD were clearly intending to, and did, take charge of the Hua Lien on its arrival in Hong Kong. I have no doubt that fromthen until the 16th June HUD were fully responsible for it and it is during this period that the attachment of the buoy shackle andthe test of the starboard anchor was carried out. The fact that nothing more was done and possibly would not have been done evenhad a typhoon arrived, seems to me immaterial. No typhoon did arrive.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> All that HUD later did by way of precautions was to fill certain ballast tanks in order to improve the stability of the vessel. Thiswas on the 11th July, against the approach of Typhoon Vera. It was done entirely on the initiative of HUD, although they did informMr. Wort of what they were about. Mr. Wort then asked them to advise the master of the fact, which may show that to his mind themaster was at least to some extent concerned with the safety of the ship. Nevertheless the judge took the incident -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <p class="quote">"to reinforce the distinct impression conveyed by the evidence in general that the defendant regarded the master as a mere figureheadand took the veiw that he and his crew had been appointed simply to fulfil Marine Department regulations, to act as watchmen whilethe vessel was berthed at the dockyard and to function as a bare riding crew when she was moored at a typhoon buoy."</p>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> The master himself apparently took the same view. In a statement given some 18 months later, and placed before the judge under theHearsay Rules he said -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <p class="quote">"    At the time of my employment I recall being told by astern Worldwide that I would not be required to attend on board the vesselevery day but I was to attend aboard at my discretion depending upon the weather condition. the crew apart from myself served ona 48 hour on, 48 hour off basis.

In the cross-examination of Capt. Shearman we find -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <p class="quote">"Q.

Isn't that a fair reflection of what you are suggestion?</p>                    <p class="quote">A. Yes. But I would like to say here that the master who was employed to command 'Hua Lien' was employed locally for the purposesof fulfilling the requirements of our  legislation. This is a totally different command than that of a master who has been appointedto take command of the ship deep-sea. This aspect is recognized in the Department."</p>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> It is not surprising then that in a statement prepared some 4 years later, Mr. Shopin Tsu, at the material time at Vice Presidentof the owners, should say -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <p class="quote">"So far as the safety of the vessel was concerned, the Owners relied solely upon HUD. This was the first and only occasion the Ownersor I had experience of a casualty of a vessel and we were not aware of the precautions necessary to be taken to safeguard a deadshipwhilst in Hong Kong during the typhoon season. In this respect, we looked to HUD, as an experienced shipyard, to ensure that thevessel was properly prepared and could safely lie at anchor during the passage of a typhoon through Hong Kong."</p>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> When one considers the situation as it was, say towards the end. of August, it is clear that HUD knew that no further precautionshad been taken. They had not been instructed to do so and without their assistance, the appropriate precautions would have been impossible.HUD knew too - so it follows from the judge's finding - that the master himself was taking no interest. If HUD had stepped in totake the precautions on its own behalf, they may have been able to rely upon Clause 8 of the Schedule of Rates and Charges to recovertheir outlay. In that situation it may well be that the fair and reasonable man, knowing that it was the season for typhoons, andof the risks inherent in mooring a dead ship to a buoy, would have said that HUD ought to have so stepped in.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> But to that situation must be added the fact that maritime law has traditionally looked to the owners to be responsible for the safetyof their ships, a position reinforced by Clause 19 of the Standard Conditions of HUD. Furthermore the owners had local agents inHong Kong, and had specifically appointed a local superintendent. It has been suggested that Mr. Wort was in reality no more thana technical adviser with regard to the repairs, but his insistence on the master being told about the ballasting operation, his requeststo HUD with regard to food for the crew and other services, and his instructions to correct the slight list on the 28th August indicatethat he took his duties to go further than that. There is no other yard now in Hong Kong from whom information as to standard practicescould be sought, but it is pertinent, I, think, to note that no evidence was called from yards in other parts of the world whichare affected by typhoons, nor, which is also important, was there any suggestion in the immediate aftermath of Ellen, or of Joe,when the Hua Lien again broke free from its mooring, from either the Marine Department or the owners that HUD were in any way toblame.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> In the end I find myself not persuaded that in all the circumstances of this case there did exist such close and direct relationsas to give rise to a duty of care on HUD I would therefore allow the appeal and enter judgment in their favour.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> As I understand my Lords Kempster and Clough are of the same opinion I do not think there is anything to be gained by a considerationof the detailed submissions made by Mr. Steel to the effect that, were e take a different view, the damage suffered by the Plaintiffswas still nevertheless not the result of any negligence on the part of HUD.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(D.

Thisis a duty conceptually different from that requiring the appellants to refrain from causing the respondents harm. The outcome ofthis appeal accordingly depends in great part on whether or not the judge should, as a mixed matter of law and fact, have so beensatisfied.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> If reasonable foreseeability of damage is without more to be equated with proximity, as Lord Wilberforce was thought to have suggestedin <u>Anns v Merton London Borough Council</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20AC%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] AC 728</a> at pp 751-752 the respondents must succeed but in <u>McLoughlin v O'Brian</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20AC%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 AC 410</a> at p 420 he explained</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"that foreseeability must be accompanied and limited by the law's judgment as to persons who ought, according to its standards ofvalue or justice, to have been in contemplation .... the statement that there is a 'duty of care' denotes a conclusion into the formingof which considerations of policy have entered.

The factors germane to proximity therefore warrant careful consideration.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Macdougall J emphasised the importance of control as such a factor and directed himself on the law as explained in P<u>eabody Fund v Sir Lindsay Parkinson Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20AC%20210" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] AC 210</a>; <u>Curran v Northern Ireland Co-ownership Housing Association</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20AC%20713" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] AC 713</a> and <u>Yuen Yeu v AG of Hong Kong</u>; being cases involving such relationships as parent and child, schoolmaster and pupil, prison officer and Borstal boy, mental hospitaland lunatic and statutory body and depositor or house purchaser. He then went on to base his conclusion that the appellants owedthe respondents a duty of care on the measure of control which he found that they exercised over the Hua Lien; a "dead and potentialdanger to the respondents.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> Accepting as I do the importance of the factor of control, of "all the circumstances" relied upon by the respondents the most significant,I find myself unable to agree with the judge's findings in this regard. While the appellants, like the Marine Department, requiredand arranged for the Hua Lien to be moved to a buoy on the approach of a succession of typhoons the commercial nature of their overalloperations had no more relevance to control than their internal instructions, contractual right to charge the owners for typhoonprecautions, needed, for example, to recover the cost of chartering tugs, or capacity to carry them out. None of such factors couldbe material unless, de jure or de facto, the appellants had sole or joint control of, the vessel or, which is not suggested, werecontractually liable to the owners to carry out these precautions. The willingness of owners representatives to seek and accept adviceor services, sometimes by way of ratification, or the arrangements made by the appellants for and on behalf of the owners for tugsand supplies do not suffice. As from 16th June 1983 possession of the Hua Lien was firmly vested in the owners and any waiver ofclause 19 of the appellants' standard condition's terminated. By their superintendent, agents and the presence of members of theircrew, the owners thereafter exercised exclusive control over the vessel and in consequence owed a duty of care to the respondentsin conformity with accepted principles of maritime law and legislation. Like occupiers of land they were in the best position torecognise and remedy risks to others. Foreseeability not being in issue I accept that the appellants may have exercised a degreeof control giving rise to a duty of care to the respondents after they had accepted the vessel from the salvors and prior to 16thJune but, since it is not suggested that they had enhanced the danger to the respondents by anything they then did, the efficacyof the precautions they had taken is neither here nor there. After 16th June they awaited further instructions, possible to carryout major repairs, pending which the Hua Lien remained alongside their wharf. In my opinion and accepting that the master and crewmight not have raised objection the appellants, albeit they had their own reasons for concern about its safety, were not entitledto board the vessel, in the absence of invitation, for any purpose other than attending to the moorings. If this be right they werenot even co-occupiers. Nothing then remains as a basis for the judge's finding of "a substantial measure of control over the vessel."save his conclusion that the appellants had scant regard for the abilities and commitment of master and crew; which goes only toforeseeability. In the circumstances I find no basis for that finding.</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"How wide the sphere of the duty of care ..... is to be laid depends ultimately upon the court's assessment of the demands of societyfor protection from the carelessness of others"</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>per Lord Pearce in <u>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1964%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964 AC 465)</a> at p 536.

For my part I cannot envisage any obligation arising other than the equivalent of that of the owners. To report to theMarine Department, not suggested by the respondents, or, which is, to provide and rig towing lines and a spare bower anchor wouldnot meet the hypothetical standard. Accordingly compliance with the provisions outlined in paragraph 2.2.2 "Requirements for deadships under Repair" in "Shipmasters Guide" described by the trial judge as "the distillation of generations of sea-faring wisdomand experience" would be called for. These include having "auxiliary power available capable of working anchors, windlass and ballastpumps and "alternative means of working anchors in the event of the windlass being under repair" Very substantial work and expenditurewould have been needed at a time when the ability of the owners to reimburse the appellants was not assured.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Yet another guideline or control mechanism is the availability of a remedy against the owners, for what it is or was worth, <u>La Banque Financiere v Westgate</u> English Court of Appeal 28th July 1988 (Unreported) at pp 113 and 114.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> Finally we cannot ignore the changed approach of the superior courts to the imposition of liability for negligence and the scopeof any duty held to arise in novel situations as demonstrated by cases reported since March 1986 when, in considering the appealof <u>Yuen Kun Yeu and others</u>, claiming damages for purely economic loss, this court was faced with the implications of the speeches of the majority of the Huseof Lords in <u>Junior Books Ltd v Veitchi Co Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20AC%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 AC 520</a>, Now it is rather to the dissenting speech of Lord Brandon that we would be advised to turn. <u>D &amp; F Estates Ltd v Church Commissioners</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%203%20WLR%20368" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 3 WLR 368</a> at p 381 per Lord Bridge and at n 394 per Lord Oliver with whom Lord Templeman, Lord Ackner and Lord Jauncey agreed.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> "In the end" said Robert Goff LJ in <u>Paterson &amp; Co v Merfarken Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%203%20All%20ER%20522" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 3 All ER 522</a> at p 540 "the choice must be one of judgment and, in the balancing of conflicting interest; and in the exercise of that judgmentthe court must strive neither unjustifiably to deprive potential plaintiffs of remedies for their injuries nor unjustifiably to imposetoo heavy a legal responsibility on potential defendants". Accepting and applying that test in the light of the authorities and ofthe foregoing considerations I conclude that the appellants owed no duty of care to the respondents.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(Michael Kempster)</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">Justice of Appeal</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Clough, J.A. :</strong></p>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> I agree that this appeal should be allowed and, although we are differing from the careful reserved Judgment of Macdougall J., Ihave nothing to add to the reasons for that conclusion which have been stated by my Lords Cons V.-P. and Kempster J.A.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(P.G.
