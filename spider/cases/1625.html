class="heading">Introduction</p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a> This is a dispute between corporate brokers, in which a large number of employees also have become embroiled.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The plaintiff, âICAPâ, is a money broking business.  It acts as intermediary between financial institutions to facilitate tradingin financial products in the wholesale financial markets.  It is part of a group of some size : the ICAP group of companies, basedin a number of countries, constitutes the worldâs largest inter-dealer brokerage business.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants, respectively âSecuritiesâ and âCapitalâ, to which collectively I shall refer as âBGCâ, are part of the BGCgroup, which has been âspun offâ from the Cantor Fitzgerald organization, which also conducts inter-dealer broking, albeit ona smaller scale than ICAP.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> At bottom this case is about BGC wishing to expand this new brokerage arm, and pursuant thereto to carve out for itself a significantslice of the Hong Kong/Asian market by means of that which ICAP refers to as the âaggressive poachingâ of its existing staff.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> On 22 March 2005 a total of 33 of ICAPâs Hong Kong employees resigned <i>en masse</i>: a local firm of solicitors, Messrs Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master, was used to deliver to ICAP 33 resignation letters, and there wasat the same time tendered, pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, a sum in excess of HK$17 million to âbuy outâ the notice periods of these employees.  Of the 32 brokers who had resigned, onethought better of his position and subsequently returned to work for ICAP.  This gentleman, a Mr Louis Hiu Shing Chui, has filedevidence outlining the <i>modus operandi</i> adopted by BGC in terms of this mass defection.</p>    <p class="heading">The proceedings to-date</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> On 6 April 2005 the plaintiff, which has been both aggrieved and inconvenienced by what it regards as the calculated emasculationof its business by its fledgling rival, issued its writ.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Among the wide-ranging relief that is sought is injunctive relief against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants, wherein BGC is sought to be restrained from inducing remaining employees of the plaintiff from breaching their contractsof employment, from inducing former employees of the plaintiff from breaching their post-termination obligations owed to the plaintiff,and from making use of information provided by former employees of the plaintiff in breach of obligations owed to the plaintiff. I assume that this latter head refers to allegedly confidential information.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> On the same date as the issuance of proceedings, ICAP issued an <i>inter partes</i> summons returnable in chambers on the next âsummons dayâ, which was Friday 8 April at 10:00 a.m.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> This summons sought abridgment of time.  The application, the terms of which speak for themselves, sought wide-ranging restraintupon the activities of BGC, <i>inter alia</i> from using the services of the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 39<sup>th</sup> defendants (consisting of 32 brokers and 5 back-office/settlement staff) to âeffect or facilitateâ any inter-dealer broking inHong Kong by the BGC group, or in employing or offering to employ in any BGC group business any âprohibited employeeâ (definedto mean any person in the employ of the plaintiff who had not entered into a contract of employment with BGC, or who had not yetresigned from ICAP, or who had been approached by the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants for the purpose of inducing such employees to join BGC).</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, Kitty Mak and Dominica Li, were, prior to their defection to BGC, two senior managers of ICAP, and are perceived to havebeen active movers â ârecruiting sergeantsâ is the evocative phrase â used by BGC in the recruiting process that it had setin train.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> A good deal of other relief was also included within the summons in terms, for example, of disclosure <i>via</i> affidavit evidence identifying who had done what to whom, when and where, although for immediate purposes there is no necessity togo into detail.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> In broad terms, therefore, the interim relief claimed by the plaintiff was aimed at preventing BGC from reaping the fruits of itsalleged wrongdoing and establishing illicit and unfair advantage over ICAP Hong Kong on the basis of what colloquially have becomeknown as âspringboardâ principles.  The plaintiffâs further aim was the prevention of any further stripping out of ICAP employeesby that which it characterized as the illicit means adopted by BGC.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> On Friday 8 April the application was listed before the Hon Suffiad J, the presiding Summons Judge for that Notice had been givenof the application to the defendants, but on any basis the application was short-served.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> It appears that the learned judge in fact never heard the application, even upon an <i>ex parte</i> on notice basis, as he was not satisfied of the urgency of the matter.  He thus stood it over for directions to the following summonsday, that is, 15 April, although it is common ground that he had <i>not</i> shut out the plaintiff from making its application for interim relief on that day notwithstanding that all the evidence germane tothe application would not, by then, have been filed.</p>    <p class="heading">The application on 15 February 2005</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> This, then, was the state of play when the matter finally came before this court at 11:30 a.m. one week later on the next summonsday.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Counsel on behalf of BGC, and counsel on behalf of the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 39<sup>th</sup> defendants, Mr Coleman and Mr Strachan respectively, formally opposed any further interim application by Mr Huggins SC, on behalfof the plaintiff, maintaining that for all practical purposes the plaintiff, as Mr Coleman expressed it, already had had âone biteof the cherryâ before Mr Justice Suffiad, and that the hearing on this day should be no more than a formal call-over and directionsfor the filing of evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> I disagreed with this submission.  I make no comment about the form of procedure adopted before Suffiad J save to say that, withgreat respect, I do not share his view that the plaintiff had demonstrated a lack of urgency in light of the events which had occurred,nor was I sympathetic to Mr Colemanâs consequent submission to the effect that, if (which was denied) it had been urgent a weekago, it was no longer thus.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Accordingly I proceeded to entertain the application by Mr Huggins for at least part of the relief that was envisaged on the faceof the <i>inter partes</i> summons, which by this stage was no longer short served but in terms of which the evidence of all parties had not yet been fullyconstituted; indeed, this application was mounted solely on the basis of the two affidavits filed by Mr Clark, the plaintiffâssolicitor, and that of the aforesaid Mr Louis Hui Shing Chui, the broker who had returned to the ICAP fold.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> This application for interim relief also was made against the backdrop of a decision by this court to conduct the substantive hearingof the summons in the near future, commencing on Wednesday 27 April for two days; in fact, at the same time as hearing this applicationfor immediate relief pending the full hearing of the summons, directions also were made for the filing of evidence necessary forthis forthcoming hearing.</p>    <p class="heading">The argument</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Mr Huggins SC sought interim injunctive relief against the first four defendants only, that is, Securities, Capital, Mak and Li.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> He noted that it was the plaintiffâs case that Mak and Li had conducted the âpoaching expeditionâ whilst still senior employeesof ICAP, and that this had resulted in 37 members of the plaintiffâs staff leaving in two tranches, namely 33 employees on 22 March2005, and a further 4 back office staff on 1 April; he said that it was believed that the staff thus lost had commenced employmentwith the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants on 4 April, or were about to do so imminently.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Absent evidence, of course, it is not yet clear precisely when the departed staff began to work, or will begin to work for Securitiesand Capital, though Mr Strachan from the bar table indicated that, on instructions, 28 of the 32 brokers had not yet begun to workfor BGC, although the 5 âback officeâ staff who had departed indeed had started with their new employer.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> In any event, with the assistance of a detailed skeleton argument Mr Huggins outlined the varying causes of action, in both tortand contract, open to the plaintiff against the 1<sup>st</sup> â 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, and noted that the present application was mounted upon a âspringboardâ relief basis, the purpose of which was todeny a wrongdoer the fruits of his defalcations and thereby to wipe out any illicit and unfair competitive advantage he may havegained : see the summary of the doctrine enunciated by Roxburgh J in <i>Terrapin v. Builders Supply Co. (Hayes) Ltd</i>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%20RPC%20375" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] RPC 375</a>, at 391.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> He stated that pending the hearing which was shortly to follow this court should not shrink from taking immediate decisive actionto protect the interests of the plaintiff, which so clearly had suffered at the hands of the predatory 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants, aided and abetted by the erstwhile senior employees of the plaintiff, Miss Mak and Miss Li.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Mr Huggins further asserted that although he recognized that  âspringboardâ principles originally had been devised for dealingwith breaches of confidence, it now was accepted that the like principles could and should be applied in other kinds of case, ofwhich the present was a prime example.  He said that almost overnight Securities and Capital had been able to become a major competitorto ICAP Hong Kong in areas in which hitherto they had not been competitors at all, whereas at the same time, and consequent uponthese events, in those areas in which it had lost staff ICAP Hong Kong had ceased to be an effective competitor â a âgross reversalâof the previous respective market positions of ICAP Hong Kong and the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> On the other side of the table Mr Coleman and Mr Strachan vigorously objected to any imposition of interim relief pending the hearingof the substantive summons.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> As might be expected, their arguments broadly were similar in nature.  It was not accepted that the âspringboardâ principlescould be adapted for use in cases other than those involving confidential information, and it was maintained that the balance ofmodern authority was set firmly against such expansion of the doctrine.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> It was further asserted that in the particular circumstances of this case that damages were an adequate remedy.  Whilst the plaintiffwas in a position to calculate the scope of its own damages, said Mr Coleman, if and in so far as injunctive relief now was to issue,his clients, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants, could never be in a position to know what profits could have been earned had the incoming employees been permitted tocontinue to work for their new employers.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> In addition, considerable reliance was placed by both counsel upon significant factual developments which had arisen in terms ofthe now-departed employees.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> First, the decision had been taken by the plaintiff to accept the payment of a sum in excess of HK$17 million, as tendered on behalfof the 32 departed brokers, in a âbuy outâ of these employeesâ respective notice periods pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, whilst in terms of the 5 departed back-office/settlement staff although the relevant sums had not been accepted, nevertheless therehad been tender, which in law, it was asserted on behalf of the defendants, had the like effect.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Second, and perhaps more significant, there had been, as Mr Strachan put it, a most substantial and unexplained âflip-flopâ interms of the plaintiffâs attitude toward the departed employees.  This was because a decision had been taken by the plaintiff notonly to accept the monies tendered <i>in lieu</i> of notice on behalf of the departing brokers but also to release these ex-employees from the post termination non-competition restraintscontained in all the contracts save for one, which was that of Miss Mak, the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant.  In the circumstances, Mr Strachan submitted, it was not easy to see why the plaintiff should on the one hand act in thisfashion, so that no remedy lay or could lie against the brokers personally, whilst on the other it should take the decision now topursue the present application upon the âspringboardâ basis.</p>    <p class="heading">Decision</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> In making an urgent decision upon the plaintiffâs application for immediate interim relief pending the hearing, in but 8 days,of the substantive application, I remind myself that I have not yet had the advantage of complete argument (or evidence) relatingto the various issues thrown up by this case.  I am further disinclined presently to say a great deal about the legal merits of thearguments, in particular the extension of the ambit of the âspringboardâ doctrine and the effect of a tender (as opposed to acceptance)of monies pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> It is probably fair to say that until being apprised during the hearing of the express release from the non-competition PTR of theex-employees (with the exception of Miss Mak, and of the 5 back office staff, whose contracts with the plaintiff contained no non-competitionclause), in principle I was sympathetically inclined towards a modified form of such injunctive relief as was requested, it havingbeen made clear to Mr Huggins during argument that any relief which might be granted would only be pending determination of the substantivehearing, and further that, on any basis, at this preliminary stage the court would not afford his client relief in terms of the disclosuresought on the face of the plaintiffâs application.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> In this connection I record that on behalf of his client Mr Coleman was prepared to offer undertakings, which have been acceptedby this court, in terms of paragraph 4(a) of the Writ, which deals with inducing remaining employees of the plaintiff from breachingtheir contracts of employment, and in terms of paragraph 1.4 of the draft Minute of Order, which deals with the destruction/alterationof documents in any form relevant to or generated in the context of the recruitment by BGC of the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 39<sup>th</sup> defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> However my preliminary view of this case â and, as matters currently stand, I emphasise that it must be no more than a preliminaryview â undoubtedly <i>has</i> been affected by the revelation (not dealt with as such within the narrative of the affidavit evidence presently filed on the plaintiffâsbehalf, albeit the relevant letter of release is apparently to be located within the voluminous exhibits) to the effect that, inaddition to the acceptance of the sum tendered in terms of the notice periods of the broker employees, these employees also havebeen released from their contractual post-termination non-competition restraints.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> In this regard, I bear in mind Mr Hugginsâ explanation of the practical problems posed by the limited temporal and spatial elementsof those specific clauses, in terms particularly of potentially facile avoidance by the defendants, but the fact remains that, asmatters now stand, a âspringboardâ injunction, which presently is being advanced very much upon the cusp of the existing jurisprudence,is being pressed against the particular factual backdrop of an exodus of employees who have had paid off their notice obligations,and who, <i>qua</i> employees, have been released from their non-competition PTR and now unequivocally are free to work for whomsoever they wish, includinga competitor of the plaintiff such as BGC.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> I do not wish to elaborate further pending additional evidence and argument and, no doubt, a closer look at the authorities thanwas able to be achieved in the limited time available for the application for interim relief.  Nevertheless, that which now is theunequivocal <i>status quo</i> is a matter which in my view must be factored into the discretionary âmixâ in terms of any decision to grant the truncated interimrelief as now sought.  I would add that, as matters now stand, I am far from convinced that, at bottom, damages would not be an adequateremedy, although I stress that this does not represent a final concluded view.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> I have taken the opportunity to reflect upon this case, and it may well be that I shall have more to say at the conclusion of thesubstantive hearing.  Nor does it need to be stressed, I hope, that my conclusion upon this application for urgent interim reliefis not to be taken as determinative of such judgment as I shall render at the conclusion of that hearing.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> In the circumstances now revealed, however, and in the exercise of my discretion, I have decided to decline to grant the plaintiffâsapplication for interim relief.  I so order.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> I note that it would have been open to the plaintiff, if my current appreciation of the facts is correct, to have made discrete applicationfor injunctive relief against the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, Miss Mak, whose non-compete PTR apparently has <i>not</i> been released.  Nevertheless, demonstrably this was not the basis of the application, which was mounted solely upon the âspringboardâbasis, and in the circumstances I do not consider that it would be fair or appropriate to order any form of interim relief outwiththe ambit of the application as made and met.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> As to costs of this interim application, it is difficult to see why they should not follow the event, but I will hear counsel onthe issue, and in so far as may be necessary I will reserve those costs for decision upon determination of the substantive hearingwhich is to take place in a matter of days.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> I should be grateful if consequent upon this judgment counsel would agree the appropriate form of order for engrossment.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(William Stone)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance<br />            High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Adrian Huggins SC leading Mr David Stokes, instructed by Messrs Deacons, for the plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr Russell Coleman, instructed by Messrs Linklaters, for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants</p>        <p>Mr Mark Strachan, instructed by Messrs Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master, for the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 39<sup>th</sup> defendants</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2005/267.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
