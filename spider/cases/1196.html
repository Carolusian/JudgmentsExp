He suggests that the court should adopt a narrow approach to the interpretation of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)(a)</a> of the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Mr Chan refers to a number of authorities to support his contention that for unliquidated claims for damages for breach of contractand tort, there is no automatic right to appeal even though the damages awarded in the judgment exceeding $1 million.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  I accept that the dispute between the Applicant and the Respondent, as in every probate action, primarily concerns the right toadminister the estate of the deceased.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  However, it is not disputed that as between the Applicant and the Respondent, whoever succeeds in the probate action, would be entitledto the entire estate of the deceased.

My reasons for giving leaveare set out below.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  I consider the Appellant (Applicant) should be given leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.22(1)(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484" class="autolink_findacts">Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance</a> as it is at least reasonably arguable on the Australian and New Zealand cases to which we have been referred that "the appeal involves,directly or indirectly, some claim or question to or respecting property or some civil right amounting to or of the value of $1,000,000or more". </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Although the High Court of Australia in <i>Tipper v Moore</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281911%29%2013%20CLR%20248" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1911) 13 CLR 248</a> referred only to the "matter at issue" limb (i.e. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.35(1)(a)(</a><u><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">1</a></u>) of the Judiciary Act 1903), Latham CJ in the same court in <i>Oertel v Crocker</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1947%5d%2075%20CLR%20261" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1947] 75 CLR 261</a> explained the decision (at 268) by holding that the judgment in <i>Tipper</i> "directly determined claims to property of a value exceeding Â£300" (i.e. s.35(1)(a)(<u>2</u>) of that Act).</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Particularly apposite in the circumstances of the present appeal is, in my view, the observation of OâLeary CJ of the New ZealandCourt of Appeal in <i>In re White</i> <i>(Deceased), Brown and others v Free and others (No.2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1951%5d%20NZLR%20428" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1951] NZLR 428</a> at 431:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The application of the text of the Rule to litigation which was in respect of testamentary capacity is not easy.  It is not apt tofit such a case.  But in the Courtâs view, the real issue is whether the directions of a testatrix regarding the disposition ofapproximately Â£8,000 were valid in law, and the real interest of the respondents is that the testamentary document containing thedirections, which was propounded by them, should be upheld.  To regard the case as not one in which âdirectly or indirectly, someclaim or question to or respecting property or some civil right amounting to or of the value of five hundred pounds sterling or upwardsâseems to us to ignore the realities of the position".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Even if the above view is wrong, and s.22(1)(a) cannot apply to a probate action by reason of a narrow construction of the statute,I consider that the court should exercise its discretion to give leave to appeal under the "or otherwise" ground in s.22(1)(b). Historically, the courts have always attached great importance to the grant of probate, whatever the size of the estate.  Indeed,<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/10/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.3(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/10" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/10">Cap. 10</a> (which is derived from <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/10/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.2(1)</a> Administration of Justice Act 1932, now s.25 Supreme Court Act 1981) gives the court jurisdiction to issue a grant of probate evenwhere the deceased person left no estate.  It is common ground that the estate involved here is very large, many times more thanthe sum where leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal is given as of right in a simple debt action.  It would in my view beincongruous not to grant leave in a probate action involving such a large estate.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  As to costs, this case has since its inception been hard-fought at every turn and it was not at all surprising that three counselappeared for each party.  Although leave has been given, I for one cannot say that Mr Edward Chan SCâs submission against the grantof leave as of right was so devoid of merit as to be frivolous.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  I see no reason to deviate from the usual order that the costs of the application for leave be in the cause of the appeal.</p>    <p class="heading">Hon Waung J:</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I agree with the Judgment of Yeung JA relating to âappeal as of rightâ and âor otherwiseâ.  I also agree with the Judgmentof Yuen JA except as to costs.  I would however like to give my additional reasons why leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appealought to be granted.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  This Application for Leave to Appeal to the Court of Final Appeal is based firstly on the ground that an appeal lies as of rightunder Section 22(1)(a) of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance (âOrdinanceâ) and alternatively on two separate discretionarygrounds firstly of âor otherwiseâ under Section 22(1)(b) and secondly that the questions involved on the proposed appeal areof great general or public importance under Section 22(1)(b) of the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Section 22(1) of the Ordinance provides as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">(a)</td>                <td width="87%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">as of right, from any final judgment of the Court of Appeal in any civil cause or matter, where the matter in dispute on the appealamounts to or is of the value of $1,000,000 or more, or where the appeal involves, directly or indirectly, some claim or questionto or respecting property or some civil right amounting to or of the value of $1,000,000 or more;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td width="87%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">(b)</td>                <td width="87%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">at the discretion of the Court of Appeal or the Court, from any other judgment of the Court of Appeal in any civil cause or matter,whether final or interlocutory, if, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal or the Court, as the case may be, the question involvedin the appeal is one which, by reason of its great general or public importance, or otherwise, ought to be submitted to the Courtfor decision; andâ</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Section 22(1) is in the same format containing materially the same provisions as the previous Order in Council governing appealsfrom Hong Kong to the Privy Council, which itself was also in the same format with materially same or similar statutory provisionsproviding for appeals to the Privy Council from the various colonies and British Dominion territories. (see <i>Bentwick on Privy Council Practice</i>, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. at page 103 which said:  âin nearly every place where the Sovereign has jurisdiction, the conditions of appeal  in accordancewith the royal grant have been laid down by Orders in Council on a uniform scheme.â)  </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The Application for leave to appeal on both grounds is opposed by the Respondent.  There is no dispute between the parties thatthe Judgment of the Court of Appeal, the subject matter of the proposed appeal, is (1) in a civil cause or matter and (2) is final. Mr. Edward Chan SC for the Respondent however disputes everything else in Section 22(1)(a) and (b) as being applicable to the proposedappeal.</p>    <p class="heading">APPEAL AS OF RIGHT</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The case of the Applicant that she has a statutory right of automatic appeal under paragraph (a) of Section 22(1) is put on 2 separatebasis by Mr. Thomas for the Applicant:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(A)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The matter in dispute exceeds $1 million;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(B)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The appeal involves a claim/question respecting property worth in excess of $1 million or a claim/question respecting some civil rightof a value exceeding $1 million.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><u>Matter In Dispute Over 1 Million</u></p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  What is the matter in dispute between the parties.  Of course the validity of the two wills is the subject matter of the contest. But what the two parties are disputing is not merely the validity of the two wills but the entitlement under the two wills to thebeneficial interest in the estate of Teddy Wang (âthe Estateâ).   This is not a case where the Estate was given to various personsunder the will.  In the 1968 Will the Estate was given to the Father.  In the 1990 Will the Estate was given to the Wife.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The matter in dispute in this civil cause (and also on appeal) is therefore the beneficial interest of the Wife and the Father inthe Estate.  That this is so is clearly brought out by the pleadings (see paragraphs 2,3 and 6 of the Statement of Claim and paragraphs3,4 and 6 of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim.)  That is not only the issue in the pleadings but that is also the reality ofthe protracted litigation.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The matter in dispute in the appeal is therefore the entitlement to the Estate or the beneficial interest in the Estate and thereis no doubt that the Estate is in excess of $1 million in value.  It seems to me therefore clearly established by the Applicant thatthe proposed appeal falls within the clear ambit of paragraph (a) of Section 22(1) of the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Authority supports this view of the appeal âas of rightâ when the dispute is over the entitlement to the estate of a deceivedunder a contested will.

One of the three sons contested the will and if successful he would on intestacy be entitled to less than â¤300.  Under the JudiciaryAct of 1903 (in similar terms as the traditional Order in Council or statute governing jurisdiction of appeal to Privy Council) thelimit for appeal as of right is â¤300.  Chief Justice Griffith held that the appellant is a competent suitor because the matterat issue being the estate is of a value over the statutory limit. An appeal therefore lies as of right.     </p>    <p class="heading"><u>Directly Or Indirectly Some Claim Or Question To Or Respecting  Property Or Some Civil Right</u></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The compendium double-headed alternatives under the second part of paragraph (a) of Section 22(1) makes it clear the very wide basisupon which the statute confers the right of appeal to the highest appeal court. The question is whether the proposed âappeal involves,directly or indirectly, some claim or question to or respecting property or some civil right amounting to or of the value of $1,000,000or moreâ.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The pleadings which I referred to earlier clearly show that there was a claim to property namely the Estate, as well as civil right,which in value is over the $1 Million limit.

Cases 181, 187 through <i>Oertel v Crocker</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%2075%20CLR%20261" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) 75 CLR 261</a> (see pages 268, 270, 275) by way of <i>Becker v Marion City Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20AC%20271" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] AC 271</a> at 283-4 (confirming <i>Meghji Lakhamshi v Furniture Worshop</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1954%5d%20AC%2080" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1954] AC 80</a> at 88) all revolve on the criterion of applying the statutory limit value.  Is the statutory limit value to be applied to the wholeof the value of the property simpliciter or to the value of what is to be gained or lost by the judgment sought to be appealed. The Estate in our case and what is to be gained or lost by the Applicant, is of such enormous value that by whatever tests applied,there is no risk that it might fall outside the text of paragraph (a) of Section 22(1)(a).   </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Paragraph (a) of Section 22(1) has a wide ambit, contrary to the narrow way, unsupported by authorities, which Mr. Chan seeks toread down that provision. In this context, the judgment of <i>Re White (No.2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1951%5d%20NZLR%20428" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1951] NZLR 428</a> of the New Zealand Court of Appeal is of interest.  There, the directions in the will regarding disposition of  â¤8,000 was heldby the New Zealand Court of Appeal to be invalid.  The appellant seeks leave to appeal to the Privy Council and contends that appeallies as of right because the matter in dispute is above the statutory limit.  Against the opposition of the respondent, the New ZealandCourt of Appeal accepts that there is appeal as of right.  At page 431 this is said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ and the real interest of the respondents is that the testamentary document â¦ which was propounded by them, should be upheld. To regard the case as not one in which âdirectly or indirectly, some claim or question to or respecting property or some civilright amounting to or of the value of â¦ or upwardsâ seems to us to ignore the realities of the position.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Mr. Chan valiantly sought to argue that there is no right of appeal in this case.  His resort to authorities on limited jurisdictionin respect of divorce appeals and appeals in relation to claims for unliquidated damages does not assist either in the task of reachingproper construction of the statutory words or in understanding the statutory jurisdiction limit to probate actions involving a deceasedperson leaving a substantial estate.            </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  If I have understood the arguments of Mr. Chan correctly, he is contending that no matter how large is the contested estate of thedeceased, all probate actions where the will is contested, fall outside the âas of rightâ appeal given by Ordinance.  The propositionis so extreme and seems to fly against all common sense that I personally have the greatest difficulty in accepting the propositionand the argument supporting that proposition.  Dispute over wills throughout centuries have been one of the most important featuresof the common law proceedings.  The passing of a large estate is of such enormous significance that it is difficult to envisage thatthe Crown and the legislature in all the British Dominion somehow deliberately left it outside the âas of rightâ category andyet no great cases had been argued against such proposition.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  In my view, the opposite is the case.  This explains why there is no authority in support of Mr. Chanâs proposition or argument. There is no authority in support of the jurisdictional exclusion in respect of probate actions contended by Mr. Chan.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  A cursory look into the Law Reports for the period, say the early twentieth century when the Privy Council was occupied with largevarieties of appeals from territories in the British world, reveal the existence of many probate appeals heard by the Privy Councilwhere the subject matter was contested will. In each of these cases, the appeal seemed to have been brought âas of rightâ andnot pursuant to discretionary special leave being given:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"><i>Allan v Morrison</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281900%29%20AC%20604" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1900) AC 604</a> (appeal from New Zealand on lost will);</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"><i>Perrera v Perrera</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281901%29%20AC%20354" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1901) AC 354</a> (appeal from Ceylon on execution);</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"><i>Karunaratne v Ferdanandus</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281902%29%20AC%20405" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1902) AC 405</a> (appeal from Ceylon on partial invalidity of will);</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(4)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"><i>Baudains v Richardson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281906%29%20AC%20169" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1906) AC 169</a> (appeal from Jersey on undue influence);</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(5)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"><i>Craig v Lamoureux</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281920%29%20AC%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1920) AC 349</a> (appeal from Canada on undue influence).</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Against this historical fact, Mr. Chan seeks to argue that by reason of what is called a detected recent change of practice of theCourt of Final Appeal (as sought to be extracted from recent decisions of the Court of Appeal and of the Court of Final Appeal),it is open to us to read down the statutory provision under paragraph (a) so as to shut out all probate appeals from the âas ofrightâ privilege previously conferred by all British Dominion courts and by the Privy Council. With the greatest respect to Mr.Chan I am of the view that he errs both on his premise as well as his conclusion.  The perceived change of practice if any (whichI doubt) is in the context of unliquidated damages appeal.  Even if there was a change of practice, that cannot by itself elevateto a totally opposite construction of paragraph (a).  This is certainly not a course open to us in the Court of Appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In my judgment, the Applicant has plainly made out a clear case of the proposed appeal being competent and âas of rightâ pursuantto Section 22(1)(a) of the Ordinance.  Leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal therefore must be given.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  In addition to the Applicant having satisfied the requirement of paragraph (a), in my view the Applicant has also correctly reliedon paragraph (b), both in respect of âor otherwiseâ as well as by reason of questions of great, general and public importancesought to be raised in the proposed appeal.</p>    <p class="heading">OR OTHERWISE </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  I deal with âor otherwiseâ first because it seems to me that even on the very high burden required for this head, the Applicanthas clearly shown that leave to appeal ought to be given.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  It is of course well known, as was said by Bokhary PJ in <i>Hui Yiu Wing v Regional Council</i> (FAMV 16/2002) that leave under that limb âor otherwiseâ is âan exceptional courseâ.  Le Pichon JA said in <i>Fu Lok Man James v Chief Bailiff of the High Court (No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%202%20HKC%20687" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 2 HKC 687</a> âOnly exceptional circumstances would warrant such leave.â  The same sentiment was also expressed in <i>Hui Shiu-wing v Cheung Yuk-lin</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%20HKLR%20176" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] HKLR 176</a> where reference was made to âcircumstances must be exceptionalâ (per Blair-Kerr J. at page 188) and âpresent any unusual featureeither of law or factâ (page Mills-Owens J. at page 191).  An example of this unusual features being present can be found in <i>Swire Properties v S-J</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%204%20HKC%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 4 HKC 134</a> where Rogers VP granted leave to appeal under the âor otherwiseâ head. </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  By any standard, this case and its appeal must be called exceptional, not only as to the facts, not only as to the persons, notonly as to the amount, not only as to the law but also in terms of everything connected with the proceedings and what have been saidto be unprecedented in practically everything connected with the case.  In many ways, it can be said to be the model of what shouldnot happen in Hong Kong proceedings, probate or otherwise.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Having lived with this case now for some time, speaking for myself, I can only say that if this is not an âor otherwiseâ casethen no case in Hong Kong can ever properly qualify.  For me, it meets even the most stringent requirement set by the Court of FinalAppeal.   </p>    <p class="heading">GREAT GENERAL PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  In the light of Yeung JA not accepting the âgreat general public importanceâ ground, it is necessary for me to say briefly afew words on this discretionary ground.  The Applicant has identified 7 questions under this limb of paragraph 22(1)(b) of the Ordinance. I agree with the Written Submission of the Applicant that these questions, either individually or collectively, by reason of theirgreat general or public importance ought to be considered by the Court of Final Appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  I am of the view that this proposed appeal raises serious and exceptionally important questions of probate law and practice.  HongKong can substantially benefit from guidance from the Court of Final Appeal as to the correct approach in contested cases to theproof of wills and to the inter-relationship between due execution, defence to execution, forgery, pleadings (or lack thereof) andevidence.  What is also of great general public importance is the apparent miscarriage of justice which is alleged (where the Courtof Appeal was divided) and raised for Hong Kong the fundamental question of the constitutional requirements of a fair trial.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  It seems to me that having regard to the complexity of the case, the decision and the reasoning of the Court of Final Appeal onthe proposed appeal is likely to be looked at closely in the future by the legal community of Hong Kong and issues which will bedealt with by the Court of Final Appeal will not be merely confined to the narrow question of whether the signatures in the 1990Document were those of the deceased.  For these reasons, I am of the view that the questions sought to be raised in the proposedappeal are deserving of consideration by the Court of Final Appeal by reason of their great, general or public importance.  </p>    <p class="heading">COSTS</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  I am finally of the view (unfortunately in the minority) that the Applicant is entitled to the costs of the hearing of this Applicationwhich has been substantially increased by reason of the wholly unsuccessful resistance of the Respondent to the Application.  Inmy view, this is a case where it had been staring in the face of all parties that the Court of Final Appeal must inevitably haveto look at the whole matter and it is wholly unreasonable for the Respondent to erect the stiff barricade resistance to the Application. Having regard to the fact that a normal application will have to be made in any event to the Court (attended by junior counsel)and that therefore not 100% of the costs of the Application should be borne by the Respondent, I believe it is only right in thecircumstances, that 90% of the costs of the Application should be awarded to the Applicant against the Respondent. </p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Yeung JA:</b></p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  By a majority decision, costs of the application for leave be in the course of the appeal in the Court of Final Appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"><span>(W Yeung)</span></td>            <td width="34%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"><span>(Maria Yuen)</span></td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(William Waung)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"><span>Justice of Appeal</span></td>            <td width="34%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"><span>Justice of Appeal</span></td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Judge of the Court of <span>First Instance</span></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Edward Chan, SC, Mr Albert Tsang &amp; Mr Victor Luk instructed by Messrs K M Chan &amp; Co for the Respondent (Respondent).</p>        <p>Mr Michael Thomas, SC, Mr Denis Chang, SC, Mr Ramesh Sujanani, instructed by Messrs Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master for the Applicant(Appellant).</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2004/418.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
