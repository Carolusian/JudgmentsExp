(âthe Roads Ordinanceâ) and claimed that the disturbance was caused by the construction of an underpass in SalisburyRoad across Chatham Road South authorized under a Government Gazette Notice No. 3011 published in 2001.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  By an affidavit of Ho Ka Ling Clara (who was an Estate Surveyor of the Lands Department) filed by the Department of Justice dated22 July 2003, it was denied that the road works and road closure were associated with or related to the works under the Gazette Notice3011 published pursuant to the Roads Ordinance.  In view of the denial, the Applicant withdrew its application under the Roads Ordinanceon 3 December 2003 and then submitted the present application to the Lands Tribunal on 23 April 2004 to seek for determination ofcompensation under the Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  However, the Respondentâs expert, Mr. Robert Pendleton, in his report dated 11 December 2004, suggests that the works carriedout in Salisbury Road were not part of the works gazetted under the Ordinance, but under the Roads Ordinance.  The Applicant contendsthat it would be unreasonable, unfair, evasive and irresponsible to argue by the Respondent in this hearing that these works werein fact Road Works and not Railway Works.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Applicant submits that the âclosureâ (in particular the closure along Salisbury Road outside the Premises) was authorizedby the G.N. Notices.  It was never suggested that there were other gazette notices published in relation to the closure of roadsaround the Premises under the Ordinance during the relevant period.  It would be unreasonable to draw any inference that no gazettenotice was published to that effect when the actual works being carried out were Railway Works and roads were actually closed forthat purpose.  It would be even more absurd that, for the closure of roads for Railway construction, the Government would have publisheda gazette notice to close the road under the Roads Ordinance, instead of the Ordinance.  It was therefore reasonable for this Tribunalin deciding the true meaning of the G.N. Notices to look at the entire circumstances including :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)     âThe positionâ taken by the Government that the work was not Road Works; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)    the construction work actually being carried out in this area was Railway Works (or at least included Railway Works);</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  It is not disputed that the closure of the roads should be ordered under section 22 of the Ordinance, and the notice of the ordershould be gazetted under section 23 of the Ordinance.  There is also no dispute that the G.N. Notices covered the closure of sectionsof Middle Road and sections of Nathan Road.  However, it is the Respondentâs case that, although it is not disputed that therewere some construction works being carried out outside the Premises along Salisbury Road during the relevant period, the closurein respect of that part of the work was not authorized under the Ordinance as they were not described in the Schedule of the G.N.Notices.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The issue is therefore whether the closure of a part of Salisbury Road outside the Premises was authorized by the G.N. Notices.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The Applicant submits that it is essential to determine the scope of the affected areas by construing the closure order referredto in the Gazette Notices against the context of section 22 of the Railway Ordinance.  Further, in relation to the question of constructionof the closure order, HH Judge Lam (as he then was) stated in <i>Berwell Trading Limited v. Secretary for Transport</i>, LDMR 6 of 2001, the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â38.     ... How do one determine the areas which were affected?  The answer lies in the Plan No. HH9092A.  It shows the limitsof works area.  Those defined the areas affected.  One may ask rhetorically what was the purpose of identifying such limit if itwere not to show the affected areas.  I cannot think of any.  If fact, if one refers back to Section 5(a) of the Ordinance (whichset out the requirements for the plan), the correlation between the rights affected and the limits of works area is abundantly clear. That section reads as follow:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âWhere the Secretary proposed to execute works ... he shall cause to be prepared a plan delineating the works area, being that areawithin which land many be resumed, easements or other <b>rights in, under or over land</b> may be created or rights <b>affected for the purposes of or incidental to the works or the use</b>.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Thus, the Applicant contends that in defining the closure areas under the section 22 order, it would be quite wrong to construethe G.N. Notices in isolation without having regard to the Scheme and the Plans referred to in both the Scheme and the G.N. Notices.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The Applicant further contends that, on true construction of the Scheme, the drainage works and waterworks were works ancillaryto the Railway Work, and that if roads were closed for these ancillary works within the boundary of the scheme, they were also authorizedclosure under the G.N. Notices.  Relying on the similar analysis of <i>Berwell Trading Limited v. Secretary for Transport,</i> supra., and the Plan TSTE-03/2 as annexed to the Scheme, the Applicant submits that the closure of part of a road outside the Premiseson Salisbury Road were closed for purpose of the Railway Works and was authorized under the G.N. Notices published pursuant to section22 of the Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Although we accept the Applicantâs argument that the plans referred to in the G.N. Notices should be considered in determiningthe scope of the authorized works, we do not accept the Applicantâs other contentions in respect of the scheme.  As submitted bythe Respondent, the mechanism provided by the Ordinance for dealing with works such as the KCRC extension works, which provides thebackground to the Applicantâs claim, is broadly as follows.  Firstly a âschemeâ is devised by which a proposal to build, extendor modify a railway is formulated in a form that sets out its general nature.  A plan is prepared to show the boundaries of the schemewithin which land may be resumed or other rights may be created (section 4 of the Ordinance).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The scheme is gazetted and is open for objection from persons interested (section 10 of the Ordinance).  Following that process,the scheme may be authorized (section 11 of the Ordinance).  Once the scheme has been authorized then it will be necessary from timeto time for specific parcels of land within the scheme boundary to be closed for the physical execution of the works.  This is theprocess described at sections 16 to 19 of the Ordinance in the case of resumptions of land and sections 20 to 25 of the Ordinancefor easements, closures of roads and the like.  Section 22 of the Ordinance is an empowering provision which provides for the Secretaryto authorize, among other things, the closure of roads, or to declare the extent to which, and when, public or private rights mightbe extinguished modified or restricted.  Orders made under section 22 are to be notified in certain specified ways as described insection 23.  These include publication in the gazette.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  We therefore agree with the Respondent that the ambit and extent of a road closure are not defined by the extent of work describedin a scheme, and is not defined by the places where work physically occurs.  The closure is to the extent described in the gazettenotification.  Since the G.N. Notices and the plans therein do not cover Salisbury Road, the works carried out there are not withinthe scope of work authorized by the G.N. Notices.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  There is no dispute that parts of Nathan Road and Middle Road were closed under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/519/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/519" class="autolink_findacts">Railways Ordinance</a> which locations are identified in the G.N. Notices.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Thus, our decision on Issue (a) is that only part of Nathan Road and Middle Road, but not Salisbury Road or other roads, were closedunder <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/519/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22</a> of the Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Issue (b)</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The Applicant relies on the same analysis as in Issue (a) to suggest that the private right of access was extinguished, modifiedor restricted.  Issue (b) is in fact used as an alternative ground to Issue (a).  Since we rule against the Applicant on Issue (a),the same arguments raised by the Applicant for Issue (b) will also fail.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  We agree with the Respondent that the only private right that exists in relation to a highway is that of access to the highway fromthe Applicantâs premises and vice versa.  That right is to be distinguished from the right of passage along the highway (a publicright), or even the right to load goods across the footpath (a public right also): see <i>Berwell Trading Limited v. Secretary for Transport,</i> supra.  That private right exists only at the interface between the premises and the highway â this is an area which has not beenaffected.  The factual evidence is overwhelmingly to the effect that there was clear access to the shopping mall at all times.  Norelevant private right has therefore been extinguished.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Thus, our decision on Issue (b) is that there was no extinction, modification or restriction of any private right of access to thePremises by reason of the road closures.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Issue (c)</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  It is the Applicantâs case that the closure caused access to the Premises adversely affected.  Referring to Stroudâs JudicialDictionary of Words and Phrases, 4<sup>th</sup> Ed. Vol. 1, the Applicant submits that access means âfreedom of passage overâ the pavement abutting the Premises.  The Applicantalso relies on <i>Berwell Trading Limited v. Secretary for Transport,</i> supra. to suggest that âAccess might be affected even though the obstruction created by the works did not occur immediately atthe shop frontâ, and that alternative access to the Premises is not necessary a relevant consideration for the entitlement of compensation(see also <i>Honnex Development Limited and others v. Secretary for the Environment, Transport and Works</i> LDMR No. 3 of 2004).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  However, we do not find the definition of âaccessâ in Stroudâs Judicial Dictionary of any use, as the main reference thereis concerning access for light under the Prescription Act, which is considered in a wholly different context. Section 3 of the PrescriptionAct reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âClaim to the use of light enjoyed for 20 years</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">When the access and use of light to and for any dwelling house, workshop, or other building shall have been actually enjoyed therewithfor the full period of twenty years without interruption, the right thereto shall be deemed absolute and indefeasible, any localusage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding, unless it shall appear that the same was enjoyed by some consent or agreement expresslymade or given for that purpose by deed or writing.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  We agree with H.H. Judge Lam (as he then was) in his approach in the interpretation of âaccessâ in <i>Berwell</i> as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â48. The word âaccessâ was not defined under the Ordinance.  Mr. Houghton submitted that it is a question fact.  He acceptedthat access might be affected even though the obstruction created by the works did not occur immediately at the shop front.  Thismust be correct and there are indeed English authorities to that effect (see <i>Fritz v.

Mr. Lui agreed that this is a question of fact.  He invited me to take into account of the planter in considering the adverseeffects on access.  Mr. Houghton said the Closure Order did not cover the planter.  The scheme annexed to the Plan described theworks as including landscaping works.  The planter was part of the landscaping works as shown in Drawing No. HH9737A.  In view ofmy above decision on the scope of the Closure Order, I hold that Mr. Lui is entitled to rely on the planter as part of the affectedfootpaths in the second part of the Closure Order.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">50.     Having visited the site and examined the photos with such knowledge, I must say I do not find the access to the Applicantâsshop being interfered with whether by the columns supporting the footbridge, the staircase or the planter.  There is ample spaceto enable visitors to go in and come out of the shop.  I do not think it can properly be said that access to the Applicantâs shophas become more difficult than before.  In this connection, it is necessary to distinguish between access to the shop and pedestrianflow along the shop front.  According to the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, the relevant meaning of the word âaccessâin the context of access to a place is âcoming into the presence of or into contact with; approach, entranceâ.  The fact thatthe columns at some distance away from the shop front and the planter would cause inconvenience to the pedestrians walking alongthe pavement does to necessarily mean that access to the shop is affected.  In the present case, I find as a fact that the accessto the shop of the Applicant was not adversely affected after the construction works have been completed.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">51.     In coming to such conclusion, I consider that question purely from the access at the shop front.  I do not accept the submissionof the Respondent that I should decide that there was no adverse effect because of the existence of an alternative access.  I myjudgment, even if there were another access, this does not mean that the access to the shop at the main entrance was not affected. It is a question of fact and it may depend on how people usually approach the shop.  In the present case, the shop front being theone facing the main road, I have no doubt that we are dealing with the main access to the shop there.  The so-called alternativeaccess had been blocked up and in any event, it was adjacent to a refuse collection point.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">52.     My conclusion in Paragraph 50 above is fortified by the requirement that under Item 4 of Pt II of the Schedule, compensationis only payable in respect of the extinction, modification or restriction of a <b><u>private right</u></b> in respect of, a road or part of a road.  In other works, there is no compensation for the extinction, modification or restrictionof a <b><u>public right</u></b> in respect of, a road or part of a road even if that exercise affects the access to the premises adversely.  The distinction betweenprivate rights and public rights regarding access to highway was summarized in <i>Winfield &amp; Jolowicz on Tort</i> , 15<sup>th</sup> Edn. p 530:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIt is clear that the right of passage along the highway is a public right and that interference with it is remediable by an actionfor public, not private, nuisance. â¦  However, the owner of property adjoining the highway has a common law right of access tothe highway which is a private right remediable by an action of private nuisance, so that anything which prevents his access (asopposed to making it less convenient for his purposes) enables the recovery of at least nominal damages.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">53.

But immediately that he has stepped on to the highway, and is using the highway, what he is using is not a private right, but a publicright.ââ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Thus, whether an access is adversely or is not adverselyaffected is a matter of fact for the determination of this Tribunal.  TheApplicant contends that an access to the Premises was adversely affectedwhen</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)     it was reduced to an unreasonable width; or</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)    the obstruction  hindered customers from resorting to the Premises for business purposes.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> The Applicant alleges that in the course of the Construction Works, the direct access to the Premises was diverted and severely curtailed. As a consequence, the entire network of accessibility to the Premises was derailed so that the access to the Premises was adverselyaffected and the business of the Applicant was thus seriously jeopardized.  Although part of the passage left for access to the Premiseswas as wide as 2 m, some other parts of the passage left for access to the Premises was less than 1 m.  The pavement serving thePremises were, therefore, not spacious enough to accommodate the desirable flow of pedestrian along the roads during the affectedperiod.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The Applicant also submits that in determining to what extent an access is or is not adversely affected, the Tribunal should notapply an arbitrary judgment, but should rely on the standard of minimum width of pavement based on:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)     standard in Hong Kong Planning Standards and Guidelines (âHKPSGâ); and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)    standard requirement stated in Code of Practice for Lighting Signing and Guarding of Road Works (âCode of Practiceâ).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The Respondent disagrees with the Applicantâs contentions and alleges that a reasonable width was left for access to the Premises.

This is of no relevance at all to the question before us, namely whether there was a diminutionin the pedestrian access to the Premises itself.  The production of photographs and diagrams by the Applicantâs expert, Mr. Koh,does not help, as he has no personal knowledge of any of the details contained in those photographs, and could not identify by whomthey were taken or, for the most part, when they were taken.  The fact that he has been given photographs by somebody with datesallocated to them does little to improve the quality of this evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> The Respondent, on the other hand, called 3 factual witnesses, all of whom were responsible for inspecting and recording the workin the context of maintenance of pedestrian traffic flow as it was carried out from time to time.  The contemporaneous records areexhibited to their statements and speak for themselves in large part.  As was clear from their oral evidence, inspections took placeweekly in the earlier part of the work and bi-weekly in the later part.   The Applicant only challenges that these were âsnapshotsâtaken at those intervals and that the witnesses were not able to say what may have happened on-site in between the particular dateson which inspections took place.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> However, the Applicantâs photographs are also âsnapshotsâ.  Even though they can be viewed together with the Respondentâsphotographs as submitted by the Applicant, they are still spaced out in time.  Paragraph 4(2) of Part I of the Schedule to the Ordinanceprovides that âNo disturbance payment is payable for any interference with a trade or business if the interference does not lastfor more than 14 days.â  The Applicant simply fails to adduce such evidence that can prove disturbance lasting for more than 14days.  The main disturbance relied on by the Applicant is that some parts of the passage left for access to the Premises had a widthof less than 1 m.  However, from the photographs, it seems that such disturbance, if any, could just be temporary, as they were causedby some temporary structures.  There is no proof that they lasted for more than 14 days.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Moreover, the Applicant relies on the aforesaid guidelines to provide for the context within which the requirement of a reasonablewidth for access can be considered.  However, it is difficult to understand how these guidelines may be relevant when the standardprovision of a passageway under the guidelines is 4.5 m width, which is probably greater than the width of the pavement even whenno road works are being undertaken.  We accept the evidence as stated in the reports of the Respondentâs expert witness, Mr. Lam,who did not give oral evidence, that those guidelines are related to forward planning; development control; plan implementation;and improving quality of life.  None of those are applicable to the circumstances of these road works.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Mr. Lam also states in his reports that KCRC was requested generally to maintain a minimum footway width of 2 m, or 1.5 m in somecritical locations for a short period of time where maintaining a 2 m wide footway was physically impossible.  Thus, there shouldnot be any assumption that a footway of less than 1 m would be maintained for longer than 14 days.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> As to the 2<sup>nd</sup> limb of the Applicantâs contention that an access to the Premises was adversely affected, i.e. where obstruction hindered customersfrom resorting to the Premises for business purposes, there is simply no evidence to support that contention at all.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Thus, we are not satisfied that the Applicant has discharged the burden of proving any disturbance that can be compensated underthe Ordinance.  Our decision on Issue (c) is that access to the Premises was not adversely affected because of the matters referredto in Issue (a) or (b).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Issue (d)</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> The business of the Applicant is in real estate investment, and its major source of income is rental.  The Applicant submits thatit was bound to suffer loss from the interference with its trade and business if the access to the Premises was insufficient andaffecting the business of the retailers and their ability to pay rent.  However, as we have decided that access to the Premises wasnot adversely affected as a result of the closure of roads, there would not be such loss suffered by the Applicant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Thus, our decision on Issue (d) is that there was no disturbance resulting from the road closure.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Issue (e)</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> It is common ground between the parties that the Ordinance provides an exclusive source of the right to compensation for works ofthis nature.  Compensation is available to property owners in circumstances in which public works such as those involved in thiscase are undertaken and which cause a specified degree of disturbance to such property owners.  To come within the Ordinance, thefollowing have to be established by the Applicant:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) the closure of a road or part of a road; or</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) the extinction, modification or restriction of a private right in respect of a road or part of a road; and</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) those matters were caused by Section 22 of the Ordinance; and</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d) because of these matters, access to any land is adversely affected.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Issues (a) to (d) are in fact formulated to establish whether the Applicant is entitled to compensation by considering the abovefactors.  In view of our decisions on Issues (a) to (d) above, it is clear that the Applicant fails to establish that it is entitledto compensation under the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Thus, our decision on Issue (e) is that the Applicant is not entitled to statutory compensation under section 32 and Item 4(a) and(b) of Part II of the Schedule of the Ordinance.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Since the Applicant fails on all the above issues, we dismiss the application herein and make an order nisi that the Applicant dopay the costs of the application to the Respondent with certificate for counsel to be taxed on High Court Scale if not agreed.  Ifthere is no further application on costs within the next 14 days, the costs order nisi shall become absolute.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">H.H.
