The plaintiff was previously the registered owner of 19 âLEADWELLâtrademarks (including the 13 impugned trademarks) in 18 countries including the USA, EU, UK, Taiwan, the Mainland and Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> In 2004, the plaintiffâs key financial indicators were as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) capital : NT$613 million (or HK$153 million);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) assets : NT$1,222 million (or HK$305 million);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) worldwide sales : NT$1,512 million (or HK$400 million);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) Hong Kong sales : NT$65 million (or HK$16 million); and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5) profits before tax : NT$91 million (or HK$23 million).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The plaintiffâs machines involve the cutting edge in computer and machinery technology, boasting âzero defectâ.  It claimedto be Taiwanâs best in research and development and quality control.  It won many awards and achieved relevant standards internationally. It has reputation and goodwill both in Taiwan and internationally.  There are many Hong Kong factories specifying the use of theâLEADWELLâ machines on their websites.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> According to an expert report, the current value of the âLEADWELLâ trademarks worldwide is worth about NT$40 million (or HK$10million).</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The defendant was incorporated in Hong Kong in December 2001.  Initially, the two shareholders and directors were: Terrence Chang(51%) and Li Tat-cheung (49%).  In December 2004, Terrence Chang resigned as directors and transferred his shares to Li.  Previously,Terrance Chang was the Manager of International Sales of the plaintiff before he resigned in February 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiff was founded by Dr Paul Chang.  Since its incorporation and until September 2000, Dr Chang was the Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer of the plaintiff.  In June 2000, Dr Chang wrongfully and without consent and authority caused the plaintiff toassign to himself 14 of the 19 of the âLEADWELLâ trademarks (except for Taiwan, the Mainland, Italy, Korea and Indonesia).</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> After his resignation from the plaintiff, Dr Chang founded the Leaderway Machinery Co., Ltd (âLeaderwayâ).  Terrence Chang joinedLeaderway as the Chief Operating Officer.  The 14 registered trademarks were subsequently assigned by Dr Chang to Leaderway.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Dr Chang was prosecuted and convicted of the offence of breach of trust in the District Court in Taichung.  His appeal to the SupremeCourt in Taipei was dismissed and he was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> In November 2001, the plaintiff obtained a prohibition order (or injunction) in Taiwan against Leaderway in dealing with the assignedtrademarks.  In January 2002, Leaderway entered into an agreement to assign the 14 registered trademarks to the defendant.  In March2002, the Taiwanese injunction was served on Leaderway.  In April 2002, Leaderway assigned the 14 registered trademarks to the defendant. Terrence Chang executed the assignment for Leaderway, and Li for the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The defendant became the registered owner of 13 of the 14 assigned trademarks including in Hong Kong.  The registration in Australiawas not successful by reason of the Taiwanese injunction.</p>    <p class="heading">Plaintiffâs claim</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The plaintiffâs claim against the defendant is based on :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) restitution of property knowingly received in breach of trust by the defendant;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) passing-off.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Proprietary claim</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Mr Wong for the plaintiff submitted that the Terrence Chang, being the Chief Operating Officer of Leaderway, must have known of thebreach of trust by Dr Chang.  As at the assignment to the defendant, Terrence Chang was also a shareholder and director of the defendant. The knowledge of Terrence Chang should be imputed to the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Further, the defendant has apparently obtained the assignment at undervalue.  The âLEADWELLâ trademarks are worth about HK$10million.  Li said that he paid US$100,000 (or HK$780,000) for the 14 trademarks.  Looking at the figures for 2001, the plaintiffâsglobal sales were US$28 million (or HK$223 million), and the contribution to the sales by Taiwan, the Mainland and Italy amountedto about 40%.  Rateably reduced in accordance with 2001 sales figures as well as contribution by countries, the value of the 14 assignedtrademarks in 2001 should be about HK$3 million.  Hence, there is <i>prima facie</i> a sale at undervalue at HK$780,000.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Further, Liâs explanation of the setting up of the defendant and sudden withdrawal of Terrence Chang from the defendant was highlysuspicious.  Li has hitherto worked for the family business of metal manufactory.  He said he met Terrence Chang who helped him toacquired the trademarks, set up the factory in Dongguan, and impart all the necessary know how of CNC technology.  Terrence Changwas given the majority shares subject to his promise to give them back to Li once the business was on the way.  Then Terrence Changbroke away completely and there was no connection with Leaderway.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Mr Wong submitted that CNC was at the cutting edge technology and it was unbelievable that the defendant could carry on without thetechnical support such as from Leaderway.  In March 2005, the plaintiff engaged private investigator to pose as prospective customer. The visit to the defendantâs registered office revealed that it only used a desk in the office of another company for messageredirection.  Later, a Mr Li returned call to the investigator, and referred the investigator to the website of Leaderway for furtherinformation.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Li said he used up his savings and invested HK$2 million in the defendant.  Deducting HK$780,000 on the trademarks, the balance wasHK$1.2 million.  Li said he set up a production line for 10 machines per month in Dongguan.  Monthly expenditure amounted to HK$40,000.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Mr Kao Yu-lung, the General Manager of the plaintiff said that the setting up costs of a production line of 10 CNC machines per monthwould be NT$80 to 100 million (or HK$20 to 25 million).  The line would have to be operated by six technicians and 16 less skilledworkers.  The monthly costs would far exceed HK$40,000.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Mr Wong submitted that Liâs story is simply incredible.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> On the other hand, Mr Szeto for the defendant submitted that the defendant was a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice, and Li had fallen victim to the internal dispute between the plaintiff and Dr Chang.  Mr Szetosubmitted that the plaintiff has a low chance of success.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Mr Szeto pointed out that the plaintiffâs pleaded case is that Terrence Changâs knowledge should be imputed to the defendant. He submitted that where a person is a director of two companies, his knowledge of the affairs of one company is not imputed to theother company as a matter of law unless there is a duty on him to communicate it.  Mr Szeto referred to <i>Advance Distribution Co. Ltd v. Shun Yip Ltd &amp; ors</i><i> </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%202%20HKLRD%20493" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 2 HKLRD 493</a>, 500 A-C where Stone J cited with adoption from Nourse LJ in <i>El</i><i> Ajou v.

Mr Szeto referred to <i>Arab Bank Plc v. Zurich Insurance Co.</i> [1999] 1 Lloydâs R 262 where Rix J held that in the insurance context, as outside it, a directorâs knowledge was not to be attributedto his company whether as the knowledge of the company itself or as knowledge which in the ordinary course of business that companyis to be inferred or deemed to know, to the extent that his knowledge is of his own acting in fraud of his company.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> As to sales at under value, Mr Szeto said he could not argue with the figures.  However, there is no evidence that the defendantknew of the sales figures at the time of the assignment, and an adverse inference should not be drawn that he knowingly entered intothe transaction at undervalue.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Mr. Wong replied that in <i>El Ajou v. Dollar Holding Plc,</i> knowledge was sought to be imputed on two alternative bases : (1) agency of common directorship, and (2) directing mind and willof the company.  The plaintiff there failed on (1), but succeeded on (2).  At 695 g-h, Nourse LJ referred to Viscount Haldane LCin <i>Leonards Carrying Co. Ltd v. Asiatic Petroleum Co. Ltd</i> [1915] 705 at 713 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMy Lords, a corporation is an abstraction.  It has no mind of its own any more than it has a body of its own; its active and directingwill must consequently be sought in the person of somebody who for some purpose may be called an agent, but who is really the directingmind and will of the corporation, the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Mr Wong submitted that at the time of the assignment to the defendant, Terrence Chang was the majority shareholder and director ofthe defendant.  This is evidence that he was the directing will and mind of the defendant.  Therefore, his knowledge can be imputedto the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The objective facts that Terrence Chang was a common director of Leaderway and the defendant, and the assignment to the defendantwas at undervalue form part of the factual matrix where inference as to knowledge may be drawn.  <i>Prima facie,</i> the allegation that Li did not know of the value of the assigned trademarks and relied totally on Terrence Chang seems to be contraryto business sense in the context of multi-million dollar business of cutting edge technology.  The evidence may even suggest thatthe defendant was a front and not victim of Leaderway as the investigator was referred to Leaderwayâs website upon enquiry aboutthe defendantâs business.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> In all the circumstances, I find that there is a serious question to be tried on knowing receipt of trust property.</p>    <p class="heading">Passing-off</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Mr Wong submitted that even if the plaintiff were unable to prove knowledge on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff could stillsucceed on the basis of passing off.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> In <i>Consorzio del Prociutto di Parma v.

These are three in number.  First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which hesupplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying âget-upâ (whether it consists simply of a brandname or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services areoffered to the public, such that the get-up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiffâs goods orservices.   Secondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leadingor likely to lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiffâ¦ Thirdly,he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in a <i>quia timet</i> action, that he is likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendantâs misrepresentation thatthe source of the defendantâs goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Mr Wong referred to <i>Wadlow on The Law of passing-Off</i> (3<sup>rd</sup><sup> </sup>ed., 2004) at 3-155 for the following proposition :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe most important restriction is that goodwill cannot be assigned or otherwise dealt with in gross, but must remain in the sameownership as the business to which it relates.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Mr Wong submitted that the defendantâs intention that it it would acquire the goodwill of the plaintiff but ineffectually withoutacquiring the accompanying business is irrelevant.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Mr Wong submitted that the plaintiff was and still is carrying on the business under the trade name of âLEADWELLâ in Taiwan andinternationally including Hong Kong.  The defendant must be taken to have recognized to the goodwill attaching to the trade nameâLEADWELLâ as he was prepared to expend US$100,000 on the assignment, a sum not insubstantial in itself.  He must have knownthat the business and goodwill in Taiwan was not assigned, and the plaintiff was still exploiting the goodwill in Taiwan.  Therewas no evidence of any negotiation nor agreement as to any business arrangement with the plaintiff.  The defendant must have knownthat the machines it proposed to manufacture were not those coming from the plaintiff.  Hence, he must be passing off his own goodsas those of the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Mr Szeto submitted on the basis that the defendant is a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice, there is no misrepresentation for passing-off.  I take it that Mr Szeto is actually referringto the defence of ostensible authority of Dr Chang in the chain as assignments.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> The copies of the assignments successively from the plaintiff to Dr Chang, then to Leaderway and ultimately to the defendant aresubject to further discovery.  Some of the assignments stated assignment of the trademarks with the goodwill, others simply the referredto the trademarks themselves.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Be that as it may, I suppose that if a registered owner is willing to assign or grant permission to an assignee to append the registeredtrademark to whatever goods of the assignee, there is nothing untoward about it.  It is all a matter of contract and the common intentionof the parties.  Assuming the defendant is seeking to bind the plaintiff to the assignment on the ostensible authority of Dr Cheng,it is still a matter of finding out the common intention of the parties as to the true purport of the bargain in the factual matrixof the case.  At the moment, apart from the assignment itself, there is scant evidence of the business arrangement reached betweenthe defendant and the plaintiff (or whichever owner of the same mark for the unassigned markets) as to the respective use of theâLEADWELLâ trademark.  Perhaps ultimately, as suggested by Mr Szeto, one still have to consider the breach of trust of Dr Chengand whether the defendant could be affixed with knowledge of it.  Given my finding of a serious question to be tried on knowing receipt,it does not really befalls me to come to any view on passing-off at this stage.</p>    <p class="heading">Balance of convenience</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Mr Wong submitted that the plaintiff has a strong case in proprietary claim.  The injunction granted by Yam J should be continuedin order to preserve the subject matter of the litigation.  Otherwise, any remedy of restitution would be rendered nugatory by reasonof the disposal to third parties.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Mr Wong submitted that the use of the âLEADWELLâ trademark will cause irreparable damage to the plaintiff.  The defendantâshigh end/low end argument will exactly prove the point.  Mr Wong submitted that CNC machines are at the cutting edge of technology. There is simply no place for any low end product.  Notwithstanding the impossibility of the low setting up costs of HK$1.2 million,even if it were ever true that the defendant would produce a low end CNC machine, it is bound to be of inferior quality, and itsbearing of an identical trademark over product which the plaintiff has no control over will cause irreparable damage to the reputationand goodwill of zero defect built up over 25 years.

The plaintiff has a valuablegoodwill built up over 25 years.  The defendant is at a preparatory stage and with production yet to start.  There is nothing tostop the defendant to produce the machines save not to use the impugned trademark.  Even if the defendant were to succeed at trial,the plaintiffâs financial position will guarantee satisfaction of any damages to the defendant.  On the other hand, the defendantâsadmitted limited resources will mean irreparable damage to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Mr Szeto submitted that there is no evidence of damage, deception or confusion.

Whether any name is an instrument of fraud will depend upon all the circumstances. A name which will, by reason of its similarity to the name of another, inherently lead to passing off is such an instrument.  Ifit would not inherently lead to passing off, it does not follow that it is not an instrument of fraud.  The court should considerthe similarity of the names, the intention of the defendant, the type of trade and all the surrounding circumstances.  If it be theintention of the defendant to appropriate the goodwill of another or enable others to do so, I can see no reason why the court shouldnot infer that it will happen, even if there is a possibility that such an appropriation would not take place.  If, taking all thecircumstances into account the court should conclude that the name was produced to enable passing off, is adopted to be used forpassing off and, if used, is likely to be fraudulently used, an injunction will be appropriate.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It follows that a court will intervene by way of injunction in passing-off cases in three types of case.  First, where there is passingoff established or it is threatened.  Secondly, where the defendant is a joint tortfeasor with another in passing off either actualor threatened.  Thirdly, where the defendant has equipped himself with or intends to equip another with an instrument of fraud.
