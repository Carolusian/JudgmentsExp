</p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  This is an assessment of damages in a fatal accident claim brought by the plaintiff, the widow of Lung Kai Hon, deceased, who diedunnecessarily in a tragic fatal traffic accident that occurred on 22 October 2004. His death was caused by the defendants, the driversof two public light buses, who, whether for reasons of road rage or otherwise, decided to engage in road racing. Their dangerousdriving resulted in a traffic accident that caused fatal injuries to the deceased who had the misfortune to be one of the passengerson board of one of the public light buses. The accident occurred because the public light buses had entered the junction of KingâsRoad and Health Street East when the traffic lights were showing red to them, resulting in multiple collisions with a taxi and thetwo public light buses. The defendants were rightly charged, convicted, and sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years for dangerous drivingcausing the death of the deceased. Their insurers, very sensibly, consented to interlocutory judgment to be entered in this actionfor the damages to be assessed.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The deceased was aged 58 at the time of his death.  He was a sole proprietor of a fruit and vegetable wholesale business, underthe name of Tai Cheong, supplying fruits and vegetables to restaurants in Central, Admiralty, Lan Kwai Fong and SoHo.  He left ashis dependant, his widow, Madam Fung Suen Sim, a housewife who was aged 61 at the date of the assessment.  There is a dispute asto whether his son, Mr. Lung Wai Kai, born on 5 June 1972 and aged 39 at the time of the assessment, and his daughter, Ms. Lung MeiYi, born on 8 March 1982 and aged 29 at the time of the assessment, were dependent on the deceased at the time of his death.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  It is common ground that the deceased operated his business, in the name of Tai Cheong, initially, out of a stall in Central Marketand, later, out of a stall at the Western Wholesale Food Market.  Tai Cheong commenced business in September 1999.  Before then,the deceased had assisted his elder brother in a similar business for some 25 years, before he fell out with his brother and venturedout on his own.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The schedule of property attached to the Letters of Administration granted by the Probate Registry showed that the estate of thedeceased held assets to the value of almost HK$4 million and had trading debts of the firm called Tai Cheong, of which the deceasedhad been the sole proprietor, of about HK$176,000.  Most of the assets were money deposits in various bank accounts as well as inthe bank accounts of Tai Cheong.  His assets also comprised a Â½ share in an apartment in Kwan Yick Building in Des Voeux Road West. This was jointly owned by the deceased and his elder brother as tenants-in-common.  It was purchased on 18 January 1991 for thesum of HK$250,000.A mortgage was not taken against this property and the purchase price had been paid outright.  During his lifetime,he also owned a Â½ share as a joint tenant, together with the plaintiff, in two other properties :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) an apartment in Sun Shing Mansion in Queenâs Road West had been purchased on 31 December 1985 for the price of just under HK$360,000with the assistance of a mortgage loan in the sum of HK$200,000 which was subsequently repaid and discharged on 5 August 1988;</p>        <p>(2) an apartment in Kornhill purchased on 26 May 1998 for the price of HK$4,420,000 which had been purchased with the assistance ofa mortgage loan in the sum of only HK$700,000 and which had also been repaid and discharged, some 14 months later, on 30 July 1999.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  As these two properties were owned by the deceased as a joint tenant with the plaintiff, they did not form part of his estate butdevolved to the surviving joint tenant, his widow, upon his death.  The Sun Shing flat had been the family home until the purchaseof the Kornhill flat.  After its purchase, the family moved to live in Kornhill and the Sun Shing flat was rented out and produceda monthly rental which the deceased had allowed the plaintiff to keep.  It was common ground that, as the widow inherited this propertyupon the death of her husband, she could not claim as part of her loss of dependency, the loss of rental from this property.  IfI may borrow the colourful metaphor adopted by Staughton LJ in <i>Wood v Bentall Simplex Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] PIQR p.332</a> at p.348 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âCan the dependants inherit the goose and still claim that they have been deprived of eggs?â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In that case, the dependant widow and sons enjoyed the income derived from the deceasedâs farming business and Staughton LJ recognised(at p.349) that if they had inherited the source of the income upon which they were dependant, they had not lost it.  The same principleapplies here.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  It was the plaintiffâs evidence that the purchase of the three properties, in which the deceased had an interest, was funded fromhis earnings during the time when he was assisting his elder brother.  A substantial part of those earnings consisted of bonus entitlementswhich had been accumulated and which were only be paid when the deceased needed money to purchase the Kornhill flat in 1998 and whenthe plaintiff left the brotherâs business.  A balance payment by his brother of his accrued bonus enabled him to discharge theoutstanding mortgage on the Kornhill flat in July 1999.  It is therefore correct to say that the accumulation of the deceasedâswealth in the form of these three properties was not achieved from any profits that he made as the sole proprietor of Tai Cheong. However, his ability to work hard and to accumulate bonuses in the course of his 25 years of work in his elder brotherâs businesscertainly bodes well for his ability to carry on a profitable enterprise as the sole proprietor of Tai Cheong which, in turn, wouldenable him to continue to accumulate wealth in the future if he had not met with this accident.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  It is also not disputed that, on average, the deceased used to give the plaintiff HK$30,000 per month for her personal and householdexpenses and that, but for the accident, the deceased would have continued, at least until the end of his working life, to supportand maintain the plaintiff in the same manner as he had done before the accident.    </p>    <p class="heading"><i>THE INCOME OF TAI CHEONG</i></p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The proper assessment of damages in the present case requires a determination of the profits generated by the business of Tai Cheong,from its commencement in September 1999 to the time of his death in October 2004.  The plaintiff gave evidence before me and I accepther as a truthful witness.  She said that when the deceased started his business he operated from a stall in Central Market beforelater moving to the Western Wholesale Food Market in Sai Ying Pun.  He ran the business by himself and only employed two deliveryworkers.  He kept his own accounts and filed tax returns.  He kept the business records in carton boxes in the stall and recordedhis business transactions on his computer.  Although she herself was a housewife all along, on occasion, she would help the deceasedin carrying on the business of Tai Cheong by spending some time in the stall and taking orders on the telephone from customers.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  I accept the plaintiffâs evidence and find that the deceased was a very hardworking man, who spent most of his time running hisbusiness in the fruit and vegetable stall in the Western Wholesale Market.  He was an extremely frugal person and a caring fatherand husband.  The deceased took his breakfast and lunch outside and only had dinner at home.  He did not gamble and did not haveany bad habits, according to the plaintiff.  He was very fond of his work.  He was very interested in making money.  He did not spendmuch on entertainment as he was always working.  The deceased was very hardworking and used to work from 4 a.m. in the morning everyday, unless it was a Sunday or a holiday, until 6 or 7 p.m. in the evening.  He worked every day of the year except for 3 days duringChinese New Year holidays when his stall would be closed.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  5 months after he commenced the business of Tai Cheong, he started, in February 2000, to pay to the plaintiff the monthly sum ofHK$30,000 for the household expenses and for her own purposes.  He either paid her in cash or by transfer to the bank account ofthe plaintiff.  The plaintiff was a housewife and had no income of her own other than from some small investments in stocks and foreignexchange, and interest income from fixed deposits.  She handled the deceasedâs finances.  Most of his accumulated bonus had beenpaid by his elder brother directly into the account of the plaintiff.  Indeed, the greater part of the purchase price of the Kornhillflat came from the plaintiffâs bank account.  The plaintiff gave evidence that, after she had made all the payments in respectof the Kornhill flat in July 1999, she still had about HK$1 million in her accounts consisting of cash deposits, foreign currencyand shares.  Indeed, her own savings account showed a credit balance in excess of HK$1 million on 9 November 1999.  The deceasedâsown savings account on 11 November 1999 had an opening balance just above HK$600,000.  This sum represented this accumulated savingsfrom the past and could not have come from Tai Cheongâs profits as Tai Cheong had just commenced business in September of thatyear.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The money that the plaintiff invested in shares and foreign currencies and kept on fixed deposits came from the accumulated bonuspayments of the deceased, which had been paid to her by his elder brother, and, after the brothers had separated, from the incomeof the deceased in the business of Tai Cheong.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The plaintiff does not have personal knowledge of the profits earned by Tai Cheong in the 5 years from September 1999, when thebusiness commenced up, until October 2004, when the business came to an abrupt end because of the death of the deceased.  She collectedthe business records of Tai Cheong to try to establish his net income after expenses.  The plaintiff relied on 3 sets of unauditedprofit and loss accounts prepared by a firm of accountants called South China CPA Ltd. which were dated 1 December 2008.  They relatedto the tax years ended 31 March 2003, 31 March 2004 and the 7-month period from 1 April to 30 October 2004.  These accounts wereprepared by South China CPA Ltd. after the death of the deceased on the instructions of the plaintiff and were based on documentshanded over to them by the plaintiffâs son.  These documents included the bank statements and bank passbooks of the business, chequebook stubs, monthly turnover reports, invoices issued by Tai Cheong to its customers, invoices issued by fruit and vegetable suppliersfrom whom Tai Cheong obtained the goods which they sold to their customers, the personal savings account passbook of the deceased,and the profit and loss accounts prepared by the deceased which were appended to his tax returns.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The monthly turnover reports provided reliable evidence of the monthly sales achieved by Tai Cheong. Ms. Selina Lau, who appearedfor the defendants, was correct to submit that they provided only half the picture, on the revenue side, but told us nothing aboutthe cost of sales and overhead expenses.  More compelling evidence than these monthly turnover reports were the bank statements fromTai Cheongâs savings account.  Annex I to the closing submissions of Mr. H.Y. Wong, who appeared for the plaintiff, showed theamounts deposited into this savings account from October 1999 up to October 2004, including further deposits by way of autopay andcheque deposits, in the total amount of HK$81,552.85, after October 2004 up to December 2004.  I accept and find as a fact that allincome from sales by Tai Cheong was deposited into Tai Cheongâs savings account, either by the deposit of cheques issued by itscustomers in favour of Tai Cheong or by autopay arrangements whereby its customers directly paid into Tai Cheongâs savings accountthe price of goods purchased by them.  As can be seen from Annex I, Tai Cheong received a sum of just under HK$2 million as proceedsfrom sales from October 1999 up to March 2000, a sum slightly above HK$6.8 million as proceeds of sales from the financial year ended31 March 2001, and a sum slightly above HK$6.58 million as proceeds of sales for the year ended 31 March 2002.  Sales were down inthe year ended 31 March 2003, which coincided with the advent of SARS and its aftermath that kept most people at home and resultedin a territory-wide substantial downturn in restaurant business.  The downturn continued for a considerable period of time and wasreflected in the sales figures of Tai Cheong for the year ended 31 March 2004, in a total sum that was slightly above HK$3.6 million. The proceeds of sales paid into Tai Cheongâs savings account from April to December 2004 were just short of HK$2 million.  Thefact that the payments were made even after the death of the deceased demonstrated that Tai Cheong afforded credit payment termsto its customers which is what one would expect in this business.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Annex III to the plaintiffâs closing submissions shows the deposits that were made into the plaintiffâs savings account fromTai Cheongâs savings account from August 2000 up to October 2004.  Although Tai Cheongâs savings account statements for thisperiod were unavailable, the deposits, made into the plaintiffâs account between 1 December 1999 and 3 July 2000, were likely tohave been deposits made from Tai Cheongâs savings account.  The cash withdrawn from Tai Cheongâs savings account is shown onp.2 of Annex III.  This aspect of the case is not controversial and it is accepted that the plaintiff received a monthly sum of HK$30,000from the deceased prior to his death.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Given the compelling evidence of the substantial amounts received in Tai Cheongâs savings account from customers for the purchaseof goods, I have little difficulty concluding that the deceased understated his income when he filed his tax returns and his profitand loss accounts for the years ending 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2004 with the Inland Revenue Department.  As recorded in the monthlyturnover reports, the sales made by Tai Cheong for the year ended 31 March 2003 were HK$4,510,424. This is supported by the depositsin the Tai Cheongâs savings account in the sum of HK$4,625,953.84.  Given the credit terms of the business, some of those depositsinto Tai Cheongâs bank account would have been for purchases made in the preceding financial year.  The tax return filed by thedeceased for the year ended 31 March 2003 only showed sales of HK$3,475,962.  Likewise, the profit and loss account filed by thedeceased with the Inland Revenue for the year ended 31 March 2004 showed sales of only HK$3,286,310, as opposed to the monthly turnoverrecord which showed sales of HK$3,728,619 for that financial year and which was also supported by the receipts into Tai Cheongâssavings account for that period in the sum of HK$3,638,657.90.  Ms. Lau rightly submitted that the court is not necessarily boundby matters stated in a tax return and is required to investigate what the real facts are.  The contents of a tax return are admissibleevidence and ought to be accepted as correct unless, on the totality of the evidence adduced, the court is satisfied that the trueposition is otherwise than that set out in those returns.  As Reyes J. said in his judgment in the decision of the Court of Appealin <i>Christopher Gordon Young v Lee Chu</i> (CACV 131/2003, 19 May 2004), at Â§132 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn ascertaining damages consequential on a wrong, a Court has to investigate the actual facts. However tempting, the Court cannotprejudge its assessment of the facts on the basis that a plaintiff derived a significant tax advantage by presenting a certain pictureof his affairs in his tax returns and should be held to that picture. The picture painted in the tax returns may or not have beenaccurate in its characterization of fact. The picture cannot bind a judge. The Court may thus find at the end of the day that thetrue state of affairs was something other than that depicted in a plaintiffâs returns. In appropriate circumstances, the Commissionerof Inland Revenue may consider whether or not a plaintiff has wrongly obtained a benefit for which he should be re-assessed to additionaltax or penalized in some way. But that is a decision for the Commissioner. It does not affect the Courtâs investigation of fact.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  If I accept the truth of the monthly turnover figures or of the annual sales figures set out in the profit and loss account preparedby South China CPA Ltd., should I not also accept the expenses, in the form of cost of sales and overhead and other business expenses,that were recorded in the profit and loss account prepared by them for the years ended 31 March 2003, 31 March 2004, and up to thedate of cessation of business on 30 October 2004?  Ms. Lau submitted that I should not because the statement of expenses in thoseaccounts was just a wholesale adoption of the expenses declared by the deceased in the profit and loss accounts he filed with theInland Revenue for the years ended 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2004, the only difference being an additional sum of HK$3,000 recordedas the accountancy fee of South China CPA Ltd.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The analysis by Messrs. Wong C. Fung &amp; Co., certified public accountants, engaged by the defendantsâ solicitors, to examinethe books, statements, bank accounts and other records of Tai Cheong does not cause me to conclude that the sale figures set outin the monthly turnover or in accounts of South China CPA Ltd. are incorrect.  Messrs. Wong C. Fung &amp; Co. examined all the invoicesthat were issued for the periods in question, but did not have all the invoices for the year ending 31 March 2003 and only had invoicesfor the period from 1 November 2002 to 31 March 2003.  The invoices for those 5 months came up to about HK$1.57 million.  There hasbeen no cross-check between these figures and the monthly turnover records for this period.  It must be noted, however, that thesales must have been reducing during this period of time because of the impact of SARS on restaurant business in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  A tally of invoices for the year ending 31 March 2004 conducted by Messrs. Wong C. Fung &amp; Co. produced a total sum of HK$3,469,443.34,which, of course, is short of the sales figures of HK$3,728,619 appearing in the monthly turnover records for that year or the annualsales figure of HK$4,094,832 shown on the profit and loss account prepared by South China CPA Ltd. for this period.  However, thetally produced by Messrs. Wong C. Fung &amp; Co. did not include the figures set out in 107 illegible invoices.  They also notedthat some invoices were missing from the sequence numbers of 25961 to 33661 that were issued during this period of time. Finally,Messrs. Wong C. Fung &amp; Co. tallied some 3,619 invoices issued during the period from 1 April 2004 to 30 October 2004 and arrivedat a total sum of HK$1,637,348.52.  It is not clear how many invoices were ignored by them as being illegible and whether or notthere were any missing invoices.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  I produce in table form, for the three tax year periods ended 31 March 2003, 31 March 2004 and 30 October 2004, the annual salesfigures produced by South China CPA Ltd., the tally of invoices by Messrs.

A person who wants to evade tax will not under-declare his expenditure.  Todo so will increase his tax liability and not reduce it. I find that the accounts filed by the deceased with the Inland Revenue showedthe true expenses of his business for the years ended 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2004, and I also find that the accounts preparedby South China CPA Ltd. showed the true expenses of the business of Tai Cheong from 1 April 2004 to 30 October 2004.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The payments made from Tai Cheongâs current account in the sum of HK$2,349,537.61 for the year ended 31 March 2004 is less thanthe business expenses for that year shown in the sum of HK$3,124,104 in the accounts filed by the deceased. Likewise, the chequepayments from Tai Cheongâs current account in the sum of HK$1,278,602.98 for the period up to the end of October 2004 is less thanthe business expenses of HK$1,619,337 (which is net of the sum of HK$3,000 for their accountancy fees) shown in the accounts preparedby South China CPA Ltd.  However, even ignoring the amount transferred to the current account from Tai Cheongâs savings accountand the amount of HK$30,000, which was paid to the plaintiff from a cash withdrawal made on 26 November 2003, there were other cashwithdrawals from the Tai Cheongâs savings account for the year ended 31 March 2004 in the sum of HK$355,000, and further cash withdrawalsof HK$125,000 for the period from April 2004 to October 2004.  The Letters of Administration also showed that trading debts of TaiCheong in the sum of HK$175,601.40 were unpaid.  Further, a review of the personal accounts of the deceased showed that funds fromhis personal savings account were likely to have been used by the deceased when he started the business of Tai Cheong in order tomeet the liabilities of Tai Cheong.  Based on the above, I find that the liabilities of Tai Cheong, which were not met by paymentsfrom Tai Cheongâs current or savings accounts, were either paid by the deceased from his other assets or remained unpaid.  On theabove basis, I find that the expenses of Tai Cheong for the year ended 31 March 2003 were HK$3,317,502, for the year ended 31 March2004 were HK$3,124,104, and for the year ended 30 October 2004 were HK$1,619,338.  The total expenses for this period were HK$8,060,944or HK$260,030 per month or HK$3,120,365 per annum.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  I find that the net pre-tax income for this period of 31 months was HK$835,874.1 per annum (HK$3,956,239.10 less HK$3,120,365) orHK$69,656 per month.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I refer to the detailed analysis of Ms. Lau that was based on the growth of the assets of the deceased. She compared his assetsat the time the business of Tai Cheong commenced and his assets at the time of his death, which produced a gross aggregate surplusfrom the business of between HK$1,311,794.09 to HK$1,381,024 over the 5 years that Tai Cheong was in operation.  These figures producednet annual profit figures of between HK$227,283 and HK$276,205 for the 5 years that Tai Cheong was in business.  To this sum mustbe added the annual sum of HK$360,000 which came from Tai Cheongâs profits and which was paid to the plaintiff. This produced totalannual profits of between HK$587,238 and HK$636,205.  This analysis by Ms. Lau proves beyond peradventure that the profits and lossaccounts filed by the deceased with the Inland Revenue, showing a net profit of HK$158,460 for the year ended 31 March 2003 and HK$173,206for the year ended 31 March 2004, were clearly wrong.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  I have considered the further written submissions and calculations from the parties on the incidence of tax on the net pre-tax incomeof the business.  Calculations based on assumed total annual profits of between HK$587,238 and HK$636,205 produced a tax liabilityof between HK$53,884 and HK$62,843 for the year ended 31 March 2004 and between HK$43,110 and HK$51,434.80 for the year ended 31March 2009.  Taking a broad brush approach I conclude that tax liability was in the region of 9% of the net pre-tax income of thebusiness and I find that the annual profits from the business, net of tax, was HK$760,645 (HK$835,874.1 less 9% on account of tax).</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  I take judicial notice of the fact that there has been about a 10% inflationary increase of prices from 2005 to the present (seethe Consumer Price Indices published by the Census and Statistics Department from January 2005 to the present) and I find that thepresent notional net, after tax, income of Tai Cheong would have risen by at least 10%, after taking inflation into account and evenignoring the recovery and general increase of restaurant business in Hong Kong and in the areas supplied by Tai Cheong since 2005. This translates to a post-trial notional net, after tax, income of HK$836,710 (HK$760,645 x 10%) and median pre-trial notional net,after tax, income of HK$798,678 (HK$836,710 + HK$760,645 Ã· 2).</p>    <p class="heading"><i>The award for loss of dependency</i></p>    <p class="heading" style="text-align:center"><i>Who were dependant on the deceased?</i></p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  It is common ground that the plaintiff was dependant on the deceased.  She was born on 29 November 1950 and was aged almost 54 atthe time of the accident.  She is now 61 years old.  The issue I have to determine is whether the son of the deceased, who was aged32 at the time of his death, and the daughter of the deceased, who was aged 22 at that time, were also dependent on the deceased. The evidence in support of the daughterâs dependency comes from the plaintiff who said, in Â§7 of her witness statement, thatshe had gone to study in Japan in 2002, some 3 years before the death of the deceased in October 2005, and that remittances as wellas cash in Japanese currency were made and given to her, from the end of December 2001 up to 20 August 2004, in a total sum of almostHK$880,000, as can be seen from Annex VI attached to the closing submissions of Mr. Wong.  By reason of the untimely death of thedeceased, she was forced to quit her studies in Japan and she came back to Hong Kong in early 2005.  She lived with the plaintiffand her brother in the Kornhill flat from that time until the end of 2007 when she married.  I accept this evidence, and also theevidence of the plaintiff that the remittances and the purchase of Japanese yen were made using the funds the deceased had givenher.  It is clear from Annex VI that the source of these remittances and the monies used to purchase the Japanese Yen came eitherfrom the plaintiffâs savings account or from the plaintiffâs multiple currency savings account.  I also accept the submissionof Ms. Lau that there is no evidence to suggest that the deceased made any transfer of funds from any of his personal accounts orfrom the accounts of Tai Cheong to the plaintiff to specifically cover the remittances and the purchase of Japanese yen.  On thisevidence, I am satisfied that the deceasedâs daughter was partially dependent on him prior to his death and that she would haveremained partially dependent on him up to the time she married at the end of 2007, and that her financial needs were partially satisfiedfrom the monthly payments of HK$30,000 which the deceased made to the plaintiff.   I am also satisfied that she was also partiallydependent on her mother, the plaintiff, at the time of the death of the deceased.  The total value of the contributions of HK$880,000averages out to over HK$20,000 a month over the period of some 3 years and 7 months, from 2002 up to the time of the death of thedeceased in October 2004.  As can be seen from Annex IV attached to the closing submissions of Mr Wong, the monthly household expenditurecame up to almost HK$15,800 per month.  I find that this household expenditure was entirely funded from the monthly contributionsof HK$30,000 made to the plaintiff by the deceased.   Clearly, part of the funds expended on the remittances and purchase of Japanesecurrency made in favour of their daughter came from the personal savings and investment returns of the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  I also accept the evidence of the plaintiff that her son had been residing, all along, with her and the deceased in the same household. He was aged 32 at the time of the death of the deceased and was engaged full-time investing in shares and other financial instruments. He earned sufficiently to cover his own personal expenses.  However, he did not make any contribution towards household expenseseven though he resided with his parents in the Kornhill flat and took all his meals at home.  I also find that he was dependent onthe deceased in the monthly sum of just under HK$6,000 shown on the revised monthly household and personal expenses calculationscontained in Annex IV to the closing submissions of Mr. Wong.  The deceased did not make any additional payment towards the householdexpenses which were incurred for the benefit of his son.  The source of the money to pay for the monthly household expenses was themonthly sum of HK$30,000 that was paid into the plaintiffâs savings account.                      </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  After the death of the deceased, the daughter and son of the deceased enjoyed benefits that arose independently and by the voluntaryact of another person, in this case, their mother, the plaintiff in these proceedings, who supported her daughter and her son fromher own assets after the monthly contribution of HK$30,000 from the deceased ceased upon his death.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The claim for loss of dependency on behalf of the son of the deceased is only made for the pre-trial period from the date of deathin October 2004 up to the date of this judgment in December 2011, a period of 7 years and 2 months or 86 months.  The award to bemade in this regard depends on the assessment of the length of time the deceased would have continued to run the business of TaiCheong, had this accident not occurred.</p>    <p><i>                   The value of the Kornhill apartment</i></p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  I have already referred to the calculations of the monthly household and total expenses of the deceased and his family appearingin Annex IV to the closing submissions of Mr. Wong.  I note that there is no reference, in these calculations, to the value of theKornhill premises in which they resided.  That is correct, so far as the widowâs enjoyment of the premises was concerned.  By reasonof her joint ownership of these premises, she became the sole owner on the death of her husband.  No deduction is to be made of thebenefit she obtained from inheriting the deceasedâs share in the property upon his death.  Damages were originally awarded underthe Fatal Accidents Act of 1846 for the net financial loss arising from the death of the deceased and this approach required thatall financial benefits which arose on the death had to be set off against the damages to be awarded.  However, the principle thatrequired a deduction to be made of financial benefits was gradually eroded by judicial decisions, such as <i>Bishop v. Cunard White Star Co Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1950%5d%20P%20240" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1950] P 240</a> and <i>Heathley v. Steel Co of Wales Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1953%5d%201%20WLR%20405" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1953] 1 WLR 405</a>, which excluded the financial value of a house or a car already owned jointly with the deceased before his death.  Based on theseauthorities, the proper determination to make, in this type of case, is that the plaintiff did not enjoy any financial gain becauseher enjoyment of the property was the same before and after his death, although, after his death, she could, if she wished, sellthe Kornhill flat and convert it into cash.  Indeed, if the capital value of the flat had to be deducted from the award for damagesfor loss of dependency, as a benefit accruing to the widow upon the death of the deceased, it would be necessary to add, to the valueof the widowâs dependency, a sum representing the rental value of her free occupation of the Kornhill flat.  This would counter-balancethe capital deduction. For this reason, the courts have long disregarded the rental value of the family home on the one hand andthe capital value of the inheritance on the other. </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The continuing erosion of the deduction principle has occurred with various legislative changes to the Fatal Accidents Act and toour <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a>. It was completed with the amendment, in 1982, of section 4 of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976.  Our current section 7 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22">Cap. 22</a>, which was modelled on that amendment, provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn assessing damages in respect of a person's death in an action under this Ordinance or under the Carriage by Air Ordinance (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/500">Cap500</a>), benefits which have accrued or will or may accrue to any person from his estate or otherwise as a result of his death shallbe disregarded.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>As illustrated by the decision in <i>Wood v Bentall Simplex Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] PIQR p.332</a>, referred to above, after the enactment of his provision, the question to ask in the assessment of damages under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a>, is whether there is a continuing source of support, as distinct from a supervening âbenefitâ which had to be disregarded.  Inthe former case, there is no loss; in the latter case, the ânewâ benefit is to be disregarded.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  However, in the case of dependent children who do not inherit the premises, jointly owned by their parents, in which they were livingbefore the death of the deceased, it may be appropriate to assess the value of the accommodation they enjoyed in those premises priorto the death of the deceased.  If they were to be regarded as being jointly permitted by their parents to reside in the premises,then half the value of the accommodation they enjoyed in those premises could be assessed as part of the value of their dependencyon the deceased.  Although they would continue to enjoy such accommodation after the death of their deceased father, such enjoymentwould arise from the voluntary act of their mother who allowed them to continue to reside in the premises which she wholly ownedafter his demise.  In this case, however, there is no claim for the value of the accommodation enjoyed by the son of the deceased. The value of the dependency of the daughter of the deceased did not include the value of rent-free occupation in the Kornhill flat:she had lived in Japan for some years prior to his death and only returned to Hong Kong in 2005, after his death.</p>    <p><i>Taylor v OâConnor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%20115" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] AC 115:</a> <i>the loss of benefit from future savings</i></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  As originally pleaded, the loss of dependency claim was based on the financial contributions made to the plaintiff during the lifetimeof the deceased.  However, it is clear that savings made by the deceased in the course of his working life that enure to the benefitof his dependants, either by way of financial contributions to be made to them after his retirement which he would make from hisaccumulated savings, or by way of inheritance after his natural death, should be included in the calculation of the value of thedependency.  In the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Taylor v OâConnor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%20115" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] AC 115</a>, the deceased, a partner in a firm of architects, died in a traffic accident as a result of the fault of the appellant and left,as his dependants, his wife, and a daughter who was aged 18 at the time.  In his judgment at p.127, Lord Reid said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt had been assumed that the wifeâs dependency ought to be calculated on the footing that it would have ceased when her husbandceased earning. I do not think that is right in this case. Before he reached 65 he would have been able to make ample provision forthe future, whether or not he survived, and I think that, if one is to be realistic, dependency should be taken on the basis thatshe would be maintained at the same rate of expenditure throughout her life.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The savings that the deceased would have been able to accumulate during his notional working life up to the date of his retirementwould be the source of funds from which his wife would be maintained.  In his judgment in the same case, Viscount Dilhorne said atp.140:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe position with regard to possible savings is more difficult. If he had saved Â£1,750 a year for 12 years, it would have amountedto Â£21,000 but some part of the savings might have been used to maintain the familyâs standard of life after his retirement asa working partner. Some part might have been used in taking out insurance policies. Estate duty would be levied on his death. Onecan reasonably say that some sum should be added on account of possible future savings, but it is not possible to do more than selectan arbitrary figure.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In his judgment, Lord Pearson also commented on the savings element, at p.142 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe judge estimated that of the deceasedâs net spendable income, estimated at Â£6,000 per annum, two-thirds, that is, Â£4,000per annum, would have enured to the benefit of the respondent and the daughter. That must include both elements of the lost pecuniarybenefit, namely, the maintenance element and the savings element. Presumably the deceased would in the later years of his workinglife have been both maintaining the family and saving for the benefit of the family. The savings would have provided some presentfinancial security not only for the deceased but also for the respondent and the daughter, and probably the savings or the residueof them would ultimately have been inherited by the respondent and the daughter or one of them.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  I do not accept the submission of Ms. Lau that the decision of <i>Taylor v OâConnor</i> turned entirely on its own facts and did not establish any principle.  Ms. Lau also submitted that, at the time <i>Taylor v OâConnor</i> was decided, the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Oliver v Ashman</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%202%20QB%20210" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] 2 QB 210</a>, that loss of earnings, in the years lost to an injured plaintiff whose life expectancy had been shortened, were not recoverable,was still good law.  <i>Oliver v Ashman</i> was overruled by the House of Lords in <i>Pickett v British Rail Engineering Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20AC%20136" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] AC 136</a>, which allowed a âlost yearsâ claim by a living plaintiff whose life expectancy had been shortened.  Subsequently, <i>Pickett</i> was applied by the House of Lords in <i>Gammell v Wilson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%2027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] AC 27</a> to allow âlost yearsâ claims by the estates of deceased persons.  Ms. Lau submitted that the continuing validity of <i>Taylor v OâConnor</i> had been affected by these decisions, and continues to be affected, notwithstanding that the lost yearsâ claims were subsequentlyabolished by statute.

In that case, the deceased and his widow had only been married for 3 months at the date of his death.  He was earning Â£30 a weeknet, of which he paid Â£6 a week to his parents for their board and lodging, and saved Â£10 a week to create a capital sum for thefuture use.  The trial judge held that the dependency was Â£18 a week, apparently including the whole of the weekly savings of Â£10as part of the dependency.  The Court of Appeal held that the whole Â£10 a week should not be regarded as spent for the widowâsbenefit, since some part was likely to be used at some future date for the husbandâs benefit.  Accordingly, the Court of Appealreduced the weekly dependency from Â£18 to Â£15.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The notional savings that the deceased can accumulate between the time of his death and the time of his natural retirement continuesto form an important element of the claim for loss of dependency by his dependants, as is recognised by McGregor on Damages, 18<sup>th</sup> Edition (2009) at Â§36-037 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMoreover, the value of the dependency can include not only that part of the deceasedâs earnings which he would have expendedannually in maintaining his dependants but also that part of his earnings which he would have saved and which would have come tohis dependants by inheritance on his death â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In the same paragraph, the author goes on to state :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAlternative methods of dealing with these savings have appeared: either they are regarded as comprised in the figure of annualdependency to be multiplied by the multiplier or they are excluded from the figure of annual dependency and a separate, and additionalsum is calculated and awarded in respect of them.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  In the course of the hearing, the plaintiff amended her claim to include a claim for loss of dependency based on the loss of benefitfrom the further savings the deceased would have accumulated, had the accident not occurred.  I include, in my award of damages forloss of dependency in this case, the financial contributions that the deceased would have made to his dependants during his notionalworking life and, also, that part of his savings which he would have accumulated during his notional working life and which wouldhave enured to the benefit of his dependants after his retirement, and after his natural death.  I turn now to consider how I mayproperly assess these claims for loss of dependency.</p>    <p><i>Assessing the award for loss of dependency</i></p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The traditional way would be to assess the financial value of the dependency by taking the sum of the monthly contribution of HK$30,000to the plaintiff, which was utilized for her benefit and for the benefit of his son and daughter, and to take out from that sum theamount of HK3,733 which was expended on the deceased, being his share of household expenses as shown in the calculations in AnnexIV attached to the closing submissions of Mr. Wong.  If this approach is taken, the savings element of the loss of dependency claimwould have to be assessed separately, by assessing the notional savings that the deceased would have made and calculating the portionthereof which would enure to the benefit of the dependants, just as the trial judge had done in <i>Taylor v OâConnor</i> when he estimated that two-thirds of the net spendable income, including both the maintenance element, and the savings element, wouldhave enured to the benefit of the widow and the daughter.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  In cases such as the present where the most important factor in the calculation of the award is the earnings of the deceased, asopposed to income from other sources, a practice has developed of expressing the annual dependency as a percentage of the annualearnings of the deceased.  Percentages have become conventional in cases where the surviving widow had been wholly dependent on herhusband and did not use her own income, if any, to support the common household expenditure.  This practice was explained and supportedby OâConnor L.J. in <i>Harris v Empress Motors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20WLR%20212" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 WLR 212</a> at p.216-217 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn the course of time, the courts have worked out a simple solution to the â¦ problem of calculating the net dependency underthe Fatal Accident Acts in cases where the dependants are wife and children. In times past, the calculation called for a tediousenquiry into how much housekeeping money was paid to the wife, who paid how much for the childrenâs shoes etc. This has all beenstruck away and the modern practice is to deduct the percentage from the net income figure to represent what the deceased would havespent exclusively on himself. The percentages have become conventional in the sense that they are used unless there is striking evidenceto make the conventional figure inappropriate because there is no departure from the principle that each case must be decided onits own facts. Where the family unit was husband and wife, the conventional figure is 33% and the rationale of this is that broadlyspeaking, the net income was spent as to one-third for the benefit of each and one-third for the joint benefit â¦ Where there arechildren, the deduction falls to 25%.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The reason for the smaller deduction in the latter case is that earnings are presumed to be split four ways in the latter case, ratherthan three ways, namely, one-quarter for the deceased, one-quarter for the wife, one-quarter for the children, and one-quarter forjoint use.  Thus, the conventional figures adopted 66.6% of earnings, to assess the dependency of a widow alone, and 75% of earnings,to assess the dependency of a widow and children.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  It is appropriate to adopt these percentages in the present case to reflect, not only the financial contribution made by the deceasedto his wife, but also the value of the dependency represented by the savings he would have accumulated for the benefit of his dependants.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  I have looked closely at the calculations prepared by Mr. Wong and Ms. Lau employing the traditional method of assessing the separateelements of the loss of dependency claim.  I do not see anything striking in these calculations to make me conclude that the conventionalfigures are inappropriate in the present case and I am prepared to adopt these conventional percentages in the present case.</p>    <p><i>The multiplier</i></p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  I turn to consider the appropriate multiplier to be adopted in the present case.  It is common ground that the multiplier shouldbe adopted by having regard to the age and health of the deceased and, in particular, to the date when he would likely have retiredif the accident had not occurred.  The age and health of the plaintiff is also relevant.  At the time of death, the deceased was58 years old. The plaintiff is now 61 years old and there is no doubt that she would live much beyond the likely retirement dateof the deceased.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  It is also common ground that I should apportion that multiplier, if it exceeded the pre-trial period, between the pre-trial andpost-trial period.  There is ample authority to support this approach : <i>Pritchard v J. H. Cobden Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20Fam%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] Fam. 22</a>, <i>Corbett v Barking, Havering and Brentwood Health Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%202%20QB%20408" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 2 QB 408</a> and <i>White (Administratrix of White, deceased) v ESAB Group (UK) Ltd</i> (11 January 2002, unreported, QBD). There has been much criticism of this practice.  It has been said that the discount for earlyreceipt of the damages, implicit in the calculation of the multiplier, should only apply to future losses from the date of trialor date of assessment and that the effect of a choice of multiplier from the date of death is that the discount is applied to pre-triallosses, which ought not to be discounted for early receipt, there be no early receipt of such losses. However, the point was nottaken and I say no more about it.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  I have already found that the deceased used to spend almost every working day of his life in his store in Western.  He had beenin this trade for some 25 years helping his elder brother before starting his own business which he carried out diligently for about5 years up until his untimely death.  The plaintiff claims a multiplier of 10 on the footing that he would have continued to operateand run his business for as long as his health permitted him to do so, and that, prior to his death, he was in good health and didnot engage in practices, such as smoking or drinking, which might impact on his future health.  Ms. Lau countered that the multipliershould not, in any event, exceed 6 years, being the uttermost limit of generosity for the deceased who was aged 58 years and 8 monthsat the time of his death.  At an assumed rate of return of 4.5% per annum, the multiplier of 6 would represent a working life of7 years (see Personal Injuries Tables Hong Kong 2005 Edition at p.68).</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  I have considered the authorities cited to me by counsel on the issue of the proper multiplier, including <i>Law Yuet Kwai v Secretary for Justice</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%203%20HKLRD%20727" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 3 HKLRD 727</a>; <i>Lee Sik Yee (Administratrix of the estate of Kwok Hing Cheung, deceased) v Lo Wing Hong</i>, HCPI 21/2006; <i>Wong Wai Hang v KMB</i>, HCA 8273/1983.  In addition to the case of <i>Wong Wai Hang v KMB</i> cited by Mr. Wong, I also had regard to the case of <i>Hung Oi Mui (intended personal representative of the estate of Hung Tin Kai, deceased) v Lam Kwok Leung</i> (HCPI 205/1998, 16 August 1999) in which Deputy Judge Muttrie adopted a multiplier of 6 for the deceased who had been employed asa warehouse man at the time of his death at the age of 66.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  I found particular assistance from the decision of OâConnor  J, as he then was, in <i>Davies v Whiteways Cyder Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20QB%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1 Q.B. 262.</a>  In that case, Mr. Davies was killed in a traffic accident in 1971 when he was 55 years old.  He was a successful businessman.  Until1963, he owned and ran a family business.  In that year, the business was taken over.  He then started a partnership with a Mr. Phillipsto build houses and to sell them.  In assessing the appropriate multiplier, OâConnor J had regard to age of health of Mr. Davies,the age of health of Mr. Phillips, and the age of the business.  Mr. Davies enjoyed excellent health prior to the time of his death. He was an active man and highly enjoyed the business in which he was engaged, which was carried out from his home.  OâConnor Jwas of the view that it was highly improbable that he would have wanted to retire before he reached the age of 70.  Mr. Phillipswas a younger man by a few years and, although he had a fairly serious illness in 1972, he had recovered from it.  The Judge foundthat he would have manned his half of the team until Mr. Davies was 70.  He also held that the probability was that the businesswould have remained profitable for a long time to come.  On that basis, he had no difficulty concluding the correct multiplier touse in that case was 10. </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  In this case, I conclude that the probabilities are that the deceased would have continued his occupation as a sole proprietor ofTai Cheong and carried on his business until he reached the age of 70.  His pre-accident lifestyle was such that I cannot conceiveof any reason why he would stop working, in order to pursue other activities, unless he had to stop by reason of ill health or businesslosses. I find that the outlook for his business was very positive and continues to remain positive.

It seems plain to me that what the court has to consider is whether, at the date of death by natural causes, there would havebeen an accumulation of wealth, the realization of which the tortuous death has prevented. The mere fact that some savings can beshown at the date of the tortuous death is not tantamount to saying that such savings would have been in existence at the date ofthe natural death. It seems clear to me that whereas a man in this sort of work can make some savings, these are inevitably earmarkedfor the period after which he has retired and during which there is no meaningful old age pension or other support. Further, savingsthat can be identified at the date of the tortuous death may well be spent on a variety of matters during the normal working life.</p>        <p class="quote">52. It also seems clear to me that the amendments introduced by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20</a> of LARCO to counter the âlost yearsâ claim were enacted to prevent a windfall accruing to estates which could not be justifiedon the evidence. In fact, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20</a> itself exhorts the court to ensure that there is no over compensation to the estate.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Consistent with those observations, Bokhary PJ said in Â§34 of his judgment in <i>Lam</i> <i>Pak Chiu &amp; Ors v Tsang Mei Ying and So Sau Lin (Administratrices of the estate of To Shing Chiu, deceased)</i> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â34. â¦ Thus if the court were to find in any given case that an accumulation of wealth would have been achieved by the notionaltime of retirement, the realistic possibilities, factoring in probable inflation, would then be as follows :</p>        <p class="quote">(i) expenditure during retirement may exceed the income from the accumulation plus any pension and the like received during retirementso as to exhaust the accumulation some time before the notional time of death, thus leaving the deceased dependent upon state, familyor other help during his notional final years; or</p>        <p class="quote">(ii) post-retirement expenditure may exceed post-retirement receipts but only so as to diminish the accumulation without exhaustingit; or</p>        <p class="quote">(iii) such receipts may more or less match such expenditure so as to leave the deceasedâs financial position at the notional timeof death much the same as it had been at the notional time of retirement; or</p>        <p class="quote">(iv) it may even be that such receipts would exceed such expenditure so as to leave his financial position better at the notionaltime of death than it had been at the notional time of retirement.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  In many cases where the deceased falls into the low income earning bracket and the family leads a hand to mouth existence, therewill not have been any savings made by the deceased prior to his death and the prospects of future savings, had the accident notoccurred, will be nil or negligible.  However, the conventional percentages can still be applied to the earnings of the deceasedto assess loss of dependency in such cases.  But they would operate to assess the loss of dependency from the loss of the financialcontributions made to the dependants by the deceased from his earnings, rather than to assess the loss of benefit from any notionalfuture savings of the deceased.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  The present case is not such a case. The deceased accumulated substantial wealth during his working life and he would have continuedto do so, had the accident not occurred.  However, in a case such as the present, where a substantial part of the savings that theplaintiff would have accumulated has already been earmarked and awarded to the dependants as part of the award for loss of dependency,it would be wrong in principle and tantamount to double compensation for that same portion of savings, earmarked for the dependants,to form part of any award for loss of accumulation of wealth which is made in favour of the estate.  The starting point, therefore,and which I have regard to, must be the remaining balance of 25% of his net pre-tax income over the pre-trial period of 86 monthsand the remaining balance of 33.3% of his post-trial net income over the post-trial period up to the likely date of his retirement. Obviously, but for the accident, he would have expended some of these monies on his own personal expenses, for transport and mealsand other personal expenses, during this period of time.  Having regard to his work-orientated and frugal lifestyle, I find thathe is likely to have saved 10% of his notional income, as his personal savings over the pre-trial period, and 15% of his notionalincome, as his personal savings over the post-trial period.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Accordingly, in the 11.5 years (or 138 months) of his notional working life from the time of death to the likely notional date ofretirement when he would have reached 70 years of age, he would have saved:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)  over the pre-trial period, the sum of HK$572,386 (HK$798,678 x 10% Ã· 12 x 86 months),</p>        <p>(b)  over the post-trial period, the sum of HK$543,861 (HK$836,710 x 15% Ã· 12 x 52 months),</p>        <p>(c)  thereby producing total personal savings of HK$1,116,247.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is inappropriate to use a multiplier to assess his notional savings over this period of time.  The award under this head of claimis not a lump sum award to represent the loss of a future continuing stream of income, which has to be discounted on account of acceleratedreceipt by the use of a multiplier.  The above assessment has to be made in order to assess the total notional accumulation of wealthfrom the time of death to the time of notional retirement, including any likely growth of these accumulated savings from investmentreturns.  Once this amount has been assessed, the next stage is to determine whether this accumulated wealth would grow, or be depleted,by the time of natural death.  If there is a net balance at the time of natural death, this net balance, which is a future loss sustainedby the estate of the deceased, must be discounted for accelerated receipt.  However, this discount is a discount for the acceleratedreceipt of a future lump sum loss rather than for the loss of a future continuing stream of income.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  On the above basis, I conclude that he would have saved HK$1,116,247 at the time of his natural retirement at the age of about 70. A greater part of this sum is likely to be invested by his wife for his benefit, if not by himself, and grow.  These invested savingswould grow, during the period he was accumulating his savings, as well as during the period, after his retirement, when he wouldhave stopped saving. </p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  The current practice is to assess multipliers, and discounts for accelerated receipt, on the assumption that prudent investmentsmade of the damages awarded to victims of torts would yield an annual return of 4.5% per annum (see <i>Cookson v. Knowles</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20AC%20556" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] AC 556</a> and <i>Chan Pui Ki (an infant) v. Leung On</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%203%20HKC%20732" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 3 HKC 732).</a>  Where a court finds that the deceased would, but for the accident, have accumulated wealth from the date of his death to the dateof his natural retirement and that he would have invested the wealth he accumulated, then, in order to be consistent with the currentpractice, it is only right that the court should assume that such investments would yield a similar rate of return of 4.5%.  AlthoughI have not attempted to make detailed calculations in this regard, I am probably not much off the mark in assessing the assumed returnon savings to have augmented the accumulated fund to about HK$1,300,000.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  I now turn to consider what would happen to this fund during the years from the date of notional retirement at age 70 to the dateof natural death, when the deceased ought to have reached 82 or 83 years of age.  I have no doubt that a substantial part of theaccumulated wealth would have been depleted during this post-retirement period on account of his personal expenditure, which wouldexceed the assumed rate of return of 4.5% per annum on the accumulated fund.  I have assessed that he would be saving about 15% ofhis net after tax income at the time of retirement.  This would leave a balance of 18.3 %, from his remaining free balance of 33.3%assessed above, for his personal expenses. 18.3% of HK$836,710 amounts to HK$153,118 per annum or about HK$12,760 per month.  Hisexpenses after retirement are likely to reduce to about HK$10,000 per month or about HK$120,000 per annum, as he would not need totravel daily to and from work.   This amounts to about 9% of his accumulated savings at the time of retirement of about HK$1,300,000. Reducing this sum of HK$1,300,000 by 9% per annum and increasing the balance by the assumed rate of return of 4.5% per annum willresult in a net reduction of the accumulated savings by 4.5% per annum.  The fund, therefore, will reduce to about HK$1,116,000 in11.5 yearsâ time and reduce further to about HK$1,066,000 in 12.5 yearsâ time, being the period of time between the notionaldate of retirement and the date of natural death.  Again, without attempting to make detailed calculations in this regard, I am probablynot much off the mark in assessing the remaining net balance on the notional date of death to be no more than HK$1,000,000.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  The remaining net balance on the notional date of death would then have to discounted for accelerated receipt of almost 18 yearsfrom the date of natural death to the date of judgment.  A discount of about 55% would be appropriate for this length of time (seePersonal Injuries Tables Hong Kong 2005 Edition at p.66).</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Every court that has to assess this head of claim faces the difficult situation of having to gaze into a crystal ball to gauge whatthe future might bring to the financial fortunes or setbacks of the deceased if the accident had not occurred. The above method ofassessment to assess damages under LARCO is the best I can devise that is consistent with the authorities and current practice. There may be other cases where the pattern of accumulation of wealth was by way of investment in real estate, such as <i>Carolyn Dall v. Choy Ying Wai</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20HKLRD%20705" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 HKLRD 705</a>, where another approach might be indicated.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  On the basis of the above assessment, I award the sum of HK$450,000 as the loss of the net accumulation of wealth in favour of theestate under the provisions of LARCO.  This case demonstrates that this remnant of the abolished lost yearsâ claim is unlikelyto yield a very high award, even in a case such as the present where the deceased was likely to accumulate substantial savings onaccount of the fact that he was a high income earner and lived frugally.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Set off of damages under LARCO and under FAO</i></p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 20(5)</a> of LARCO provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â (5) The rights conferred by this section and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 21</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">22</a> for the benefit of the estates of deceased persons shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any rights conferred on the dependantsof deceased persons by the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22">Cap. 22</a>) â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Therefore, the award under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a> is not to be deducted from the award made under LARCO.  On the other hand, the effect of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a>, reversing the previous position, is that no deduction of a LARCO award, which would be inherited by a dependant, is to be made fromthe award made in favour of the dependant under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a>.  The combined effect of these two provisions creates a risk of duplication of the 2 awards, one for loss of wealth under LARCO thatwould be inherited by the dependants, or by some of them, and the savings element of the other award for loss of dependency underthe <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a>.  However, I have eliminated that risk in this case, pursuant to the statutory injunction under section 20(2) of LARCO to avoid over-compensation,by assessing the LARCO award in the manner set out above.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Damages for Bereavement</i></p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  This has been agreed in the sum of HK$150,000.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Funeral Expenses</i></p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Funeral expenses in the sum of HK$80,357 are also agreed.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Summary</i></p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  A summary of my award is as follows :</p>    <blockquote>		<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0">		<tr>			<td style="width: 8%" valign="top">(a)			</td>			<td style="width: 61%" valign="top">Damages for pre-trial loss of dependency			</td>			<td width="30%" class="auto-style4" valign="top">HK$4,292,894.25			</td>					</tr>		<tr>			<td style="width: 8%" valign="top">(b)			</td>			<td style="width: 61%" valign="top">Damages for post-trial loss of dependency			</td>			<td width="30%" class="auto-style4" valign="top">HK$1,021,623			</td>					</tr>			<tr>			<td style="width: 8%" valign="top">(c)			</td>			<td style="width: 61%" valign="top">Damages for net accumulation of wealth in favour of the estate			</td>			<td width="30%" class="auto-style4" valign="top">HK$450,000			</td>					</tr>			<tr>			<td style="width: 8%" valign="top">(d)			</td>			<td style="width: 61%" valign="top">Bereavement			</td>			<td width="30%" class="auto-style4" valign="top">HK$150,000			</td>					</tr>			<tr>			<td style="width: 8%" valign="top">(e)			</td>			<td style="width: 61%" valign="top">Funeral expenses			</td>			<td width="30%" class="auto-style4" valign="top">HK$80,357			</td>					</tr>					</table>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i>Interest</i></p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>   I award interest at 2% per annum on damages for bereavement from the date of death to the date of judgment and interest at 8% perannum on funeral expenses from the date of death to the date of judgment.
