At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal this court allowed the appeal to the extent that it ordered that this matter shouldbe remitted to the President of the Lands Tribunal to give further directions as to the framing of the issues including the filingof statements of contentions setting out the factual and legal basis of the partiesâ cases.  This court also ordered that the orderon this appeal should be without prejudice to the right of either party to renew an application under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 18</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A" class="autolink_findacts">Lands Tribunal Rules</a> when the pleadings are closed.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  As long ago as 1970, the applicant acquired a very substantial parcel of land in Pennyâs Bay, Lantau, which for convenience maybe referred to as Lot 22.  By any standards Lot 22 was very sizeable: it was approximately 2,010,000 square feet.  It was, apparently,a land locked area and access by sea was permitted.  The land was used for the purposes of shipbuilding yards and had been let outto a well-known shipyard.  One of the Special Conditions attaching to the Lot was that not less than 285,000 square feet should beused for shipbuilding purposes only.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  All was well until 1995 when proposals were formulated for the construction of two container terminals at Pennyâs Bay.  Thesewere referred to as CT 10 and CT 11.  On 5 May 1995 GN 1574 was gazetted.  That was a notice of authorization under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/127/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/127" class="autolink_findacts">Foreshore and Sea-bed (Reclamations) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/127">Cap. 127</a> (âthe Ordinanceâ).  That has been referred to as the 1995 Authorization.  In brief the effect of that was that an areacomprising approximately 1260 hectares of foreshore and sea-bed situated at Pennyâs Bay would be affected.  It would be neededfor the purposes of the construction of the container terminals.  It is the applicantâs case that that effectively legally extinguishedthe marine access to Lot 22 and, as such, it was entitled to compensation under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/127/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 12(1)</a> of the Ordinance.  Hence, pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/127/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 12(1)</a> a claim was lodged with the Director of Lands for compensation in the sum of HK $2,539,000,000.  That included a claim for the lossof value in Lot 22 in the sum of $2,200,000,000.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Things however did not stay the same.  The Governmentâs proposals for the construction of the container terminals were not pursued. Instead, in October 1999 proposals were published for the reclamation of part of the foreshore and sea-bed of Pennyâs Bay so thata theme park could be constructed.  Since by then the applicantâs claim for compensation had not been satisfied, on 2 November1999 the applicant applied to the Lands Tribunal pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/127/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(3)</a> of the Ordinance to determine its claim for compensation arising from the extinguishment of its marine access by the 1995 Authorization. The claim was in the standard form of Form 12 of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A" class="autolink_findacts">Lands Tribunal Rules</a>.  Attached to the Form 12 were various supporting documents.  It is clear that the applicantâs claim for compensation has alwaysbeen upon the basis of total extinguishment of the right to marine access, which in effect, is said to have extinguished the valueof the Lot and to have caused substantial financial damage.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The notice of opposition was short and concise.  The grounds and particulars of the opposition read as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe Applicantâs claims are opposed on the grounds that the Applicant suffers no loss compensatable under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 12</a> of the Ordinance, or alternatively that the amount of compensation claimed is excessive.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  That document was filed on 19 November 1999.  On 10 April 2000 there were 2 notices published in the Gazette.  The first GN 2230was a withdrawal of the authorization of the reclamation under GN 1574.  The second notice was another authorization notice under<a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9</a>, which was designed to assist the construction of a theme park at Pennyâs Bay.  It comprised the reclamation of an area which wouldotherwise have been part of the reclamation under the 1995 Authorization.</p>    <p class="heading">The attempt to crystallise the issues</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Immediately following the Governmentâs notice of opposition the applicantâs solicitors attempted to elicit the basis upon whichthe Government contended that the applicant was not entitled to compensation.  The first response to which we have been referredis that of 7 January 2000.  In the letter from the Department of Justice two points were taken.  In the first place it was said thatthe entire lot had been used for shipbuilding and ship repairing but that was a declining market.  The second and more substantialpoint that was sought to be made was that GN 1574 provided for the construction of infrastructure including roads which would haveopened up Lot 22 for its full redevelopment potential.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  By 23 May 2000, which was of course after the publication of the later Gazette Notices, the Department of Justice was expressingthe view that although the publication of GN 1574 resulted in the applicantâs rights in relation to the area of the foreshore andsea-bed affected by that authorization being extinguished and ceasing to exist, the compensation would have to be based on the factthat the extinguishment of the rights was for a limited period between the date of that authorization and its withdrawal.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In April 2001 there was a deed of surrender of Lot 22 in accordance with which there was a very substantial <i>ex gratia</i> payment of $1,483,380,000 with a total payment of $1,506,090,750.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In January of the following year the Department of Justice wrote again to the applicant stating that it had taken advice from twoleading counsel in London, one concerned with the administrative law aspects and the other with the valuation aspects.  On this occasionit was said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAs regards the consequences of the withdrawal of the 1995 Authorization, it is our view that it is a matter of interpretation ofthe order(s) concerned and should be a matter for the Lands Tribunal.  We are instructed that, having reconsidered the issues, contraryto our previous indication that such rights were revived by the withdrawal of the 1995 Authorization, Government is prepared forthe purposes of assessing the claim to compensation by your clients to accept that all the rights, public or private, which wereextinguished by the Gazettal of the 1995 Authorization under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10</a> of the FSRO were permanently extinguished and that there was no revival of those rights, even on a momentary basis, upon the Gazettalof the withdrawal of the 1995 Authorization in March 2000 before the 2000 Authorization was Gazetted.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The applicantâs solicitors sought clarification of that by letter of 16 February 2002.  In particular they inquired as to whetherit was the Governmentâs contention that the claim for compensation was in any way affected by the withdrawal and subsequent authorizationin April 2000 and, if so, how.  Inquiries were also made as to whether it was still the Governmentâs position that the compensationpayable as a result of the 1995 Authorization should be set off against any âbettermentâ referable to the infrastructural andother works authorized to be carried out.  That letter was met by a singularly unhelpful reply of 27 February 2002 in which it wassaid that the issues should be ventilated after the filing of expert evidence.  The letter then went on: âIt would not be helpfulfor either party to have to commit themselves at this stage to any single valuation approach in the proceedings before the LandsTribunal.â</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Pausing there, it must be stated that it would clearly be most undesirable that parties should be put in a position where they haveto file unnecessary evidence because a case has to be prepared on the basis that the opposing party might put forward various alternativearguments one or other of which might be their ultimate case and might or might not find favour with the Tribunal.  Litigation, includingclaims for compensation, should be conducted on the basis that each party knows what the other partyâs case is so that it can befully prepared to meet it.  It is, in those circumstances, not surprising that the applicant put forward the proposal that thereshould be a trial of points of law as preliminary issues before the assessment of the compensation.  The points of law which requestedwere as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1.Upon the proper construction of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 10(2)</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">11</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">12</a> of the Ordinance, whether the claim for compensation by PBIL is subject to any set-off, diminution or otherwise adversely affectedby the 2000 Withdrawal and/or the 2000 Authorization, which were events occurring after the relevant rights of PBIL to the foreshoreand sea-bed had been extinguished in 1995.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2.Upon the proper construction of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 10(2)</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">11</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">12</a> of the Ordinance, whether the claim for compensation by PBIL is subject to any set-off or diminution by reason of any âbettermentâreferable to the infra-structural and other works authorized under the 1995 Authorization, which had not been and would no longerbe carried out.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">3.Whether Question 1 or Question 2 are to be answered differently when <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 10(2)</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">11</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">12</a> of the Ordinance are construed in the light of Articles 6 and 105 of the Basic Law.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">4.If the answer to Question 1 or Question 2 or to both is in the affirmative, whether <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 10(2)</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">11</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">12</a> of the Ordinance are invalid and to be struck down for being inconsistent with the constitutional provisions under Articles 6 and105 of the Basic Law.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  It would seem that the first question focuses on what affect if any withdrawal and authorization in 2000 would have upon the claimfor compensation.  The second question raises the issue as to whether âbettermentâ can be taken into account.  The other questionsrelate to the effect if any of articles of the Basic Law.  Those seem to be dependent upon the determination of the first two issues.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  It is noteworthy that prior to the hearing before the Lands Tribunal on the applicantâs application for the trial of these issues,the Department of Justice, whilst objecting to the determination of the preliminary points of law, reformulated the questions.  Onematter which was sought to be introduced was that the assessment compensation should be âon the same general principles as a claimfor damages in tort and in particular having regard to all facts and events known at the date of the determination of the claim â¦â. Further aspects were also sought to be introduced, for example, the fact that access by sea was continued as a matter of fact untilthe date of surrender of the land in April 2001 and the fact that the 1995 Authorization was withdrawn and, finally, the fact thatthe land has been surrendered to the Government.  This was even further amplified in a letter of 26 July this year where the Departmentof Justice went on to say that the events relating to the withdrawal of the 1995 Authorization in 2000 and the new authorizationin 2000 were part of the sequence of events which is relevant to both claims.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The judge in giving his decision in the Lands Tribunal said in summary that the expertsâ reports on behalf of the Government shouldbe filed and then it could be seen what issues emerged.  I should state at the outset that this court is most reluctant to interferein what are case management decisions.  Not only are these matters of discretion but it is, in most circumstances, highly undesirablethat an appellate court should interfere in the manner in which a Tribunal should conduct its proceedings.  This is all the moreso in the case of the Lands Tribunal where the procedure is more informal than that of court.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In this instance the proceedings before the Tribunal are not of the ordinary nature.  Quite apart from the size of the claim, thefacts and the issues which have been raised and dropped on the part of the Government take this claim out of the ordinary run ofclaims where the basis of compensation would not generally be in dispute.  A consideration of the varying attitude on the part ofthe Government demonstrates quite clearly that this is a case where special attention needs to be paid to the process of definingthe issues.  It may be that when the different contentions of the parties as to the basis upon which the compensation should be assessedis known, there should be a preliminary trial of issues of law so that unnecessary expenses are not incurred in preparing evidenceon alternative bases depending upon what might emerge. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Furthermore, it would be quite wrong for either of the parties to be taken by surprise by any arguments raised in the course ofthe claim on the basis that something might have been put into the evidence which had been omitted because the issues had not beenclarified.  Even whilst this appeal was pending there was a letter from the District Lands Officer of 26 July 2004 in which it wassaid that the events relating to the withdrawal of the 1995 Authorization and the new authorization in 2000 are part of a sequenceof events relevant to the applicantâs claim.  The vacillating approach coupled with the imprecise contentions put forward in theletters from Government leave no doubt that it is high time, nearly 10 years after the 1995 Authorization, that the position andcontentions of the Government are properly spelt out. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Although the Lands Tribunal has a power under section 8A of the Ordinance to transfer proceedings to the Court of First Instance,and although consideration may be given to that course, that may not be necessary in this case particularly in view of the fact thatthe President of the Lands Tribunal is, of course, a Judge of the Court of First Instance.  Under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10</a> of the Ordinance, the Tribunal is given the power to follow the practice and procedure of the Court of First Instance in the exerciseof its civil jurisdiction.  It is for this reason that this court considered it imperative that the issues both of fact and law shouldbe clarified in a form of pleadings which could then form the basis of the determination of the claim to compensation.  In that wayit would be known whether there are indeed questions of law which arise and whether these can be usefully determined prior to thefurther conduct of the claim.  It was for this reason that this court made the order as set out above.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Le Pichon JA:</b></p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Cheung JA:</b></p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Anthony Rogers)</td>            <td width="34%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Doreen Le Pichon)</td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Peter Cheung)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Vice-President</td>            <td width="34%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Justice of Appeal</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Denis Chang SC, Mr Wong Yan Lung SC and Mr Johannes Chan SC, instructed by Messrs Wilkinson &amp; Grist, for the Applicant/Appellant</p>        <p>Ms Teresa Cheng SC and Mr Valentine Yim, instructed by the Department of Justice, for the Respondent/Respondent</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2004/350.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
