Although the section does not say that no appeal shall lie if a party has <i>unsuccessfully appealed</i> against the decree nisi (which is the case here), the spirit and intent of the section must be to prohibit such an appeal as well. To lodge such an appeal is, almost by definition, an abuse of the process of the court.  In any event, even assuming that such anappeal is not caught by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 14(3)(d)</a> as such, leave to appeal should, as a rule, be refused save in the most exceptional circumstances.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>   Furthermore, assuming <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 14(3)(d)</a> does not apply, leave to appeal ought to be sought, at first instance, from Deputy District Judge K W Wong: Order 58, rule 2(4) &amp;(5), Rules of the District Court (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H">Cap 336H</a>).  No valid reason has been advanced for applying for leave directly from the Court ofAppeal: see Order 58, rule 2(6), <i>ibid</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In any event, the applicantâs intended grounds of appeal, set out in an affidavit made by her on 2 June 2008, are wholly unarguable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The applicant argues that the decree nisiof divorce dated 15 March 2006 should be rescinded pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/179/s15c.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 15C</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/179" class="autolink_findacts">Matrimonial Causes Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/179">Cap 179</a>) and by reason of a number of other grounds.  These arguments have been rejected by the Court of Appeal in HCMP 1085/2006. The applicantâs attempt to appeal from the Court of Appealâs decision has been unsuccessful.  In those circumstances, the applicantcannot raise the same arguments or challenge the validity of the decree nisi again in this application.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  It is an abuse of the process of the court to do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The applicant argues that in the order made by Deputy District Judge K W Wong dated 19 May 2008, it is recited that the Court hasread an affidavit made by Mr L as petitioner, but in fact Mr L has only made an affirmation.  She therefore argues that there isan âapparent misrepresentationâ in the order.  There is absolutely no merit in the argument.  The order, made in Chinese, onlyrefers to the Courtâs reading a âèªç« â made by the petitioner.  The term âèªç« â can mean either an affidavit or anaffirmation.  There is no misrepresentation whatsoever.  In any event, the point is wholly immaterial to the validity of the order. The applicant also says the affirmation was not signed by Mr L and his signature was forged.  There is no substance in it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The applicant argues that the order of 19 May 2008 is contrary to a previous order dated 28 September 2007 made by the same deputydistrict judge, where it was ordered that hearing of the proceedings below be stayed until after the disposal of the applicantâsapplication for leave to appeal (HCMP 1534/2007), which was then scheduled to be heard by the Court of Appeal on 23 October 2007.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Again, this is a non-starter.  As described, HCMP 1534/2007 was heard by the Court of Appeal on 23 October 2007.  By a judgmenthanded down 3 days later, the Court rejected the application for leave to appeal.  Furthermore, the applicantâs application forleave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal was rejected by the Appeal Committee of the Court of Final Appeal on 8 May 2008 underFAMV 5/2008.  In those circumstances, there was no impediment to the deputy district judge making the decree nisiof divorce absoluteand he correctly did so by his order dated 19 May 2008.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The applicant also says that CACV 77/2007 and CACV 43/2008 are still pending before the court.  First, in relation to CACV 77/2007,as described, it was already disposed of by the Court of Appeal on 19 March 2008.  The applicantâs appeal was dismissed and leaveto appeal to the Court of Final Appeal refused.  Secondly, CACV 43/2008, which is pending determination, relates to the applicantâstortious claims against HSBC and Madam W.  It is difficult to see how CACV 43/2008 (or for that matter, CACV 77/2007) could preventthe deputy district judge from making the decree nisiof divorce absolute.  Nor did the earlier order of the deputy district judgedated 28 September 2007 refer to these two other appeals.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Then it is argued by the applicant that the order of Deputy District Judge K W Wong of 19 May 2008 does not comply with the requirementunder <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/179/s17a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17A(3)(b)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/179" class="autolink_findacts">Matrimonial Causes Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/179">Cap 179</a>) which provides that the court shall not make absolute a decree of divorce unless it is satisfied that the financial provisionmade by the petitioner for the respondent is reasonable and fair or the best that can be made in the circumstances.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The argument is rejected.  In the order of 19 May 2008, it is specifically recited that the Court is satisfied that the financialprovision made by the petitioner for the respondent is reasonable and fair or the best that can be made in the circumstances.  Asmentioned, orders have already been made for ancillary relief, and the applicantâs challenge against those orders has been dismissedby the Court of Appeal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The applicant then argues that the certificate issued by the Registrar, although dated 23 May 2008, was only posted on 28 May 2008. As a result, she was unable to appeal against the certificate within the 5-day period allowed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/179A/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 116</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/179A" class="autolink_findacts">Matrimonial Causes Rules</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/179A">Cap 179A</a>).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  This argument is misconceived.  The substantive decision was made by Deputy District Judge K W Wong in his order dated 19 May 2008. The issue of the certificate of decree absolute pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/179A/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 66</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/179A" class="autolink_findacts">Matrimonial Causes Rules</a> is only an administrative step.  There is no question of appealing against that certificate.</p>    <p class="heading">Outcome of present application</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  In those circumstances, the application for leave must be dismissed, with no order as to costs.</p>    <p class="heading">Striking out, RPO and RAO</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Based on the matters described above, we take the provisional view that the applicant has shown herself to be a vexatious litigantwho has been abusing the process of the court.

By applying for summary judgment against HSBC when the court had already struck out the claimagainst HSBC, the applicant was plainly seeking to re-litigate issues that had been adjudicated on and to mount a collateral attackagainst the courtâs decision to strike out her claim.  Yam J was obviously right to dismiss the application for summary judgment. To appeal from that decision is a continuation of the abuse of the process of the court, particularly when the decision to strikeout has now been affirmed by the Court of Appeal (CACV 77/2007).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The court has inherent jurisdiction to strike out, of its own motion, abusive proceedings, so as to protect its own process fromabuse:  <i>Ng Yat Chi v China Resources</i> <i>(Holdings) Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%203%20HKC%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 3 HKC 506</a>, 523-526 (paras 26-36). </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  We take the provisional view that such jurisdiction should be exercised in the present case to strike out the appeal in CACV 43/2008with costs to HSBC and to grant a RPO to prohibit the applicant from appealing or applying for leave to appeal to the Court of Appealfrom any judgment, order or determination in any proceedings concerning any matters involving or relating to or touching upon orleading to FCMC 11418/2004 and/or HCA 1819/2006, save with the leave of Tang VP (or another judge designated by the Chief Judge,High Court).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  We also take the provisional view that a RAO should issue against the applicant to prohibit her from taking out any further applicationsin FCMC 11418/2004, including but not limited to any applications for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, without the leave ofa family court judge to be designated by the Chief District Judge.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  We also note that the RPO granted by Yam J is still in force to prohibit the applicant from commencing any fresh proceedings concerningany matters involving or relating to or touching upon or leading to HCA 1819/2006, without leave of the court.  We believe that thereis no need to make any further RPO, at least for the time being, against the applicant. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  We note that Yam Jâs RPO prohibits, without leave, the commencement of any fresh proceedings concerning matters involving or relatingto or touching upon or leading to HCA 1819/2006 only and FCMC 11418/2004 is not referred to specifically as such.  But we take theview that any fresh proceedings concerning matters involving or relating to or touching upon or leading to FCMC 11418/2004 will almostinvariably, if not always, be proceedings concerning matters involving or relating to or touching upon or leading to HCA 1819/2006as well, so as to be caught by the RPO granted by Yam J. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  For the sake of completeness, we further note that the RAO granted by Yam J in HCA 1819/2006 is also extant and in full force.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  If the applicant wishes to argue against the Courtâs striking out CACV 43/2008 and/or making the intended RPO and/or RAO againsther, she must lodge her submission in writing with the Court within 14 days after the handing down of this judgment, in which event(or in the event that no such submission is lodged within the time limit), the Court will decide the matter accordingly. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In the meantime, we order that there be a stay of all further proceedings in CACV 43/2008 pending our decision on the matter andHSBC be notified accordingly.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(Robert Tang)<br />                Vice-President</p>            </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(Andrew Cheung)<br />                Judge of the Court of First Instance</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>The applicant, appearing in person</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2008/554.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
