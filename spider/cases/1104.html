However, no such meetingwas ever held.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The 3rd defendant ("Far East") is a private company with an issued share capital of H.K$50,000 divided into 500 shares of $100 each.Deacon Chiu and his wife each hold 250 shares and together with their sons Dick and David Chiu are directors of Far East.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Ronald Chu and Deacon Chiu were at all relevant times the co-owners of the Yuen Long Theatre, being tenants in common in equal undividedshares.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The plaintiffs allege that at all material times prior to July 1975 Asia was the monthly tenant of the co-owners in respect of YuenLong Theatre ("YLT") and there conducted the business of a cinema operator exhibiting films to the public.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> In both their original defence and amended defence the 1st and 2nd defendants admitted that this was so. It is curious, however,that the 3rd defendant, being the 1st and 2nd defendants wearing their corporate hat, made no such admission. It also made no admissionto several uncontestable allegations in the statement of claim that the 1st and 2nd defendants had specifically admitted. Five daysafter the commencement of the trial the 1st and 2nd defendants indicated through their counsel that they proposed to seek leave toamend their amended defence, and on the following day made a formal application to amend it so as to withdraw these admissions.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The 1st and 2nd defendants also sought and obtained leave to further amend the same paragraph of their amended defence which, inaddition to the admissions, contained a denial that the film projection equipment and cinema seats in YLT were and are the propertyof Asia. This amendment resulted in the insertion of the word "expressly" before the word "denied". It appears therefore, that althoughthey had changed their, minds about their admissiona as to Asia having been the monthly tenant of the co-owners and having con-ductedthe business of cinema operator in YLT, the 1st and 2nd defendants did not feel sufficiently strongly to make these matters the subjectof a denial, let alone an express denial, as they obviously considered to be necessary in respect of the other allegation in thesame para-graph of the amended statement of claim.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The amendment which withdraw the admission as to the existence of a tenancy thus brought the defence of the 1st and 2nd defendantsinto line with that of their company, Far East, in this regard. Despite the unemphatic nature of their pleadings on this aspect ofthe plaintiff's case, it became vary clear during the course of the trial that Deacon Chiu, his wife and their company Far East werestrenuously asserting that the alleged tenancy did not exist and that Asia had merely occupied YLT as the licensor of the co-ownersRonalb Chu and Deacon Chiu. The question as to whether ,a tenancy had in fact existed is, as will be seen, a matter of great importance.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> On 16th July 1975 Asia and Far East entered into a written agreement, signed by Roanld Chu and Chiu for Asia, and by Deacon Chiufor Far East, which states that Asia "licenses (Far East) to enter upon and use the cinema premises (of YLT) save and except thesweet shops and other shops" in the building, for a period of three years from 1st June 1975 at a fee of $60,000 per calendar month.Having entered into occupancy of the cinema in pursuance of this agreement Far East remained there until 31st December 1984.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The plaintiffs allege, and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd defendants admit that Far East failed to pay the sum of $30,000 for its occupationof YLT for the last half of the last month of the three year period, namely May 1978 that it continued to occupy the theatre anduse the fittings and equipment belonging to Asia therein after the expiration of the last day of the period stated in the agreementnamely 31st May 1978 without having paid any licence fee or other consideration in respect of that occupation and use.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Although the 1st and 2nd defendants have pleaded that they admit that Far East entered into occupation of YLT on or about 1st June1975 pursuant to the terms of an agreement dated 16th July 1975 made between Asia acting on behalf of Ronald Chu and Deacon Chiuof the one part and Far East acting through its director Deacon Chiu of the other part they make no admission as to whether thisagreement is a licence as alleged by the plaintiffs. Moreover they deny the plaintiffs, allegation that Far East's occupation ofYLT after 31st May 1978 was unlawful.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> In its original defence Far East pleaded that the written agreement of 16th July 1975 was a tenancy agreement made between Asia aslandlord and Far East as tenant. In its amended defence, however, it claimed, and continues to claim, that the agreement was a licenceauthorising Far East to enter upon and use the cinema premises of YLT for the purpose of showing films for a period of three yearsfrom 1st June 1975 at a monthly licence fee of $60,000.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Far East claims that, by virtue of a written agreement dated 31st May 1973, Ronald Chu and Deacon Chiu agreed that Asia would beappointed as their agent to collect rents or income from the tenants or occupiers of properties held by them as tenants in commonand to disburse all proceeds from such rents or income in accordance with, article 11 of the agreement. In the light of such agreement,Far East contends that Asia was entitled only in its capacity as agent for Ronald Chu and Deacon Chiu as co-owners of YLT to collectthe licence fees payable by Far East under the agreement of 16th July 1975 and that, accordingly, Asia had not been the tenant ofthe co-owners in respect of YLT.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Far East also contends that Asia's alleged agency in respect of the cinema premises of YLT terminated at or short by prior to 31stMay 1978 when the licence agreement expired, or alternatively when Ronald Chu and Deacon Chiu in an exchange of letters in the monthsof February, March and April 1980 agreed to terminate it. Far East concedes, however, that it is liable to pay to Ronald Chu "reasonableand fair damages" for its use and occupation of Ronald Chu's interest in the cinema premises from 1st June 1978 to 31st December1984. What are "reasonable and fair damages" is left to the court to assess.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> I have no doubt that the agreement of 16th July 1975 is a licence agreement. The preamble to the agreement states that Asia had agreedto give to Far East a licence for the showing of films in YLT, and in the body of the agreement Asia expressly licences and authorisesFar East to enter upon and use the theatre for the purpose of showing films for a three year period from 1st June 1975 between thehours of 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. the next morning on every day during that term.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Not only does clause 17 of the agreement impose a strict limitation as to the hours during which Far East is permitted to enter anduse the cinema, but it stipulates that possession of the premises is to remain at all times in Asia.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Furthermore, clause 18 of the agreement specifically provides:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Nothing herein contained shall create or be deemed to create any tenancy as between the parties hereto or to confer upon (Far East)any right or interest in the cinema premises but its presence in and upon the cinema premises shall be only that of a licensee and(Far East) shall not be entitled to claim any right under any existing or future legislation which may offer protection to tenants."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> It is also clear from correspondence sent to Asia that Far East regarded the relationship between itself and Asia as being one of"licensee and grantor". It is therefore surprising that in its original defence Far East pleaded that the agreement is a tenancyagreement, and that the 1st and 2nd defendants in their defence plead that they make no admission as to whether the agreement constitutesa licence as alleged by the plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Before turning to a consideration of whether Asia was at all material times the tenant of Ronald Chu and Deacon Chiu in respect ofYLT, it is convenient to continue to relate the events with which this action is concerned.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> On 30th May 1978, the day before the licence agreement expired, Ronald Chu wrote on behalf of Asia to Far East noting that the licencewas due to expire and requesting that it deliver up vacant possession of the theatre premises on 31st May. By reply letter DavidChiu, a son of Deacon Chiu and a director of Far East, confirmed that, in accordance with an alleged discussion with Ronald Chu,the matter would be left in abeyance until Deacon Chin returned to Hong Kong on or about 10th June. He went on to observe that hehad been advised by his solicitor that Ronald Chu could not solely act for Asia since it was a partnership (sic). Apparently, DeaconChiu was content to let matters rest on that basis and Far East remained in occupancy until 31st December 1984 without payment ofany licence fee or other consideration.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Apart from YLT, Ronald Chu was also the co-owner of the Waldorf Theatre in Tsuen Wan. The other co-owner was a public company namedFar East Consortium Ltd of which the 1st and 2nd defendants, their three sons Dick, David and Dennis and three other persons werethe directors. Originally, Asia had operated the Waldorf Theatre but in 1977 it granted a licence to Victory Motion Picture CompanyLimited to operate it as a cinema. After this licence expired in January 1980 a company called Hong Kong Riviera Limited ("Riviera")indicated that it was interested in licensing the theatre and on 29th January of that year Far East Consortium Limited and RonaldChu licensed it to Riviera for a period of two years at a licence fee of $3,000 per day for the first year and $3,500 per day forthe following year. Under the agreement, Riviera was also obliged to pay 50% of its net profit, if any, derived from the annual ticketsales of the cinema. David Chin signed this agreement on behalf of Far East Consortium Limited, and Ronald Chu and Riviera's representativeeach signed on his own behalf. Asia was not involved in the agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Shortly afterwards, on 21st March 1980, Ronald Chu wrote to Deacon Chiu and informed him that Riviera had indicated to him that italso wished to operate YLT and was prepared to pay a higher licence fee than that which it was paying for the Waldorf Theatre. Thesum that it had offered to pay was $5,800 per day including a bonus. He indicated to Deacon Chiu that he considered these to be favourableterms and requested him to agree to accept the offer. In the letter he also mentioned that if, as in the case of the licence agreementfor the Waldorf Theatre, Deacon Chiu required the agreement to be signed by the co-owners of the property, thus by passing Asia,Ronald Chu would be prepared to agree to the same procedure being followed on this occasion. He enclosed in the letter a  copy ofthe proposed Chinese agreement for Deacon Chiu's perusal and a photocopy of a cheque for $100,000 that Riviera had paid as a depositto Asia as stakeholder for the proposed licence transaction.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> If, as the plaintiffs maintain, Asia at that time enjoyed a monthly tenancy of YLT there is no dispute that it was capable of grantinga licence to Riviera to operate it as a cinema. If on the other hand the co-owners wished to by pass Asia and grant a licence toRiviera in their own names no obstacle lay in the way to prevent them from so doing. Since they controlled Asia there would be nonecessity for them to serve on Asia a notice to quit; and as the grant of a licence to Riviera was inconsistent with exclusive possessionin YLT being vested in Asia the tenancy would be extinguished by operation of law.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> It is as well to recall that at this point of time Far East was not only $720,000 in arrears in its payments to Asia in respect ofits licence agreement relating to YLT but had continued in occupation of the cinema without payment for almost 22 months. Plainlythe longer Far East could continue in occupation the greater would be the financial benefit to it. It is equally plain that becauseof their voting power in Asia Deacon Chiu and his wife could frustrate any attempt by Ronald Chu and his wife to evict Far East fromthe cinema. The situation was thus in a state of deadlock and for as long as it remained so it was to the advantage of Deacon Chiuand his wife.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> On 25th March 1980 Ronald Chu again wrote to Deacon Chiu and urged him to give the matter of the proposed licence to Riviera hisimmediate attention so that an agreement could be executed in good time. This sense of urgency was no doubt due to the fact thatthe Chinese copy of the proposed agreement stated that the licence period would commence on 1st April 1980. On 29th March DeaconChiu replied to both letters. He admitted that the first letter had been handed to him personally by Ronald Chu on the afternoonof 22nd March, and con-firmed a conversation that he had held with Ronald Chu over the telephone on 28th March in which he had agreedto accept Riviera's terms. On the same day Ronald Chu wrote to Deacon Chiu, and acknowledged receipt of his letter of 29th March.He proposed that, as Mr. William Kwok of Fairbairn and Kwok had prepared the licence agreement with Riviera for the Waldorf Theatrehe would likewise ask him to prepare the proposed agreement for YLT and expressed the hope that this would meet with Deacon Chiu'sapproval.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> On the following day, 2nd April having just received a letter dated 1st April from Riviera in which it had indicated its willingnessto extend the time for execution to 5th April Ronald Chu wrote to Riviera and requested that, as the 4th and 5th April were publicholidays, the parties attend at the office of Fairbairn and Kwok on 3rd April to sign the agreement. On the same day he wrote toMr. William Kwok and requested him to ask Deacon Chiu to attend at Mr. Kwok's office on 3rd April for that purpose.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> On the same day Ronald Chu sent an urgent letter by special messenger to Deacon Chiu in which he protested his horror at having beentold by Mr. Kwok that when he had called Deacon Chiu to make arrangements for him to sign the agreement Deacon Chiu had suddenlyand without any explanation refused to sign it. Ronald Chu requested Deacon Chiu to explain why he had done so and urged him to attendat Mr. Kwok's office on 3rd April to sign the agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Ronald Chu not only confirmed the agreed correspondence between the parties but gave evidence that Deacon Chiu had verbally informedhim that he was willing to accept Riviera's offer. He explained that it had been because William Kwok had told him on 2nd April thatDeacon Chiu had refused to sign the agreement that he had written the letter of the same date to Deacon Chiu to personally requesthim to attend at Mr. Kwok's office on 3rd April. He also told the court that he and Mr. Yuen Man, who represented Riviera, had goneMr. Kwok's office on the afternoon of both 2nd and 3rd April and that it was on one or other of those two occasions that Mr. Kwokhad telephoned Deacon Chiu. This matter was not pursued by counsel for any of the parties, but it seems that it is quite possiblethat the information that Ronald Chu said that he had obtained from William Kwok on 2nd April as to Deacon Chiu's refusal to signthe agreement coincided with the telephone call that Ronald Chu said William Kwok had made to Deacon Chiu on that date.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Although what Deacon Chiu is alleged to have told William Kwok about refusing to sign the agreement is hearsay, and William Kwokhimself was unable to recall the conversation it is significant that nowhere in the correspondence between the parties does. DeaconChiu deny the allegation in Ronald Chiu's letter that he had refused to sign the agreement. Bearing in mind the importance of thematter of consent I would have expected Deacon Chiu to have made a point of denying that he had refused to sign the agreement ifin fact such had not been true. A study of his correspondence clearly shows that he is extremely quick to challenge any allegationwith which he disagrees.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Ronald Chu also testified that he and Yuen Man had waited in Mr. Kwok's office until after 6 p.m. on April 3rd in the hope that DeaconChiu would attend and sign the agreement but that he failed to appear. It was suggested to Ronald Chu in cross-examination by counselfor Far East that Deacon Chiu had left Hong Kong for Japan on April 3rd and would therefore have been unable to attend at WilliamKwok's office. The implication seems to have been that Ronald Chu knew that Deacon Chiu would be absent and that by attending withYuen Man at Mr. Kwok's office Ronald Chu had simply been playing a charade. What purpose he would have had in mind in resorting tosuch devious behaviour was not made clear. However, Ronald Chu denied any knowledge of Deacon Chu having gone to Japan that day andsince Deacon Chiu did . not testify at the trial, there is no evidence to support counsels suggestion.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> William Kwok was clearly embarrassed by being requested to give evidence as he had known both Ronald Chu and Deacon Chiu from hisboyhood and addressed both of them as "uncle". Although quite understandably he was unable to recollect the events of 2nd and 3rdof April 1980 with clarity he was able to say that his diary would reveal whether Ronald Chu had attended, at his office on thosedays. Having been requested to do so he returned to his office during an adjournment and reported that having checked his diary for1980 he found an entry for 5 p.m. on 2nd April which read "Ronald Chu - sign contract", and that for 3rd April there was a 5.30 p.m.entry which read "Chu Lap-hoi". It is common ground that Chu Iap-hoi is the transliteration from the Cantonese pronounciation ofRonald Chu's name. He also agreed that he had been introduced to Mr. Yuen Man as a director of Riviera and that Mr. Yuen had attendedat his office on more than one occasion,</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> I found Ronald Chu to be an honest witness and I accept his testimony. He made no attempt to bolster his evidence surrounding theunsuccessful Riviera offer or to place a more favourable interpretation on the correspondence by claiming when it would have beenquite easy to do so without fear of contradiction from any source other than Deacon Chiu himself that Deacon Chiu had made damagingadmissions or assertions to him.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> It is not in dispute that Deacon Chiu, despite his stated agreement to the terms offered by Riviera, did not sign the licence agreementthat had been prepared by William Kwok. However, the correspondence gives no indication that he was unwilling to execute the agreement.Indeed, in a letter dated 2nd April written to Ronald Chu, he re-confirmed that he had no objection to leasing YLT to Riviera andnotified his acceptance of the appointment of William Kwok to handle the documentation.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> On 3rd April he wrote to Ronald Chu and having acknowledged that at 11.55 a.m. of the same day he had received Ronald Chu's letterof 2nd April explained that before he could sign the agreement he must examine it and study its terms. If he had really been willingas he professed to be to enter into the agreement with Riviera there seems to me to have been no reason why Deacon Chiu, knowingas he must have done that the matter was urgent, could not have made an appointment to discuss the proposed terms with William Kwokin order to satisfy himself that they satisfied his requirements. Indeed Mr. Kwok had prepared the earlier licence agreement relatingto Riviera and the Waldorf Theatre and it is reasonable to assume that Deacon Chiu would have realised that apart from the obviousnecessary alterations to times, amounts and parties the terms of the proposed agreement would closely follow those in the Waldorfagreement. Indeed a comparison of the terms of the proposed agreement with those of the Waldorf agreement reveals that other thanthe necessary changes the documents are almost identical. If he had genuinely been interested in Riviera's offer it would have takenhim very little time to peruse the terms of the document.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> On 10th April, presumably hoping that Riviera would still hold open its offer, Ronald Chu again wrote to Deacon Chiu and requestedhim to indicate whether he was willing to execute the agreement. Six days later, on 16th April Deacon Chiu sent a strangely obliquereply to Ronald Chu and informed him that he had communicated  his intentions to William Kwok directly. Indeed, on the very sameday he did in fact write a letter to William Kwok in which he acknowledged that he had received a copy of the license agreement fromhim on 10th April and stated that he had no objection to signing it.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Since Ronald Chu had received his copy of the agreement on 2nd April, it is reasonable to assume that Deacon Chiu's copy was alsoavailable on the same day. Bearing in mind the urgency of the situation, it is surprising that Deacon Chiu, who had earlier professedto be willing to accept the Riviera offer, did not arrange with William Kwok for his copy of the agreement to be sent to him promptlyinstead of simply waiting until 10th April for it to arrive. Notwithstanding this renewed profession of willingness to sign the agreementhe failed to do so and, finally on 17th April Riviera wrote to Ronald Chu and announced that due to the fact that he had been unableto come to any agreement with Deacon Chiu it had decided to withdraw its offer and requested the return of its deposit. The transactiontherefore came to an abrupt end.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Completely unbeknown to Ronald Chu, however, a number of telexes had been passing between David Chiu and Riviera between 3rd and8th April. These telexes were disclosed on discovery by the solicitors for Far East after the bundles of documents had been preparedfor the trial.  Their contents are such that I propose to set them out in full.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The first telex is from Riviera to David Chill and is dated 3rd April:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="6%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="94%" colspan="2" class="quote">Attn Mr. David Chiu</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="6%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="22%" class="quote">                <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">Director</p>            </td>            <td width="72%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="6%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="22%" class="quote">                <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">--------------------------</p>            </td>            <td width="72%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="6%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="94%" colspan="2" class="quote">                Re: Yuen Long Theatre licence agreement                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="6%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="94%" colspan="2" class="quote">                Further to the telephone conversation between your goodself and the undersigned this morning concerning the aboveuntil this moment we still have not received the indemnification letter which you have promised to deliver to my office this afternoon.Pls note that we will be prepared to execute the above agreement at the office of                <p class="quote">Fairbairn and Kwok solicitors if your said indemnification letter does not reach our hands at 5.00 pm.

Counsel for the plaintiffscontends that it must have contained the indemnificiation referred to in the first telex sent by Riviera to David Chiu. He invitesrile to draw the conclusion that Deacon Chiu through his son David had been at work attempting to sabotage the proposed transactionby persuading Riviera to withdraw its offer and that as a consequence of having been given an indemnification, Riviera finally didso. Counsel submits that this exchange of telexes clearly shows that Deacon Chiu had had no intention of entering into an agreementwith Riviera for YLT and that his apparent willingness to sign an agreement as indicated by the correspondence was nothing more thana smokescreen sent up to convey the impression that he was being co-operative and had every intention of acting in Asia's best interests,whereas in reality he was deliberately playing for time and working behind the scene to ensure that no agreement would ever be signed.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> In their joint defence Deacon Chiu and his wife aver that Deacon Chiu did not sign the agreement because at that time Riviera hadbeen known by Deacon Chiu to be insolvent and therefore unable to pay the proposed licence fees. They further aver that Deacon Chiuhad in fact notified Ronald Chu that Riviera was insolvent. In his testimony Ronald Chu denied this and claimed that in the monthsof April and May 1980 and, indeed for the rest of that year, Deacon Chiu and he had had no discussions concerning Riviera's financialhealth.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Notwithstanding, a vigorous attempt by counsel for Far East to impugn the financial standing of Riviera with a view to establishingthat it would have been inadvisable for Deacon Chiu and Ronald Chu to have entered into an agreement with it at that time, thereis not a shred of evidence in the correspondence or otherwise to indicate that Deacon Chiu had been unwilling to proceed with theagreement for any such reason. Had he entertained any doubts as to Riviera's financial standing I am sure that this highly articulateman, whose correspondence is replete with complaints on a variety of other matters, would most certainly have informed Ronald Chuof them. Not only is there a conspicuous absence of any mention of Riviera's insolvency or financial status in the extensive correspondencebetween Ronald Chu and Deacon Chiu at and around the time of the Riviera offer for YLT but, as I have already indicated, Deacon Chiu'sown letters show that on 29th March he had expressed agreement to accept Riviera's terms and that even as late as 15th April he professedto have no objection to signing the agreement. It is plain however that notwithstanding what he said in this last letter he had alreadydeliberately set out to ensure that no agreement would ever be signed.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> It is of no avail at this stage for Deacon Chiu through counsel to engage in an ex post facto analysis of Riviera's financial standingat the relevant time. Moreover there is not the slightest reason to believe that the documents now referred to by counsel to castdoubt on Riviera's financial position would have been available to Deacon Chiu at the material time. I am entirely satisfied thatDeacon Chiu had seen to it that the transaction would be frustrated so that Far East could remain in occupation of YLT for the personalenrichment of himself and his wife.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Although an attack had been made during the course of the trial on Riviera's financial standing Ronald Chu made it clear that Rivierahad dicharged its financial responsibilities under the license agreement for the Waldorf Theatre. There does not appear to be anycogent reason why Riviera would not likewise have been able to meet its commitments under the proposed agreement for YLT since inthe words of counsel for Far East when commenting on Asia's profit and loss accounts for the years from 1968 to 1975 (excluding 1971and 1972 which were missing) YLT was "the flagship" of the cinemas in which Ronald Chu and Deacon Chiu had a financial interest.Indeed counsel was moved to comment in the following terms on the performance of YLT during the years 1970-71 and 1973-1975 of thatperiod: "star performer", "magnificent effort", "even more magnificent effort" and "more magnificent than ever". If Riviera had beenable to meet its financial commitments in respect of the Waldorf Theatre it seems reasonable to assume that it would have been ableto do likewise in the case of YLT which, on all accounts was a more profitable enterprise. There can be little doubt therefore thatFar East having entered into a license agreement to operate YLT from mid 1975 would not have been anxious to relinquish the controlof such a "star performer".</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> It is also apparent from a letter written by Deacon Chiu on 9th November 1983 that his group of companies and Carrian had acquiredthe Bang Bang group of companies, to which Riviera belonged and that his company had paid $42 million for the purchase. He complainedthat he was still losing money as a consequence of that acquisition. It does not seem at all likely that Deacon Chiu would have consideredacquiring the Bang Bang group unless he had been convinced that it was a sound investment. It seems more likely that his disappointmentat the ultimate outcome of his purchase had convinced him with the benefit of hindsight that at the time of the proposed licenseagreement Riviera would have been unable to meet its obligations. He now seizes upon this after acquired knowledge to justify hisfailure to enter into that agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Ultimately ,the plaintiffs in their capacity as shareholders in Asia by a notice dated 18th March 1982, called on the Board of Directorsto convene an extraordinary general meeting in order to pass such resolutions as would be necessary to terminate Far East's occupationof YLT. The Board of Directors however, ignored the notice and no meeting was called within the 21 days required by the articlesof association.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> The plaintiffs then tried another tack. By a notice dated 13th April 1982 they requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting for19th April to pass resolutions to end Far East's occupation of the theatre. This was met with a reply by Deacon Chiu who took objectionto the holding of the meeting on the ground that the required notice of seven days had not been given. Notwithstanding his objectionboth Deacon Chiu and his wife attended the meeting and objected to all the resolutions proposed by the plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> The plaintiffs then served a fresh notice on the 20th April for a meeting to be held on 28th April 1982 for the same purpose. Onthis occasion Deacon Chiu did not personally attend but his wife attended both on her own behalf and as proxy for him. She was accompaniedby her son Dick who had no right to attend. The minutes of the meeting, which were recorded by Deacon Chiu's wife state that afteran initial argument between Dick Chiu and Ronald Chu over Dick Chiu's right to be present and some dispute as to the use of a taperecorder, the meeting began and that it concluded when she objected on her own behalf as well as that of Deacon Chin to all the resolutionscontained in the notice.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> The situation remained in a state of deadlock until 31st December 1984 when Far East finally yielded up possession of YLT. Counselfor the plaintiffs submits that it is reasonable to infer that the reason why Far East had decided to surrender the theatre was thatDeacon Chiu, having just opened a new theatre in Yuen Long called the Golden Dragon, had found that it no longer suited his purposesto remain in occupancy of YLT. The coincidence of these events does indeed strongly suggest that this is an entirely reasonable conclusionto draw.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> This brings me to a consideration of the capacity in which the plaintiffs bring this action against the defendants. Ronald Chu suesas a minority shareholder in Asia for wrongs allegedly done to Asia by Deacon Chiu and by Far East. Alternatively he sues as a co-ownerwith Deacon Chin of YLT. Ronald Chu's wife, the 2nd plaintiff, sues in her capacity as a minority shareholder in Asia on behalf ofAsia for wrongs allegedly done to Asia by Deacon Chiu and Far East.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> In Wallersteiner v Moir (No.2) <i>[</i>1975<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20QB%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 Q.B. 373</a> at 390 Lord Denning MR had this to say about derivative actions:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is a fundamental principle of our law that a company is a legal person, with its own corporate identity, separate and distinctfrom the directors or shareholders, and with its own property rights and interests to which alone it is entitled. If it is defraudedby a wrongdoer, the company itself is the one person to sue for the damage. Such is the rule in Foss v. Harbottle  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281843%29%202%20Hare%20461" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1843) 2 Hare 461.</a> The rule is easy enough to apply when the company is defrauded by outsiders. The company itself is the only person who can sue. Likewise,when it is defrauded by insiders of a minor kind, once again the company is the only person who can sue. But suppose it is defraudedby insiders who control its affairs - by directors who hold a majority of the shares - who then can sue for damages? Those directorsare themselves the wrongdoers. If a board meeting is held, they will not authorise the proceedings to be taken by the company againstthemselves. If a general meeting is called, they will vote down any suggestion that the company should sue them themselves. Yet thecompany is the one person who is damnified. It is the one person who should sue. In one way or another some means must be found forthe company to sue. Otherwise the law would fail in its purpose. Injustice would be done without redress."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> Lord Denning went on to say that the minority shareholders could bring an action in their own names, but in truth on behalf of thecompany, against the wrong-doing directors for the damage done by them to the company, provided always that it was impossible toget the company itself to sue them. He added that it is perfectly proper and in accordance with principle that the minority shareholderssue in their own names, although in reality on behalf of the company, just as an agent may contract in his own name but in realityon behalf. of his principal.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> Although Deacon Chu and his wife held no more than 50% of the shares in Asia I see no reason why the principle stated by Lord Denningshould not apply with equal force in such a situation. Deacon Chiu and his wife were in a position to vote down any suggestion thatAsia should sue Far East. Their votes at the extraordinary general meeting held on 28th April 1982 clearly demonstrated that theywould block any action by the plaintiffs to obtain redress against Far East through Asia.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> It is plain that all attempts by Ronald Chu to get Deacon Chiu to remove Far East from YLT had proved fruitless. Indeed, Ronald Chutestified that on three or four occasions in 1978 he had held discussions with Deacon Chiu urging him to vacate YLT. Deacon Chiu'sresponse to these requests was "Alright, alright, I'll work it out.". Nothing, however, was done. In 1979 Ronald Chu again requestedDeacon Chiu on three, or four occasions to yield up the theatre. Again these requests were to no avail. I am left in no doubt thatDeacon Chiu was content to engage in delaying tactics so as to extend Far East's occupation of YLT for as long as possible. It isclear from Ronald Chu's evidence that, when it suited him, Deacon Chiu was capable of making quick decisions. This is exemplifiedby the speed with which he acted on behalf of Far East Consortium Ltd. when Riviera had earlier sought to license the Waldorf Theatre.There had been no delay on that occasion, nor had Deacon Chiu queried Riviera's financial viability. Indeed, Ronald Chu had approachedDeacon Chiu concerning the proposal to grant a licence to Riviera in respect of the Waldorf Theatre on 26th January 1980 and DeaconChiu, having decided that he wanted William Kwok to draw up the agreement, was able to so expedite matters that it was signed on29th January. This promptitude stands in stark contrast to his conduct during the course of the Riviera negotiations for the licensingof YLT.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> Counsel for Deacon Chiu and his wife and counsel for Far East both contend that no derivative action can possibly arise because atall relevant times Asia was not a tenant of YLT but was acting as a mere agent for the co-owners of the theatre. Counsel for FarEast concedes, however, that as Ronald Chu, as a co-owner, has a valid cause of action against Far East. Indeed, Far East has pleadedthat it is willing to pay Ronald Chu reasonable and fair damages for its use and occupation of his interest in YLT from 1st June1978 to 31st December 1984.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> Counsel for the plaintiffs contends that Ronald Chu must succeed whatever view the court takes of Asia's status. If at the relevanttime Asia had been a tenant of the co-owners then the derivative action is properly founded and both plaintiffs must succeed. Alternatively,if the court concludes that Asia had been merely an agent for the co-owners, then Ronald Chu must succeed in his personal capacity.Counsel observed that although it would be preferable for Ronald Chu to succeed in his personal capacity, the evidence disclosesthat since the parties had conferred a tenancy on Asia and there is no indication that that tenancy had ever been lawfully determined,the plaintiffs had no choice but to bring a derivative action. The action by Ronald Chu in his personal capacity was brought to circumventany attempt by Deacon Chiu and Far East to escape liability by setting up that Asia had not been the tenant of the co-owners butthe mere agent.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> I have already observed, but I think it bears repetition, that until several days into the trial, Deacon Chiu and his wife had admittedin their defence and amended defence that at all material times prior to June 1975 Asia had been the monthly tenant of the co-ownersin respect of YLT and had conducted in those premises the business of a cinema operator exhibiting films to the public. That admissionwas withdrawn and replaced by a non admission. It is also significant that until it amended its defence on 30th July, Far East hadaverred that the licensing agreement between Asia and Far East was a tenancy agreement made between Asia as landlord and Far Eastas tenant for a period of three years at a monthly rental of $60,000. Far East also stated in its amended defence that it was willingto pay to Asia reasonable and fair damages for its use of Asia's interest in furniture and equipment in YLT from 1st June 1978 to31st December 1984.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Apart from the admissions that have now been withdrawn there is the positive evidence of Ronald Chu that the co-owners rented YLTto Asia and that Asia installed in the theatre its own equipment including seating, air conditioning plant, screen, stage curtain,all electrical facilities and sound and projection equipment, and operated it as a cinema from the time that the theatre buildingwas erected until Far East entered under the licence agreement in mid 1975.  In his testimony he went through the accounts to indicatethat rental had been paid by Asia for the use of the theatre. Furthermore, as a consequence of an order for discovery made on 15thOctober during the course of his testimony ,he conducted a search through numerous boxes of old documents and was able to producea rent deposit dated 6th January 1981 in the sum of $200,000. It is clear from the signatures on this document that Ronald Chu andDeacon Chiu received that sum from Asia as guarantee money "for the leasing of YLT".</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> He also produced a payment voucher signed by Deacon Chiu for $12,000 rent for the month of April 1963 paid by Asia in respect ofYLT. Attached to that voucher was another document which acknowledged that Asia had paid $12,000 rent for that month. It also containeda number of terms. One of these terms stated that rent was to be paid each month in advance. Another term prohibited the tenant fromsecretly transferring, assigning or subletting the premises without consent of the landlord. It further provided that in the eventthat the tenant committed a breach of this provision the landlord would be entitled to recover possession of the premises. Thereare various other provisions in this document relating to the duties of the tenant and the rights of the landlord including one whichstates that "if the tenant wants to quit he must give one month's notice in writing or he shall have to pay one month's rent as isthe usual practice in Hong Kong".</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> An examination of the licence agreement itself is illuminating. Not only does the preamble recite that Asia is operating the cinemaand has agreed to give a licence to Far East to show films in the premises, but clause 17 expressly declares that possession of thecinema premises "is and shall at all times be vested in <i>[</i>Asia<i>]</i> .....". If Asia had not been a tenant but a mere agent of the co-owners this is indeed a most surprising clause.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> The correspondence from and on behalf of Far East also shows that it and Deacon Chiu conducted their dealings with Asia and not theco-owners. In particular, when Far East sought the return of the deposit paid under the licence agreement, it directed its requestto Deacon Chiu and Ronald Chu as joint managing directors of Asia. Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that had Deacon Chiu and RonaldChu been the principals for whom Asia had been acting as agent it would have been reasonable for Far East to expect that the depositwas in their hands and would therefore have written to them direct in their capacity as co-owners. There would have been no need,unless Far East accepted and recognised Asia to be the principal, to write to Ronald Chu and Deacon Chiu in their capacity as jointmanaging directors.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> As I have already observed, if the co-owners had wished to by pass Asia they could simply have terminated Asia's tenancy and haveentered into a licence agreement direct with Far East as co-owners. On the other hand, if Asia had not been the tenant of the theatrethere does not seem to be any reason why the co-owners should have used it as their agent. They certainly did not think it necessaryto employ Asia as their agent for the transaction with Riviera for the Waldorf Theatre.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> Counsel or the defendants referred to a written agreement which had been entered into by Deacon Chiu and Ronald Chu on 31st May 1973in order to settle their many grievances. Paragraph 1 of Article 11 of the agreement is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is agreed that the parties shall appoint Asia Motion Picture Development Ltd. as their agent to collect rents or income from thetenants or occupiers of Waldorf Theatre Building and all other properties held by the parties hereto as tenants-in-common and allmoneys received by Asia Motion Picture Development Ltd. shall forthwith be deposited into a new current account to be opened by RonaldChu and Deacon Chiu as joint-signatories with the FNCB Hong Kong Head Office and shall be applied first in payment of the costs andexpenses of collection second in payment of Crown rents, rates, Property Tax and other out goings in respect of Waldorf Theatre Buildingand other properties held by the parties hereto as tenants-in-common thirdly in payment of interest payable under Mortgage MemorialNo. relating to Waldorf Theatre Building and subject thereto pay one half of the balance thereof to Deacon Chiu and the remainingone half to Ronald Chu such payments to Deacon Chiu and Ronald Chu to be made monthly on the last day of each calendar month."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> In the light of this provision counsel contend that, whatever might have been the situation prior to that date, the relationshipof Asia with Ronald Chu and Deacon Chiu was henceforwards that of collection agent for the co-owners. I accept that the wording isso broad that it means that the co-owners had agreed that they would appoint Asia as their agent to collect rents and income fromeven YLT.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> However, whatever may be the correct legal interpretation of the words of an agreement, it is always open to the parties to thatagreement to ignore totally what they have agreed or to apply only such part of parts of it as they see fit. They may also applyit on the basis of their own understanding of its terms. Indeed, when cross-examined as to his understanding of paragraph 1 of Article11, Ronald Chu firmly stated that it had no application to YLT. He explained that Asia had collected the rental from that theatrein its own right because it had rented it and had installed its own equipment in order to operate it, but that it had collected,as agent for the co-owners ,the rentals from the shop spaces and sweet shop which were attached to the theatre but were not operatedby Asia.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> I did not have the benefit of hearing what Deacon Chiu understood by this provision in the agreement but there is no doubt in mymind on the evidence before me that at all times he would have made it his business to receive, and did in fact receive, the annualprofit and loss accounts and balance sheets for Asia and YLT and knew full well that Asia was paying rent for YLT after the 1973agreement. I find it inconceivable that he would not have concerned himself with these accounts and that had there been any inaccuraciesin them, particularly one which ran contrary to his conception of how the 1973 agreement should be operating, he would not have queriedthem with Ronald Chu.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> Ronald Chu testified that the accounts had been sent to Deacon Chiu and that after Far East have entered YLT under the licence agreement,its own staff performed the tank of preparation of the accounts and had sent them to Ronald Chu for signature. I am satisfied thatDeacon Chiu had access to and well knew the contents of the accounts. If he had not received or not had the accounts but had wantedto see them he would have had no difficulty, as joint managing director of Asia and co-owner of YLT, in obtaining them. I considerthat has belated complaints in the correspondence that he had not received the accounts to be both self-serving and without justification.It is significant that having written to the auditors on 11th August 1980 complaining that he had not received copies of the statementsof account for Asia for the previous three years and requesting that copies of those accounts together with the accompanying, auditorsreports be supplied to him, Deacon Chiu received the following reply:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In compliance with your request I now send you herewith extra copy of the audited accounts of (Asia) for the three years ended 31stMarch 1977, 31st March 1978 and 31st March 1979 for your reference. Please acknowledge receipt."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> So it appears that, as far as the auditors were concerned, Deacon Chiu had already been sent copies of the accounts of Asia for thoseyears.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> Ronald Chu also told the court that in 1975 he and Deacon Chiu had agreed that the rental for YLT be increased to $360,000 per annumin order to take into account the payment of rates and the fact that the rental had remained static at $144,000 for a lengthy periodof time and was therefore due for an increase. I am satisfied that Ronald Chu was a truthful witness I see no reason to accept counselfor Far East's invitation to disbelieve this piece of evidence. Moreover, had Deacon Chiu wished to contradict Ronald Chu he hadthe opportunity of expressly doing so from the witness box.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> Counsel for Deacon Chiu and his wife referred me first to the alternative way in which the plaintiffs had pleaded the capacity inwhich Asia had entered into the licence agreement with Far East, namely, either as agents for the co-owners or in right of its statusas monthly tenant, and secondly, to the fact that in an affirmation filed on 10th January 1983 Ronald Chu affirmed, and during thecourse of the trial confirmed as being correct, that:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"On the 16th of July 1975 the 1st defendant and I acting through Asia Motion Picture Development Ltd granted a licence to the 3rddefendant in respect of the property."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> Although counsel concedes as indeed he must that the plaintiffs had pleaded in the alternative because there had been a dispute asto whether Asia had entered into the licence agreement as agent of the owners or in its own right he submits that it is clear fromthe affirmation that as far as Ronald Chu is concerned Asia entered into the agreement purely as agent for the co-owners.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> Having heard Ronald Chu testify I have come to the view that in his affirmation he had been speaking of the reality of the situationas a layman might see it. There can be no doubt that the reality is that Deacon Chiu and Ronald Chu themselves had indeed made thedecision to grant a licence to Far East notwithstanding that they chose to do so wearing their corporate Asia hats. Such imprecisionof language is understandable from a layman. Indeed during the course of his evidence there were other instances of loose terminology.It is also evident in the correspondence. I have already mentioned that when Deacon Chiu's son David wrote as a director of Far Eastto Ronald Chu he observed that he had been advised by his solicitor that Ronald Chu could not solely act for Asia Motion PictureDevelopment Ltd since it was a "partnership".</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> I am satisfied on all the evidence that at all material times the co-owners had rented YLT to Asia and that notwithstanding the strictlegal interpretation of paragraph 1 of Article 11 of the 1973 agreement Ronald Chu did not understand it to mean that Asia was tobe a mere agent for the co-owners for the collection of rent and income from YLT, and that neither of the co-owners ever treatedAsia as being their agent in relation to YLT or regard Asia in any light other than as tenant in respect of the theatre.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> There is no dispute that Deacon Chiu and his wife as directors of Asia owed a fiduciary duty to Asia to act in its best interests.As Astbury J observed in Transvaal lands Company v New Belgium (Transvaal) Land and Development Company <i>[</i>1914<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20Ch%20488" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 Ch. 488</a> at 503:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Where a director of a company has an interest as shareholder in another company or is in a fiduciary position towards and owes aduty to another company which is proposing to enter into engagements with the company of which he is a director, he is in our opinionwithin this rule. He has a personal interest within this rule or owes a duty which conflicts with his duty to the company of whichhe is a director."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>Lord Herschell in Bray v Ford <i>[</i>1896<i>]</i> AC 44 at page 51 Put the matter this way:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is an inflexible rule of a Court of Equity that a person in a fiduciary position such as the respondent's, is not, unless otherwiseexpressly provided entitled to make a profit; he is not allowed to put himself in a position where his interest and duty conflict.It does not appear to me that this rule is, as has been said founded upon principles of morality. I regard it rather as based onthe consideration that, human nature being what it is there is danger in such circumstances, of the person holding a fiduciary positionbeing swayed by interest rather than by duty, and thus prejudicing those whom he was bound to protect."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>I do not think that it is necessary to refer to any of the many other authorities that were cited to me concerning the duty of directors.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> In her defence Deacon Chiu's wife pleaded that she had been made a shareholder and director of both Asia and Far East as a nomineefor or on behalf of Deacon Chiu and that at all material times had acted as his nominee and took orders from him. She further pleadedthat at no material time had she taken any active role in the running of the business or corporate affairs of either company butthat insofar as she had participated in all the affairs of both companies she did so only as his nominee and that since he exercisedfull control over Asia she was neither interested in its affairs nor was in a position to act contrary to his wishes. She claimsthat therefore she has at no material time acted in breach of her fiduciary duties owed to Asia.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> It is not clear what is meant by the averment that Deacon Chiu exercised full control over Asia. However that may be I find it difficultto imagine that she would not have known of Asia's affairs and took no interest in the company. In fact she recorded the minute;,of the extraordinary general meeting of Asia held on 28th April 1982 which disclose that she took an active part in the meeting andpurported to be familiar with the internal workings of the company. Moreover, in a letter of 23rd April 1982 she wrote to RonaldChu and among other matters asserted that "the genuine founders who possess half share of the company (Asia) and are equally jointmanaging directors as you yourself are completely in the dark". Apparently she considered herself to be a joint managing directorof Asia even though in fact she was only a director. She then went on to state that she was prepared at any moment to appear in courtand swear to the truth of the many allegations that she had made in the letter concerning Ronald Chu's activities in Asia. Quiteclearly the fact that she made such a statement presupposes that she had interested herself in the affairs of the company and haddirect personal knowledge of the various matters that she said she was prepared to testify to.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> Mrs Chiu further pleaded in the alternative that i?she should be found to have acted in breach of the fiduciary duties which sheowed to Asia she would seek relief from any liability on such terms as the court may think fit under the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s358.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 358</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap 32</a> and that she had acted honestly and reasonably and in the circumstances, ought fairly to be excused from her breach of duty.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> She has, however made no attempt to discharge the burden cast upon her under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s358.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 358.</a> But even on the assumption that she had done so she is on her own averments, still fixed with liability. In this connexion I referto the judgment of Ungoed-Thomas J in Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd v Cradock &amp; Ors (No.3) <i>[</i>1968<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20WLR%201555" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 WLR 1555</a> at 1613 where in reference to two directors of the company in question the learned judge said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It seems to me however that both Barlow-Lawson and Jacob were nominated as directors of the plaintiff to do exactly as they weretold by Cradock, and that that is in fact what they did. They exercised no discretion or volition of their own and they behaved inutter disregard of their duties as directors to the general body of stockholders or creditors or anyone but Cradock. They put themselvesin his hands not as their agent or adviser but as their controller. They were puppets which had no movement apart from the stringsand those strings manipulated by Cradock. They, were voices without any mind but that of Cradock; and with that mind they are fixedin accordance with the view which I have already expressed on the law. They doubtless hoped for the best but risked the worst; andthat worst has befallen them."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> If one substitutes Mrs Chiu for Barlow-Lawson and Jacob and Deacon Chiu for Cradock, it is apparent that her averment that she hadat all times acted as Deacon Chiu's nominee and had taken orders from him, does not excuse her.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> It is plain that Deacon Chiu and his wife owed fiduciary duties to both Asia and Far East. These interests came into conflict whenthe licence expired and Far East unlawfully remained in occupation of YLT. Deacon Chiu and his wife clearly decided to resolve theconflict in favour of Far East; and their decision was made with a view to their own financial advantage. The obvious consequencewas that Asia would suffer financial loss. They are therefore liable to account to Asia for the profits they made as a consequenceof that lawful occupation.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> The general rule of equity is that no one who has duties of a fiduciary nature to perform is permitted to enter into engagementsin which he has or can have a personal interest conflicting with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect (Regal (Hastings's)Ltd v Gulliver &amp; Ors <i>[</i>1967<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20AC%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 AC 134</a> per Viscount Sankey at page 137)</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> Equally Far East is liable, on the application of equitable principles, to account for its profits on the basis that it was a constructivetrustee. In this connexion I refer to the judgment of Ungoed-Thomas J in the Selangor Case at pages 1579-1591 and in particular totwo passages therein. In the first passage which appears at page 1579 the learned judge referred to the two different kinds of constructivetrustees. It is only those of the second kind with which we are here concerned. The learned judge defined them as:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Those whom a court of equity will treat as trustees by reason of their action of which complaint is made. Distinguishing featuresare (a) that such trustees claim to act in their own right and not for beneficiaries and (b) no trusteeship arises before but onlyby reason of the action complained of."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a> In the second passage at page 1582 the learned judge had this to say.-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It seems tome imperative to grasp and keep constantly in mind that the second category of constructive trusteeship (which is theonly category with which we are concerned) is nothing more than a formula for equitable relief. The court of equity says that thedefendant shall be liable in equity as though he were a trustee. He is made liable in equity as trustee by the imposition or constructionof the court of equity. This is done because in accordance with equitable principles applied by the court of equity it is equitablethat he should be held liable as though he were a trustee. Trusteeship and constructive trusteeship are equitable conceptions.</p>        <p class="quote"> </p>        <p class="quote">        The court of equity is not administering criminal law but equity. It is equity and not criminal law or even tort or contractthat governs whether a person shall be liable in equity as constructive trustee. So, whether a misapplication of a company's fundsfor the purchase of its shares occasions the imposition of liability as constructive trustees depends not upon the statutory provisionmalting it a criminal offence or upon statue or criminal law or common law conceptions, but upon equity and its principles. As mentionedin argument there are criminal offences nowadays which are not morally reprehensible and are not even blameworthy. Indeed, it appearsthat nowadays, by Act of Parliament, a person is made criminal although he can unquestionably and conclusively prove that he didnot even know the facts that establish the crime. If indeed this is so this is crime without guilt. It is to brand such proven innocentsas convicted criminals. It may be convenient policing. It is not justice and it certainly is not equity. On the other hand theremay be actions dishonest and fraudulent in the eyes of equity yet not punishable under the criminal law. Equity is not crime andthis court is not the Old Bailey. And it is according to "the plain principles of a court of equity" which this court, in its administrationof equitable relief, that what is "dishonest and fraudulent" has to be judged. And the language used by the courts of equity, inthe authorities referred to must be similarly understood in accordance with their equitable principles and conceptions. This mayall seem over emphatic emphasis of the obvious; but it is an emphasis that I have found essential if confusion is to be avoided."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> The relief claimed by the plaintiffs against Deacon Chiu and his wife is first damages for breach of their fiduciary duties, secondly,an order for all necessary accounts and enquiries, including where necessary, all tracing orders and consequential directions andthirdly an account of profits made as a result of Far East's unlawful occupation of YLT from 1st June 1978 to 31st December 1984.They claim against Far East judgment in the sum of $30,000 in respect of licence fees due and owing to Asia for the period from 16thMay 1978 to 31st May 1978 under the terms of the licence agreement of 16th July 1975, and damages for unlawful use and occupationof YLT for the period previously stated or alternatively an account of profits.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that on the evidence before it the court is in a position to quantify the profit which Far Easthas made as a consequence of its unlawful occupation. The method by which calculation is to be made is based on the actual figuresextracted from Far East's audited accounts relative to the period for which it was in occupation of YLT after the expiration of thelicence agreement but excluding the last nine months from 1st April to 31st December 1984. The reason why counsel excludes theselast nine months from consideration is that he contends that the accounts for that period should be looked at with suspicion dueto the fact that they were approved by Far East's board of directors some three months after it no longer had any interest in YLT.They also disclose that the item for salaries for no apparent reason, had leapt from $146,096 to $337,064.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> Counsel's alternative contention is that if the court is not satisfied that the profit can adequately be quantified by this processof computation, it is possible to calculate damages on the basis of the agreement of 20th March 1980 proposed by Riviera in whichthere was an offer of a licence fee of $5,800 per day for the first year commencing 1st April 1980 and a licence fee of $6,300 perday for the second year, commencing 1st April 1981, and to make allowance for deductions in accordance with the terms of that agreement.From these figures the actual operating expenses incurred by Far East at that time would be deducted in order to produce net figures.The calculations for the periods before and. after that for which the agreement would have operated had it come to fruition, mustnecessarily be made in accordance with an estimate of licence fees and operating expenses based on their proportionate relationshipto the increase or decrease of the box office receipts for the same periods.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> In short counsel's submission is that nothing could be fairer than to adopt the first method and to take Far East's own audited accountsand to proceed to an account of profits on that basis. He also submits that apart from constituting an alternative basis on whichthe court can make a calculation, the evidence concerning the Riviera transaction for YLT is so cogent that it can be accepted withthe utmost confidence and as such serves to reinforce the reliability of the first method.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> By whichever method the calculation is performed there is no substantial difference in the final figures. The first method producesa figure of $12,521,633 and the second method a figure of $11,721,530.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> In dealing with the plaintiffs' proposed methods of calculation of what sum is due by Far East to them, counsel for Far East centredhis attack on the Riviera transaction. The gist of his contention is that because of Riviera's financial position at the relevanttime its ill-fated offer is totally misleading and utterly unreliable. It is his submission that evidence given by Mr. Wilkinson,a chartered surveyor in the firm of A. G. Wilkinson and Associates forms the proper basis on which an assessment of profits shouldbe made.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> Mr. Wilkinson produced a report prepared on the basis of instructions given by Deacon Chiu. The instructions were to assess the rentalvalue of YLT on the open market as at the periods 1st June 1978 to 31st March 1980, 1st April 1980 to 31st March 1982, 1st April1982 to 31st March 1984 and 1st April 1984 to 31st December 1984. Having inspected the theatre Mr. Wilkinson assessed the monthlyrental values for the relevant periods to be $42,000, $55,000 $72,000 and $50,000 respectively.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a> He reported that the theatre appeared to be in sound structural and decorative order at the date of inspection namely 22nd November1984 and that, although he did not carry out a detailed inspection of all the furniture equipment fixtures and fittings, and wastherefore unable to report on the standard and condition of each item, the general impression he formed was that they appeared tobe old.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="pseudopara" id="p93">93.</a> Mr. Wilkinson acknowledged that although the theatre is considered to be one of the oldest cinemas in Yuen Long it is situated withinthe early established and densely populated portion of Yuen Long town centre where all forms of facilities and amenities are readilyavailable. He reported that the pedestrian and vehicular flow along the two streets from which access can be gained to the theatrelobby is moderate and that that part of the street on the western side of the theatre is a pedestrian precinct and rest garden whichis a popular shopping area within the district with a high pedestrian flow.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="pseudopara" id="p94">94.</a> In arriving at his valuation figures Mr. Wilkinson proceeded on the assumption that any renewal of the licence which Far East hadearlier entered into concerning the theatre, would be from 1st June 1978 and be based on similar terms and conditions to those inthe earlier agreement that the occupant would be responsible for the maintenance of the interior of the premises and payment of ratesand that the landlord would carry out structural repairs maintain the exterior and. pay property tax and crown rent.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="pseudopara" id="p95">95.</a> The basis on which Mr. Wilkinson made his valuation was that leases of new cinemas in Hong Kong are normally negotiated on a mediumterm of 7 to 14 years at a minimum rent and a percentage of takings including retail sales of confectionary and the like. Accordingto him the percentage is usually of the whole takings but sometimes is related to takings over a certain level less entertainmenttax.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="pseudopara" id="p96">96.</a> Notwithstanding his comments on the pedestrian flow adjacent to the theatre Mr. Wilkinson's report went on to state that the cinemawas not situated in "a good entertainment location". He conceded however that comparative tenancy agreements of similar cinema premisesin the immediate locality are rare and that he had therefore taken the view that the most reliable basis of rental assessment wouldbe accounts which show the amount of rent that an operator could afford to pay over the period in question, taking into considerationtenant's management maintenance burden improvement costs and the like.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a> In his testimony he expanded his findings concerning the interior of the theatre and said that the projection room was "very poor"and that the equipment being of the reel to reel type was obsolete. He also expressed the view that the rental paid by a cinema operatoris a percentage of the net income. In his experience he had found it to vary from 30% to 70%. Using Far East's accounts for YLT ashis base, he applied a percentage of 50% for the early years and, because of the change in situation due to the development of thenew town, he applied one of 40% in respect of the later years. He stated that he had arrived at these percentages on the basis ofhis experience.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="pseudopara" id="p98">98.</a> He agreed that there were very few cinemas in the same locality as YLT, that the assessment of a theatre's potential is not an exactscience and that many factors have to be weighed in coming to an assessment. He also agreed that, provided that it comes from a totallyindependent source a very good pointer to the market rental would be a genuine offer for a theatre made by an prospective cinemaoperator. He also conceded that an offer or would make it his business to examine the accounts of the theatre and that an offer froman experienced operator who had access to such accounts would be an excellent indicator of the true valuation.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="pseudopara" id="p99">99.</a> Moreover, Mr. Wilkinson agreed that until 1983 there had been only three cinemas in the Yuen Long area and that of these YLT wasthe newest and the biggest. He added however, that after he had inspected the surrounding area in order to find what would attractpeople to the cinemas he came to the conclusion that the bulk of the paying customers were on the opposite side of the main roadto that on which YLT was situated. How he had been able to come to such a conclusion and why paying customers would be deterred fromattending a cinema by the prospect of having to cross the main road was far from clear.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="pseudopara" id="p100">100.</a> Essentially, Mr. Wilkinson said that he had arrived at his valuation on the statements of account provided by Far East but that althoughthese accounts formed the background of the appraisal, he also took into consideration the nature of the locality and the elementof competition in arriving at his conclusion that he should apply the percentages of 50% and 40%, rather than one closer to 70%,in determining his estimate of the appropriate rental figures. Apart from the rather unpersuasive reason that Mr. Wilkinson offeredfor suggesting why prospective patrons would be disinclined to attend YLT, he stated that in his view the cinema was in a poor areadue to the multiplicity of hawkers and that their presence made access to the theatre difficult. When cross examined as to his conclusionthat YLT was the worst maintained of the three cinemas in that area, it became clear that he had not entered the other two theatresbut had merely taken an external view of the buildings including that portion of each which was open to the general public wishingto buy tickets. From his view of the exterior of a particular cinema he deduced that its interior condition would be in a similarstate. He explained that he had not inspected the interior parts of these theatres because he had been unable to gain permissionto do so. The fact that he had wanted to inspect the interiors does suggest, however that there would have been some purpose forso doing and that it does not follow that the standard of the facilities within each building must necessarily be judged by referenceto its external appearance.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="pseudopara" id="p101">101.</a> When questioned as to the reason why he had considered that an item for a management fee of $540,000 in Far East's accounts for theyear of 1976 was warranted he replied that as this sum had been shown in the audited accounts it must have been a straightforwardpayment. Such an answer does not seem to me to offer an explanation as to why it should have been necessary for Far East to pay amanagement fee. Indeed throughout the trial Far East took the line that because of its experience in operating cinemas and the highlyadvantageous terms on which it could obtain films it would be able to run a cinema more efficiently and profitably than Riviera.I do not propose to deal with Mr. Wilkinson's non expert views on other matters.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="pseudopara" id="p102">102.</a> Mr. Paul Varty of Collier Petty testified that he had been the auctioneer at the public auction held in February 1985 for the saleof YLT. He said that his firm had suggested a reserve price in the region of $4.5 million on the basis that a reserve price is normallyset at around 15% to 25% below the anticipated sales price. There were approximately six bidders at the auction. Two developers droppedout of the bidding between $9.5 and $10.5 million. One other bidder withdrew at $11.5 million, leaving Ronald Chu and David Chu tobid progressively by units of $100,000 to $13.9 million. David Chiu dropped out of contention at this stage and Ronald Chu securedthe cinema with a winning bid of $14 million.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="pseudopara" id="p103">103.</a> The outcome of the auction illustrates the difficulty faced by experts in assessing values. Clearly Collier Petty's assessment hadbeen wildly wide of the mark. The parties who were in perhaps the best position to know the value of the cinema demonstrated thatthey were prepared to pay $13.9 million and $14 million respectively for it.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="pseudopara" id="p104">104.</a> Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that applying the rough rule of thumb that the capital value is one hundred times the net monthlyrental of a premises if one bases the calculation on the highest price that David Chiu bid, and was therefore clearly prepared topay for the theatre, the rental would be $139,000. He concedes however that this type of calculation merely gives the very broadestidea of the rental value of the theatre.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="pseudopara" id="p105">105.</a> On the one hand I have before me Mr. Wilkinson's valuation which was substantially influenced by his personal judgment based on hisexperience as a quantity surveyor of the rental value calculated as a percentage of the net income. Against this there is, firstthe figure, to which Deacon Chiu clearly agreed of $60,000 per month in respect of the 1975 licence agreement secondly the positiveand genuine offer by Riviera in 1980, thirdly, the net amount of $90,000 per month stated by Deacon Chiu himself in a letter dated3rd June 1982 as being a reasonable sum at which to let the cinema to a third party in March 1980 and finally there is the evidenceof the capital value of the theatre in 1985. Quite clearly the 1975 figure of $60,000 per month indicates that, after having takeninto account the factor of inflation, the true figures from 1978 onwards would be substantially higher. This is also borne out byDeacon Chiu's own knowledgeable assessment of the rental value in March 1980.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="pseudopara" id="p106">106.</a> I find these concrete pieces of evidence to be more reliable indicators of value than the assessment performed by Mr. Wilkinson.Accordingly, I accept counsel for the plaintiffs submission that I should base my award on the known figures in Far East's own accounts.The evidence concerning Riviera's offer and Deacon Chiu's own assessment of what the proper rental should have been in March 1980lend valuable support to the legitimacy of the adoption of this method of calculation.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="pseudopara" id="p107">107.</a> I do not propose to set out the full details of the calculation as these have been placed before the court and the parties are wellaware of them. Suffice it to say that it is based on operating income less direct operation expenses. However as to the last ninemonths of Far East's occupancy of the theatre the calculation has been based on the accounts for the previous year. As counsel forthe plaintiffs observed one must approach the accounts for the final year with a considerable degree of caution. In this connexionI have already observed that for the last complete financial year salaries not attributable to the running of the .theatre increasedfrom $146,076 to $337,064 for no apparent reason. For the year ended 31st March 1983 the unaudited accounts disclose a figure of$437,241 for repairs and maintenance. An examination of the documents purporting to support this claim failed to disclose any justificationfor it. Indeed in the audited accounts the figure was reduced to $81,298. Moreover a management fee of $540,000 was paid to Rex EntertainmentLtd. in respect of management services provided during the year. One then finds that the directors of Far East were also the directorsof Rex Entertainment Ltd. The report of the directors of Far East for that year also shows that Far East had assigned to Far EastInternational Investment and Finance Ltd. and Rex Entertainment Ltd. certain advances totalling $3,147,514 made to related companiesat net book value. The directors of the latter company are none other than Deacon Chiu, his wife and Dick David and Daniel Chiu.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="pseudopara" id="p108">108.</a> I am satisfied that the figures extracted from the audited accounts by Mr. Lam are correct and that the net profits made by Far Eastduring the period of its unlawful occupation of YLT namely 1st June 1978 to 31st December 1984, and on which judgment should be based,amount to $12,521,633. To this sum must of course be added $30,000 in respect of the arrears of unpaid licence fee to Asia at 31stMay 1978.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="pseudopara" id="p109">109.</a> This brings me to a consideration of the matter of interest. Being a case for equitable interest no question arises as to interestunder section 48 of the Supreme Court Ordinance <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap. 4</a>. In this connexion counsel for the plaintiff relied upon the approach takenin Wallersteiner v.

The principle of Burdick v Garrett(k) will apply to the effect that if it is shown that the defaulting trusteeor director used the money "in trade" he may be charged compound interest. In Wallersteiner v Moir (No.2)(1) the Court of Appealheld that compound interest was to be charged with yearly rests and (having regard to the present high interest rates) not at thetraditional 5 per cent. per annum but at 1 per cent. above the Bank England minimum lending rate from time to time. The fact thatthe money does not actually pass through the director's hands may be immaterial where it is established that he benefited at thecompany's expense through his power to dispose of company money. Further, even if there has been no investigation of the amount ofprofit a director receives if a transaction involving company funds is clearly of a commercial character, it will be assumed, inthe absence of evidence to the contrary to be profitable for the purpose of awarding compound interest. (m) Buckley L. J. statedthat the basis for awarding interest in cases of this kind was not to compensate the company but in order to ensure as far as possiblethat the defendant retains no profit for which he ought to account. He rejected the view that compound interest should be awardedon the ground that the monies were working capital of the companies affected.

It isnoteworthy that in none of the cases cited in this judgment, some of which involved breaches of fiduciary duty, was compound interestordered, although in some of them at least it seems likely that the money must have been used in trade. In Wallersteiner v. Moir(No.2) <i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20QB%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975]</i> Q.B. 373</a>, the evidence was that Wallersteiner was a financier operating through a complex structure of companies and that he used the moneyswhich he obtained or its capital equivalent in his operations. In those circumstances it was presumed that the money was worth tohim the equivalent of compound interest at commercial rates with yearly rests at least. In the present case accepting that the moneywas used by the defendants for their business purposes part of it must have been used for the benefit of O'Sullivan himself."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p112" class="pseudopara" id="p112">112.</a> Further reliance is placed on what Waller LJ said concerning interest at page 473:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Should the interest be compound? When the question of compound interest was raised the judge was referred only to Wallersteiner v.Moir (No.2) <i>[</i>1975<i>]</i> Q.B. 373. This was a case of very special facts and quite different from the present case. It was also a case decided at a time oflow steady rates of interest. The reason for awarding compound interest was that the interest which had not been paid must be takento have been used by the defaulting party to make a profit for himself. We have not been referred to any other modern case wherecompound interest has been involved. In this case there is a joint venture and the effect of the joint venture would mean that inpart at any rate the interest was being used to further the joint venture. Furthermore whilst compound interest is payable in equitymatters it must be borne in mind that at common law it has been made unlawful and this indicates the nature of the circumstancesrequired to justify it. I am of opinion therefore that this being a joint venture with one reservation I would not award compoundinterest. The reservation is with regard to the foreign royalties under the publishing agreement. In that case there were secretdeductions which were not used in the joint interests of the plaintiff and the companies. As Dunn L.J. has explained in his judgmenta substantial proportion of these royalties were diverted to foreign subsidiaries of the defendants without the knowledge of theplaintiff. Accordingly it is to be inferred that the defendants had the use of the money for commercial purposes and Mr. Miller hasconceded that compound interest should be charged. In so far as it has been shown clearly that it was not used for commercial purposesthen only simple interest should be charged: see Attorney-General v. Alford  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281854%29%204%20De%20GM%20%26%20GBy%20843" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1854) 4 De G. M. &amp; G. 843.</a> It is clear from this that the basis for ordering compound interest is that the defendant has actually used the money in trade. Theprinciple therefore is that he must disgorge the profits which he has made."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p113" class="pseudopara" id="p113">113.</a> It seems to me, however, that, as counsel for the plaintiffs contends the point of distinction made between the factual situationin the Wallersteiner case and that in the O'Sullivan case emerges from Dunn LJ's judgment where in comparing the two situations HisLordship observed that part of the money involved must have been used for the benefit of the injured party himself. Likewise WallerLJ stated that he would not award compound interest insofar as there was a joint venture, since the effect of the joint venture wouldmean that, at least in part, the interest had been used in its furtherance. It is significant, however, that the court ordered thatcompound interest be paid in respect of the money that had not been used to further the joint venture. I therefore do not understandWaller LJ's observation that Wallersteinder's case had been decided at a time of low, steady rates of interest to have been the reasonwhy he considered that simple interest only should be paid in respect of part of the monies.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="pseudopara" id="p114">114.</a> Counsel for the defendants also contend that the court should not make an order for the payment of compound interest because FarEast's expertise and effort in generating the profit from YLT benefited the plaintiffs. This self proclaimed expertise is recitedin the preamble to the licence agreement of 16th July 1975 which states that Far East held itself out to be an expert in the managementand operation of a cinema. The preamble also recites that the management of Far East is closely connected with other cinemas in HongKong and is able to obtain beneficial terms for the booking and exhibition of films because of its connection.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="pseudopara" id="p115">115.</a> I am unable to accept counsels' argument. The very essence of the plaintiff's claim is that Asia having been entitled to possessionof YLT since the expiration of the licence agreement with Far East on 1st June 1978 has been totally deprived of any income fromthe cinema and has not received any of the profits reaped by Far East from it since its unlawful occupation. The O'Sullivan caseis of no assistance to the defence. There the factual situation was entirely different from that in the present case. In O'Sullivan'scase the defendants concerned took over the management of a young unknown composer and singer whose compositions and recordings hadall been failures and, whilst recognising his potential had actually performed considerable work in promoting him to worldwide fame.Accordingly the court considered that it was just that an allowance be made for the skill and labour employed in promoting him.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="pseudopara" id="p116">116.</a> I am satisfied that it is proper to award compound interest. Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that this interest should be calculatedat the rate of 2% above the prime rate.   In support of this contention he referred me to International Military Services Ltd. v.Capital and Counties P L C <i>[</i>1982<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20WLR%20575" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 WLR 575</a> where Slade J said at page 587:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="76%" colspan="2" class="quote">                The question arises as to the rate of interest which should be awarded to the plaintiffs in the discretion of thecourt. In this context I have been assisted by a reference to the recent decision of Forbes J. in Tate &amp; Lyle Food and DistributionLtd. v. Greater London Council  <i>[</i>1982 <i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20W%20L%20R%20149" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 W. L. R. 149.</a> The facts of that case were very different but he made some pertinent observations as to matters of principle. In particular he pointedout (for example at p. 153H), that there are considerable differences between personal injury cases and cases involving injury tobusiness concerns. He said at P. 154:                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="13%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="4%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="72%" class="quote">                '.... I do not think the modern law is that interest is awarded against the defendant as a punitive measure for havingkept the plaintiff out of his money: I think the principle now recognised is that it is all part of the attempt to achieve restitutioin integrum. One looks, therefore not at the profit which the defendant wrongfully made out of the money he withheld - this wouldindeed involve a scrutiny of the defendant's financial position - but at the cost to the plaintiff of being deprived of the moneywhich he should have had. I feel satisfied that in commercial cases the interest is intended to reflect the rate at which the plaintiffwould have had to borrow money to supply the place of that which was withheld. I am also satisfied that one should not look at anyspecial position in which the plaintiff may have been; one should disregard for instance the fact that a particular plaintiff' becauseof his personal situation, could only borrow money at a very high rate or, on the other hand was able to borrow at specially favourablerates. The correct thing to do is to take the rate at which plaintiffs in general could borrow money. This does not however to mymind mean that you exclude entirely all attributes of the plaintiff other than that he is a plaintiff. There is evidence here thatlarge public companies of the size and prestige of these plaintiffs could expect to borrow at 1 per cent over minimum lending ratewhile for smaller and less prestigious concerns the rate might be as high as 3 per cent over minimum lending rate. I think it wouldalways be right to look at the rate at which plaintiffs with the general attributes of the actual plaintiff in the case (though notof course with any special or peculiar attribute) could borrow money as a guide to the appropriate interest rate. If commercial ratesare appropriate I would take 1 per cent over the minimum lending rate as the proper figure for interest in this case.'               <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="13%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="76%" colspan="2" class="quote">This was the rate which subject to certain qualifications Forbes J. awarded."</td>            <td width="13%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p>Slade J later went on to say:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I think that on the facts which I know it is right to treat these particular plaintiffs as being plaintiffs of standing and prestige,who with the benefit of these attributes, would be able to borrow at a more favourable rate than smaller and less prestigious concerns.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <p><a name="p117" class="pseudopara" id="p117">117.</a> He then proceeded to adopt 1 per cent over the minimum lending rate where such rate was in effect as the figure at which interestshould be applied in that case.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="pseudopara" id="p118">118.</a> I also observe from Wallersteiner's case that the court awarded interest at the rate of 1 per cent over the minimum lending rate.Although counsel for the plaintiff submits that it is likely that plaintiffs of the standing of those in the case with which SladeJ was concerned would receive more favourable treatment from the banks than his own clients, there is no positive evidence beforeme to justify this conclusion. Accordingly, I award interest at the rate of 1 per cent per annum above the minimum bank lending ratein operation from time to time during the relevant period and with yearly rests.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="pseudopara" id="p119">119.</a> The resultant figure must however be reduced by the amount of interest otherwise payable on the money paid into court by Far Eastby the order of Mantell J dated 1st August 1983.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="pseudopara" id="p120">120.</a> The final matter to which I must direct my attention is the counterclaim of Deacon Chiu. In his re-amended counterclaim he averredthat since about June 1973 Ronald Chu wrongfully ousted him from possession and enjoyment of his undivided half interest in the YuenLong Theatre Building by collecting rental or profits, or both, from the tenants and occupiers of certain ground floor shops in thebuilding, purportedly on behalf of himself and Deacon Chiu as co-owners, but had failed to account to Deacon Chiu his half sharethereof. He therefore claims that Ronald Chu is liable to account to him for those monies.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="pseudopara" id="p121">121.</a> Further or alternatively he claims that as co-owner he is entitled to a half share of the rentals and profits collected by RonaldChu and, insofar as may be necessary, claims an account of the same and payment over by the plaintiffs of the monies held by RonaldChu as a constructive trustee, or alternatively, as monies had and received to Deacon Chiu's use. No attempt was made during thetrial to justify these claims. Indeed, in his closing address, counsel for Deacon Chiu expressly abandoned them.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="pseudopara" id="p122">122.</a> Finally, Deacon Chiu pleaded in his counterclaim that if the Riviera offer had been made in good faith and of value, it had beenlost through the fault of Ronald Chu and that therefore he claims damages or an account of the loss, including loss of profits orboth, and seeks a consequential order that Ronald Chu pay to him his half share of such profits.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="pseudopara" id="p123">123.</a> The impudence in making such a claim regarding this offer is breathtaking. Not only did the proposed transaction fail to come tofruition due to the fault and machinations of Deacon Chiu, but throughout the trial the defence strenuously protested that the Rivieraoffer had been worthless. The counterclaim is therefore dismissed with costs.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="pseudopara" id="p124">124.</a> I gave judgment for the plaintiffs against 1st 2nd and 3rd defendants in the sum of $12,521,633 with interest as I have already indicatedless (1) the amount of interest otherwise payable on the money paid into court by Far East on the order Mantell J dated 1st August1983.</p>    <p>                (2)    the sum of $193,536 in respect of profits tax for YLT paid by Far East out of monies paid into court by it;</p>    <p>                (3)    the sum of $42,900 paid by Far East for rates due in respect of YLT for the period 1st October 1981 to 31stMarch 1983, and</p>    <p>                (4)    such amount of profits tax as is irrecoverable and was paid by Far East in respect of the profit it made fromYLT during the period of its unlawful occupation.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="pseudopara" id="p125">125.</a> I order that the judgment sum be paid to the 1st plaintiff Ronald Chu as trustee for the 4th defendant, Asia, and that all sums alreadypaid into court be paid to Ronald Chu or his solicitors forthwith.</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="pseudopara" id="p126">126.</a> Counsel for the plaintiffs undertakes on their behalf that they will not draw up or perfect judgment for a period of 14 days to enableFar East to apply in the meantime for a variation of the judgment sum to take into account any provision for taxation that oughtto have been made in this judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="pseudopara" id="p127">127.</a> I also grant the plaintiffs liberty to apply generally to submit to the court the figure for compound interest to be calculated inaccordance with this judgment.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p128" class="pseudopara" id="p128">128.</a> As counsel for the defendants had indicated at the conclusion of final addresses that they wished to address me in due course onthe matter of costs, I will now hear their submissions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(Neil Macdougall)</p>                <p style="text-align:center">Judge of the High Court</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr. Henry Litton, Q.C. and Mr. Allen Yau instructed by Messers Peter Mark &amp; Co. for the plaintiffs.</p>        <p>Mr. Kemal Bokhary, Q.C. and Mr. Daniel Fung instructed by Messers Poon &amp; Sum for D1 and D2.</p>        <p>Mr. Francis Eddis, Q.C. instructed by Poon &amp; Sum for D3.</p>        <p>D4 unrepresented; no resolution to instruct legal representative.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/1985/464.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
