For presentpurposes, it is necessary to set out the main procedural steps taken by the parties in both the court proceedings and the parallelarbitration proceedings.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> It is convenient to first deal with the arbitration proceedings. The plaintiff and the 6th defendant entered into a piling contractdated 19th October 1994 ("the piling contract"). Certain disputes thereunder subsequently arose. Pursuant to an arbitration clausecontained in the piling contract, the plaintiff referred the disputes to arbitration on 15th and 16th February 1996. The notice ofarbitration was then served on the 6th defendant on or about 8th May. The 6th defendant confirmed its agreement to arbitrate on 3rdJune. The arbitrator accepted the appointment on 29th August and duly gave directions to the parties regarding the conduct of thearbitration proceedings. The arbitration then proceeded.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The court proceedings began shortly before the appointment of the arbitrator when on 19th August 1996, the plaintiff issued a generallyendorsed writ against the 6th defendant and other defendants involved in the work done under the piling contract. The claim, allegedlyarising from breach of contract and breach of duty in tort, exceeded HK$183 million. However, the writ was not immediately servedon the defendants.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The 6th defendant soon became aware of the issue of the writ from a newspaper report. Subsequently, by a letter dated 5th October1996, its solicitors informed the plaintiff's solicitors that all differences and disputes between the parties including those inthe court proceedings should be referred to arbitration and that it would not take any steps in the court proceedings.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The writ was eventually served on the 6th defendant. It then filed an acknowledgement of service on 21st January 1997. By a summonsfiled on 24th January and returnable on 18th February, the plaintiff applied to extend the time for filing the statement of claim.On 14th February, the 6th defendant took out another summons returnable on 21st February for a stay of proceedings. The plaintiff'sapplication was heard by Findlay J. who ordered that the plaintiff was to file and serve the statement of claim by 17th March 1997.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> On 21st February, the parties filed a consent summons to adjourn the 6th defendant's application to a date to be fixed. After serviceof pleadings, the plaintiff withdrew its action against the 1st to 5th defendants on 4th June 1997. Three months later on 5th September,the proceedings against the 6th defendant were by consent stayed with costs of the action against the plaintiff, to be taxed if notagreed. The 6th defendant's bill of costs was submitted for taxation on 16th March 1999.</p>    <p class="heading">CONDUCT OF PROCEEDINGS</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The court proceedings on behalf of the 6th defendant were conducted by a team of solicitors including Mr. Bernard Fleming, Mr. GlennHaley and Mr. Geoffrey Shaw. Mr. Fleming was admitted in New Zealand in 1977, later served in the then Attorney General's Chambersof Hong Kong from 1985 to 1991 and was admitted as a solicitor in Hong Kong in 1993. Mr. Haley was admitted in Australia in 1984and in Hong Kong in 1990. Mr. Shaw was admitted in Australia in 1982 and later in Hong Kong in 1988. At the taxing hearing, it wassubmitted by Mr. Shaw that they have considerable experience and expertise in construction cases. That was accepted by me and solicitors'profit costs generated by their work were taxed on that footing.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Despite the strength of the representation, both senior and junior counsel were instructed. Mr. Shaw who appears before me for thisreview refers to the provisions in the 1st Schedule of Order 62 on counsel's fees and seeks to justify the instruction of counselon various grounds:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(1) The amount of claim was very substantial.</p>        <p align="justify">(2) The case was of great importance to the 6th defendant.</p>        <p align="justify">(3) The case involved complicated factual and legal issues.</p>        <p align="justify">(4) The plaintiff itself had engaged leading counsel from the early stage of the proceedings.</p>        <p align="justify">(5) The parallel arbitration proceedings had complicated the matters. The 6th defendant had to be careful before it did anything inconnection with the court proceedings, lest its act might constitute "a step taken in the action", giving rise to a waiver of itsright to seek a stay for arbitration. I will refer to this ground as the "taking a step in the action" ground.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">REVIEW</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Most of the items under review relate to counsel's fees. I accept that the factors listed above are relevant and I will take theminto account when deciding this review. I also bear in mind the relevant provisions in the 1st Schedule of Order 62.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Mr. Shaw relies on the "taking a step in the action" ground virtually in connection with all the items of counsel's fee under review.It is therefore convenient to deal with this ground before turning to the specific items. Mr. Shaw refers to a passage in <em>Mustill &amp; Boyd on Commercial Arbitration</em> at p. 472 and submits that the authorities give no clear guidance on the nature of a step in the proceedings. Counsel's advice wastherefore necessary. However, in the same passage, the learned editors say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The circumstances which accompany an act may be looked at to see whether the act amounts to an election to give up the right to astay. Thus, an application to the Court which might otherwise amount to a step in the proceedings is deprived of this characteristicif the applicant makes it clear - by stating that his application is without prejudice to a subsequent request for a stay, or bysimultaneously taking out a summons to stay - that he intends to insist on a reference to arbitration."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> In my view, with this clear proposition of law, the handling solicitors, armed with their considerable experience and expertise,should generally have no difficulty in addressing the "taking a step in the action" ground, advising the 6th defendant what to doand taking the appropriate action accordingly, without resorting to counsel's advice. The position would be altogether differentif the handling solicitors did not possess such experience and expertise.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> With this note, I now turn to the items one by one.</p>    <p class="heading">ITEM 3: SENIOR COUNSEL'S FEES FOR CONFERENCE ON 12TH SEPTEMBER 1996 ~ $9,000</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Half of this one hour conference was spent on discussing the present action. I have inspected the attendance notes kept by Mr. Fleming.The rest of the conference concerned the arbitration proceedings. Counsel's fees claimed for this part of the conference were $9,000.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> It should be noted that at this stage, the arbitration proceedings were still going on and that the writ, though issued, had yetbeen served on the 6th defendant. The question of whether any act taken by the 6th defendant would constitute a step in the actionhad plainly not arisen yet.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Mr. Shaw, however, submits that the court proceedings gave the 6th defendant an option: (1) it could either seek a stay for arbitrationor; (2) it could defend the proceedings together with other defendants and there would be no arbitration. Deciding which step wasmost advantageous for the 6th defendant was obviously an important tactical question. It was therefore not unreasonable to seek advicefrom senior counsel.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> I accept this submission. Given the size of the claim and the implications that might follow from the choice to arbitrate or litigate,it was reasonable to seek senior counsel's advice. I am therefore prepared to review my decision and allow this item. But the feesclaimed were clearly excessive and unreasonable. I will only allow a fee of HK$4,000.</p>    <p class="heading">ITEM 5: SENIOR COUNSEL'S FEES FOR CONFERENCE ON 29TH NOVEMBER 1996 ~ $6,000</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> At this stage, the writ had not been served yet. Further, by the letter of 5th October 1996, the 6th defendant's solicitors had alreadyemphatically stated that all differences and disputes between the parties including those in the action should be referred to arbitration,and that the 6th defendant would not take any step in the court proceedings. Mr. Shaw says that this conference was held to reviewthe matter and nothing particular had happened since the last conference with senior counsel. In the circumstances, I do not considerit justified to seek senior counsel's advice in conference. This item is not allowed.</p>    <p class="heading">ITEM 14: JUNIOR COUNSEL'S FEES FOR CONSULTATION WITH SENIOR COUNSEL ~ $1,100</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> On 30th January 1997, junior counsel consulted senior counsel regarding the plaintiff's application for extension of time to filethe statement of claim. There was no separate charge by senior counsel for this consultation.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Mr. Shaw seeks to rely on the "taking a step in the action" ground. But given the clear proposition of law as stated above, I donot accept that the joint consultation between counsel was justified on a taxation under the party and party basis. Review on thisitem fails.</p>    <p class="heading">ITEM 15: SENIOUR COUNSEL'S FEES FOR ADVICE ON DARFT SUMMONS ~ $9,000</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The draft summons was for an application to stay the proceedings for arbitration. Mr. Shaw again tries to justify this item on the"taking a step in the action" ground. I repeat my earlier observation in this regard. Further, I have considered the summons andam of the view that the handling solicitors should have no difficulty to prepare the summons without the assistance of counsel. Ido not see the necessity to instruct senior counsel to advise on the draft summons.</p>    <p class="heading">ITEM 17 &amp; 18: SOLICITOR'S ATTENDING CONFERENCE WITH COUNSEL FOR ADVICE AND COUNSEL'S FEES THEREFOR ~ $9,600 AND $10,000 RESPECTIVELY</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The advice rendered in the conference on 10th February 1997 was in connection with the plaintiff's application for extension of timeto file the statement of clam. Similar justification by the "taking a step in the action" ground is advanced. I am of the view thatthe handling solicitors themselves should be able to give the proper advice. Accordingly, I do not consider it necessary to seekcounsel's advice on the plaintiff's summons.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> I have considered the affidavit filed in opposition and in my view, it clearly falls within the expertise of the handling solicitorsto prepare and to give advice on. Counsel's fees are therefore not allowed.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Having said this, I note that there is no separate charge claimed by Mr. Fleming for advising the 6th defendant on the plaintiff'ssummons and the affidavit to be filed in opposition. I will therefore allow a charge for the work done by Mr. Fleming in this respect.Having considered the matter, I take the view that the time spent (3 hours) was excessive. I will only allow 2 hours. My decisionon item 17 is therefore varied to the extent that a sum of $6,400 is recoverable.</p>    <p class="heading">ITEM 19: JUNIOR COUNSEL'S FEES FOR CONSULTATION WITH SENIOR COUNSEL ON STAY APPLICATION</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> By the reason stated under item 14, the consultation was, in my view, not justified on a party and party taxation.</p>    <p class="heading">ITEM 21: COUNSEL'S FEES FOR SETTING THE AFFIDAVIT OF SIMON LEE ~ $2,475</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Mr. Simon Lee was a deputy principal crown counsel when he made this affidavit. It set out the grounds in support of the stay application,including the prejudice, expenses and inconvenience caused by the parallel proceedings. These grounds are common in similar applicationsfor stay for arbitration. Preparing the affidavit is clearly within the expertise of the handling solicitors.

As noted, Mr.Fleming is a very experienced solicitor in this field. He should be conversant with the effect of the rule. Charging a particularfee on considering something he is expected to have sufficient knowledge is, in my view, not permissible on a party and party taxation.Nor is he entitled to charge for the time spent on revising his knowledge of the rule either.</p>    <p class="heading">CONCLUSION</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> By the foregoing reasons, I review my decision on items 3, 17, C1 and C2 to the extent as stated above. The balance of the reviewfails and is dismissed accordingly. Upon the parties' request, I will not make any order on the costs of the taxation and of thereview. If necessary, they should make the application on those costs within 14 days from the date of handing down.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <div align="left">        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"></td>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">Jeremy Poon</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"></td>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">Master</td>            </tr>        </table>    </div>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="justify">Representation:</p>        <p align="justify">Mr. Shaw of Messrs.
