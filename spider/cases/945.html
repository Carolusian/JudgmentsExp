incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. It is the borrower under a Loan Agreement dated29th November 1996 ("the Loan Agreement") entered into with the 2nd Defendant ("Universe"), a Hong Kong company, as lender. The purposeof the loan was to provide the Plaintiff with short term finance in the aggregate amount of HK$450,000,000.00. The Loan Agreementwas subsequently varied by two Deeds of Variation, the details of which are not immediately relevant. Security for the loan includeda Mortgage executed on 28th February 1997 over certain properties in Des Voeux Road West in Hong Kong ("the Mortgage").</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The 1st Defendant ("DC Finance") is a Bermudan company listed in Hong Kong. It wholly owns Universe which had a paid up capital in1996 of HK$2.00 and which was described in DC Finance's Annual Report for that year as having "loan financing" as its principal activity.DC Finance also holds a number of other subsidiaries, several of which carry on like activities.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the HK$450,000,000.00 loan amount was drawn down by Liggars in two tranches on 29th November 1996and 28th February 1997 respectively. Various fees, commissions and interest payments were also made by Liggars.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> On 27th March 1997, Liggars defaulted on payment of an interest installment due. By various letters from Universe and its solicitors,the whole of the outstanding loan was made due and payable. Liggars managed only to make repayment in the sum of HK$3,000,000.00on 6th June 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> None of the facts referred to above are in dispute.</p>    <p class="heading">The proceedings between the parties</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> On 5th November 1997, Liggars issued the Writ in this Action. As indicated in the Statement of Claim subsequently served, Liggarsseeks a declaration that the Loan Agreement is illegal and unenforceable by reason of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163" class="autolink_findacts">Money Lenders Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap. 163</a>) ("the Ordinance").</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Liggars has sued both DC Finance and Universe, alleging that Universe in fact entered into the Loan Agreement as agent for or nomineeof DC Finance. It appears that this was an argument developed on the premise that while Universe was not a registered money lender,DC Finance was, this being possibly relevant in a context discussed below. However, it is now accepted that such premise was erroneousand that neither DC Finance nor Universe are registered as money lenders under the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On 20th November 1997, Universe issued an Originating Summons in MP4001 of 1997, seeking to enforce the Mortgage. The claim in thoseproceedings (by the Originating Summons as amended on 20th January 1998) is for recovery of principal in the sum of HK$450,000,000.00,accrued interest amounting to HK$89,733,929.39, a sum in respect of unpaid rates on the mortgaged premises and contractual interestat the daily rate of HK$362,504.10 until payment. Universe also seeks an Order for possession of the mortgaged premises.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> By a summons issued on 29th December 1997, DC Finance and Universe applied to strike out the Writ and Statement of Claim under Order19 rule 19 or under the inherent jurisdiction on the grounds that they are scandalous, frivolous and vexatious or otherwise an abuseof the process.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Master Jones granted the Order and, on 9th March 1998, struck out the Writ and Statement of Claim on the basis that they are scandalous,frivolous and vexatious, dismissing the Action in consequence.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> There are listed before me today (i) Liggars' appeal against the said Order of Master Jones striking out the Action; (ii) Universe'sapplication to join Guangdong Finance Company Limited ("Guangdong Finance") as a Plaintiff in the Originating Summons proceedings;and (iii) the hearing of the Originating Summons to enforce the mortgage.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> By the consent of all parties, I adjourned all these matters to be heard in open court solely as a matter of convenience. I alsogranted Universe's application to join Guangdong Finance as a party in MP4001 without any opposition on the part of Liggars. I wasthen invited by both parties to deal first with the striking out appeal. However, they each invited me to adopt a different coursein doing so.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Mr Nigel Aiken SC, who appeared on behalf of Liggars, submitted that the question of law raised by the allegation of illegality isnovel and arguable and that it possibly has far-reaching consequences. He submitted that accordingly, in line with cases such as<strong>Lonrho v Fayed</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20AC%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 AC 448</a> at 469B; and <strong>Lonrho v Tebbit</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%204%20All%20ER%20973" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 4 All ER 973</a> at 979; and  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%204%20All%20ER%20280" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 4 All ER 280</a> at 285-287, I should decline to resolve that question finally at the present stage but should instead consolidate the present Actionwith the Originating Summons proceedings and give directions for the further progress of those matters.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Mr Robert Kotewall SC, who appears for DC Finance and Universe, submits that the point is a short one, requiring merely constructionof the definition of "money lender" in the Ordinance and that nothing is to be gained by putting off resolution of the question.He points out that the cautionary remarks made by the various courts concerned with the Lonrho litigation arose in the context ofa refusal to stifle summarily the Plaintiff's attempts to establish causes of action involving economic torts which were still inthe process of development.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Having heard full argument on the point of construction, I have decided to adopt the approach advocated by Mr Kotewall. In my view,the question is indeed a short and self-contained one. It involves no material questions of fact in dispute and can just as easilybe decided now as by the trial judge.</p>    <p class="heading">The illegality argument</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The crucial question is whether Universe and (in so far as it may have been involved in the transaction) DC Finance are companiescaught by the definition of "money lender" in section 2(1) of the Ordinance. If the lender(s) are caught within that definition,it is common ground that the Loan Agreement contains provisions, e.g., those for charging compound and default interest, which wouldmake it an illegal agreement under section 22(1) and that sections 23 and 27 would operate to exclude recovery by Universe (and/orDC Finance) of the sums claimed, subject to any discretionary relief that the Court may grant.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Section 2(1), so far as material, provides as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In this Ordinance unless the context otherwise requires: ..... 'money lender' means every person whose business (whether or not hecarries on any other business) is that of making loans or who advertises or announces himself or holds himself out in any way ascarrying on that business, but does not include (a) a person specified in Part 1 of Schedule 1; or (b) as respects a loan specifiedin Part 2 of Schedule 1, any person who makes such a loan".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> For present purposes, Schedule I, Part 2 para 2 is important. The whole of Part 2 is headed "Exempted Loans" and para 2 states asfollows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A loan made to a company secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other encumbrance (a) registered, or to be registered under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>); or (b) which would, in the case of a company referred to in paragraph (b) or (c) of the definition of 'company' in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2(1)</a>, be able to be registered under that Ordinance if that company were a company referred to in paragraph (a) of that definition."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> This provision makes it necessary to turn to the definition of "company" in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2(1)</a> of the Ordinance. This provides as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"'company' means a body corporate (a) incorporated under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>); (b) incorporated by any other Ordinance; or (c) incorporated or established outside Hong Kong."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The argument on behalf of Universe</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> It is submitted on behalf of Universe that the Loan Agreement is clearly an exempted loan within the meaning of Schedule I, Part2 since it undoubtedly involves "a loan made to a company", namely Liggars, "secured by a mortgage". Given that Liggars is a BVIcompany and so falls within sub-paragraph (c) of the definition of 'company' in section 2(1) of the Ordinance, the Mortgage is anencumbrance which could be registered under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> if Liggars had been a Hong Kong company. In particular, Universe submits that it would be registrable as a charge on land or anyinterest therein under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 80(2)(d)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Once it is accepted that the relevant transaction is the making of an exempted loan under Schedule I, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a>, Universe argues that it must fall outside the definition of "money lender". This is because that provision plainly states that thedefinition ".... does not include ..... (b) as respects a loan specified in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> of Schedule 1, any person who makes such a loan". Universe being "a person who makes such a loan", so the argument runs, is excludedfrom the definition of "money lender", not for all purposes, but "as respects" that exempted loan.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> It follows, so Universe submits, that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 22</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">23</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">27</a> of the Ordinance do not apply since in each case, by express language, they only apply to persons who are "money lenders" withinthe said definition. It follows that no illegality or unenforceability exist.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Universe also argues that on this basis, it matters not at all whether Universe was merely DC Finance's agent or nominee. It wouldmake no difference if the principal lender under the Loan Agreement was DC Finance instead of Universe. It would still be an exemptedloan under Schedule I, Part 2 and in consequence, DC Finance would be excluded from the definition.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> It may perhaps at one stage have been contemplated by Liggars that its argument might be strengthened by the contention that DC Financewas a registered money lender and accordingly, that if it was the true lender through the agency of Universe, it ought, by reasonof its registered status, be held to be a money lender for all purposes. Since, as I have stated above, DC Finance is not in facta registered money lender, this point, though mentioned in the skeleton arguments, was not pursued by Mr Aiken at the hearing.</p>    <p class="heading">The argument on behalf of Liggars</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> The contrary argument on behalf of Liggars involved splitting the definition of "money lender" into two parts. Focussing in the firstplace on the words which precede the exclusionary words which refer to exempted persons and exempted loans listed in Schedule I,Mr Aiken started his argument by pointing to the acknowledged "loan financing" activity of Universe and contending that this primafacie brought Liggars within the definition of "money lender".</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> He then argued that as a matter of construction, the words stating that the definition ".... does not include ..... (b) as respectsa loan specified in Part 2 of Schedule 1, any person who makes such a loan", refer only to persons who were not already "money lenders",in other words, persons, like Universe who, by their money lending activities, were caught by the words which precede the exclusion.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Mr Aiken argued that "the exception does not allow a money lender to divest himself of the label and so avoid the controls of theOrdinance by the simple device of dressing up his business as a Schedule I, Part 2 loan."</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> He drew attention to sections 33A and 33B of the Ordinance which give the Registrar powers to "exempt a class of persons (whethermoney lenders or not)" from specified provisions of the Ordinance. This, Mr Aiken argued, showed that the draftsman was careful touse language distinguishing between persons who were and those who were not money lenders. It follows that if the draftsman had intendedthe money lender to avail himself of what Mr Aiken called "the exception" in the section 2 definition, he would have inserted a phraselike the "(whether money lenders or not)" phrase used in sections 33A and 33B.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Mr Aiken argues that it follows that Universe (and insofar as necessary DC Finance) was caught by the definition and unable to availthemselves of the Schedule I, Part 2 "exception". Universe was therefore a "money lender" for these purposes and its Loan Agreementwas illegal and unenforceable by virtue of sections 22, 23 and 27 of the Ordinance.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion as to illegality</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> I am, with respect, unable to accept Mr Aiken's argument and have reached the firm conclusion that the construction contended forby Mr Kotewall is correct.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> I cannot accept that one can legitimately divide up the definition in the way contended for. All of the words in that provision,including the words which exclude exempted persons and persons who make exempted loans, together constitute the definition of "moneylender" for the purposes of the Ordinance. In my view the words are unambiguous and clear. Where any person makes a loan to a companysecured by a mortgage, that person makes an exempted loan and is not to be regarded as a money lender as respects that loan. It mattersnot whether that person is legally a money lender for the purposes of any other loan or is licensed as a money lender under the Ordinanceor carries on business as such.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> The interpretation urged on Liggars' behalf requires the Court to read in words cutting down express language which, unless cut down,excludes from the definition "any person" who makes an exempted loan. It requires, for instance, insertion into the definition, wordssuch as: "provided that person is not one whose business is that of a money lender". I can see no warrant for importing such a qualificationinto the section.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Moreover, the argument is inherently objectionable as question-begging and circular. The purpose of the provision is to define theconcept of "money lender" and a definition which excludes from its scope someone who is "already a money lender" begs the questionwhich the section is there to answer. Indeed, in drawing the distinction between persons who are and those who are not money lenders,sections 33A and 33B pre-suppose that a clear definition exists. Use of the distinction in those sections does not throw any lighton what that definition itself is.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> Mr Aiken also argued that a construction which excludes lenders of exempted loans from the definition of "money lender" cannot havebeen intended as a matter of policy as this would open the door to unscrupulous money lenders circumventing the statutory controls.With respect, I do not see that the interpretation which I have held to be correct implies a policy which should in any way be regardedas dubious. Schedule I, Part 2 excludes from the regulatory framework persons who make loans to companies against formal, registrableclasses of security. This may cogently be considered to express the legislative intention that the Ordinance be primarily directedat the protection of individuals and not corporate borrowers able to put up such security. One may note in this context that whereexcessively high rates of interest are charged, the Legislature has intervened by section 24 to invalidate the loan whether or notmade by a money lender. Plainly, in other cases, the policy is to limit the scope of illegality to persons caught by the definitionof "money lender". In any event, any inadequacies or "loopholes" that may exist in the Ordinance are matters to be cured by legislationand not by a strained process of construction.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In the circumstances, I have reached the firm conclusion that the argument that Universe and/or DC Finance are caught by the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163" class="autolink_findacts">Money Lenders Ordinance</a> resulting in the unenforceability of the Loan Agreement is unsustainable. I therefore dismiss the Appeal from the Master with costs,these proceedings certified fit for two counsel.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> I will hear counsel as to disposal of the Originating Summons.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p style="text-align:center"><u>JUDGMENT MP4001 of 1997</u></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> At the conclusion of the hearing of the Appeal against the Master's decision in Action No. A11787 of 1997 and after I delivered judgmenttherein, I invited submissions as to how the trial of the mortgage action in these Miscellaneous Proceedings should be disposed of.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Mr Aiken submitted that notwithstanding my ruling above, I ought to adjourn the trial and direct pleadings to be filed. He indicatedthat he wished to consider whether Liggars may have a counterclaim in equity based on the argument that certain features of the LoanAgreement involving compound interest and payment of a large commission make that agreement an unconscionable bargain. However, ashe had been brought into these proceedings very late in the day, he was not in a position to formulate this argument with any precision.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Having heard submissions from Mr Kotewall, I refused Mr Aiken's application for an adjournment. While I have every sympathy for MrAiken given the shortness of time that he has had to consider the matter, Liggars has previously always had access to highly competentand experienced legal advice, including the advice of leading counsel who was Mr Aiken's predecessor. This is the trial of the OriginatingSummons which was issued in November 1997. If any arguments by way of defence additional to the illegality argument that I have disposedof were to be raised, they could and should have been raised in the affidavits filed. Indeed, in February 1998, Mr. Lin affirmedon Liggars' expressly reserved the right then to put in further evidence. Clearly, the question of whether any further issues wereto be raised on Liggars' behalf received due consideration and if by now no such issues have been formulated, I am not prepared toadjourn the trial simply to allow further time for consideration.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> On the resumption of the trial, Mr Aiken valiantly submitted that I ought, on the evidence as it stood, rule that the Loan Agreementwas an unconscionable bargain and so grant equitable relief to Liggars against enforcement of the Mortgage. He pointed in particularto Clause 6.05 of the Loan Agreement which allows the lender to charge default interest at a rate of 28% p.a. or at such other rateas it may determine.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> In my judgment, the evidence as it stands is inadequate to raise any issue as to unconscionability and no basis for the applicationof any such equitable doctrine has been made out. As I have held the illegality argument unsustainable, no further issues remainby way of defence against enforcement of the Mortgage. The facts as to default and as to the amounts outstanding are not in dispute.Accordingly, I order that there should be judgment for the Plaintiffs in these Originating Summons proceedings.</p>    <p class="heading">Order:</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Payment to be made to solicitors for the Plaintiffs within 4 weeks of today's date comprising (a) repayment of the principal sum;and (b) payment of interest accrued under the Loan Agreement and Mortgage as at today's date; and (c) the sum of $127,890 in respectof unpaid rates.
