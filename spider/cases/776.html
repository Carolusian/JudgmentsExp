Ltd. (âKwong Ianâ),who was the former 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, for leave to intervene with a view to permanently staying this action and striking out the claims against the defendants.The ground relied on was the plaintiffsâ breach of undertakings and duties to Kwong Ian under a settlement deed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i>CLAIM IN THE PRESENT ACTION</i></p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The action concerns loans made by Tianjin Jinfu Expressway Co. Ltd. (âJinfuâ) to the plaintiffs (âthe Lucky Companiesâ)in the sum of RMB 250,000,000.  The Lucky Companies claim that the loan was wrongfully diverted by D3 (âMs Shiâ) to the accountof D1 (âGZCKâ) on dates unknown on the instructions of GZCK and/or Kwong Ian and one Mr. Chen Ru Gui. The Lucky Companies claimthat the defendants are liable to account to the Lucky Companies for money had and received, that the defendants held the loan asthe Lucky Companiesâ constructive trustees and damages for conspiracy to defraud or to injure against both defendants.  They alsoseek damages for Ms Shiâs breach of fiduciary and/or contractual duties.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>BACKGROUND</i></p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The background facts have been helpfully summarized in the skeleton submission of Mr. Mak, counsel for the defendants and KwongIan and I set out the relevant parts below.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  For the purpose of building and operating an expressway in Tianjin (âthe Projectâ), 3 Sino-foreign joint venture companies (âthe Project Companiesâ) were set up, each in charge of one section of the expressway.  One of them was Jinfu. Each project companyhad 2 joint venturers, a âChinese sideâ venturer holding a 40% stake in the project and a âforeign sideâ holding a 60% stake.  On the foreign side, the original venturers were the Lucky Companies. </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The foreign side of the project was originally owned by several investors.  The most prominent figure was Mr. Ho Kai Cheong (âMr.Hoâ) who made the affirmations on behalf of  the Lucky Companies in this action.  His and/or his associatesâ stake in the foreignside was held through a company called Golden Tree Investments Ltd. (âGolden Treeâ). </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Initially, Kwong Ian was not involved in the Project. In March 1998, at the invitation of the original investors, Kwong Ian agreedto become an investor on the foreign side because of its ability to raise bank loans through its associated company, GZCK. </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  To facilitate Kwong Ianâs participation, a holding company called Inter Ease International (Highways) Ltd. (âInter Easeâ)was set up by Kwong Ian and the original investors on the foreign side.  Inter Ease was effectively the holding company of the 3Lucky Companies because, as the only 2 shareholders, both Kwong Ian and Mr. Ho held their shares in the Lucky Companies on trustfor Inter Ease.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  With regard to the shareholdings of Inter Ease, Kwong Ian held 9,999 shares and Mr. Ho held one.  As a result of declarations oftrust, there were 2 camps: Kwong Ian held 49%, and the remaining 51% was held by Mr. Ho on his own and on behalf of other originalinvestors controlled by him, i.e. Golden Tree and one South Beach Group Ltd. (âSouth Beachâ).</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Both Kwong Ian and Golden Tree had nominee directors on the boards of Inter Ease and each of the Lucky Companies.  One of KwongIanâs nominee directors was Ms. Shi.  One of Golden Treeâs directors was Mr. Ho.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Kwong Ian arranged for GZCK to secure bank loans totalling RMB 258 million for the project.  GZCK lent the same amount to KwongIan who, in turn, lent the same amount to Inter Ease.  The loan was forwarded to Jinfu and used for the project.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In 2000, using the projectâs future toll fee income as security, Jinfu secured a bank loan of RMB 500 million.  In March 2001,Jinfu resolved that out of that loan, RMB 250 million would be made available for use of the foreign side (i.e. the Lucky Companies). (In HCA 447 of 2006 and on appeal in CACV 266 of 2007, it was held that this latter sum was in the nature of a loan from Jinfu tothe Lucky Companies.)</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  At about that time, various parties on the foreign side (i.e. Inter Ease, Kwong Ian, Mr Ho, Golden Tree and South Beach) enteredinto the Debt Restructuring Agreement dated 17.3.2001.  Kwong Ian and Mr. Ho also entered into the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Supplemental Agreements on the same date.    These few Agreements were agreed to by Kwong Ian and Mr. Ho who were then all the registeredmembers of the Lucky Companies.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The material clauses of the Debt Restructuring Agreement provided as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â2. ä¹ä¸ä¸ (Kwong Ian, Golden Tree and South Beach) ä¸æ¹ééç±ä¸æ¹ä¹ææ¬ä»£è¡¨ä½ç¹¼æ (Mr. Ho) å°è©²é ç®çè·¯è²»æ¶çä½æµæ¼åéè¡å®æçèè³,å¶ä¸­å¤æ¹å¬å¸ (the Lucky Companies) ç®åæå¾æ¸ç®æç²äººæ°å¹£ 3.15 åå, æ¸é¤å¶ä¸­å¯å¥é ç®å¬å¸çäººæ°å¹£6 ä»å¤è¬åå¾å©ä¸æ·¨é¡ä¹äººæ°å¹£ 2.5 åå (the RMB250 million) å°å¨ç¨æ¼æ¸éåè¨(2)(ä¸)ä¹è²¸æ¬¾ (the loans ofRMB 258 million borrowed by Inter Ease from Kwong Ian) åå©æ¯ â¦ â¦</p>        <p class="quote">8. äºæ¶å° 2.5 ååäººæ°å¹£ææ¬¾å®å,ç²æ¹ (Inter Ease) éå¨äºåå·¥ä½å¤©åå°è©²æ¬¾é ç¨æ¼æ¸éåè¨2(ä¸) æé¡è¿°ä¹äººæ°å¹£2.58 ååè²¸æ¬¾åå©æ¯, ä½ä¸æªæ¸ä»çæ¬åæ¯æ ¹ææ¬åè­°ç¬¬ 3 å5 æ¢èçãâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The 3<sup>rd</sup> recital to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Supplemental Agreement shows receipt of RMB 2.58 million by Kwong Ian:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âç±æ¼åéäººæ°å¹£2.58 ååçéä½åå¶éè¡çè¦å®ï¼å»£ä»æ¼æ¶å° 2.5 ååäººæ°å¹£æä¸è½å³æä¸ç­éçµ¦éè¡èå¿éç§éè¡è¦å®å®ç­é£æ¯åæ®µåéãâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  By a fax dated 14.3.2001 copied to Ms. Shi, Mr. Ho himself asked Kwong Ian for instructions with respect to the identity of therecipient of the RMB 250 million. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  On 19.3.2001, Ms Shi (then a director of Jinfu and Kwong Ian) caused Jinfu to make 5 remittances totalling RMB 250 million fromits account in Guangzhou to GZCKâs account in Guangzhou for the purpose of repaying the bank loans of RMB 258 million and the interestthereon.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In April 2001, the shareholding and management structures of Inter Ease and the Lucky Companies were reorganized so that Mr. Hoâscamp had assumed effective control over these companies.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Almost immediately thereafter, Mr. Hoâs camp began to take steps to eliminate Kwong Ianâs further participation and interestsin the foreign side of the Project.  His camp complained that Kwong Ian was, through its nominee directors (e.g. Ms. Shi) guiltyof irregularities in the handling of fund remittances from the foreign side e.g. âunauthorized withdrawalsâ and âdiversionsof fundâ from Inter Ease.  Mr. Hoâs camp proceeded to remove all of Kwong Ianâs nominee directors on the board of the ProjectCompanies in about 2004 and later the nominated directors on the board of the Lucky Companies in about August 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In 2004, Mr. Hoâs camp took steps which caused the foreign sideâs (i.e. Lucky Companiesâ) interests in the Project to becomeassigned (âthe 2004 Assignmentâ) and vested in a company called Glorious Sun (Highway Development) Ltd (âGlorious Sunâ),which was owned and controlled by Mr. Ho and his camp.  The effect was that Glorious Sun had, on the official records, replaced theLucky Companies as the foreign side. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  There then followed a series of litigation and arbitration, among others:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) HCA 260 to 262 of 2006: Kwong Ian alleged that Mr. Hoâs camp misappropriated the foreign sideâs interests in the Project.As a result, Kwong Ian commenced legal actions in Tianjin in late 2005 and in Hong Kong in about early 2006. In the Hong Kong action,Kwong Ian obtained an injunction restraining Glorious Sun from disposing of the foreign sideâs interests in the Project.</p>        <p>(ii) HCA 447 of 2006: Jinfu sued the Lucky Companies for recovery of the outstanding indebtedness with regard to the RMB 250 million(which stood at about RMB 177 million after adjustments). The Court of First Instance found in favour of Jinfu and the decision wasupheld by the Court of Appeal in CACV 266 of 2007.</p>        <p>(iii) The Lucky Companies arbitration: This was taken out by all the shareholders of Mr. Hoâs camp in the Lucky Companies againstKwong Ian. It was pleaded that the Lucky Companies were caused to pay RMB 250 million to Kwong Ian pursuant to the Debt RestructuringAgreement. The money used in paying Kwong Ian was alleged to form part of the property in the 60% interest in the joint venturesand thus it was beneficially owned by Inter Ease. Kwong Ian was allegedly liable to refund to the Lucky Companies the RMB 250 millionon the ground that the Debt Restructuring Agreement should be void for misrepresentation and unilateral mistake, because Kwong Iannever procured or remitted RMB 258 million to the joint ventures and Kwong Ian had diverted money from Inter Ease for purposes unrelatedto the project. There was no plea that the Lucky Companies could have a claim in their own right, or that the payment was made withoutauthorization, as pleaded in the present action.</p>        <p>(iv) The Inter Ease arbitration: Golden Tree claimed against Kwong Ian for breach of the Inter Ease Shareholdersâ Agreement. Allegationssimilar to those in the Lucky Companies arbitration were made in the statement of claim. For example, it was alleged that the LuckyCompanies were trustees for Inter Ease with regard to the 60% in the joint ventures. Kwong Ian failed to inject RMB 258 million intothe joint ventures in breach of the Inter Ease Shareholdersâ Agreement. Kwong Ian had diverted money in Inter Easeâs accountfor purposes other than funding the project. Golden Tree allegedly overpaid interest on the basis of the RMB 258 million loan.</p>        <p>(v) HCA 1720 of 2006: Inter Ease (by then controlled by Mr. Hoâs camp) sued Kwong Ian. It was pleaded that Kwong Ian had in truthonly lent RMB 172 million to Inter Ease. As Kwong Ian had caused Inter Ease to repay a sum exceeding RMB 258 million by March 2001,Kwong Ian was sued for the âover-repaymentâ.</p>        <p>(vi) The present action, which was instituted in 2007 but was not served on the defendants until 2010.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The allegations which made up the claims in items (ii) to (vi) were all directly related to the RMB 250 million.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Whilst all those legal proceedings and arbitrations were ongoing, Kwong Ian and Mr. Hoâs camp explored the possibility of a saleof the foreign sideâs interest in the Project with a view to achieving a clean break from the Project and from one another.  Eventuallyone Choice Tone Ltd. (âChoice Toneâ) purchased the interests of the foreign side.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In September 2009, a deal was struck among Choice Tone, Kwong Ian and Mr. Hoâs camp.  It was reflected in various agreements includingthe Settlement Deed dated 23.9.2009, the Foreign Interests Assignment dated 25.9.2009 and the Indebtedness Assignment dated 19 November2009.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  For the purpose of the sale of the foreign sideâs interests, the 2004 Assignment was ratified by special resolutions of the LuckyCompanies in general meeting.  The foreign sidesâ interests were then sold by Glorious Sun (not the Lucky Companies) to ChoiceTone, the consideration of which was:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) A cash component in the sum of RMB 340 million â RMB 220 million for Glorious Sun and RMB 120 million for Choice Tone; and</p>        <p>(ii) A non-cash component in the form of Choice Toneâs assumption of the foreign sideâs (whether Lucky Companiesâ or GloriousSunâs) original obligation to pay Jinfu their indebtedness with respect to the RMB 250 million (which stood at RMB 147 millionas at 1.1.2008). There was corresponding extinguishment of the Lucky Companiesâ repayment obligation.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  For the purposes of arriving at a full and final settlement of all disputes between Kwong Ianâs camp and Mr. Hoâs camp, theparties had agreed to the terms as provided for in clauses 17 and 18 of the Settlement Deed (detailed in paragraph 35 below).  Tofacilitate a clean break between the 2 camps, Kwong Ianâs shares in each of the Lucky Companies were transferred to a nominee ofGlorious Sun and Kwong Ianâs shares in Inter Ease were transferred to Mr. Ho, all at nominal consideration.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>THE EFFECT OF THE ABOVE DEALINGS ON THE PRESENT ACTION</i></p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The issue is whether or not having regard to the above dealings, any claim which the plaintiffs might have against the defendantsand/or the RMB 250 million could not be maintained having regard to:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) The Debt Restructuring Agreement; and</p>        <p>(ii) The full and final settlement under the Settlement Deed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i>The Debt Restructuring Agreement</i></p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Five remittances by Ms Shi to GZCK (which were the subject of the alleged diversion of funds in the present action) were made pursuantto the Debt Restructuring Agreement.  Mr. Ho was clearly aware of them and himself asked Kwong Ian by fax for instructions as tothe identity of the recipients.

By virtue of the factsset out in paragraphs 7 and 8 above, all the parties who had an interest (direct or indirect) in the Lucky Companies were partiesto the Debt Restructuring Agreement. </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  According to <i>In re Duomatic Ltd.,</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%202%20Ch%20365" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 2 Ch 365</a>, where it can be shown that all shareholders who have a right to attend and vote at a general meeting of the company assent to somematter which a general meeting of the company could carry into effect, that assent is as binding as a resolution in general meetingwould be. </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Therefore, the fact that no resolution had been passed by the boards of the Lucky Companies authorizing Ms. Shi to effect the remittanceswas irrelevant.

One of the affirmations ofMs. Ho filed on behalf of  the Lucky Companies in seeking to extend the validity of the writ in the present action did refer to thesettlement amongst the Lucky Companies, Kwong Ian, Jinfu and other parties and the fact that it included several other court proceedingsin Hong Kong and the Mainland.  Mr. Ho, however, affirmed that the present action did not come under the Settlement Deed.  On counselâsadvice, so Mr. Ho affirmed, the action against Kwong Ian was discontinued.  This action against GZCK and Ms Shi was, however, pursued.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  It is true that the defendants were not parties to the Settlement Deed. In fact, it was upon legal advice that GZCK made a considereddecision not to be a party to the Settlement Deed.

It is an attempt to discover what a reasonable person would have understoodthe parties to mean. And this involves having regard, not merely to the individual words they have used, but to the agreement asa whole, the factual and legal background against which it was concluded and the practical objects which it was intended to achieve.â¦ [The] overriding objective in construction is to give effect to what a reasonable person rather than a pedantic lawyer wouldhave understood the parties to mean. Therefore, if in spite of linguistic problems the meaning is clear, it is that meaning whichmust prevail.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Commercial contracts should be construed in a commercially sensible manner.

The reason for this approach is that a commercial construction is more likely to give effect to the intention of theparties.

Therefore, there was no expressreservation in the Settlement Deed permitting the Lucky Companies to pursue it.  Mr. Wu for the Lucky Companies argues that the LuckyCompanies are at liberty to pursue this action.  His arguments can be broadly classified as:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) There was no deliberate concealment of the present action. After the Court of Appeal in CACV 266 of 2007 upheld the decision thatthe Lucky Companies owed Jinfu the balance outstanding under the RMB 250 million, the Lucky Companies were considering voluntaryliquidation. Mr Wu concedes that without contemplation of the winding-up proceedings, the present action clearly fell within theterm âæ¬æºåé²è¡â within the meaning of Clause 17.1(a). However, because of the consideration of voluntary liquidation,there were no proceedingsæ¬æºåé²è¡ã</p>        <p>(ii) The present action does not fall within the scope of the Settlement Deed.</p>        <p>(iii) There was only a settlement and no adjudication of issues on the meritsï¼ so they were at liberty to sue the defendants.</p>        <p>(iv) GZCK and Ms Shi were not parties to the Settlement Deed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  With regard to argument (i), I can hardly see what difference the intended voluntary liquidation could make.  The term âæ¬æºåé²è¡âwas clear in its meaning.  It covered actions soon to be commenced or temporarily held in abeyance.  The present action fell withinits meaning as it was held in abeyance pending resolution to wind up or settlement.  The Lucky Companies could not even claim thatthey had forgotten about this action because they promptly applied for extension of the validity of the writ each year and both theintended liquidation and the settlement were relied on in those applications.  The irresistible inference is that the Lucky Companieshad deliberately concealed the present action during the negotiation for settlement.  Argument (i) fails.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  With regard to argument (ii), Mr. Wu argues that what was encompassed in the Settlement Deed was stated in the preamble, which didnot mention the RMB 250 million.  The Settlement Deed dealt with disposal of foreign interests, so Mr. Wu submits, but not internalmatters like breach of directorâs duties or misappropriation of funds.  With respect, Mr. Wu is correct only in the literal sense. He overlooks the reference to âåºè³ç­è­°â and the reference to the litigations and arbitrations in the preamble which weredirectly related to the RMB 250 million. </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Mr. Ho claims that âthe purchase price offered by Choice Tone took into full account of the debt owed to the [Project Companies]by the plaintiff [i.e. the Lucky Companies] in the Jinfu Action [i.e. HCA 447 of 2006].  Hence [the Lucky Companies] sold their interestsin the [Project] upon deducting the relevant sum.â  I cannot agree.  It was true that as a result of the decisions in HCA 447 of2006 and CACV 266 of 2007, there was a liability due from the Lucky Companies to Jinfu.  However, that liabliltiy had already beentaken up by Choice Tone.  Further, it was Glorious Sun (not the Lucky Companies) who was the seller of the foreign sideâs interests. The Lucky Companies had already ratified the 2004 Assignment pursuant to the Settlement Deed and they were not entitled to receiveany sum from the sale of such interests.  If Lucky Companies were permitted to succeed in the present action, they would receivea windfall.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Donât forget that it was originally intended that GZCK would be a party to the settlement.  If it was true that the Lucky Companiesdid intend to sell their interests in the Project upon deducting the outstanding balance of the RMB 250 million loan, one wonderswhy that was not dealt with in the Settlement Deed.  If the Lucky Companies were concerned that there was no evidence of dischargeof liability over the RMB 250 million given to them or that the sum had not been properly received by GZCK, an express provisioncould have been included in the settlement. </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  I am of the view that the present action fell within the scope of the Settlement Deed.  Argument (ii) fails.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  With regard to argument (iii), Mr. Wu submits that there was no evidence of discharge of liability over the RMB 250 million givento the Lucky Companies. As a matter of law, the RMB 250 million had not been properly received by GZCK.  The Lucky Companies, asa matter of right was entitled to claim back the money.  There was no unjust enrichment to the Lucky Companies.  Yes, Mr. Wu concedes,there had been previous inconsistent actions or arbitration proceedings but they had been settled without adjudication.  The LuckyCompanies were entitled to seek adjudication in the present action.  I am unable to agree.  As pointed out by Mr. Mak, the supportingaffirmation of Mr. Lao has set out the destination of the 5 remittances and there was no valid challenge from the Lucky Companies. One of the objectives of the Settlement Deed was to settle the disputes between the parties in relation to the issue of capitalinjection. The RMB 250 million loan was at the core of the Lucky Companies Arbitration, Inter Ease Arbitration and HCA 1720 of 2006referred to in paragraph 20 above.  By settling those actions or arbitrations without adjudication, the underlying issue must havebeen settled as well.  Argument (iii) fails. </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  With regard to argument (iv), Mr. Wu is only correct literally.  GZCK and Ms Shi were not a parties to the Settlement Deed and cannot,in their own right, rely on it.  They were not âparties to previous litigations or arbitrationsâ within the meaning of Clause17.1(c) either.  However, under Clause 17.1(a) of the Settlement Deed, the Lucky Companies had expressly warranted that âtherewere no action or no intended action against Kwong Ian or any of its associatesâ apart from those actions expressly mentioned inthe Settlement Deed.  By Clauses 17.1(g) and  18.2(ii)(b), âassociatesâ of Kwong Ian expressly included GZCK.  Clause 17.1(d)also prohibited Mr. Hoâs camp from suing the directors of Kwong Ian, which would include Ms Shi.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Clauses 17.1(e), (g) and 18.6 required Mr. Ho and Golden Tree (not the Lucky Companies) to provide an indemnity to Kwong Ian andits associates in case they are sued by the Lucky Companies.  An agreement to indemnify and hold harmless contains within it by necessaryimplication an implied term not to sue: <i>Deepak Fertilisers and Petrochemicals Corporation v. ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd. and others</i> [1999] 1 Lloyds Representative 387.  In the light of the specific references to Lucky Companies in these Clauses, the necessary implicationthat Mr. Ho and his camp should also procure the Lucky Companies not to sue as well.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The clear wording of the Settlement Deed was to achieve a full and final settlement of all the disputes between the 2 rival camps. Any claims which the Lucky Companies had against the defendants would have been discharged, compromised or settled by the SettlementDeed. I find that the terms of the Settlement Deed clearly encompassed the present action and the present defendants. It would beludicrous to suggest that by deliberately concealing one action and hiding behind the fact that an associate or its director of KwongIan was not specifically named, the Lucky Companies could now ignore the settlement with impunity, thereby reopening settled disputes.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Having considered the effect of the Debt Restructuring Agreement and the Settlement Agreement, I now proceed to consider each ofthe applications under the summonses.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>THE APPLICATION TO INTERVENE</i></p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  GZCK and Ms Shi were not parties to the Settlement Deed and cannot directly enforce that document. However, Kwong Ian does havea sufficient interest in this action.  It can be in breach of its loan agreements with GZCK if it is established that it failed tomake full repayment of the loans it owed to GZCK.  Ms Shi can seek an indemnity from Kwong Ian because she was acting as its agentwhen making the 5 remittances purportedly in discharge of Kwong Ianâs own indebtedness owed to GZCK.  The commercial effect ofthe Lucky Companies suing GZCK and Ms Shi is very similar to suing Kwong Ian.  This is against the spirit of the Settlement Deedand Kwong Ian seeks to restrain the flagrant breach by the Lucky Companies.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Mr. Wu submits that the claims against Kwong Ian were time-barred and it was their deliberate decision not to pursue any claim againstKwong Ian, hence the withdrawal of the claim against it.   D1 and D3 do not require the presence of Kwong Ian to invoke the SettlementAgreement.  Their arguments on discharge of the claims and abuse of process would have remained the same even without the presenceof Kwong Ian. </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The plaintiffs are of course at liberty to decide whether to claim against Kwong Ian.  However, the whole purpose of Kwong Ian interveningis to enforce clauses 17 and 18 for the benefit of the defendants and to prevent the Lucky Companies from advancing the very argumentsas they are now doing, i.e. that the defendants were not parties to the Settlement Deed. </p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  A stranger to a contract is not entitled to rely on the terms of the contract in defence to a claim.  However, where there is aclear breach by a party and if all parties are before the court, the proper order is to dismiss the claim: <i>Snelling v. John Snelling Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%201%20QB%2087" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] 1 QB 87.</a> </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In that case, 3 brothers co-owned a family company and all of them were directors of it.  The company owed them considerable sums. By a written agreement among the brothers, it was agreed that if a director was to resign, he would immediately forfeit all moneysowed to him by the company and the moneys would be used towards repaying a mortgage.  A mortgage agreement was signed on the sameday as the written agreement.  About 3 months later, the plaintiff brother resigned as a director and sued the company in order torecover the moneys due to him from it.   The other 2 brothers joined in as parties to the action and counterclaimed for a declarationthat any sum otherwise due to the plaintiff had been forfeited pursuant to the agreement.  Ormrod J held that the company was a strangerto the contract and was not entitled to rely on it as a defence. Nevertheless there was a clear breach of the agreement by the plaintiffbrother in suing the company.  It should be a proper case in which to grant a stay of all further proceedings.  He added that heshould go further if all the parties to the agreement, including the company who was to benefit under it, were before the court,the proper order was to dismiss the claim.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The application to intervene is rightly taken out by Kwong Ian and I grant the same.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>STRIKING OUT THE ACTION</i></p>    <p class="heading"><i>The Principles on Striking Out</i></p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The application is premised on the claim being frivolous, vexatious or is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.

The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the court was actuallyrequired by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject oflitigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  In <i>Johnson v.

Henderson</u> abuse of process, as now understood, although separate and distinct from cause of action estoppels and issue estoppel, has much incommon with them. The underlying public interest is the same: that there should be finality in litigation and that a party shouldnot be twice vexed in the same matter. This public interest is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and economy in theconduct of litigation, in the interests of the parties and the public as a whole. The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defencein later proceedings may, without more, amount to an abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse)that the claim or defence should have been raised in earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all. I would not accept that itis necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional element such as a collateral attack on a previous decision orsome dishonesty, but where those elementsare present the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive, and there will rarelybe a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment of a party. It is, however,wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raisingof it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad,merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts ofthe case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the processof the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>   A party should generally be barred by the rule in <i>Henderson v. Henderson</i> from raising a claim in a second action by deliberately concealing the real facts on which he now relies from the court in orderto put forward a bogus claim which is radically inconsistent with them.  <i>Vervaeke (formerly Messina) v.

This argument alsowas rightly rejected. An important purpose of the rule is to protect a defendant against the harassment necessarily involved in repeatedactions concerning the same subject matter. A second action is not the less harassing because the defendant has been driven or thoughtit prudent to settle the first; often, indeed, that outcome would make a second action the more harassing.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i>Application of the Law to the Facts</i></p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Ms. Shiâs transfer of the RMB 250 million to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was authorized under the Debt Restructuring Agreement.

However, it was only in 2007 that the Lucky Companies instituted the presentaction to avoid limitation period from expiring.  It was not served only 3 years later after the substantive dispute was settled. If, as alleged by Mr. Ho in his affirmation, Ms. Shi was responsible for keeping the accounts in relation to this sum, there couldhave been a bona fide request for accounts from her instead.  The present action lacked bona fides and is clearly vexatious.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  The present claim is in relation to the RMB 250 million, which belonged to the subject of the litigations and arbitrations set outin paragraph 20(ii) to (v) above. The Lucky Companies could and should have brought in the parties to the present action there soas to have the core issues of who to pay what determined once and for.  By not doing so, and subsequently pursuing the present actionafter the previous litigations and arbitrations have been settled is an abuse of process of the court.  It is even worse when theLucky Companies retained the right to pursue the present action by a deliberate concealment during settlement negotiation.

In addition, Mr. Wu is unable to point to an act committed by this director within Hong Kong.

Mr. Wu submits that though Ms Shi was a Mainlander, she had an office in Hong Kong and the companyâs alterego carried on business in Hong Kong.  Therefore, the act of transfer of money was in a way executed in Hong Kong.  I disagree. The alleged acts causing the damage were not committed in Hong Kong.  The remittances from Jinfuâs accounts to GZCKâs accounttook place in Guangzhou.  The alleged absence of proper authority or instructions was not an âactâ, let alone an act of the 1<sup>st</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant.
