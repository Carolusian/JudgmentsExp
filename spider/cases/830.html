The first is the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs' application to strike out the2nd defendant's counterclaim. The second is the 1st plaintiff's application to strike out the Contribution Notice issued by the 2ndand 5th defendants. The last is the 1st third party's application to strike out the Amended Third Party Notice issued by the 2ndand 5th defendants.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> This is a derivative action instituted by the shareholders of The Prudential Enterprises, Limited ("PEL"), other than the 2nd to5th defendants, against the 2nd to 5th defendants, who are and/or were directors of PEL and also against the 6th defendant, who wasformerly the accountant of PEL.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Between 1990 and 1993, a series of litigations were commenced involving, on the one hand, PEL, the 2nd defendant and MW Lee &amp;Sons Enterprises Limited ("MWLS") and, on the other hand, members of Mr Lee Chai Cheong's branch of family and Greenhill EnterprisesLimited ("Greenhill"). The litigations led to what is called the Blue Pool Road Settlement ("BPRS") and the conclusion of the BPRSAgreement on 26 September 1995.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The principal terms of the BPRS Agreement, so far as they are relevant to these proceedings, are the sales of No.5 and No.7 BluePool Road ("BPR") by MWLS and Greenhill respectively to PEL at HK$108 million and HK$110 million. The purchases were subsequentlycarried out through Dorfit Properties Limited ("Dorfit"), a subsidiary of PEL.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The present action relates to the sale of No.5 BPR by MWLS, the consideration for which was satisfied as to HK$60.48 million by cashand as to the balance of HK$47.52 million by allotment of 1,357 shares in PEL.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> At the material time in 1995, the directors of MWLS were the 1st plaintiff and the 2nd defendant. They were also shareholders ofMWLS together with the estates of their parents, Lee Man Wah, deceased and Ng Chan Wa, deceased ("the Estates"). The 1st and 2ndplaintiffs are the executors of the Estates, and have in that capacity sued as the 5th and 6th plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> On 19 December 1995, the sale of No.5 BPR was completed. Out of the 1,357 PEL shares, 1,295 shares were allotted to the 2nd defendantand 62 shares to the 3rd defendant at the price of HK$35,070 per share. Consequential upon the allotment, the total shareholdingof the 2nd defendant and his children and nominee company in PEL rose from 5.78% to 26.86%.</p>    <p class="heading">The action</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The plaintiffs' claim as appeared by the Re-Amended Statement of Claim are for :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) as against the 2nd to 6th defendants, damages for conspiracy;</p>        <p>(2) as against the 2nd to 5th defendants, damages for breach of fiduciary duty and of duty of care as directors and/or for deceit;</p>        <p>(3) as against the 2nd and 3rd defendants, damages in lieu of rescission of the allotment of shares in PEL; and</p>        <p>(4) as against the 6th defendant, damages for negligence.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The gist of the plaintiff's complaints is that the allotment of 1,357 shares to the 2nd and 3rd defendants was at gross or substantialundervalue. The plaintiffs claim that the undervalue was the result of a conspiracy between the 2nd to 5th defendants as directorsand the 6th defendant as accountant of PEL. In particular, the plaintiffs say that the 6th defendant had given a dishonest valuationof the value of the PEL shares. Using the 6th defendant's valuation, the 2nd to 5th defendants made misrepresentations to the shareholdersregarding the fair and proper value of the PEL shares, and further procured resolutions to be passed at the EGM enabling the allotmentto be made.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The 2nd and 5th defendants have filed a Re-Amended Defence disputing the plaintiffs' claim. In addition, the 2nd defendant counterclaimsagainst the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs, but in their capacity as executors of the Estates for breach of executors' duties. The 2nd defendantbrings the counterclaim in his capacity as a beneficiary of the Estates and also on behalf of the beneficiaries thereof.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> On 24 October 2002, the 2nd and 5th defendants also issued a Contribution Notice against the 1st plaintiff in his personal capacity.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Separately, the 2nd and 5th defendants had on 23 October 2002 issued a Third Party Notice against MWLS seeking indemnity, accountingand tracing relief. The Third Party Notice was amended on 17 December 2002.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> By amended summons dated 9 December 2002, the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs apply to strike out the counterclaim. By another summons dated23 December 2002, the 1st plaintiff also applies to strike out the Contribution Notice. On 14 January 2003, MWLS also applies bysummons to strike out the Amended Third Party Notice.</p>    <p class="heading">Applicable principles</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Counsel have no disagreement over the general principles relating to striking out applications. In essence, the court should onlystrike out in plain and obvious cases. It is not the court's function to resolve factual disputes and in determining a striking outapplication, the court will proceed on the assumption that the facts pleaded by the respondent to the application can be proved attrial.</p>    <p class="heading">The 2nd defendant's counterclaim</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The Re-Amended Defence of the 2nd and 5th defendants and the counterclaim of the 2nd defendant is a huge document of 165 pages long.The counterclaim, which is 12 pages long, apart from repeating some parts of the Defence, is primarily self-contained.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The thrust of the 2nd defendant's pleaded case on the counterclaim is that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) As executors of the Estates, the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs owe certain fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries of the Estates, includingthe 2nd and 5th defendants.</p>        <p>(2) In the context of the BPRS, the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs as executors were further under a duty to ensure that :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) MWLS received full value for No.5 BPR;</p>            <p>(b) the consideration received by MWLS were distributed to its shareholders pro rata according to their entitlements;</p>            <p>(c) PEL did not pay a too high price for the BPR properties; and</p>            <p>(d) the value of the shareholdings of the Estates and of HY &amp; HT Lee Brothers &amp; Co. Limited ("HY &amp; HT"), the 15th plaintiff,in PEL were not diluted or diminished by the consideration paid for the BPR properties.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) The 1st and 2nd plaintiffs had other and personal interests in that they held shares in PEL and the 1st plaintiff further heldshares in MWLS and was a director in MWLS and another family company, HY &amp; HT.</p>        <p>(4) The 1st plaintiff harboured certain personal agenda, including a desire to emigrate to the USA and to extract cash, and also aconcern for any possible personal liability for PEL debts owed to HSBC ("Personal Agenda"). The sale of No.5 BPR was a means of partiallysatisfying some of the 1st plaintiff's desires.</p>        <p>(5) If indeed the 6th defendant's valuation was at an undervalue, the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs had acted in breach of their duties asexecutors of the Estates in that :</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) they entered into the BPRS Agreement without :</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p>(i) satisfying themselves that the 6th defendant's valuation was a fair one, and</p>                <p>(ii) seeking independent advice on the value of PEL shares; and</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b) they failed to ensure that :</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p>(i) MWLS received full value for No.5 BRS,</p>                <p>(ii) the consideration received by MWLS was distributed to the shareholders pro rata and according to their entitlements,</p>                <p>(iii) the value of the shareholding of the Estates and of HY &amp; HT in PEL was not diluted or diminished by the consideration paidfor No.5 and No.7 BPR;</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>and</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(c) insofar as they had relied on the 6th defendant's valuation, they entered into the BPRS Agreement without :</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p>(i) satisfying themselves as to the propriety of the basis of the 6th defendant's valuation,</p>                <p>(ii) inspecting the full valuation report from the 6th defendant, and</p>                <p>(iii) seeking independent advice as to the value of PEL shares.</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6) The 1st plaintiff had also acted in breach of his duties as executor of the Estates in that he was under a conflict of interestsand he had exercised his powers for his own benefit and in furtherance of this Personal Agenda.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Broadly speaking, the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs apply to strike out the counterclaim on the ground that it discloses no reasonable causeof action, is frivolous and vexatious, embarrassing and an abuse of process. Specifically, the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs say that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) There is no basis for the claim in breach of executors' duty.</p>        <p>(2) The 2nd plaintiff has no <em>locus standi</em> to bring the counterclaim.</p>        <p>(3) The counterclaim is premature in that the alleged loss is contingent and based on hypothetical assumption that the defendantswould not compensate PEL for the loss if they fail in defending the plaintiffs' claim.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Before dealing with these specific grounds, it is worth noting that the defendants named in the counterclaim are the 1st and 2ndplaintiffs, i.e. Lee Tak Yan ("TY Lee") and Lee Wing Kim May ("May Lee") in their personal capacity. Given that the 2nd defendantis counterclaiming against TY Lee and May Lee as executors of the Estates, the proper defendants to the counterclaim should havebeen the 5th and 6th defendants. Strictly speaking, the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs are entitled to have the counterclaim struck out asagainst them on this basis. But then the 2nd defendant may seek to amend the counterclaim to one against the 5th and 6th plaintiffs.Therefore for practical purpose, I shall deal with the striking out application as if the proper defendants, namely, the 5th and6th plaintiffs had been named.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The first main ground relied upon by TY Lee and May Lee as executors of the Estates (collectively referred to as "the executors")is that the specific duties as executors pleaded do not exist and there is no breach of duties on their part. An important aspectof the counterclaim is the plea that the executors are under a duty to satisfy themselves that the valuation provided by the 6thdefendant was a fair valuation and also to seek independent advice as to the value of PEL shares. It is the 2nd defendant's casethat the executors were at fault in failing to obtain independent valuation and to satisfy themselves as to the propriety of the6th defendant's valuation.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> There is no dispute that the executors owe the general fiduciary duties pleaded in the counterclaim. There is no dispute, too, thatan executor is under a general duty to protect the assets of the estate. What is in issue is the extent of the duty and whether itnecessitates the executors going behind the 6th defendant's valuation. The question has to be determined in the context of the undisputedand relevant factual matrix.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Firstly, the board of directors of PEL had on 8 September 1995 issued a circular to the shareholders recommending the acquisitionof the BPR properties and the issue of 1,357 PEL shares by way of part consideration for the purchase of No.5 BPR. The circular hadincluded in it the 6th defendant's valuation of the issued shares of PEL. Under the "Recommendation" section of the circular, itstates that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"[the 6th defendant], a chartered accountant has confirmed that the terms of the Acquisitions [of BPR properties] are fair and reasonableso far as the shareholders of [PEL] are concerned, ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and that the directors strongly recommend the shareholders to vote in favour of the proposed resolutions.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Secondly, a letter dated 16 August 1995 from the 6th defendant to the shareholders was contained in Part III of the circular. The6th defendant's letter set out their valuation and further states that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Your Company is valued as a going concern and based on general accepted valuation principles, parameters and methodology which includedweighted balance of dividends base, earnings base and net assets value base in our computation.</p>        <p class="quote">It is our opinion that a band should be used to describe the true value. It is our view, which we consider to be fair and reasonable,that the dollar per share value of (PEL) is in a range between HK$26,900 and HK$41,600."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Thirdly, the 6th defendant is a chartered accountant and had been acting as the accountant of PEL. On the 2nd defendant's own pleadedcase (paras.41.1.1 and 41.1.2, Section E, Re-Amended Defence), the directors of PEL had "represented to the shareholders that thefair and proper value of PEL's shares in or around September 1995 was HK$35,017 per share". The representation was based upon the6th defendant's valuation and the PEL directors "had no reason to doubt the efficacy and reliability of the resolution", and that"they had acted properly and reasonably in relying on that valuation".</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Fourthly, the estates are shareholders in PEL. They also hold shares in a shareholder of PEL, i.e. HY &amp; HT. The question of theextent of the executors' duties with regard to the PEL shares held by the estates ought therefore to be approached from the perspectiveof a shareholder. The question is to be answered by considering what a reasonable shareholder of PEL in September 1995 would havedone in relation to the valuation and the allotment of shares.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> On the pleading, the 2nd defendant has not made out a case for imposing upon the executors a duty to go behind and to check the 6thdefendant's valuation. Fundamentally, there is no plea that the executors had any knowledge, whether actual implied or constructive,of the valuation given by the 6th defendant being an undervalue, or of any circumstances that would cast doubt on the correctnessor reliability of the 6th defendant's valuation, or of the independence and competence of the 6th defendant as a professional. Thepleading has therefore not shown why the executors were not entitled to rely on the directors of PWL and an independent professionalchartered accountant and to act on their recommendations and professional advice. Short of any allegation that the executors wereaware of any want of competence or independence of the 6th defendant and/or of any impropriety in the valuation, there is no basisfor contending that the executors were required to do more than what a reasonable shareholder would have done with regard to thevaluation of PEL shares. Even though they are trustees of the Estates, they were only bound to act in the same manner as a prudentman of business : <strong>Bartlett v. Barclays Trust Co.</strong> (No.1) [1980] 1 Ch.515 at 532E.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Mr Coleman submits that the executors should have obtained their own valuation for a number of reasons. Essentially, it is said thatthe allotment arose out of disputes, litigations and settlement proposals and that there had been at least a breakdown of trust betweenMay Lee and the 2nd defendant over the administration of the mother's estate.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Although the allotment did have a background of litigations and settlement agreement, the 2nd defendant and the executors were onthe same side in the context of the BPRS and the BPRS Agreement as well as the sale of No.5 BPR. Any hostility between May Lee andthe 2nd defendant is therefore irrelevant.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> It is also submitted that the executors had information that might put them on inquiry in that during a conversation on 20 August1995 TY Lee had told the 2nd defendant that the Inland Revenue Department had placed a higher value on PEL shares in connection withthe mother's estate (para.34.17.6, Section D, Re-Amended Defence). This averment has to be viewed against the 2nd defendant's pleadedcase that he and the other PEL directors had no reason to doubt the 6th defendant's valuation and that he had acted reasonably andproperly in relying on it. If directors who are closely involved in the day-to-day administration of PEL were justified in relyingon the valuation, the executors, who were one step removed from the management and affairs of PEL, should similarly be entitled toact on the valuation and the directors' recommendation. This is so even if TY Lee knew that the Inland Revenue Department had puta higher value to the PEL values held by the mother's estate because the 2nd defendant was similarly aware of the point as a resultof the conversation he had with TY Lee in August 1995.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Additionally, it is said that the executors being lay person should have taken appropriate advice. But the executors and the othershareholders do have the benefit of professional opinion represented by the 6th defendant's valuation. It is to be noted that the6th defendant was engaged to render expert opinion to the shareholders of PEL. From this perspective, the 6th defendant was on thesame side as the executors. Short of any allegation of knowledge of irregularity, the executors cannot be expected to take step tocheck the advice given by the 6th defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Another major aspect of the counterclaim is the averment that the executors owe various duties to the beneficiaries of the Estateswith regard to the consideration for the sale of No.5 BPR and the shareholding of the Estates and HY &amp; HT in PEL, and that theyhad failed to discharge these duties.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> So far as the alleged duty in connection with the consideration for the sale of No.5 BPR is concerned, the averment is clearly misconceived.The plaintiffs have taken no issue on the sale of No.5 BPR or the consideration for the sale of it. It is not the plaintiffs' casethat HK$108 million was not an appropriate settlement sum or that the sale proceeds received by MWLS had been improperly distributed.The essence of the plaintiffs' claim is that the 2nd defendant had mis-used the occasion to enable the 3rd defendant and himselfto acquire shares in PEL at inadequate consideration. The averment that the executors had failed to ensure that MWLS received fullvalue for No.5 BPR is therefore irrelevant. It is also bad for the reason that the executors are not parties to the BPRS and thesettlement agreement. Further, the fact that the 2nd and 3rd defendants had received more distribution of the sale proceeds thantheir entitlement, as a result of the allotment at undervaluation, does not mean that the other shareholders of MWLS, including theEstate, is entitled to receive more by way of distribution. It also does not mean that MWLS is entitled to receive more than whatit had been paid for No.5 BPR. The averment that the executors failed to make a proper distribution to the shareholders of MWLS ismisplaced.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> In as much as the plaintiffs are not contending that MWLS had been underpaid, the plaintiffs do not claim herein that PEL had overpaidfor the purchase of No.5 BPR. The plea that the executors fail to ensure that PEL did not pay too high a price for the purchase isirrelevant. At any rate, there is no basis for imposing on the executors a duty to ensure that the company, in which the Estatesare shareholders, does not pay too high a price for its acquisition.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Similarly, the executors cannot be under a duty to ensure that the shareholding of the Estates was not diluted or diminished, unlessthe dilution or diminished was improperly achieved.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> A third major aspect of the counterclaim is the averment that TY Lee was in breach of the duty not to place himself under a conflictof interest and not to exercise his powers for collateral purposes. It is pleaded that TY Lee had a Personal Agenda and had knowledgeof the 2nd defendant's desires to, <em>inter alia</em>, take BPR properties into PEL for development. It is further pleaded that TY Lee encouraged the 2nd defendant to attribute a valueto the PEL shares and was reckless as to what value was attributed. This is a theme that also features in the Contribution Noticeagainst TY Lee and the Amended Third Party Notice against MWLS, to which I shall return later.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> This averment is defective. Short of alleging that TY Lee had encouraged the 2nd defendant to attribute a value to the PEL sharesthat did not represent the true worth of the shares, the Personal Agenda and knowledge of the 2nd defendant's desires do not giverise to a breach of duty on TY Lee's part. The allegation that TY Lee was reckless is also not particularized.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> There is, in short, no sound basis for counterclaiming against the executors in breach of duties in connection with the BPRS andthe valuation of PEL shares. Indeed, upon analysis, the 2nd defendant is effectively saying that the executors had failed to preventthe defendants form committing the wrong on PEL. Because of that and because the 2nd defendant has a beneficial interest in PEL throughthe Estates, the executors should be liable to the 2nd defendant for the loss caused by the wrong committed by the other defendantsand himself. This cannot be right.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> As to the <em>locus standi</em> of the 2nd defendant to counterclaim against the executors, it is apparent from the relief sought in the counterclaim that the 2nddefendant was claiming compensation for the beneficiaries. The 2nd defendant has no proper basis for so doing. This is particularlyso when one considers that the counterclaim is put on the assumption that the 6th defendant's valuation was an undervaluation broughtabout by conspiracy and/or breach of duties involving the 2nd defendant. The 2nd defendant cannot be heard to complain that he hassuffered loss as a beneficiary by reason of wrongs done to the company, for which he is responsible as a director.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Additionally, the loss which the 2nd defendant is counterclaiming for will only arise if PEL cannot be fully compensated by the defendants,despite the plaintiffs' claim herein being successful. It is therefore contingent upon the failure of the defendants, including the2nd defendant, to observe the court order and to pay damages as ordered. The counterclaim is both premature and speculative.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> For these reasons, I am of the view that the 2nd defendant's counterclaim against the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs as executors of theEstates are unsustainable and ought to be struck out. I need not consider the other grounds relied upon by the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs,including jurisdiction and limitation. Suffice to say that I do not regard them as plain and obvious points justifying a strikingout.</p>    <p class="heading">The Contribution Notice</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> By the Contribution Notice, the 2nd and 5th defendants seek an indemnity by way of contribution from the 1st plaintiff in respectof the plaintiffs' claim and costs of the action.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> The grounds for contribution are set out in 18 paragraphs.

In order that the 1st plaintiff is liable to contribute to the 2nd and 5th defendants herein, the Contribution Noticemust plead a case that the 1st plaintiff is liable personally in respect of the damages for which the 2nd and 5th defendants maybe held liable to the plaintiffs herein : see <strong>Birse Construction Ltd v. Haiste Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20WLR%20675" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 WLR 675</a> and <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em> (18th edn), paras.4-116 at p.208<em>.</em></p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The damages that the plaintiffs seek to recover from the defendants herein is represented by the loss suffered by PEL as a resultof the allotment of the 1,357 shares at an undervalue to the 2nd and 3rd defendants as a means of distribution in MWLS of the saleproceeds of No.5 BPR.

At the most, paragraphs(14) and (17) plead that the 1st plaintiff had encouraged the 2nd defendant to attribute whatever value to the PEL shares the 2nddefendant considered appropriate, and the 1st plaintiff was reckless and did not care what value was attributed. They do not giverise to any cause of action against the 1st plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Mr Coleman in his submission puts the liability to contribute on the basis that if the 2nd defendant was held to have conspired asclaimed, then the 1st plaintiff is also liable as a co-conspirator. The conspiratorial agreement is said to be between the 1st plaintiffand the 2nd defendant and "involved the acquisition of No.5 and No.7 BPR". The object of the agreement is said to enable the 1stplaintiff to further his Personal Agenda and to fulfill the 2nd defendant's desire to acquire and develop No.5 BPR.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Quite apart from the fact that this is not pleaded, a point that I will return to later, the conspiracy that Mr Coleman puts forthis entirely different from the conspiracy pleaded and relied upon by the plaintiffs in claiming against the defendants. The conspiracythat is pleaded in the Amended Statement of Claim is a conspiracy to :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) misrepresent to the shareholders of PEL the fair and proper value of PEL shares in about September 1995;</p>        <p>(b) procure the passing of resolutions approving the allotment at undervalue; and</p>        <p>(c) procure the allotment of shares at undervalue.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> The conspiracy in question is therefore a conspiracy to defraud PEL and its shareholders by dishonestly putting forward for relianceby its shareholders, the 6th defendant's valuation as fair and proper, when in fact the valuation was an undervaluation. The conspiracyis in relation to the valuation of the shares for the purpose of the allotment as a means of distribution of the sale proceeds ofNo.5 BPR within MWLS. The conspiracy is not in relation to the acquisition of No.5 and No.7 BPR by PEL. Indeed, the crux of the plaintiffs'claim is not about the sale of the BPR properties or the terms of the BPRS or the BPRS Agreement. There is also no complaint againstthe allotment of shares to the 2nd and 3rd defendants as a means of distribution of the sale proceeds within MWLS. What is at theheart of the plaintiffs' complaint is that the 2nd defendant had made use of the opportunity presented by the BPRS to benefit himselfand/or his children and nominee company by causing the allotment to be made at an undervalue.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> The conspiratorial agreement advanced by Mr Coleman in his submission being a different agreement, the 1st plaintiff cannot be saidto be a co-conspirator of the 2nd defendant in terms of the conspiracy in question. It follows that no liability to contribute canarise under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Liability (Contribution) Ordinance</a> in the event the 2nd defendant were found liable to the plaintiffs for damages in conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Another major difficulty that the 2nd and 5th defendants face in putting forward a case for contribution on conspiracy is that thisis not pleaded at all. It is a well-recognized rule of pleading that allegations of fraud must be pleaded distinctly and with theutmost particularity : <strong>ADS v. Wheelock Marden &amp; Co. Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%202%20HKC%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 2 HKC 264.</a></p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The tort of conspiracy takes two forms, either conspiracy to injure or conspiracy to use unlawful means. In order to make out a caseof conspiracy, the claimant must establish :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) an agreement between two or more persons;</p>        <p>(2) either, where the means are unlawful, an agreement the real and predominant purpose of which is injure the claimant, or wherethe means are unlawful, an agreement a purpose of which is to injure the claimant; and</p>        <p>(3) that acts done in execution of the agreement resulted in damage to the claimant :</p>        <blockquote>            <p><em>Halsbury's Laws of England</em> (4th edn Reissue), Vol.45(2) at para.697.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> In <strong>Marquis Trading Co. &amp; Ors v. Associated Insurance Co. Ltd &amp; Ors</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20HKLR%20434" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] HKLR 434</a> at 440A-B, Barker JA referred with approval to Bullen and Leake and Jacob's Precedents of Pleadings (12th edn) at p.341, in whichit stated that a statement of claim for conspiracy to defraud should describe the parties to it and their relationship with eachother. It should also allege the conspiratorial agreement and must state precisely the purpose or objects of the alleged conspiracyand must further set out, with clarity and precision, the overt acts that are alleged to have been carried out in pursuance and infurtherance of the conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> In <strong>ADS v. Wheelock Marden &amp; Co. Ltd</strong> at 272B-C, Bokhary JA (as he then was) further held that in a claim in conspiracy, the pleader must allege at least one overt actwhich is the act of all the conspirators or alternatively a number of overt acts which include at least one act on the part of eachconspirator. Additionally, the overt act or overt acts pleaded must be such as to show :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) that the conspiratorial agreement had been entered into by each and every conspirator;</p>        <p>(ii) that the agreement, and not merely the intention of one person alone, was implemented; and</p>        <p>(iii) that such implementation caused the damage complained of.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> The Contribution Notice fails to meet the aforesaid requirements completely. Despite the submission that the 1st plaintiff is liableto contribute as a co-conspirator, the Contribution Notice does not contain any plea that the 1st plaintiff knew or was aware ofthe dishonest intention or knowledge of the 2nd defendant. No particulars of the conspiratorial agreement is pleaded. The ContributionNotice also does not contain any plea of dishonest acts that are carried out in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Mr Coleman submits that the Contribution Notice has pleaded the relevant facts for giving rise to a plea of conspiracy, and relianceis placed on paragraphs (15) and (16). But the two paragraphs merely plead that "a course of action" had been agreed upon betweenthe 1st plaintiff and the 2nd defendant and the course of action was designed to, and did, achieve certain consequences. It givesno particulars of the course of action. Nothing therefore is known about the agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> As to avert act or overt acts, Mr Coleman relies on the following matters pleaded in the Contribution Notice as fulfilling the requirementson pleading overt act :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The 1st plaintiff consistently encouraged the 2nd defendant in relation to the latter's work to take No.5 BPR into PEL.</p>        <p>(2) The 1st plaintiff sought to persuade CC Lee to cause Greenhill to sell No.7 BPR, knowing the prospect of selling No.5 BPR to PELdepended on a successful sale of No.7 BPR.</p>        <p>(3) The 1st plaintiff agreed to resolve with the 2nd plaintiff the issue relating to the memorandum attached to Ng Chan Wa's will,knowing that the 2nd defendant would not agree to the BPRS if the issue is not resolved.</p>        <p>(4) The 1st plaintiff encouraged the 2nd defendant to attribute whatever value to the PEL shares as he thought fit, knowing that the2nd defendant would only go ahead with the BPRS if he got PEL shares valued at HK$35,000 each.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> On the last point, the allegation that the 1st plaintiff knew that the 2nd defendant would only go ahead with the settlement if thePEL shares were valued at HK$35,000 each is not pleaded in the Contribution Notice. Even though paragraph (12) of the ContributionNotice states that the 1st plaintiff knew that the 2nd defendant wanted to take PEL shares rather than cash, short of pleading thatthe 1st plaintiff knew that the 2nd defendant would refuse to take cash, it does not give rise to the inference that the 1st plaintiffknew that the 2nd defendant would only go ahead with the BPRS if he was given PEL shares valued at about HK$35,000 each.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> That aside, the overt acts identified by Mr Coleman are not in furtherance of the conspiracy in question. It is not shown they haveresulted in the damages claimed by the plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> The Contribution Notice is plainly defective and does not reveal an actionable cause in conspiracy or otherwise against the 1st plaintiff.The issue of it is an abuse of process. As such, the Contribution Notice ought to be struck out, and I so order.</p>    <p class="heading">Amended Third Party Notice</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> The Amended Third Party Notice is substantially identical to the Contribution Notice. The first 17 paragraphs are identical to thosein the Contribution Notice. Additionally, paragraphs (18) to (20) of the Amended Third Party Notice pleads :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(1) the knowledge of TY Lee and ST Lee, as directors of the third party, of the facts and matters set out in paragraphs (3) and (17)falls to be imputed to the third party;</p>        <p class="quote">(2) the third party was an integral part of, and participated in, the course of action referred to in paragraph (16) as an intended,and actual, beneficiary of it; and</p>        <p class="quote">(3) if, which is denied, the 2nd, 3rd and 5th defendants are liable in any way to the plaintiffs, or any of them, for damages forconspiracy the third party is also liable to them for such damage."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> On this basis, the 2nd and 5th defendants claim against MWLS an indemnity in respect of the plaintiffs' claim and also for accountingand tracing relief in respect of dividends, profits or benefits derived from the allotment of shares and the consideration of HK$60.48million for the sale of No.5 BPR.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Paragraphs (21) to (23) of the Amended Third Party Notice proceed on the basis that if the allotment of shares is rescinded, thenthe whole of the BPRS Agreement should be set aside and MWLS, as recipient of the consideration for the sale of No.5 BPR, shouldbe made a party to these proceedings. This part of the Notice is academic given that the plaintiffs by the Re-Amended Statement ofClaim had deleted the claim for rescission of the PEL shares. Mr Coleman in his submission also accepts that the accounting and tracingrelief does not appear to be appropriate given that the claim for rescission is not pursued by the plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> MWLS applies to strike out the Amended Third Party Notice on the basis that it discloses no reasonable cause of action. Insofar thatthe 2nd and 5th defendants seek to base their claim on conspiracy, MWLS complains that the Amended Third Party Notice does not showan agreement or combination involving MWLS to defraud PEL and/or its shareholders and that no overt acts in furtherance of the conspiratorialagreement has been pleaded.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> A right to indemnity arises where there is an obligation in law or in equity to indemnify. The right may arise from contract, statuteor by implication from some principles of law : <em>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2002</em>, Vol.1, para.16/1/3; <em>Halsbury's Laws of England</em> (4th edn), Vol.20, paras.347, 348 and <strong>China Everbright-IHD Pacific Limited v. Ch'ng Poh &amp; Ors</strong> (unreported), HCA12837/1995, CACV49/1999. The Amended Third Party Notice, however, does not indicate the basis upon which the claimto indemnity arises. From counsel's submissions, it will appear that the right to indemnity is put on the basis of MWLS being a co-conspirator.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> In this respect, the Amended Third Party Notice suffers from the same defects in the Contribution Notice. While paragraph (15) pleadsthat the 1st plaintiff and the 2nd defendant had agreed to "a course of action", and paragraph (19) states that MWLS was an integralpart and beneficiary of the course of action, there is no allegation that there was an agreement to conspire to defraud PEL and/orits shareholders in respect of the value of PEL shares. An agreement on a course of action is different from an agreement to defraudPEL and/or its shareholders in respect of the value of PEL shares. More importantly, it is neither pleaded nor shown that MWLS wasa party to any alleged agreement between the 1st plaintiff and the 2nd defendant. The Amended Third Party Notice also contains noparticulars of the alleged agreement, including the time and manner in which it was entered into and the terms of the agreement.There is also no plea of overt acts done by the alleged conspirators and in particular, MWLS, in pursuance and in furtherance ofthe conspiratorial agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> It is submitted on behalf of the 2nd and 5th defendants that the overt acts consist of MWLS's knowledge of the motives or desiresof the 1st plaintiff and the 2nd defendant and of the agreed course of action, coupled with MWLS's participation in the agreed courseof action.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> This submission ignores the fundamental fact that the 2nd defendant himself is a director of MWLS. On the 2nd defendant's pleadedcase, the guilty knowledge of MWLS is imputed from him and the 1st plaintiff. If indeed MWLS was an integral part to the "courseof action" agreed upon by the 1st plaintiff and 2nd defendant and had participated in it, it was no more than a vehicle of fraud.Any dishonest acts of MWLS would only be at the instance of its directors, of whom the 2nd defendant was one. Thus analysed, the2nd defendant cannot have any entitlement to seek an indemnity from MWLS. It would be absurd that a director who had caused the companyto be used as a vehicle of fraud has a right to be indemnified by the company for the consequences of the fraud, just because hehappens to be interested in the victim of the fraud in another capacity.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> In addition, without particularizing the so-called course of action, a plea that MWLS participated in the course of action will notbe sufficient to amount to a plea of overt acts. MWLS's participation in the BPRS Agreement and the involvement in the allotmentof PEL shares, even with the imputed knowledge, cannot amount to overt acts in pursuance and furtherance of the conspiracy to defraudPEL and/or its shareholders with regard to the value of the PEL shares. It is of paramount importance to note that there is no allegationthat the dishonest intention to misrepresent the value of the shares and the knowledge of the undervaluation, was shared by the 1stplaintiff and/or imputed to MWLS. As pointed out previously, the crux of the plaintiffs' complaint is the misrepresentation of thevalue of the PEL shares and the allotment to the 2nd and 3rd defendants at undervalue. The participation by MWLS in the BPRS Agreementand the distribution of the sale proceeds by allotment are therefore incapable of being overt acts in pursuance and furtherance ofthe conspiracy in question. Furthermore, the loss suffered by PEL and its shareholders, namely, the underpayment for the allotment,is not occasioned by the BPRS Agreement nor the distribution of sale proceeds by allotment.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> The Amended Third Party Notice for the reasons indicated has failed to plead a reasonable cause of action against MWLS. No properbasis for seeking an indemnity can arise. It should therefore be struck out and I so order.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> For the reasons above, I make the following order :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The counterclaim of the 2nd defendant against the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs be struck out and dismissed.</p>        <p>(2) The Contribution Notice of the 2nd and 5th defendants against the 1st plaintiff be struck out.</p>        <p>(3) The Amended Third Party Notice of the 2nd and 5th defendants against the 1st third party be struck out.</p>        <p>(4) There be an order nisi that :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) The costs of the counterclaim, including the costs of the application to strike out, be to the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs againstthe 2nd defendant, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for two counsel.</p>            <p>(b) The costs of and occasioned by the Contribution Notice, including the costs of the application to strike out, be to the 1st plaintiffagainst the 2nd and 5th defendants, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for two counsel.</p>            <p>(c) The costs of and occasioned by the Third Party Notice as amended, including the costs of the application to strike out, be tothe 1st third party against the 2nd and 5th defendants, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(C.
