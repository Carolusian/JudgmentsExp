In support of the summons, there isan affirmation of Kam Tak Yuen, Peter and two affirmations of Stella Chu Sook Chun, his wife ("Mrs Kam"), both of whom are directorsof the plaintiff companies. The defendants opposed the application. There are affirmations from Fung Kam Sun, a director of the 1stdefendant, each of the 2nd and 3rd defendants, Lee Kei Chong ("K.C. Lee"), who is a former client of the 2nd plaintiff and SheraiThalwinder Kaur, an employee of the plaintiffs, filed in opposition. The 3rd defendant is a former employee of the plaintiffs andleft their employ a few weeks prior to the incidents described below.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> In addition to the inter partes summons, the plaintiffs have issued a summons returnable at the same time for liberty to cross-examinethe deponents of the affirmations filed in opposition. In response to those affirmations, both Kam Tak Yuen Peter, and his wife havefiled further affirmations (being respectively their second and third affirmations) and five employees of the plaintiffs' group ofcompanies have also filed affirmations. At the hearing, Mr Allman Brown for the plaintiffs informed me that cross-examination wasnot being pursued.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> In brief, the plaintiffs operate their businesses from office premises at the address described above. The total area they occupyis some 3,500 sq.ft. including an exhibition room of 600 sq.ft. and a seminar room of 800 sq.ft. and 21 staff are employed. The 1stplaintiff is a holding company. The 2nd plaintiff markets Australian properties in Hong Kong. The 3rd plaintiff advises and representscustomers in lodging immigration applications to Australia and Canada and the 4th plaintiff is a travel agent. Seminars and exhibitionsare held at the premises and it is in the nature of those businesses that numerous customers and potential customers attend the plaintiffs'offices.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The injunctions granted on 1 April arose out of events that the plaintiffs alleged occurred on 30 and 31 March 1995 at the premises.On 27 March, the 2nd plaintiff received a letter from K.C. Lee, a previous customer, demanding payment of A$26,500 and HK$20,000.K.C. Lee who apparently cancelled the purchase of certain properties in Australia sought the refund of reservation fees and the depositand notified the 2nd plaintiff that he proposed to collect the refund on 2 April. On 30 March at about 10 a.m., the 2nd defendantarrived at the Premises to collect those sums on behalf of Lee. It is not disputed that he did so attend but what is hotly deniedis what allegedly occurred at the Premises. The plaintiffs say that he identified himself with a background called "Kowloon Son"and shouted loudly : "You better pay up since you are operating a business in the open". It is alleged that the 2nd plaintiff startedto intimidate the plaintiffs' employees in an aggressive manner and declared that their boss should pay up. Two of the plaintiffs'customers apparently left the Premises looking perturbed after conversing with the 2nd defendant. When Mrs Kam asked him to leave,he ignored the request and allegedly intimidated the receptionist. It is alleged that he then sat down at the reception area bangingthe ashtray onto the coffee table and made a lot of grumbling noises and did not leave till 11:30 a.m.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> On the following day at 11:15 a.m., Mr Kam said he was informed by the plaintiffs' receptionist that she had received threateningphone calls from an unidentified male. Earlier that morning Mrs Kam had visited K.C. Lee at his office, what was discussed and agreedbetween Mrs Kam and K.C. Lee is a matter of dispute. In any event, the parties are agreed that at 3:30 p.m. that day, the 2nd defendantwent to the Premises with the 3rd defendant. Beyond the fact of the visit, what transpired is again contentious. It is alleged thatthey caused disturbance in the reception area; that they refused an invitation to go to the seminar room for a discussion; that theyrefused to produced any authorisation letter from K.C. Lee; that the 2nd defendant refused to produce his identity card and businesscard; and that both the 2nd and 3rd defendants refused to leave. The plaintiffs called the police who arrived at about 4 p.m. andchecked the identity cards and business cards of the 2nd and 3rd defendants. The 2nd defendant's business card showed that he wasa representative of the 1st defendant, a fact allegedly confirmed by the 2nd defendant. The 2nd and 3rd defendants and the policeleft the Premises at 4:50 p.m. It is alleged that the 3rd defendant returned shortly thereafter, banging the doors of the adjourningoffices on the 7th floor, declaring loudly that the 2nd defendant could not pay its debt. Half an hour later, the 2nd defendant returnedto the Premises causing further disturbance. Not only is he alleged to have shouted obscenities, he threatened to return the nextday.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The 1st defendant's business is euphemistically described as "credit management" in its business registration certificate. It specialisesin the collection of credit card debts. It claims not to have anything to do with the incidents described above, other than the factthat the 2nd defendant is its employee whom it says it has never authorised nor instructed to go to the Premises.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The 2nd and 3rd defendants admit that the visits occurred on 30 and 31 March but vehemently deny that they behaved in the manneralleged or that they caused any disturbance or commotion whatsoever at the Premises. K.C. Lee had apparently sought the assistanceof the 3rd defendant whose client he had been in getting refunds from the 2nd plaintiff in relation to the cancellation of the proposedpurchases of various Australian properties as his previous requests were to no avail. There are hints of impropriety about the 2ndplaintiff's business and suggestions that the 2nd plaintiff is experiencing financial difficulties in its business. In any event,the 3rd defendant thought it more appropriate for some independent third party to represent K.C. Lee as he was no longer in the plaintiffs'employ and obtained the assistance of his friend, the 2nd defendant, whom Lee had never met. According to the 2nd and 3rd defendants,the second visit, i.e. the one on 31 March was pursuant to an arrangement with the 2nd plaintiff who had agreed to repay Lee an agreedamount.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The defendants submit that the injunction ought not to be continued because the plaintiffs failed to make a full and fair disclosurewhen they applied for ex parte relief. It is said that Mr Kam's first affirmation failed to make a full and fair disclosure aboutthe financial dispute between the 2nd plaintiff and K.C. Lee which would have explained the visits of the 2nd and 3rd defendants.As I see it, the question is not whether the 2nd and 3rd defendants had good reason to attend the Premises or whether the 2nd plaintiffis indebted to Lee. Rather, for present purposes, the question is : have the plaintiffs succeeded in establishing that there is aserious issue to be tried? In any event, the defendants have not convinced me that the alleged non-disclosure was material in thebalancing exercise.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The next point taken by the defendants is that the plaintiffs have not adduced evidence to prove that they are able to satisfy theircross-undertaking as to damages, e.g. by exhibiting the annual auditor's report. I was referred to <strong>Intercontex v. Schmidt</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20FSR%20575" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] FSR 575.</a> In that case substantial sums had been intercepted by the plaintiffs following an Anton Piller order and a request had been madeby the defendants for financial details of the plaintiffs whose accounts were hopelessly out of date and who had been in flagrantbreach of its statutory obligations by not filing any accounts. On those facts, the absence of proper evidence that the plaintiffswould be able to satisfy their cross-undertaking as to damages was one of several grounds for refusing injunctive relief. The presentcase is distinguishable from<strong>Intercontex</strong> on the facts. It is not in every case of a cross-undertaking as to damages by a company that its audited accounts must be exhibited.What is required is information as to its financial ability to meet the undertaking and that would depend on the facts of each particularcase. Here, the plaintiffs have given information regarding their gross weekly profit. Although there is no information regardingtheir net profits, that alone is not sufficient for me to exercise my discretion in refusing to grant an injunction should such acase be made out. It would be another matter if the companies were not trading at all or had no operating profit. Further, it isopen to the defendants to apply for fortification and they have not done so.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The plaintiffs seek damages for nuisance, trespass and interference with the plaintiffs' trade and business by unlawful means. Thequestion is whether disturbances had been caused on 30 and 31 March and there was a threat of future disturbances so as to justifythe continuation of the injunctions.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Dealing first with the position vis-Ã -vis the 2nd and 3rd defendants, there is undoubtedly a serious issue to be tried. It was contendedthat as against the 2nd defendant there is no serious issue to be tried because there is no cause of action in tort for damages forinterference with the plaintiffs' trade and business by unlawful means, that the facts of this case does not suit a cause of actionin nuisance and in any event damages for that as for trespass would be minimal. I confess I have some difficulty in following theargument. It cannot be seriously suggested that no cause of action in tort exists for interference with contractual relations byunlawful means.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Vis-Ã -vis the 1st defendant, admittedly the 1st defendant's involvement is more tenuous. However, the 2nd defendant's two visitswere made on consecutive weekdays during normal working hours. The first lasted one and a half hours, the second two hours withoutreckoning travelling time. There is no explanation from the 1st defendant about this. It is also noteworthy that the 1st defendantis represented by the same firm of solicitors as the 2nd and 3rd defendants. In view of these matters, at this stage, I cannot saythat there is no serious issue to be tried vis-Ã -vis the 1st defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Are damages an adequate remedy? The defendants submit that at most only two customers were scared away. Therefore, it is said, theplaintiffs' loss and damage is limited and capped. I do not agree. The quantification of that loss is not obvious. Moreover, damageto business reputation and the potential loss of customers were the alleged conduct to recur must also be considered. Damages areclearly not an adequate remedy.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The balance of convenience in this case is plainly in the plaintiffs' favour. The defendants have not shown that the injunctionssought, if granted, would cause irreparable injury to their reputation and goodwill so that on the balance of convenience such injunctionsshould not issue.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The defendants argue that the injunctions are in any event too wide. The relief sought is in fact identical to that granted on theex parte application, but due to a misreading of the order made on 1 April, the inter partes summons referred to the 2nd floor ratherthan the 7th floor of the Premises in Head 1. On that basis, I am satisfied that the relief sought is not too wide and I thereforegrant the injunctions sought.
