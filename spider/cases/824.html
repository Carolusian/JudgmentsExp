   <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon A Cheung J:</b></p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  In this application for judicial review, the applicant challenges the decision of the Chairman of the Market Misconduct Tribunal(MMT) dated 28 February 2008 that the Tribunal is validly constituted and has jurisdiction to determine the matters referred to itby the Financial Secretaryâs notice dated 12 September 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The facts leading to this judicial review application are uncontroversial.  The Tribunal was set up by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/571/s257.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 257</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/571" class="autolink_findacts">Securities and Futures Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/571">Cap 571</a>), which came into force in April 2003.  On 12 September 2007, the Financial Secretary instituted the second ever proceedingsof the Tribunal by issuing a notice pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/571/s252.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 252(2)</a> of the Ordinance.  The notice directed the Tribunal to institute and conduct proceedings to determine whether any market misconductwithin the meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/571#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIII</a> of the Ordinance had taken place in relation to the dealings in the securities of China Overseas Land and Investment Ltd.  The noticespecified three persons suspected of having engaged in market misconduct â the applicant was one of them. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  At a preliminary hearing on 9 November 2007, the Tribunal directed that the specified persons identify, supported by full writtensubmissions, any and all issues to be taken, other than the substantive matters, by 7 December 2007.  In accordance with that direction,the applicant filed a detailed written submission dated 7 December 2007 to challenge, amongst other things, the constitutionalityof the proceedings. </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Despite doubts over the Tribunalâs jurisdiction to determine its own constitutionality, the Tribunal, chaired by a judge of theCourt of First Instance who sat with two members, nonetheless conducted a hearing on 25 February 2008.  In a written ruling dated28 February 2008, the Chairman determined that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to determine the issue of its own constitutionalityand then dismissed the applicantâs challenge.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Leave to apply for judicial review against the Tribunalâs determination on its own constitutionality was granted on 29 May 2008and a direction for holding an expedited hearing was also given.</p>    <p class="heading">Separation of powers and the Basic Law</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In this application for judicial review, Mr Jonathan Harris SC, appearing for the applicant, contends, in essence, that what theOrdinance requires the Tribunal to do is to exercise the judicial power of the State, which is reserved exclusively under the BasicLaw for the courts of judicature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to exercise.  This offends against the doctrine ofseparation of powers, which underlies the political and legal structures set up under the Basic Law.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Counsel points out, quite correctly, that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/571/s291.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 291</a> in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/571#p14" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIV</a> of the Ordinance provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that conduct commonly described as insider dealing constitutes a criminal offence.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/571/s303.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 303</a> specifies the penalties that a court may impose on a person that is convicted of such an offence.  Yet <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/571#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIII</a> of the same Ordinance provides an alternative regime by which the Tribunal, a statutory body established by the Ordinance and consistingof three people, two of whom are not judges and are appointed by the Financial Secretary, may at the Financial Secretaryâs instigationdetermine whether conduct identified in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/571/s270.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 270</a> under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/571#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIII</a> has taken place.  Counsel correctly points out that such conduct is identical in all material respects to the criminal conduct thatis set out in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/571/s291.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 291</a> under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/571#p14" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIV.</a></p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Mr Harris therefore argues that what the Tribunal purports to do in an inquiry is, in substance, to decide whether or not insiderdealing has taken place, and thus whether a criminal offence has been committed, by acting as a court or a âshadow courtâ inthe sense of exercising what on a proper analysis is the judicial power of the State, reserved for the Judiciary of the HKSAR.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  This is, counsel contends, constitutionally objectionable.  First, arts 19 and 80 of the Basic Law provide that the courts of judicatureof the HKSAR only shall exercise the judicial power of the Special Administrative Region.  The Tribunal is not such a court and thereforecannot exercise the judicial power in question.  Secondly and alternatively, if the Tribunal is in law and in substance such a court,its constitution and procedures do not comply with arts 80 to 96 of the Basic Law.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  It is common ground that, in relation to the second point made by counsel, indeed the Tribunalâs constitution and procedures donot comply with arts 80 to 96 of the Basic Law.  The only and all important issue in the present application is whether the Tribunaldoes purport to exercise the judicial power of the HKSAR, which is vested exclusively in the Judiciary of the HKSAR, pursuant tothe provisions in the Basic Law.  In other words, the issue is: is the Tribunal purporting to function as a âcourtâ or a âcourtof the classic kindâ, when it is not such a court?</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  This is not a novel contention in Hong Kong.  In the leading case of <i>Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ltd v New World Development Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282006%29%209%20HKCFAR%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2006) 9 HKCFAR 234</a>, Ribeiro PJ described the relevant issues as follows (at pp 263-264):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â77.  Another context in which the concept of âa courtâ may be in issue concerns cases where a challenge is made to a tribunalâsjurisdiction on the ground that it is performing a function which involves exercise of the judicial power whereas it is not a properlyconstituted âcourtâ and therefore cannot lawfully exercise such power. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">78.  Thus, in <i>Shell Company of Australia Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1931%5d%20AC%20275" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1931] AC 275</a>, the question was whether the Board of Review set up under Australian tax legislation to review decisions of the Commissioner ofTaxation was exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth within the meaning of s 71 of the <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.  If so, the taxpayer contended that it was not a properly constituted âcourtâ since the terms of appointment of its memberslacked the entrenched security of tenure enjoyed by judges.  The challenge was unsuccessful since the Board of Review was held notto be exercising the judicial power but merely acting administratively. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">79.  In our own jurisdiction, a challenge based on similar grounds succeeded in <i>Lai Hung Wai v Secretary for Security</i> (Unreported, HCAL 1596/2001, Hartmann J; 9 September 2002; see also <i>Yau Kwong Man &amp; Lai Hung Wai v Secretary for Security</i> CACV 377/2002, 2 July 2003).  Young persons who had been convicted of murder had been made subject to an indefinite sentence of imprisonment. Legislation <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/221/s67c.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 67C</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/221" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/221">Cap 221</a>) was passed to modify that sentence so that there would be a fixed minimum term.  It was provided that this task would beperformed by the Chief Executive on the recommendation of the Chief Justice.  The constitutionality of that legislation was successfullychallenged on the basis that the fixing of the term of imprisonment involved an exercise of the judicial power which had to be exercisedby a court of law as provided for by Art 80 of the Basic Law and not by the Chief Executive.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/221/s67c.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 67C</a> was consequently further amended to vest the function in the court instead.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">80.   â¦ In this category of cases, there is no doubt that if the function in question involves exercising the judicial power, onlya court of law is qualified to exercise it.  The argument is about the nature of the function and whether the body performing itis in fact a court of law.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Legislative materials</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Mr Harris has, without objection from the Financial Secretary, referred the Court to various legislative materials, to explain thegenesis and policy intention behind the relevant provisions in the Ordinance.

The maximum penalties under the SO and the CTO for similar offences are inconsistent and inadequate.  Forthe 10 successful cases, the court has imposed suspended sentences in two instances, and the average fine of the other eight casesimposed has been only $40,000.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">9.

Where it appears a conviction by the courts will be difficultto secure, the Commission will recommend the Financial Secretary initiate proceedings in the Tribunal instead: LegCo Panel on FinancialAffairs Paper dated 27 March 2006 (LC paper no CB(1)1179/05-06(07)) at para 7.</p>    <p class="heading">Australian cases</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Mr Harris relies on a number of Australian cases to support his contention that where the doctrine of separation of powers is constitutionallyenshrined, the judicial power of the State can only be exercised by the courts of judicature, or courts of the classic kind, establishedunder the constitution.  Australia is such a case where s 71 of the <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> vests the judicial power of the Commonwealth in a Federal Supreme Court (the High Court of Australia) and in such other federal courtsas the Parliament creates, and in such other courts as it invests with federal jurisdiction.  These Australian authorities include,amongst others, <i>Huddart, Parker &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281908%29%208%20CLR%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1908) 8 CLR 330</a>; <i>Albarran v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282007%29%20231%20CLR%20350" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2007) 231 CLR 350</a> and <i>Brandy v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%2d1995%29%20183%20CLR%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994-1995) 183 CLR 245.</a>  Moreover, in the passage from the judgment of Ribeiro PJ in <i>New World</i> that has been extracted above, <i>Shell Company of Australia Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation</i> is also such a case.  In a great many of these cases, the courts had to determine whether a power given to a body to determine aparticular matter was in truth and in substance a judicial power that could only be exercised by the federal courts pursuant to s71 of the Australian <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In <i>Albarran</i>, what was in issue was whether the power conferred by s 1292(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) on the Companies Auditors andLiquidators Disciplinary Board to cancel or suspend the registration of a person as a liquidator for a specified period if satisfiedthat certain conditions were fulfilled was judicial or not.  In the highly illuminating judgment of Kirby J, a number of matterswere examined in order to decide the question.  Amongst other things, the judge looked at the history and the origin of the currentfederal legislative regime for the registration of auditors and liquidators.  This was because the history of the determination ofearly legal controversies, factually similar and apparently analogous to a later controversy, could sometimes be useful as indicatinga function which, by the <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, was reserved, in the case of federal law, to the necessary exercise of the judicial power (para 94).  The judge also took into accountthe history of Australian companies legislation, particularly the need for a more systematic and detailed regulation of company liquidatorsby procedures involving registration due to the growth of the economy.  In the judgeâs view, the establishment of professionaldisciplinary boards to supervise such a registration became a logical and natural development (para 95).  Furthermore, the judgetook the view that legally and functionally, the purpose of the provision in question was to uphold the standards of registered liquidators,to ensure the compliance with an adequate and proper performance of the duties imposed on company liquidators, to protect companyshareholders, creditors, officers and employees, and the public, and to uphold professional and business expectations in that regard(para 96).  Regard having had to the function which the Board performed and the interpretation of the section in question, as wellas the intramural or domestic disciplinary arrangements, Kirby J concluded that the Board was not engaged in the adjudication ordetermination of guilt, still less of criminal guilt, or in the imposition of punishment as such.  He therefore came to the viewthat the Board did not exercise a judicial power (para 97).</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Lastly, the judge carried out a function check of his conclusion against the basic objective, reflected in the <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, of reserving the exercise of federal judicial power to the federal courts, which has been described in another Australian case,<i>R v Quinn; Ex parte Consolidated Foods Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20138%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 138 CLR 1</a>, 11 (<i>per</i> Jacobs J) in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe historical approach to the question whether a power is exclusively a judicial power is based upon the recognition that we haveinherited and were intended by our <i><a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> to live under a system of law and government which has traditionally protected the rights of persons by ensuring that those rightsare determined by a judiciary independent of the parliament and the executive.  But the rights referred to in such an enunciationare the basic rights which traditionally, and therefore historically, are judged by that independent judiciary which is the bulwarkof freedom.  The governance of a trial for the determination of criminal guilt is the classic example.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Kirby J took the view that orders made by the Board did not require the intervention of courts as âthe bulwark of freedomâ forthe protection of what had been traditionally regarded as âbasic legal rightsâ (para 99).  Rather, the judge considered the caseunder determination differently (para 100):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âOn the contrary, what is involved in the appellantâs cases is no more than the operation of a disciplinary scheme designed ultimatelyto uphold standards of integrity and competence in the liquidation of companies.  Such a disciplinary scheme involves functions aptto an administrative body.  The Board is thus an unremarkable disciplinary institution which, for functional reasons, includes relevantprofessional and business expertise.  The Board cannot enforce its own decisions and its decisions are subject to facilities of administrativereview of which the appellants have availed themselves.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In <i>Brandy,</i> <i>supra</i>, the High Court of Australia dealt with the question of whether the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission charged with theobligation to hold inquiries into conduct allegedly amounting to racial discrimination was actually exercising a judicial power reservedfor the federal courts.  The Court answered the question in the affirmative.  A major factor that the Court took into account wasthat although a determination by the Commission was not binding or conclusive between any of the parties to it, yet the Commissionwas obliged by the statutory provisions to lodge a determination in a registry of the Federal Court as soon as practicable and theRegistrar was required to register it â upon registration the determination was to have effect as if it were an order made by thatcourt.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  In the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan and Toohey JJ, the judges explained the general principles as follows (258-259):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAlthough many decision-making functions may take their character as an exercise of judicial, executive or legislative power fromtheir legislative setting, the character of the decision-maker and the nature of the decision-making process, some decision-makingfunctions are exclusive and inalienable exercises of judicial power.  As Dixon CJ and McTiernan J observed in <i>R v Davison</i>:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe truth is that the ascertainment of existing rights by the judicial determination of issues of fact or law falls exclusivelywithin judicial power so that the Parliament cannot confide the function to any person or body but a court constituted under ss 71and 72 of the Constitution.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In that statement, the expression âjudicial determinationâ means an authoritative determination by means of the judicial method,that is, an enforceable decision reached by applying the relevant principles of law to the facts as found.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Thus, it has always been accepted that the punishment of criminal offences and the trial of actions for breach of contract and forwrongs are inalienable exercises of judicial power.  The validity of that proposition rests not only on history and precedent butalso on the principle that the process of the trial results in a binding and authoritative judicial determination which ascertainsthe rights of the parties. â¦ The determination involves an exercise of such power not simply because it is made by a court butbecause the determination is made by reference to the application of principles and standards âsupposed already to existâ.  Andthe determination is binding and authoritative in the sense that there is what has been described as an immediately enforceable liabilityâ¦ Consequently, even if the determination in such a case were to be made by an administrative tribunal and not by a court, thedetermination would constitute an exercise of judicial power, although not one in conformity with Ch III of the Constitution.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  What eventually tipped the scales was the automatic registration of the Commissionâs determination (pages 259-260):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âBut s 25ZAB goes beyond providing the machinery for the enforcement of a determination.  It purports to give a registered determinationeffect âas if it were an order made by the Federal Courtâ.  A judicial order made by the Federal Court takes effect as an exerciseof Commonwealth judicial power, but a determination by the Commission is neither made nor registered in the exercise of judicialpower.  An exercise of executive power by the Commission and the performance of an administrative function by the Registrar of theFederal Court simply cannot create an order which takes effect as an exercise of judicial power; conversely, an order which takeseffect as an exercise of judicial power cannot be made except after the making of a judicial determination.  Thus, s 25ZAB purportsto prescribe what the <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> does not permit.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The joint judgment of Deane, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ was also to the same effect so far as these general principles were concerned. Having pointed out the difficulty, if not impossibility, of framing a definition of judicial power that is at once exclusive andexhaustive, the judges stated the general principles, including the one concerning the enforceability of decisions, in the followingterms (pages 267-268):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is traditional to start with the definition advanced by Griffith CJ in <i>Huddart, Parker &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead</i> in which he spoke of the concept of judicial power in terms of the binding and authoritative decision of controversies between subjectsor between subjects and the Crown made by a tribunal which is called upon to take action.  However, it is not every binding and authoritativedecision made in the determination of a dispute which constitutes the exercise of judicial power.  A legislative or administrativedecision may answer that description.  Another important element which distinguishes a judicial decision is that it determines existingrights and duties and does so according to law.  That is to say, it does so by the application of a pre-existing standard ratherthan by the formulation of policy or the exercise of an administrative decision. â¦ But again, as was pointed out in <i>Re Cram; Ex parte Newcastle Wallsend Coal Co Pty Ltd</i>, the exercise of non-judicial functions, for example, arbitral powers, may also involve the determination of existing rights andobligations if only as the basis for prescribing future rights and obligations.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">However, there is one aspect of judicial power which may serve to characterise a function as judicial when it is otherwise equivocal. That is the enforceability of decisions given in the exercise of judicial power.  In <i>Waterside Workersâ Federation of Australia v J W Alexander Ltd</i>, Barton J said:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIt is important to observe that the judicial power includes with the decision and the pronouncement of judgment the power to carrythat judgment into effect between the contending parties.  Whether the power of enforcement is essential to be conferred or not,when it is conferred as part of the whole the judicial power is undeniably complete.ââ</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Applicantâs arguments</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  As described, Mr Harris relies heavily on these Australian authorities.  First, he submits that the Tribunal purports to performa function which is judicial in nature and which has only previously been performed by the criminal courts.  He argues that the formsof market misconduct that the Tribunal is empowered to inquire into under <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIII</a> of the Ordinance are exactly the same as the offences that the criminal courts are required to try under <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/#p14" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIV.</a>  The effect of the institution of proceedings in the Tribunal, it is contended, is to oust the jurisdiction of the criminal courtsand usurp that function from the courts.  He argues that s 307, enacted to prevent âdual punishmentâ, in the sense that personswho are the subjects of proceedings before the Tribunal cannot be charged in a criminal court for the same conduct, necessarily âequatesâthe function performed by the Tribunal with that performed by the criminal courts. </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Secondly, Mr Harris argues that the Tribunal wields powers which are intrinsically judicial powers, such as compelling people toattend and give evidence on oath, authorising the Securities and Futures Commission to conduct searches of premises and compel peopleto attend interviews and give statements, and punishing people for contempt in the same manner as the Court of First Instance bymeans of fines and imprisonment.  The Tribunal may also impose various orders by way of sanctions, such as disgorgement orders, Governmentcosts orders, Commission costs orders and Financial Reporting Council costs orders.  Further, the Tribunal may, through the impositionof disqualification orders, cold shoulder orders and disciplinary orders, prevent a specified person from practising his trade orprofession and participating in the economic life of the community.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Mr Harris further makes the side point that by determining whether the specified person has been guilty of market misconduct, theTribunal is in substance exercising an authority to label him as a criminal in the eyes of the public.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Thirdly, Mr Harris points out, rather correctly, that under s 264 of the Ordinance, the Court of First Instance may, on notice inwriting given by the Tribunal, register an order of the Tribunal in the Court of First Instance and the order shall, on registration,become for all purposes an order of the Court of First Instance made within the jurisdiction of that Court.  Mr Harris relies on<i>Brandy</i> and contends that such a feature points strongly to the conclusion that the Tribunal is in fact exercising the judicial power reservedfor the courts of judicature.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Fourthly, Mr Harris also points out, again correctly, that a determination by the Tribunal that a person has engaged in market misconductis admissible in evidence for the purposes of related civil proceedings and must be deemed correct by the civil court unless thecontrary is proven: s 281(8).  The Tribunal, counsel argues, therefore purports to perform the fact-finding role of the civil courtsand to determine the legal liability of specified persons to third parties. </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In summary, counsel submits that the Tribunalâs power falls squarely within the judicial definition of âjudicial powerâ, inthat the Tribunal is purporting to determine a controversy between the State and a specified person, by reference to pre-existingrights and in accordance with law, and to issue a binding and authoritative decision.  The Tribunal, in the words of Mr Harris, constitutesa âshadow judiciary systemâ.</p>    <p class="heading">Interpreting the Basic Law â importance of context</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  It is true that the principle of separation of powers is enshrined in the Basic Law, and the judicial power of the Special AdministrativeRegion is exclusively vested in the Judiciary: see <i>La</i><i>u</i> <i>Cheong v HKSAR</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282002%29%205%20HKCFAR%20415" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2002) 5 HKCFAR 415</a>, 447-448 (para 101).  The task in the present case is to determine whether the Market Misconduct Tribunal is required by the Ordinanceto exercise such a power.  That necessarily involves the interpretation of the relevant provisions in the Basic Law in order to understandwhat the judicial power of the State (or the HKSAR) is.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  As Hartmann J (as he then was) has observed in <i>Lau Kwok Fai Bernard v Secretary for Justice</i>, HCAL 177/2002 and 180/2002 (10 June 2003), para 23:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhile therefore I accept that the Basic Law incorporates the principle of the separation of powers (subject of course to the meaningand purpose of specific articles which may act to modify that principle), it is apparent that whether the Ordinance, in respect ofany individual article or in respect of the Basic Law generally, offends that Law is a matter which may only be determined by lookingat the Ordinance âin contextâ.  As the Privy Council said in <i>Liyanage </i>: each case must be decided in the light of its own facts and circumstances, including the <i>true purpose of the legislation</i> and <i>the situation to which it is directed</i>.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  And as was also observed during the course of counselâs submission, âeach constitution is the child of its environmentâ. It is, therefore, unsafe to simply borrow and apply the Australian jurisprudence on separation of powers in general and on judicialpower in particular without first recognising the rationale behind the Australian approach, which is a âstrictâ one: <i>per</i> Kirby J in <i>Albarran</i>, para 61.  And there are reasons for that strict approach to separation of powers, as Kirby J explained in para 62:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe governing principle can be traced to concepts expounded in Alexander Hamiltonâs views concerning the special need in a federationto have a branch of government, the judiciary, which was insulated from the other branches of government so as to be able to performthe functions essential to its purposes.  Hamilton considered the independence of the judiciary from the other arms of governmentessential to ensure impartial decision-making in those matters where, otherwise, there was a risk of encroachment and partialityin the administration of federal laws affecting such matters as the âlife, liberty or propertyâ of those who are subject to suchlaws.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  In Hong Kong, we certainly do not have a federal system.  Rather, under the principle of âone country, two systemsâ the HKSARis vested with independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication (art 19).  A main theme of the Joint Declarationand the Basic Law, as Mr Duncan SC (Mr Conney with him) for the Financial Secretary has reminded the Court, is that of continuity,including continuity between the pre-existing and the present court and judicial systems: <i>New World</i> at para 43.  And art 8 of the Basic Law specifically provides that subject to exceptions, the laws previously in force in Hong Kongshall be maintained.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  In this regard, the warning sounded by Sir Anthony Mason in his article, <i>The Place of Comparative Law in Developing the Jurisprudence on the Rule of Law and Human Rights in Hong Kong</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282007%29%2037%20Hong%20Kong%20Law%20Journal%20299" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2007) 37 HKLJ 299</a>, 305-306 is apposite:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQuite apart from political differentiations, there are doctrinal differences, such as those mentioned above.  These doctrinal differences,which are not always based on political differentiations, present obstacles to the importation of principles based on different doctrinalfoundations.  Take, for example, the separation of powers.  The United States and Australian Constitutions incorporate a separationof powers, as does the <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of Canada (at least impliedly), while United Kingdom public law also asserts a separation of powers.  But the content of that separationvaries across the four jurisdictions.  Although the United States and the Australian separation of powers is similar in some respects,the difference between the presidential system and the Westminster system, with its doctrine of responsible government, means thatthere is a substantial cleavage between the two systems.  Neither in Canada nor in the United Kingdom has the doctrine been takenas far as it has in Australia, let alone the United States.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The consequence is that judicial decisions on the separation of powers need to be treated with great care before they can be importedfrom one jurisdiction to another.  This proposition has significance for Hong Kong.  The Basic Law incorporates a separation of powers. So far, however, the courts of the HKSAR have not had occasion to consider what the doctrine may entail in Hong Kong.  It wouldnot follow that the Basic Law, when construed in the light of its context and the preservation of the English common law by Article8 of the Basic Law, necessarily mandates a separation of powers that conforms either to the United States or Australian model.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>See also Anthony Mason, <i>The Role of The Common Law in Hong Kong</i> in <i>The Common Law Lecture Series 2005</i> (HKU) 1, 22-24.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Unlike the Australian <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> which came into being at the beginning of the last century â well before the development of administrative bodies and tribunals,the Basic Law became Hong Kongâs <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> under very different circumstances.  By then, following developments in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, particularly after theSecond World War, administrative bodies and tribunals had become prevalent and they performed or discharged numerous functions thathad superficial resemblance to the judicial process.  Amongst other things, by reason of the requirement under public law, thesetribunals and bodies had to act judicially in their decision-making process.  And they even exercised some sort of âjudicial powerâ. As Robert Walker LJ (as he then was) pointed out in <i>General Medical Council v British Broadcasting Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%201573" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 1573</a>, 1580C-F:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[Counsel] submitted, correctly, that the P.C.C. of the G.M.C. has to adjudicate in a formal and judicial manner on very seriousissues which are of public importance and may also have the gravest effect on the reputation and career of an accused medical practitioner.Mr Henderson was correct in submitting that the PCC is exercising a sort of judicial power but in our judgment it is not the judicialpower of the state which is being exercised. ...... In this case, by contrast, the P.C.C. is a statutory committee of a professionalbody specially incorporated by statute.

The authors pointout the advantages of tribunals on pages 907-908 â they can offer speedier, cheaper and more accessible justice.  Another advantageis that of expertise.  Specialised tribunals can deal both more expertly and more rapidly with special classes of cases, whereasin the High Court counsel may take a day or more to explain to the judge how some statutory scheme is designed to operate.  Evenwithout technical expertise, a specialised tribunal quickly builds up expertise in its own field.  At pages 908-910, the chaptergoes on to discuss other characteristics of statutory tribunals, including the so-called âadministrative tribunalsâ:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe system of tribunals has now long been an essential part of the machinery of government.  The supplementary network of adjudicatorybodies has grown up side by side with the traditional courts of law.  There is a close relationship between the two systems, bothbecause under the ordinary law the tribunals are subject to control by the courts and also because Parliament has in the majorityof cases provided a right of appeal from the tribunals to the courts on any question of law.  A case which starts, say, in a socialsecurity or employment tribunal may therefore end in the House of Lords, having passed through four or five stages of litigation. This is a rare event, since otherwise the tribunal system would be self-defeating.  But the tribunals must in some way be integratedwith the machinery of justice generally.  As will be seen, it has proved necessary to increase the supervisory powers of the courts,as well as to extend rights of appeal.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Tribunals are subject to a law of evolution which fosters diversity of species.  Each one is devised for the purposes of some particularstatute and is therefore, so to speak, tailor-made.  When any new scheme of social welfare or regulation is introduced the line ofleast resistance is usually to set up new ad hoc tribunals rather than reorganise those already existing.  Uncontrolled growth hasproduced over fifty different types of tribunal falling within the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992.  When all their local subdivisionsare aggregated the total (including Scotland) exceeds 2,000.  They range from extremely busy tribunals such as those dealing withsocial security, employment, valuation appeals and rent assessment to tribunals which have no business at all and have thereforenever been appointed, such as the mines and quarries tribunals. â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The responsibilities of tribunals are in general no less important than those of courts of law.  Large awards of money may be madeby tribunals, for example, in cases of industrial injuries.  Mental health review tribunals determine whether a patient ought tobe compulsorily detained, and so lose his personal liberty, whereas the administration of his property is a matter for the courtsof law.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦ the decisions of most tribunals are in truth judicial rather than administrative, in the sense that the tribunal has to find factsand then apply legal rules to them impartially, without regard to executive policy.  Such tribunals have in substance the same functionsas courts of law.  When, for example, jobseekerâs allowance is awarded by a social security tribunal, its decision is as objectiveas that of any court of law.  Only two elements enter into it: the facts as they are proved, and the statutory rules which have tobe applied.  The rules may sometimes give the tribunal a measure of discretion.  But discretion is given to be used objectively,and no more alters the nature of the decision than does the âjudicial discretionâ which is familiar in courts of law.  Thesetribunals therefore have the character of courts, even though they are enmeshed in the administrative machinery of the state.  Theyare âadministrativeâ only because they are part of an administrative system for which a minister is responsible to Parliament,and because the reasons for preferring them to the ordinary courts are administrative reasons.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Fourthly, and most important of all, tribunals are independent.  They are in no way subject to administrative interference as to howthey decide any particular case.  No minister can be held responsible for any tribunalâs decision.  Nor are tribunals composedof officials or of people who owe obedience to the administration.  It would be as improper for a minister to try to influence atribunalâs decision as it would be in the case of a court of law.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>For academic discussion on the Hong Kong position, see also P Wesley-Smith, <i>Judges and Judicial Power under the Hong Kong Basic Law</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282004%29%2034%20Hong%20Kong%20Law%20Journal%2083" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2004) 34 HKLJ 83</a>, 94-102; B Hsu, <i>Judicial Independence Under the Basic Law</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282004%29%2034%20Hong%20Kong%20Law%20Journal%20279" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2004) 34 HKLJ 279</a>, 280-286.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  It is plain that in a modern society like Hong Kong, administrative tribunals and bodies have an important role to play.  This isnot a new phenomenon.  It was already the case before the Basic Law was promulgated.  Given the theme of continuity, it would bevery surprising if the effect of the Basic Law, upon its proper interpretation, were to outlaw these administrative tribunals andbodies for ousting the jurisdiction or usurping the judicial functions of the courts of judicature of the HKSAR.  Or put anotherway, the Basic Law should be interpreted in such a way as to enable, so far as violence is not done to the principle of separationof powers as understood in the tradition of English common law, the continued existence and development of administrative tribunalsand bodies.  This calls for a flexible and realistic, as opposed to an idealistic, approach to the doctrine of separation of powers,and a purposive and contextualised interpretation of the scope and meaning of âjudicial powerâ in the Basic Law, rather thanfollowing indiscriminately the strict interpretation adopted by the Australian courts towards their own <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, which was written under very different circumstances in order to serve its own unique purposes.</p>    <p class="heading">Combating insider dealing in Hong Kong</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  This theme of continuity brings me to the fact that the Insider Dealing Tribunal, the predecessor of the Market Misconduct Tribunal,was already in existence for some years before 1997, pursuant to the provisions in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/395" class="autolink_findacts">Securities (Insider Dealing) Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/395">Cap 395</a>) (now repealed).  Some of the background facts can be gleaned from the judgment of Sir Anthony Mason NPJ in <i>Koon Wing Yee v Insider Dealing Tribunal</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%203%20HKLRD%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 3 HKLRD 372</a>, 389 to 391.  As his Lordship explained (at paras 45 and 46):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â45.  Insider dealing is an âinsidious mischiefâ which threatens the integrity of financial markets and public and investorconfidence in the markets.  The object of SIDO [Securities (Insider Dealing) Ordinance] was to eliminate insider dealing and to reinforcethe transparency of the markets, thereby enhancing and preserving Hong Kongâs position as an international financial centre.  Theimportance of attaining this object led to the decision to arm the Tribunal with the additional powers of imposing a penalty andordering disqualification.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">46.  That insider dealing amounts to very serious misconduct admits of no doubt.  It is a species of dishonest misconduct.  It consistsof using price-sensitive information (which is not in the public realm) about a public company for private gain in circumstanceswhere the wrongdoerâs misconduct is based on knowledge of, or his having reason to believe, critical prescribed elements of themisconduct described by s 9 of SIDO.  That public censure was thought earlier to be an adequate sanction is indicative that insiderdealing is considered to be very serious misconduct and that severe injury to reputation may flow from such a finding.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  I have already quoted from the relevant legislative materials which throw light on the purposes and policy intention behind thereplacement of the old Ordinance with the present <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/571" class="autolink_findacts">Securities and Futures Ordinance</a> and the setting up of the Market Misconduct Tribunal to combat insider dealing.  The new scheme has been described by Sir AnthonyMason NPJ as providing for dual civil and criminal regimes to deal with insider dealing (at p 391):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â47.  Moreover, insider dealing is a form of conduct which can be readily characterized as criminal conduct.  Indeed, the SFO [Securitiesand Futures Ordinance], which enacted the present legislation governing insider dealing, provides for dual civil and criminal regimesto deal with six types of market misconduct.  The purpose of the SFO was to enhance the deterrent and punitive effect of the availablesanctions for insider dealing on the basis that the regime under SIDO was insufficient to combat effectively acts of market misconduct. Similar dual regimes had by then been adopted in the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">48.  As an element in the new civil regime, the SFO set up the Market Misconduct Tribunal (âthe MMTâ) to hear cases of suspectedmarket misconduct.  The MMT was given power to impose civil sanctions, including surrender of any profit made or increased by marketmisconduct, but without power to impose a fine or penalty.  The decision to leave the MMT without power to impose a fine was influencedby legal advice received by the Government to the effect that the existence of such a power might lead to a breach of the BOR.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  It is interesting to note that neither the Court of Final Appeal, nor apparently the eminent counsel appearing in <i>Koon Wing Yee</i>, which was concerned with whether the proceedings before the Insider Dealing Tribunal were compatible with human right requirements,raised the question of whether the Insider Dealing Tribunal was exercising the judicial power of the HKSAR that is exclusively vestedin the courts of judicature, if they ever thought that it was a potential problem.  This is particularly so when the Court of FinalAppeal actually concluded that the nature of the charges before the Insider Dealing Tribunal was criminal.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  That, if nothing else, tends to support my earlier observation that the (pertinent) philosophy behind the Basic Law is one of continuity,and it would be a very surprising suggestion indeed if anybody were to suggest that the Insider Dealing Tribunal, which had beenestablished before 1997 to deal with a particular type of evils affecting the financial markets that had been identified by the executive/legislature,had suddenly become a usurper of judicial authority after the coming into force of the Basic Law.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  This is a highly relevant background fact, in the sense that how, historically, the subject matter under discussion has been dealtwith and how the present regime came into being are material to determining whether the judicial power of the State is involved:see <i>Albarran, supra</i>, paras 91 and 95.</p>    <p class="heading">A novel subject matter</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Another important fact, in my view, is this: As the Australian authorities have pointed out, if the subject matter is one that has,traditionally or historically, been the subject of adjudication by the courts of judicature, that is an indication that what is involvedis the judicial power of the State.  Thus, subjects such as crimes, or claims in contract or tort, are subjects traditionally dealtwith by the courts in exercise of their judicial power of the State.  Hiving off any such subject matters from the courtâs jurisdictionto a tribunal could therefore be problematic. </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  The same consideration does not apply where the subject matter is novel to the common law.  Insider dealing is such a subject. It is not a common law offence.  Nor does it sit comfortably well with traditional causes of action based on contract, tort, trust,agency or companies law â although I am not saying that given the right facts, some causes of action could not be framed underthe common law.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Likewise, the sanctions that the Tribunal can impose, namely, orders of disqualification, cold shoulders orders, cease and desistorders, disgorgement orders and extensive costs orders, are, by and large, sanctions not known to the common law.  They are creaturesof statute.  There is therefore, again, no question of hiving off remedies that are traditionally dispensed by courts of law to anadministrative tribunal.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  In short, it is not a case of removing from the jurisdiction of the court a subject matter and giving it to a statutory tribunalto deal with.  What actually happens is that by legislative intervention, a new subject matter is identified as one that requiresregulation or policing, and, for policy or administrative reasons, the task is given, not to the traditional courts, but to a statutorytribunal specially established for such purposes.  In those circumstances, the case for saying that the judicial power of the State,exercisable only by the courts of judicature, is removed from the courts and given to a statutory tribunal, is not particularly convincing.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Having said that, of course, if the statutory intervention results in the creation of criminal offences, and the determination ofthose offences is left in the hands of a statutory tribunal instead of the criminal courts, that would be a quite different story. For, regardless of whether the offences are statutory in origin, the trying of crimes is, from all perspectives, an exercise ofthe judicial power of the State that should, under the doctrine of separation of powers, be reserved exclusively for the criminalcourts.</p>    <p class="heading">MMT does not decide criminal guilt</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  This brings me to Mr Harrisâ point that the Market Misconduct Tribunal is, in truth and in substance, required to try criminaloffences.  I do not accept this argument.  As has been observed by Sir Anthony Mason NPJ in <i>Koon Wing Yee</i>, the new Ordinance provides for dual civil and criminal regimes to deal with six types of market misconduct.  At the choice of theFinancial Secretary, the same conduct may be referred to the criminal courts for trial or the Market Misconduct Tribunal for investigation(but not both).  If the Part XIV route is taken, it is a criminal court, applying criminal rules and procedures, including the criminalstandard of proof, which will decide whether a criminal offence has been committed and the appropriate criminal punishment.  TheMarket Misconduct Tribunal will have nothing to do with it.  On the other hand, if the Part XIII route is chosen, the Market MisconductTribunal will, applying its own rules and procedures which are civil (and inquisitorial) in nature, carry out investigations intothe matter and determine whether market misconduct has taken place.  That determination will not be the determination of the commissionof a crime.  No such determination will be made.  Nor is it relevant to any criminal proceedings for â by definition â therewill not be any parallel criminal proceedings.  Nobody will be labelled a criminal â to do so would be defamatory, for the Tribunalâsdetermination, based on the civil standard and according to rules and procedures that are civil and inquisitorial in nature, is nota determination of <i>criminal</i> guilt.  That there is a distinction between guilt and criminal guilt, as Mr Duncan SC has argued, is clearly borne out by Kirby Jâsjudgment in <i>Albarran, supra</i>, at para 97, where the learned judge concluded that the Companies Board was not engaged âin the adjudication or determination ofguilt, still less of criminal guiltâ.</p>    <p class="heading">MMT does not decide civil liability</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Nor is the Market Misconduct Tribunal required to determine civil liability.  It is noteworthy that the Ordinance creates a civilcause of action based on market misconduct (s 281) but does not give the jurisdiction to determine such liability to the Tribunal. Rather such civil liability is to be determined by the civil courts.  What the legislature has done is to render the determinationby the Tribunal admissible evidence in the civil proceedings and to create a rebuttable presumption based on the determination ofmarket misconduct against the defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  That does not make the Market Misconduct Tribunal the adjudicator of civil liability or of the primary facts necessary to foundsuch liability.  What has been done is nothing more than the creation of an evidential aid in the civil proceedings before the courts. If the legislation had provided that the determination by the Tribunal is conclusive evidence of the commission of the market misconductin the civil proceedings, that would have been a different matter.  But that is not the case here.</p>    <p class="heading">Nature of the function of MMT</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  What then is the nature of the function of the Tribunal?  What function, in the statutory scheme, does the Tribunal perform, forthe purposes of which it is given the power of determination â hence the nature of such power?</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Speaking of the repealed <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/395" class="autolink_findacts">Securities (Insider Dealing) Ordinance</a> and the now defunct Insider Dealing Tribunal, Sir Anthony Mason NPJ observed in <i>Koon Wing Yee</i> that the object of the Ordinance was to eliminate insider dealing and to reinforce the transparency of the markets, thereby enhancingand preserving Hong Kongâs position as an international financial centre (para 45).  As a successor to the former statutory regime,in my view, the present Ordinance and the Market Misconduct Tribunal it has established are there to serve, hopefully in a more effectivemanner, the same purposes.  This is fully borne out by the legislative materials that have been referred to.  The same conclusionhas been reached by Hartmann J (as he then was) and Lam J in <i>Chau Chin Hung v Market Misconduct Tribunal</i>, HCAL 123/2007, 124/2007 and 22/2008 (22 September 2008), although the focus of that decision was on the nature and severity of thesanctions that the Tribunal could impose.  The Court had no difficulty in concluding, in respect of those sanctions, namely disqualification,cold shoulder orders, cease and desist orders, disgorgement orders, reference of an identified person to his own professional bodyfor possible disciplinary proceedings, as well as extensive costs orders, that they are all designed to protect financial institutionsand the investing public, or, in the case of costs orders, to serve a compensatory purpose.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In my view, quite plainly, looking at the dual regimes under the Ordinance, and particularly the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/395#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIII</a> scheme, the purpose is to protect and maintain the integrity of the financial markets in Hong Kong, thereby enhancing and preservingHong Kongâs reputation as an international financial centre.  It is regulatory in nature.  The investing public, and thereforepublic interest at large, is protected in the sense that the regime ensures the integrity of the financial markets in which the investingpublic carry on their investment or trading activities.  It is very different from the case, for instance, dealt with by the Australiancourt in <i>Brandy</i>, concerning racial discrimination, which, of course, is a problem cutting across all strata of the society.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  It is true that the sanctions are potentially severe, and therefore carry with it a deterrent effect, but that does not render thesanctions any less protective in nature.  This has been decided by <i>Chau Chin Hung</i>, against which Mr Harris has mounted no challenge.  In particular, the power to disqualify is protective rather than punitive incharacter, namely, that the primary purpose of the power is to protect investors and the public.  In so far as the making of suchan order has a deterrent effect, that effect is incidental and subservient to the purpose of protecting shareholders, investors andthe public from people who are unfit to hold office: <i>Koon Wing Yee</i> at paras 72 and 73; <i>Chau Chin Hung</i> at paras 29-32.  In other words, nothing penal is involved here and, as I have already concluded, the Tribunal is not required todetermine any criminal liability or to impose any penal sanction or punishment.  That is not the purpose of the scheme laid downin <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/395#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIII.</a>  Rather, that is the business of the criminal courts pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/395#p14" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIV</a> of the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  In my view, to a substantial extent the Tribunal is performing a function comparable to that performed by a regulating body or disciplinarytribunal established to self-regulate a particular type of activities amongst a specific class of people in the society.  Of course,like solicitors disciplinary proceedings, the public at large has a stake in the matter in the sense that solicitors are here toprovide legal services to the public and it is in the interest of the public that professional misconduct of solicitors be investigatedinto and dealt with accordingly.  Likewise, the Market Misconduct Tribunal is there to regulate the conduct of those involved inthe financial markets in Hong Kong.  The investing public and the reputation of Hong Kong as a serious financial centre all havea stake in it.  But it is very different in nature from, say, the determination of a criminal offence by a criminal court, or theadjudication of civil disputes before a civil court.  The functions performed by the courts in those cases are qualitatively differentfrom that performed by the Tribunal.  Maybe this is just another way of putting the distinction between exercising the judicial powerand exercising a judicial power of the State.</p>    <p class="heading">Registration of MMTâs orders</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  It is true that an order of the Tribunal may be registered in the Court of First Instance, and once registered, it shall take effectas if it were an order of that court (s 264(1)).  In this regard, the Australian decision in <i>Brandy</i> is of course highly relevant. </p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  But first, unlike <i>Brandy</i>, registration is not automatic.  The court plainly retains a discretion whether to register an order under s 264(1) (âthe Courtof First Instance <i>may</i> â¦ register an order of the Tribunal â¦â).  It cannot be assumed that the discretion is anything other than a real one.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Secondly, I do not see <i>Brandy</i> as laying down the rule that if an order by a tribunal is automatically registrable as an order or judgment of a court of the classickind, the tribunal must be exercising the judicial power of the State.  In my view, taken at the highest, that is only a pointer,albeit an important one, that what is being exercised is the judicial power of the State.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Moreover, the actual decision in <i>Brandy</i> was heavily influenced by its context, namely racial discrimination, a subject matter which, one would have thought, ought to bedealt with by the courts of the classic kind.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  In any event, as I said at the outset, in interpreting our Basic Law, the historical context â the use of administrative tribunalsin general and the use of a specialised tribunal to combat insider dealing in particular in Hong Kong â cannot be ignored.  A flexibleand sensitive approach must be adopted.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Furthermore, under the former legislation, registration of the orders of the Insider Dealing Tribunal was automatic: <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/395/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 29</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/395" class="autolink_findacts">Securities (Insider Dealing) Ordinance</a>.  Viewed historically, such provision was already in existence prior to 1997, and assuming that the Basic Law did not intend to createa sea change in terms of regulating insider dealing in Hong Kong, it is difficult to see how a <i>discretionary</i> power to register could turn the successor to the Insider Dealing Tribunal into a tribunal seeking to exercise the judicial powerof the State.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  In my view, all things considered, what is being sought to achieve in s 264(1) is nothing more than to provide a convenient aidto execution.  Imagine, for the purposes of argument, that s 264(1) were not included in the legislation: there would have to beput in place instead elaborate provisions to set up a machinery of execution of the Tribunalâs orders.  But not only that: effortsand expenses would have to be incurred in order to implement the machinery of execution designed on paper in the legislation.  Theregistration provisions in s 264(1) simply provide a convenient shortcut to the problem.  In my view, it is never intended to affectthe substance of the matter, that is to say, that the Tribunal is established to police and regulate market behaviour.</p>    <p class="heading">MMTâs powers</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  That the Tribunal is given powers regarding gathering evidence and punishing people for contempt cannot be conclusive of the matter. Understandably, those powers are required to enable the Tribunal to do an effective job, particularly bearing in mind that proceedingsbefore the Tribunal are essentially inquisitorial in nature: <i>Chau Chin Hung, supra,</i> at para 56.  (Likewise, proceedings in the Insider Dealing Tribunal were also inquisitorial.  There was no <i>lis</i> as such.  <i>Riady v Insider Dealing Tribunal</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%202%20HKC%2010" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 2 HKC 10</a>, 18, para 23(2).)  </p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The Tribunalâs power to commit people for contempt is not unique to it.  The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal certainly possessessuch a power.  In <i>Tse Wai Chun, supra</i>, at paras 18 to 21, the Court of Appeal held that at least in the local context, possession of a statutory power to commit peoplefor contempt in the face of a tribunal is nothing unusual. </p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Taking a step back, the whole question of whether a tribunal is in fact exercising the judicial power of the State cannot possiblybe determined by the single question of whether it has a power to commit for contempt in the face of the tribunal.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Just as that fact does not turn the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal in <i>Tse Wai Chun</i> into a court of the classic kind, exercising the judicial power of the State, it alone cannot be dispositive of the question underdiscussion.</p>    <p class="heading">Policy intention</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  It is true that the legislative materials sometimes used words which would tend to suggest that the Tribunal is there to âpunishâactivities of insider dealing and to impose âsanctionsâ.  But there is a limit to what one can derive from these legislativematerials, which were policy papers or explanatory notes, rather than the legislation itself.  Ultimately, the legislation, as enacted,must be looked at with care to determine whether the Tribunal is in substance seeking to determine criminal guilt, and whether thesanctions that the Tribunal can impose are penal, with deterrent and punishment being its primary objectives.  The fact that it isthought that securing a <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/395#p14" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIV</a> conviction is difficult and thus there is a need to set up a <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/395#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIII</a> alternative does not turn the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/395#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part XIII</a> scheme into one whereby the judicial power of the State is exercised.  One must not confuse the reasons for needing an alternativeregime with the true nature of that alternative regime.</p>    <p class="heading">Double jeopardy</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  The question of âdouble jeopardyâ does not take Mr Harrisâ case very far.  The same or similar policy considerations can leadto the enactment of provisions against double jeopardy irrespective of whether the two set of proceedings in question are both legalproceedings belonging properly to the province of courts of the classic kind, or whether one set of proceedings is legal in nature(in the above sense) and the other administrative in nature.  That, in the absence of provisions safeguarding against double jeopardy,a person may be vexed in two sets of proceedings does not necessarily or logically mean that the nature of those two sets of proceedingsis the same or similar.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I have no hesitation in concluding that the Market Misconduct Tribunal is notrequired by the Ordinance to exercise the judicial power of the HKSAR.  It does not oust the jurisdiction of the criminal courtsin Hong Kong, nor does it usurp their function.  It is established to perform a regulatory and protective role in Hong Kongâs financialmarkets.  It is there to ensure that those engaged in market misconduct do not profit from their wrongs.  In a fairly general sense,it performs a function that protects and benefits the interests of the society as a whole.  But it does not determine criminal guiltnor impose penal sanction.  Certainly it wields extensive powers and indeed it must act judicially.  But one thing it does not dois to exercise the judicial power of the HKSAR.  Hong Kong has a long history of using administrative bodies and tribunals for similarfunctions.  They are, to a certain extent, integrated into and form part of the âmachinery of justiceâ, a phrase used in <i>Wade &amp; Forsyth, op cit</i>, at page 906.  In my view, their place in Hong Kong is not affected by the provisions in the Basic Law.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  I would therefore dismiss the application for judicial review.
