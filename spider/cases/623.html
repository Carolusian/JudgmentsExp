comprising shops, offices, residential apartments, a hotel and an exhibition centre.It is and has at all material times been operated and managed by the plaintiff (Seacliff) a Hong Kong registered company which isa joint venture owned by a number of corporate investors.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Seacliff managed and paid for capital improvements undertaken between 1995 and 2000. The budgeted costs were US$49 million. Managementof the refurbishment was originally undertaken by inhouse personnel of senior rank. The Chief Finance Officer surnamed McNett wasto play a prominent role. For reasons not clear Seacliff came to engage the 5th defendant (Benswick) to participate in the managementof the refurbishment. Benswick is and was at all material times a Hong Kong registered company owned and controlled by a man surnamedHowe.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> By or shortly after the project was complete, in early 2000, the plaintiff came to realise that it had exceeded the budget. It hadcause to believe that there were irregularities including the misappropriation of funds. It appointed an independent company calledKroll Associates (Asia) Limited to undertake an investigation. A chartered accountant named Alexander Duperouzal (Duperouzal) wasput in charge.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> It was soon apparent that McNett had helped himself to large amounts of money in cash advances which could only have been withoutauthority and improper. In addition both McNett and Howe had claimed and been paid large amounts of money for expenses in connectionwith the project which smacked of unauthorized expenditure for personal use. And then, shortly after the investigation got underway,McNett disappeared suddenly, and has not been heard of since.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> An investigation running parallel to that of Duperouzal's has revealed that the budget has been overspent by US$35 million and thatin fact the total cost should have been US$41 million, leaving US$43 million unaccounted for. Duperouzal has also found a numberof unexplained unusual features about the project which included:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) that there is a paucity of records justifying payments made by Seacliff, some of them substantial;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) that there appears to be no commercial or other good reason why Benswick was appointed to manage the project;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) that a number of PRC registered companies appear to have been used as conduits for the passage of money without good cause orreasonable explanation. Through them approximately US$42 million has been channelled and then paid to Benswick purportedly thenceto various suppliers, but there are insufficient records to verify these.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Duperouzal's investigation to date points to large scale commercial fraud implicating McNett, Howe and perhaps others.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Certain of the irregularities uncovered have included what on the face of it appears to be a duplication or even triplication ofpayments made for the supply and installation of marble, provided by the 1st defendant (Decca). As an example Decca was paid directby the plaintiff an invoiced charge of HK$16.831 million. But the plaintiff was also debited for this amount by Benswick on the basisthat it paid Decca. Further, sums totalling RMB$30 million were channelled through one of the PRC companies purportedly for marblesupplied, but there are wholly inadequate records to explain or justify the outlay. There has also been difficulty in finding outwhat has been paid for carpeting, the supplier of which was the 2nd defendant (Tai Ping) because of an apparent instruction to routepayments through a PRC company. But this cannot be ascertained because so much of documentation supporting this is non-existent orhas gone missing.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Duperouzal sought the assistance of Decca and Tai Ping requesting copies of documents, records, correspondence and so on as may helphis enquiries. He claims there has been partial, ineffective response from both suppliers, at least as at October 2000.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> It was Howe who told Duperouzal that many of the payments made by Seacliff in the course of the project to the PRC companies werethen routed through Benswick's accounts with the 3rd defendant (the Hong Kong Bank) to pay the suppliers. Howe has on request providedsome information and documents, but his co-operation has been selective and limited. Duperouzal says much vital detail has not beenand is unlikely to be forthcoming, at least voluntarily.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The investigation has uncovered that McNett used the 4th defendant (Credit Lyonnais) through which he channelled funds derived fromthe Shanghai Centre. Further, he was in control of a BVI Company called MBM Investments Limited (MBM) which at one stage held deposits"in the low 7 figures in US dollars", thus in excess of US$1 million. An inspection of bank statements and records of accounts inthe names of McNett and MBM would likely be of assistance to trace the present whereabouts of funds rightfully Seacliff's.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Against this background, on 22 September 2000, Seacliff filed an originating summons, naming Decca, Tai Ping, the Hong Kong Bankand Credit Lyonnais as the four defendants, seeking production of documents as specifically named and described for the purpose ofassisting it in establishing fraud and running to earth those responsible, and as a means of tracing funds which Seacliff might beentitled to recover. The application amounts to a pre-action claim for discovery, for there are no proceedings yet underway. Seacliff'sstated position is that this is a necessary prerequisite to identify the wrongdoers and formulate to the required acceptable levelof preciseness its pleadings. The application was brought under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8">Cap. 8</a>(EO), and invoking the court's inherent jurisdiction to make the orders sought.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Benswick with notice of the application, applied to be joined, and was made 5th defendant by order of 12 December 2000. Seacliff'sapplication was set down for hearing, two days reserved, on 12 March 2001.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Meanwhile, there was a preliminary matter to deal with. Benswick following its joinder made application that the summons as it affectedthe Hong Kong Bank be struck out upon the grounds that the court had no jurisdiction to make the orders asked for. The matter cameon for hearing on 1 March 2001 and on 5 March I handed down a judgment dismissing Benswick's application. Following that, there beinginsufficient time for Benswick to file its affidavit in opposition to Seacliff's application and for Seacliff to reply, the actionagainst the Hong Kong Bank has been adjourned to be dealt with in the future.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Seacliff's application for the meantime is directed against Decca, Tai Ping and Credit Lyonnais.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> When the hearing began, Mr Harris, counsel for the plaintiff, told me that the issues with Tai Ping had been resolved. Since serviceof the application Tai Ping had volunteered a large amount of material. Those additional documents Seacliff wanted sight of havebeen agreed and the terms of discovery settled, and I was invited to make what is commonly known as a Tomlin order by consent. Imade such order.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> I was also shown a letter from those representing Credit Lyonnais which stated that there would be no opposition to the orders soughtagainst it and no representation, Seacliff to meet the bank's costs.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Mr Hung representing Decca opposed the application.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> At the outset Mr Harris made a summary of those documents Seacliff currently wants sight of, submitting, in effect, a draft order,in which Seacliff is referred to as P and Decca as D1, as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"1. All agreements and/or documents recording any agreements entered into between D1 and any incorporated or unincorporated company,partnership, sole proprietorship or individual (<em>"Person" or "Persons"</em>) in connection with the Works* pursuant to which D1 received payment. (P is principally interested in contracts with P, the Chinesecompanies or Benswick.) (<em>*defined as the major refurbishment begun in 1995 and concluded in 2000</em>)</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">2. All quotations and/or estimates provided by D1 to any Person or Persons in connection with the Works.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">3. All invoices and/or interim payment applications and/or any other request for payment made by D1 to any Person or Persons in connectionwith the Works.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">4. All documents showing how much D1 was paid, whether in the form of cash, cheque, bank transfer, goods or services, credit or thecancellation of a liability or howsoever, in connection with the Works and by who, how and when such payments were made.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">5.

(<em>the first five companies referred to are the PRC registered companies I have referred to at page 3</em>)</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> At the hearing Mr Harris said that disclosure was not sought through <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21</a> EO and that the plaintiff's application is founded on the court's inherent jurisdiction to order in terms sought. He also said thatfor the avoidance of doubt Seacliff was prepared to undertake to meet the reasonable costs of disclosure of documents sought. Anundertaking has now been filed.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The argument against discovery being ordered pre-action is that it falls within the "mere witness" rule. This was referred to byLord Reid in <strong>Norwich Pharmacal v. Customs &amp; Excise</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] AC 133.</a> In this case the plaintiff sought discovery from the defendant of the names and particulars of those it had reason to believe hadcommitted breaches of copyright, there being no other means of identifying the alleged wrong doers. Lord Reid said at p. 173:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"But it is argued for the respondents that it was an indispensable condition for the ordering of discovery that the person seekingdiscovery should have a cause of action against the person from whom it was sought. Otherwise it was said the case would come withinthe "mere witness" rule.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">I think that there has been a good deal of misunderstanding about this rule. It has been clear at least since the time of Lord Hardwickethat information cannot be obtained by discovery from a person who will in due course be compellable to give that information eitherby oral testimony as a witness or on a subpoena duces tecum. Whether the reasons justifying that rule are good or bad it is muchtoo late to inquire: the rule is settled. But the foundation of the rule is the assumption that eventually the testimony will beavailable either in an action already in progress or in an action which will be brought later. It appears to me to have no applicationto a case like the present case. Here if the information in the possession of the respondents cannot be made available by discoverynow, no action can ever be begun because the appellants do not know who are the wrongdoers who have infringed their patent. So theappellants can never get the information.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">To apply the mere witness rule to a case like this would be to divorce it entirely from its proper sphere. Its purpose is not to preventbut to postpone the recovery of the information sought. It may sometimes have been misapplied in the past but I see no reason whywe should continue to do so.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">But that does not mean, as the appellants contend, that discovery will be ordered against anyone who can given information as to theidentity of a wrongdoer. There is absolutely no authority for that. A person injured in a road accident might know that a bystanderhad taken the number of the car which ran him down and have no other means of tracing the driver. Or a person might know that a particularperson is in possession of a libellous letter which he has good reason to believe defames him but the author of which he cannot discover.I am satisfied that it would not be proper in either case to order discovery in order that the person who has suffered damage mightbe able to find and sue the wrongdoer. Neither authority, principle nor public policy would justify that."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Referring then to authorities on the principle Lord Reid went on to say at p 175:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"They seem to me to point to a very reasonable principle that if through no fault of his own a person gets mixed up in the tortiousacts of others so as to facilitate their wrong-doing he may incur no personal liability but he comes under a duty to assist the personwho has been wronged by giving him full information and disclosing the identity of the wrongdoers. I do not think that it matterswhether he became so mixed up by voluntary action on his part or because it was his duty to do what he did. It may be that if thiscauses him expense the person seeking the information ought to reimburse him. But justice requires that he should co-operate in rightingthe wrong if he unwittingly facilitated its perpetration.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">I am the more inclined to reach this result because it is clear that if the person mixed up in the affair has to any extent incurredany liability to the person wronged, he must make full disclosure even though the person wronged has no intention of proceeding againsthim.

Assistance from those who contracted to provide goods and services is required notsolely for the purpose of a tracing claim but also to establish how much was spent on the capital improvements in order to ascertainthe nature and extent of the fraud.

Sir Richard Scott V-C. said at p 1318:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The present position is that it is not possible for the plaintiff to know for certain whether he does or does not have a viable causeof action against the informant.

It did not know whom to sue. But that there was tortious conduct against it was not in question. In thepresent case it is in question whether a tort has been committed against the plaintiff. He believes that it has. The purpose of anyorder I make, as I suppose of any order that a judge ever makes, is to try to enable justice to be done. It seems to me that in thecircumstances of the present case justice demands that the plaintiff should be placed in a position to clear his name if the allegationsmade against him are without foundation. It seems to me intolerable that an individual in his position should be stained by seriousallegations, the content of which he has no means of discovering and which he has no means of meeting otherwise than with the assistanceof an order of discovery such as he seeks from me. It seems to me that the principles expressed in the Norwich Pharmacal case, althoughthey have not previously been applied so far as I know to a case in which the question whether there has been a tort has not clearlybeen answered, ought to be applicable in a case such as the present."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> In <strong>Re Greater Beijing Region Expressways Limited</strong> No 2  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%202%20HKC%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 2 HKC 118</a> the point was dealt with by Le Pichon J (as she then was).

In this case the particular point is "full information".</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">This new jurisdiction must, of course, be carefully exercised. It is a strong thing to order a bank to disclose the state of its customer'saccount and the documents and correspondence relating to it. It should only be done when there is a good ground for thinking themoney in the bank is the plaintiff's money - as, for instance, when the customer has got the money by fraud - or other wrongdoing- and paid it into his account at the bank. The plaintiff who has been defrauded has a right in equity to follow the money. He isentitled, in Lord Atkin's words, to lift the latch of the banker's door: see <em>Banque Belge pour l'Etranger v. Hambrouck</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1921%5d%201%20KB%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1921] 1 K.B. 321</a>, 355. The customer, who has prima facie been guilty of fraud, cannot bolt the door against him. Owing to his fraud, he is disentitledfrom relying on the confidential relationship between him and the bank: see <em>Initial Services Ltd. v. Putterill</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%201%20QB%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 1 Q.B. 396</a>, 405. If the plaintiff's equity is to be of any avail, he must be given access to the bank's books and documents - for that is theonly way of tracing the money or of knowing what has happened to it: see <em>Mediterranea Raffineria Siciliana Petroli S.p.a. v. Mabanaft G.m.b.H.</em> (unreported). So the court, in order to give effect to equity, will be prepared in a proper case to make an order on the bank fortheir discovery. The plaintiff must of course give an undertaking in damages to the bank and must pay all and any expenses to whichthe bank is put in making the discovery: and the documents, once seen, must be used solely for the purpose of following and tracingthe money: covery. The plaintiff must of course give an undertaking in damages to the bank and must pay all and any expenses to whichthe bank is put in making the discovery: and the documents, once seen, must be used solely for the purpose of following and tracingthe money: and not for any other purpose.

Compliance with theorder asked for will amount to a massive undertaking to locate in Hong Kong and China the material sought, much of which by now maywell be destroyed or archived. The disclosure application therefore is oppressive and thus unreasonable and should be turned down.And he queried whether Seacliff had demonstrated a real prospect that the information required might lead to uncovering a fraud andby whom. He defined Seacliff's claim as trumped up, speculative and founded only on the apparent latent realization that expenditurewas over-budget. In the circumstances, he argued, I should dismiss the application.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> He referred me to <strong>Attorney-General v Wellcome Foundation Limited</strong> [1992] 1 HKC. In the court below Kaplan J had ordered discovery against Customs and Excise (C &amp; E) in circumstances where thestrength of the plaintiff's case was somewhat uncertain, the discovery would have meant rummaging through tens of thousands of documentsand there was nothing to say that after all that C &amp; E would have found what the plaintiff was looking for.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Litton JA (as he then was) said at p 169:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Here, Wellcome cannot assert as a fact that the Customs and Excise Department know the names and addresses of infringers. All theycan say is that if the Department went through the tens of thousands of documents dating back to 1 January 1991 in their possession,they might be able to identify some infringers. But, of course, the entire exercise could be in vain, yet that is what the Departmentwould have to do to comply with the judge's order. This, as it seems to me, is no more than a 'fishing request' by Wellcome: not,perhaps, precisely of the nature referred to by Lord Cross in <em>Norwich Pharmacal</em> at p 199D, but equally objectionable; and it would indeed be a 'thin end of the wedge', for once the Department is compelled to complywith Wellcome's request, similar requests by other trade mark owners would be irresistible.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">The law has long distinguished the position of parties to litigation (against whom extensive discovery orders can be made) and thesituation of 'mere witnesses'. As to the latter, the courts have been reluctant to subject them to the compulsive processes of lawunless the interests of justice clearly so demands."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Referring to Kaplan J's orders as the 'third and fourth orders', he spoke of the 'mere witness rule' at p 170:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"You cannot get discovery against someone who has no connection with the litigious matters other than that he might be called as awitness either to testify or to produce documents at the trial.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">That is the fundamental rule. <em>Norwich Pharmacal</em> provides an exception. If Kaplan J's third and fourth orders were to be upheld, this court would have widened the relief availableto would-be plaintiffs against innocent third parties well beyond the scope contemplated in <em>Norwich Pharmacal</em>."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The court unanimously allowed the appeal to discharge Kaplan J's third and fourth orders.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> I come now to deal with Seacliff's applications; first against Decca.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> One can readily understand why the orders at first instance in Wellcome Foundation Limited were held to be oppressive, unreasonableand inappropriate for C &amp; E to have to comply with; furthermore, as Litton JA said, permitting <strong>Norwich Pharmacal</strong> discovery to go that far could open the floodgates.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> But I do not find there is a proper comparison to be made with the facts of this case. Large though the project was and spread asit was over five years, it was not massive; a well-run, well-managed company such as Decca should have the systems in place and theresources and ability to run to earth relevant material without too much difficulty. Commonsense must prevail - Seacliff will beable to do without every piece of paper, as long as there is a proper record for it to examine.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Furthermore, with an exception I shall come to, I do not regard Seacliff's pursuit as a fishing expedition, and no more. It is morethan mere suspicion Seacliff harbours, given the conduct of McNett, the unusual position of Benswick, the relationship with the Chineseregistered companies, the paucity of records and the huge overspend, that there is a major fraud waiting to be uncovered for whichthe assistance of Decca, willingly or by order, is essential. And there can be no downside. Seacliff has formally undertaken to meetthe reasonable costs that compliance will incur.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> However, I do accept that the request at no. 5 of Mr Harris' proposed order needs separate consideration. Seacliff by this part ofthe application seeks disclosure of information about any payments at all made by Decca back to the plaintiff or those various entitiesnamed, on the basis that if there are any at all this itself would highlight a serious irregularity. Whilst conceding that thereis nothing to suggest that Decca, either knowingly or innocently, was a party to such conduct, Mr Harris seeks to justify its inclusionbecause if there were in fact no payments as one would expect, then the answer is a straightforward denial. But if there were thendetails would be essential to uncover the fraud.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> I do not find that justifies the inclusion of this part of the application. There being no indication at all beyond guesswork thatthere were any payments that went the other way - that is from Decca rather than to Decca - I believe that this part of the applicationshould be withheld. But it goes without saying that this should not stop Decca disclosing the same of its own accord if somethinguntoward comes to light during the course of its investigation, for there would be nothing to stop Seacliff from renewing its applicationif such evidence emerges. For the meantime, Seacliff shall be entitled to the orders sought from Decca, at nos. 1 to 4, in termsI leave it to the author to perfect; liberty to apply.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> I come now to the application against Credit Lyonnais.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> This can be shortly stated.
