The reasons are set out in the judgment I delivered.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Mr Martin Rogers, appearing for the respondent, seeks costs against the applicants on an indemnity basis.  This is the primary positionof the respondent.  If the court is not mined to order costs on an indemnity basis, the respondentâs secondary position is thatthe resulting shortfall in his costs should be paid from the assets of the Company.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Mr Whitehead, SC for the applicants does not dispute that they should pay the respondentâs costs but said that this should beon a party and party basis. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Official Receiver seeks an order for costs against the applicants on a party and party basis.  Further, irrespective of thebasis upon which costs are to be awarded, the respondent is not entitled to recover his costs out of the assets of the Company.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  I should first deal with the point raised by the Official Receiver that the respondent is not entitled to be paid the shortfallof his costs out of the assets of the Company, as I am of view that that would have a bearing on the exercise of my discretion whetherto give indemnity costs, despite Mr Whiteheadâs submission to the contrary.  Whether liquidators should be personally left outof pocket with a costs order on the standard basis was regarded as a matter of significance when the court came to consider if indemnitycosts should be awarded in <i>Hill v OâDriscoll</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20HKC%20436" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 HKC 436</a> at 436E, H to I.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Miss Linda Chan for the Official Receiver drew my attention to <i>Alsop Wilkinson v Neary</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20WLR%201220" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 WLR 1220</a> in which Lightman J made a distinction between 3 types of litigation in which trustees might become involved at 1223H to 1224C:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTrustees may be involved in 3 kinds of dispute.  (1) The first (which I shall call âa trust disputeâ) is a dispute as to thetrusts on which they hold the subject matter of the settlement.  This may be âfriendlyâ litigation involving e.g. the true constructionof the trust instrument or some other question arising in the course of the administration of the trust; or âhostileâ litigatione.g. a challenge in whole or in part to the validity of the settlement by the settlor on grounds of undue influence or by a trusteein bankruptcy or a defrauded creditor of the settlor, in which case the claim is that the trustees hold the trust funds as trusteesfor the settlor, the trustee in bankruptcy or creditor in place of or in addition to the beneficiaries specified in the settlement. The line between friendly and hostile litigation, which is relevant as to the incidence of costs, is not always easy to draw: see<i>In re Buckton; Buckton v Buckton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1907%5d%202%20Ch%20406" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1907] 2 Ch. 406.</a>  (2) The second (which I shall call âa beneficiaries disputeâ) is a dispute with one or more of the beneficiaries as to the proprietyof any action which the trustees have taken or omitted to take or may or may not take in the future.  This may take the form of proceedingsby a beneficiary alleging breach of trust by the trustees and seeking removal of the trustees and/or damages for breach of trust. (3) The third (which I shall call âa third party disputeâ) is a dispute with persons, other than in the capacity of beneficiaries,in respect of rights and liabilities e.g. in contract or tort assumed by the trustees as such in the course of administration ofthe trust.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  A similar classification of 3 categories was given in <i>McDonald v Horn</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20All%20ER%20961" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 All ER 961</a> at 970j at 971c, per Hoffmann LJ. </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In a third party dispute, trustees are entitled to be indemnified as to their costs of proceedings properly brought or defended,as they have a duty to protect and preserve the trust estate for the benefit of the beneficiaries and to represent the trust in athird party dispute.  On occasions, trustees would make a <i>Beddoe</i> application to seek the authorisation of the court before they sue or defend, making full disclosure of the strength and weaknessof their case, so as to avoid any argument that they might not be entitled to an indemnity for their costs.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  For a trust dispute, the modern view is that where there is hostile litigation between rival claimants to the trust estate, thetrustee should remain neutral and if he does so, he will have his proper and necessary costs indemnified.  If the trustee shouldtake an active part in litigation, and if he is successful, he may be entitled to costs out of the estate, for he has preserved theinterests of the beneficiaries under the trust.  But if he should lose, he is not entitled to be indemnified for his costs, as thecosts have been incurred in an unsuccessful attempt to prefer one class of beneficiaries to another (see <i>Alsop Wilkinson</i> at 1225C to F).</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In respect of a beneficiaries dispute, this is regarded as ordinary hostile litigation, so costs will follow the event and do notcome out of the trust estate (<i>Alsop Wilkinson</i> at 1224G; <i>McDonald v Horn</i> at 971b)</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  It is not always easy to tell the difference between the 3 situations, as is recognized in <i>McDonald v Horn</i> at 971c.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Miss Chan submitted that this is a beneficiaries dispute.  In making this classification, one should not have regard to the capacityof the party who brought the proceedings against the respondent, but should have regard to the nature of the dispute, whether thisconcerns the administration of the estate of the Company.  Applying this test, she submitted that the costs should not come out ofthe assets of the Company for these reasons:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)            the application was made against the respondent personally;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)            the reliefs sought by the applicants were all directed against the respondent without any reference to the Companyor its assets;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)            the application was not defended by the respondent âin the name or on behalf of the Companyâ (cf. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s199.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 199(1)(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>); and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)            the matters complained of by the applicants all concerned the propriety of the actions taken by the respondent andwere not concerned with the protection or preservation of the estate of the Company.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Miss Chan also relied on O. 62 r. 6(2) of the Rules of the High Court which provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhere a person is or has been a party to any proceedings in the capacity of a trustee, personal representative or mortgagee, heshall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be entitled to the costs of those proceedings, in so far as they are not recovered fromor paid by any other person, out of the fund held by the trustee or personal representative or the mortgaged property, as the casemay be; and the Court may otherwise order only on the ground that the trustee, personal representative or mortgagee has acted unreasonablyor, in the case of a trustee or personal representative, has in substance acted for his own benefit rather than for the benefit ofthe fund.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  She submitted that the respondent has not been a party to these proceedings âin the capacity of a trusteeâ, and that he âhasin substance acted for his own benefit rather than for the benefit of the fundâ.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  It is not in dispute that O. 62 r. 6(2) is not the only situation in which the court may order costs of a trustee to be borne outof the trust estate.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Mr Rogers submitted that this is not a beneficiaries dispute, as neither of the applicants are creditors of the Company nor arethey shareholders, although the entities controlled by the applicants are among the creditors of the Company.  Further, each of thefour grounds relied on by the Official Receiver in the contention that costs should not come out of the assets of the Company wouldapply equally if proceedings were brought against a trustee by an entirely independent party.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Besides, even if this were a beneficiaries dispute, it is not as if under no circumstances would a trustee be entitled to be paidhis costs out of the estate.  Mr Rogers referred me to this passage in <i>Lewin on Trust</i>, 17<sup>th</sup> ed<i>.</i>, para. 21-89:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA beneficiary who unsuccessfully sues trustees for breach of trust will normally be ordered to pay the costs of the trustees. But costs may prove to be irrecoverable from the beneficiary, for example because he is impecunious or legally aided, or the costsrecovered, assessed on the standard basis, may be less than the costs actually incurred by the trustees which would be allowed onthe indemnity basis.  In such cases, the question arises whether the trustees must suffer the burden of their costs personally, sofar as not recovered from the unsuccessful claimant.  Early cases suggest that trustees who successfully defend a claim against themfor breach of trust are entitled to indemnity out of the trust fund in respect of such costs only if it can be shown that their defenceis for the benefit of the trust.  Later cases show that this is too narrow a view and trustees in these circumstances, being guiltyneither of breach of trust nor misconduct, are entitled to such costs by way of indemnity as incident to their administration ofthe trust, though in view of Part 48, rule 48.3 of the Civil Procedure Rules the court may in such a case order an assessment onthe standard rather than indemnity basis.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  So the situation may be the same as in a third party dispute, where a trustee successfully defends a claim of a third party andis entitled to retain out of the trust fund such of the costs which he is unable to recover against a third party with a costs orderon a standard basis (see <i>Lewin</i> at para. 21-45).</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Mr Whitehead has adopted the same position as Mr Rogers in respect of the Official Receiverâs contention.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  I have doubts if the present proceedings could properly be regarded as beneficiaries dispute.  Even if these proceedings were beneficiariesdispute, it seems to me that Miss Chan is taking too narrow a view in submitting that the respondent was acting for his own benefitin resisting the application to commit him for contempt.  The complaints made by the applicants against the respondent were in respectof acts done by him in discharge of his obligations as a liquidator, either to further recovery for the benefit of the creditorsof the Company, or to discharge his duties at common law or under the statute in the wider public interest in the liquidation ofthe Company.  The respondent was sued as an incident of being a liquidator of the Company.  I hold that he is entitled to recoverany shortfall in his costs out of the estate of the Company.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  I turn to consider whether I should award costs on an indemnity basis.  If I should order costs on the standard basis, the shortfallwould be borne by the creditors of the Company.  Is this just and fair in the circumstances?</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  I have cited to me the relevant authorities, <i>Overseas Trust</i> <i>Bank Limited v Coopers and Lybrand (a firm) and Ors.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20HKLR%20177" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 HKLR 177</a> at 182J to 183H and <i>Choy Yee Chun v Bond Star Development Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20HKLRD%201327" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] HKLRD 1327.</a>  It is clear that the circumstances in which an indemnity award might properly be made are not confined to the circumstances suchas those described in <i>Overseas Trust Bank</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The discretion of the court is not to be fettered or circumscribed beyond the requirement that taxation on an indemnity basis mustbe âappropriateâ (<i>Choy Yee Chun</i> at 1335C to E).  I was also reminded by Mr Whitehead that notwithstanding the courtâs discretion is not so confined, there muststill be âspecial and unusual featuresâ (<i>Choy Yee Chun</i> at 1334G) to warrant an award of costs on an indemnity basis.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  I am inclined to think there are such special and unusual circumstances here.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  I do not think these proceedings can be termed ordinary hostile litigation.  This is unlike the situation in <i>Overseas Trust Bank</i> where a third party claim was struck out as oppressive and without foundation in law or fact.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  As pointed out in my judgment on the submission of no case, here an officer of the court is accused of having committed a criminalcontempt of court and not because he has acted in breach of a court order or an undertaking given to the court.  I have found thatthe respondent has no case to answer on all of the complaints.  The proceedings to commit for contempt were shown to be misconceivedand futile, with no reasonable prospects of success.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  It is in my view not relevant that leave was granted on an <i>ex parte</i> application to proceed with the application to commit the respondent for contempt, as the threshold for granting leave is a low one,and the court would only have the submission of one side, notwithstanding the duty to make full disclosure by the applicants.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The applicants have chosen to play at high stakes notwithstanding they are seeking to commit for contempt on a novel situation,where there are serious disputes to say the least on the proper construction of the statutory provisions they relied upon, and inthe face of the principle against doubtful penalisation in contempt proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  It is not fair in the circumstances that the creditors should bear the shortfall in the respondentâs costs.  I note that similarviews were expressed in <i>Hill v OâDriscoll</i> at 436H to I. </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  I am given to understand that the respondent and members of his firm had incurred substantial time in responding to the proceedingsto commit him for contempt.  He would not seek to recover these costs from the assets of the Company except for the disbursements.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  In my judgment, the respondent should not be left personally out of pocket for legal expenses and any shortfall should not be paidout of the assets of the Company at the expense of the creditors.  I rule in favour of the respondent that he should have an orderin respect of his costs against the applicants on an indemnity basis.  This would also cover the costs of the application today.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  As the Official Receiver only seeks a costs order on a party and party basis, I would accede to the application and order coststo be paid by the applicants to the Official Receiver on the standard basis.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Mr Rogers has a further application under O. 62 r. 9A(1)(b) of the Rules of the High Court for an interim payment of costs âforany other reason that the Court in the circumstances the case considers justâ.  The amount sought is in the total sum of HK$1,330,644.84. This is made up of 90% of counselâs fees and 50% of the profit costs of the solicitors.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The application was resisted by Mr Whitehead on the ground that no special circumstances have been shown to justify such an unusualorder; the respondent is in the same position as any other blameless litigant who is successful, and he would be compensated in intereston being kept out of his costs to await the process of taxation.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In my view, the respondent cannot be regarded as being in the same position as any other blameless litigant.  These proceedingswere brought against him in respect of the discharge of his duties as a liquidator.  I have ruled that he should be entitled to costsagainst the applicants on an indemnity basis.  The respondent is not seeking interim payment of the full amount of his costs butonly in respect of part of his costs. </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  I think the circumstances are such as to justify an order for interim payment in the amount sought and I so order.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(S Kwan)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p>                                                                         </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Robert Whitehead, SC, instructed by Barlow, Lyde &amp; Gilbert, for the Applicants</p>        <p>Mr Martin Rogers, of Clifford Chance, for the Respondent</p>        <p>Miss Linda Chan, for the Official Receiver</p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2004/886.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
