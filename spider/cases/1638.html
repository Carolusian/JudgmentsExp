They were (and still are) employed by Messrs Fung, Wong, Ng &amp; Lam.  They bring this actionalleging that they were defamed by the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The letter (dated 14 May 2003) which allegedly contains the libel is a relatively short one (âthe said letterâ).  The relevantparts are set out below:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt happened to me yesterday apart [from] Mr [Wong who] â¦ claimed as the âsurveyorâ, there had also [been] <i>two unknown men</i> said by the âsurveyorâ that they were the âsolicitorsâ also entered into my premises without my permission despite myselfand the management office demanding them to leave for the reason they were unable to provide any of their identity and proof of theirprofession.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I hereby strongly protest that it is totally beyond our previous agreement and now I would also very doubt of [sic] the truthfulnessand correctness of the water seepage investigation report â¦ â.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  According to the statement of claim, the said letter was published to the following individuals:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)    the owners of Flat C, 32<sup>nd</sup> floor of a residential block in Tsuen Wan Centre (â<i>the 32C flat</i>â);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)    the Mr Wong referred to in the said letter (â<i>Wong</i>â), an expert engaged for the purpose of ascertaining the cause of water seepage to the 32C flat;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)    Mr Lee and/or Mr Choi of the management company of Tsuen Wan Centre (â<i>the said manager</i>â);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d)    the plaintiffsâ employer;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(e)    by way of inference, people who have read the said letter when the same was delivered to Mr Lee and/or Mr Choi of the saidmanager.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  If ever liability can be established against the defendant, this is an action which fits the proverb âmaking a mountain out ofa mole hillâ.  However, for reasons set out below, I find that the plaintiffs have failed to establish liability.  This actionis accordingly dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Background Facts</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Almost all the background facts are undisputed and can be summarised as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The defendant is the owner of Flat C, 33<sup>rd</sup> floor, that is, the residential unit directly above the 32C flat (â<i>the defendantâs flat</i>â).  At the relevant time, the plaintiffsâ employer was instructed to act for the owners of the 32C flat.  Water seepage was foundinside the 32C flat.  Suspecting the problem was caused by leakage from the defendantâs flat, an expert (who turned out to be Wong)was engaged to go to the defendantâs flat and find out if that was in fact the case.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Arrangement for an inspection at the defendantâs flat was made.  On 13 May 2003, the date scheduled for inspection, the followingindividuals went to the defendantâs flat:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     the plaintiffs;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     the sister of the owners of the 32C flat;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     Wong;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     Mr Lee and Mr Choi of the said manager.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>When they arrived at the defendantâs flat, the defendant and a Mr Cheng were inside.  Mr Cheng was at that time the occupier ofthe defendantâs flat.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The visiting party knocked on the main door of the defendantâs flat.  After the party was let in, the defendant asked for theidentity of the visitors.  They were introduced to her.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  When the defendant became aware that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was a solicitor, she asked for his name card.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff refused to give her a name card.  She then asked him to leave and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff indicated he would.  In relation to the incident set out in this paragraph, the parties differ as to the precise identityof the speakers as well as the exact words used.  However, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff in effect agreed to the above summary both in his witness statement and when he testified.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Despite the defendantâs request and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs indication, neither plaintiff left the defendantâs flat.  This is partly because, immediately after the above exchangebetween the defendant and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, Wong indicated that the plaintiffs and he were in the same group.  The defendant did not expressly say anything furtherabout the plaintiffsâ presence.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The inspection was completed on the same day and the party left the defendantâs flat.  On the following day, the said letter wassent by the defendant to the individuals named therein, that is: the owners of the 32C flat, Wong, the said manager and the plaintiffsâemployer.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff also tape recorded the visit.  The defendant contends that certain parts of the relevant conversation have not been recordedwhereas the plaintiffs contend otherwise.  Where it is necessary to do so, I will deal with this dispute under the next heading.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings of Fact</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Insofar as there may still be factual disputes and/or a need to make findings of fact, I find the following to be the facts.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The plaintiffs, together with the sister of the owners of the 32C flat, Wong and Mr Lee and Mr Choi of the said manager, went tothe defendantâs flat on 13 May 2003.  Very shortly after the plaintiffs (and the others) were allowed into the defendantâs flat,the defendant asked for their identity whereupon they informed the defendant they were solicitors acting for the owners of the 32Cflat (it was not expressly mentioned in the tape recording that the plaintiffs were acting for the owner of 32C flat but, judgingfrom the whole context, that must have been what they meant when they told the defendant they were solicitors).</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  I note that the tape recording does not record any conversation concerning the identity of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, or that the defendant asked for proof of identity (especially name card) from him.  However, in view that the said letterspecifically referred to âtwo unknown menâ, the defendant must have known that the inspection was attended by the plaintiffs(together with the other people referred to above).  It is more probable she would have required the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff to identify himself (as she did with regard to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff).  Further, Mr Cheng (the occupier of the defendantâs flat) and Mr Choi of the said manager testified that she had doneso.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Thirdly, the tape recording does not record any conversation about the defendant asking either plaintiff to leave.  However, dueto the reasons set out below, I find that she has in fact done so.  In relation to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, it is accepted by the plaintiffs that the tape recording shows that either Mr Lee or Mr Choi indicated to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff (on the defendantâs behalf) he should leave if he refused to show his name card to the defendant.  Both Mr Cheng (theoccupier of the defendantâs flat) and Mr Choi testified that the defendant had asked the plaintiffs to leave.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Mr Choiâs testimony is supported by a letter dated 26 May 2003 from the said manager.  This letter was written and sent a fewdays after the commencement of this action (on 23 May 2003).  There is no suggestion that the said manager was aware of this actionat the time, or that this letter was written by the said manager with this action in mind.  In addition, Mr Choi testified that thisletterâs content is the same as a report he compiled (on the same day as the inspection).  According to Mr Choi, that report wascompiled purely for the records of the said manager.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  In the circumstances set out above, although the plaintiffs have already entered the defendantâs flat, in view of the short timelapse between their entry and the defendantâs indication that they should leave, I find as a fact that their entry was withoutthe defendantâs permission.  It is unclear if their subsequent stay inside the defendantâs flat was with the defendantâs consentor not.  It is probable that the defendant did not persist in her objection to their continued presence due to the intervention ofWong and Wongâs indication that the plaintiffs and he belonged to the same group (this will be discussed further below).</p>    <p class="heading">Reference to the Plaintiffs</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  An ordinary reader of the said letter, if he had not been informed of the above background or this action, would not have knownthe said letter referred to the plaintiffs.  This is because the said letter merely referred to âtwo unknown men said by the âsurveyorâthat they were the âsolicitorsâ â¦ â.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Of the individuals specifically named in the statement of claim as the recipients of the said letter:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     Wong and Mr Lee and Mr Choi of the said manager should know that the said letter refers to the plaintiffs because they werepresent at the time of the inspection;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)    the owners of the 32C flat should know that it refers to the plaintiffs because it is more likely than not the owners wouldbe informed of what transpired during the inspection afterwards;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)     the plaintiffsâ employer should know that it refers to the plaintiffs because it is more likely than not the plaintiffsâemployer would know the plaintiffs also attended the inspection and what transpired during that time.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  I note that the plaintiffs argue that the defendant has admitted the said letter referred to the plaintiffs.  Subject to what Isaid in the preceding paragraph, and in view of the denial at para. 12 of the defence, I disagree with this argument.</p>    <p class="heading">Extent of Publication of the said Letter</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The publication of the said letter to the owners of the 32C flat, Wong, Mr Lee and Mr Choi of the said manager and the plaintiffsâemployer appears to be undisputed.  Insofar as it may be necessary to do so, I find the above publication has been proven.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  There is however no evidence relating to its publication to people who have read the said letter when the same was delivered toMr Lee and/or Mr Choi of the said manager (see para. 3(e) above).  For example, there is no evidence about:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     whether the said letter was contained in an envelope;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)    if so, whether the said letter was addressed to Mr Lee and/or Mr Choi only;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)     whether the defendant otherwise intended the said letter to be read by other staff of the said manager.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The related evidence is too scanty for any inference to be properly drawn.  Accordingly, I am not satisfied that it has been proventhe said letter has been published to the people referred to in para. 3(e) above.</p>    <p class="heading">Meaning of the said Letter</p>    <p><b>(a)</b>  <b><u>Pleading</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Para. 20, statement of claim avers:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn their natural and ordinary meaning the said words .. meant and were understood to mean:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">a.    the Plaintiffs were the sort of individuals who might be suspected to have been guilty of knowingly failed and/or refused todisclose their identities to the Defendant upon entering into [the defendantâs flat] in the course of carrying out their dutiesas legal representatives for [the owners of the 32C flat];</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">b.    the Plaintiffs were the sort of individuals who might be suspected to have been guilty of knowingly entered into and stayedon [the defendantâs flat] without the permission of the Defendant;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">c.    the Plaintiffs were the sort of individuals who might be suspected to have been guilty of knowingly failed and/or refused toleave [the defendantâs flat] upon the demands of the Defendant and the staff from the [said manager of ] Tsuen Wan Centre â¦ ;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">d.    the Plaintiffs were the sort of individuals who might be suspected to have been guilty of knowingly behaved in a disorderlymanner in refusing to leave after requests were made by the staff from the [said manager of ] Tsuen Wan Centre â¦;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">e.    the Plaintiffs were the sort of individuals who might be suspected to have been guilty of knowingly holding out themselves assolicitors without the necessary professional qualificationâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Further, para. 21, statement of claim pleads other meanings by way of innuendo.  It reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ by way of innuendo the said words meant and were understood to mean:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">a.    the Plaintiffs were lacking in the professional and ethical standards required of and expected of a solicitor or a trainee solicitor;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">b.    the Plaintiffs had acted unethically, unprofessionally and unlawfully;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">c.    the Plaintiffs were unfit to practise as solicitor or trainee solicitor; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">d.    the Plaintiffs were unfit for their profession owing to the lack of knowledge, disreputable conduct or misconductâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In relation to innuendo, <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i> (2004) 10<sup>th</sup> Ed. said this:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the claimant must not only identify in his particulars of claim the defamatory meaning which he contends the words convey â¦but also identify the relevant extrinsic facts â¦ â (para. 3.18).</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This is because innuendo involves:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ defamatory meaning [which] only arises because of extrinsic facts which are known to the recipients â¦ â (para. 3.18).</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(the above passages in <i>Gatley</i> are not among the authorities relied on by the plaintiffs).  The above requirement is also set out in RHC Ord. 82 r. 3(1):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhere in an action for libel or slander the plaintiff alleges that the words or matters complained of were used in a defamatorysense <b><i>other than their ordinary meaning</i></b>, he must give particulars of the <b><i>facts and matters on which he relies</i></b> in support of such senseâ (emphasis supplied).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  On the other hand, 25 <i>Halsburyâs Laws of Hong Kong</i> (2000) 380.517 states:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe defamatory meaning averred to in the pleadings is to be treated at the trial as the most injurious meaning which the wordswere capable of bearing.  The plaintiff will be estopped from contending that the words bore a more injurious meaning â¦ The lessermeaning has to be in the same class or range as the meaning pleaded and not some wholly different meaningâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The above passage corresponds to the modern practice of requiring plaintiffs to set out in their particulars of claim the defamatorymeaning or meanings which they claim were borne by the words complained of: <i>Gatley</i>, para. 26.20 to 26.24 (these passages are not relied upon by the plaintiffs).</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  As can be seen from the quote above, para. 21, statement of claim does not plead any facts or matters in support of the innuendo. Nor have the other parts of the statement of claim set out the defamatory meaning(s).  When queried by the court about this, theplaintiffs clarified that they are not relying on innuendo, and para. 21, statement of claim should be treated as an averment settingout the defamatory meanings of the said letter.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Thus, the court will approach this aspect based on the plaintiffsâ said clarification regarding their pleading.</p>    <p><b>(b)  <u>âStingâ of the Defamation</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In determining this aspect, the following principles have been taken into account.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  âFor the purposes of the law of defamation, the fact that the same words can mean different things to different people is ignored;the court seeks to determine and act upon the one and only meaning that the readers as reasonable persons should have collectivelyunderstood the words to bear; this is the natural and ordinary meaningâ: <i>Hong Kong Halsbury</i>, para. 380.517.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Where defamation actions are tried by a single judge, it would be carrying artificiality too far to require the judge to arriveat the single ârightâ meaning by distinguishing between meanings which the words were capable of bearing and then choosing theârightâ one: <i>Next Magazine Publishing Ltd. v.

For the purpose of this action, I will adopt the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âa statement is defamatory if it tends to harm the reputation of another so as to lower him or her in the estimation of the communityor to deter third parties from associating or dealing with him or herâ: American Second Restatement of Torts quoted in <i>Gatley</i>, para. 2.1.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The law looks only to whether an imputation has a tendency of injuring a personâs reputation.  A cause of action still lies evenif the words were not believed by the audience (unless they were totally beyond belief): <i>Gatley</i>, para. 2.1.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The said letter advances basically 3 propositions:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     ââ¦ two unknown men said by the âsurveyorâ that they were the âsolicitorsâ â¦ â and âthey were unable to provideany of their identity and proof of their professionâ (â<i>âthe failure to disclose identity proofâ proposition</i>â);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     ââ¦ [the two unknown men] â¦ entered into my premises without my permission despite myself and the management office demandingthem to leave â¦ â (â<i>âthe unauthorised entryâ proposition</i>â);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     ââ¦ it is totally beyond our previous agreement â¦ â.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In the context of what happened on 13 May 2003, the last-mentioned proposition must have been about the presence of the plaintiffsânot being part of the agreed arrangement.  Because of the averments set out in para. 20, statement of claim, this cannot be any ofthe matters relied upon in support of the defamatory meanings contended for in para. 21, statement of claim.  For this reason, Ido not consider the last-mentioned proposition to be relevant to whether the said letter bears a defamatory meaning.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  I do not consider âthe failure to disclose identity proofâ proposition to bear any defamatory meaning.  The ordinary reader,even if he should assume that the âtwo unknown menâ were in fact qualified solicitors, would not consider their reputation tohave been harmed ââ¦so as to lower [them] â¦ in the estimation of the community or to deter third parties from associating ordealing with [them]â.  âThe failure to disclose identity proofâ proposition merely states that two unknown men:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)    were described by a third party to be (or referred to by a third party as) solicitors; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)    did not prove that description or reference (whether the failure was the result of inability or refusal is immaterial in presentcontext).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  It should be noted the said letter does not state the two unknown men were in fact solicitors.  Further, no innuendo has been reliedupon (the plea of innuendo at para. 21, statement of claim was in effect abandoned at trial).  In any event, no particulars havebeen given in support of the plea.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  I do not find that âthe unauthorised entryâ proposition to bear a defamatory meaning either.  Its natural and ordinary meaningis: two unknown men entered the defendantâs flat without the defendantâs permission and refused to leave when being asked todo so.  The most injurious meaning is that those men were described as trespassers and in that sense were said to be acting unlawfully. To this extent, the defamatory meaning pleaded at para. 21b, statement of claim is established.  I do not consider the said letterto bear any of the other defamatory meanings set out at para. 21, statement of claim.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  It is usually defamatory to impute the commission of a criminal offence: <i>Gatley</i>, para. 2.17 (not relied upon by the plaintiffs).  But the imputation of a criminal offence or conviction in very minor cases is notdefamatory.  Examples given were a parking offence or a minor offence of speeding: <i>Groom v Crocker</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%203%20ALL%20ER%20844" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] 3 ALL ER 844</a>, 848 (not relied upon by the plaintiffs).  I consider the same reasoning to be applicable to an accusation of a minor tortuous actsuch as the âunauthorised entryâ proposition.</p>    <p class="heading">Defence</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Para. 12, defence expressly refers to the defence of justification and honest comment (see <i>Cheng v. Tse Wai Chun</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282000%29%20HKCFAR%20339" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2000) HKCFAR 339</a> and <i>Gatley</i>, para. 12.24.  Neither of these are relied on by the plaintiffs).</p>    <p><b>(a)  <u>Justification</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  I have concluded that nothing in the said letter bears a defamatory meaning.  I shall discuss this aspect assuming, somehow, âtheunauthorised entryâ proposition is defamatory in the sense set out in para. 41 above.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  What the defendant needs to justify is the âstingâ of the defamation.  She does not need to prove each and every word is true:<i>Hong Kong Halsbury</i>, para. 380.550 and <i>Gatley</i>, para. 11.8 to 11.10 (<i>Gatley</i> is not relied upon by the plaintiffs).</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  In view of the findings of fact, I consider the defendant has successfully established this defence.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The plaintiffs also rely on the defendant not persisting in her objection to their continued presence after Wong has indicated theyalso belonged to the same group.  Because of this, they argue âthe unauthorised entryâ proposition cannot be true.  I do notagree.  First, the defendant (both herself and through the said manager) has made it abundantly clear the plaintiffs should leave. Secondly, the plaintiffs (and in relation to this matter, I infer the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff would follow the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs action) also indicated they would leave.  That the plaintiffs should later decide to stay on is a different matteraltogether.  The said letter does not assert that the plaintiffs continued to stay in the defendantâs flat without permission.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  I have concluded âthe failure to disclose identity proofâ proposition is not defamatory.  Even if it were defamatory, I wouldhave found that it is true.  In relation to this matter, whether the plaintiffsâ failure was a result of refusal or inability isirrelevant.</p>    <p><b>(b)  <u>Honest Comments</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  By virtue of the above, it is unnecessary to consider whether the defence of honest comments has been established by the defendant.</p>    <p><b>(c)  <u>Qualified Privilege</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The defence has not pleaded the defence of qualified privilege.  In the course of the plaintiffsâ opening speech, I indicatedthat the following passages in <i>Gatley</i> may be relevant to this defence if it had been relied upon by the defendant:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     para. 14.33: volunteered communications regarding employeesâ character;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)     para. 14.43: common and reciprocal interests;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)     para. 14.46: other common interests;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d)     para. 14.54: redress of grievances;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(e)     para. 14.57 to 14.60: complaints against public officers, persons in authority or with responsibilities towards the public.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  It is unnecessary to consider if in fact this defence can be established.  The plaintiffs assert that the said letter was publishedwith malice (see para. 24, statement of claim).  If it had been necessary to make a finding, I do not find any sufficient basis forconcluding that there was actual malice on the defendantâs part.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  By virtue of the above matters, as state above, this action is dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Other Matters</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The defendant acts in person and, understandably, she offers practically no assistance to the court with regard to the legal aspectof this action.  Plaintiffsâ counsel, on the other hand, has referred to a number of authorities.  Unless otherwise stated, thelegal principles quoted above are taken from the authorities provided by the plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  I mentioned at the beginning of this judgment the triviality of the subject-matter of this action.  The plaintiffs, being solicitors,should know better than anyone else that judicial resources are scarce and expensive.  They should know that judicial resources shouldbe spent on more worthy causes than this action.  Even if they had been able to establish their claim, the quantum which may be awardedis likely to be very small (or may even be nominal) taking into account the nature of the article and the extent of publication. In any event, the quantum should be nowhere near $1 million (for the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff) and $700,000 (for the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff) as the plaintiffs claim in their opening speech.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Finally, I must observe that the plaintiffsâ conduct in refusing to leave the defendantâs flat when being asked to do so isfar from what one would reasonably expect of an educated person (let alone a qualified professional).</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff explained in his testimony why he did not want to give his name card to the defendant.  From the tape recorded conversation,it is obvious the defendant was more concerned with seeing some proof of identity than obtaining the name card.  I do not understandwhy the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff did not suggest to the defendant that he could show her his Law Society membership card as proof of identity instead.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs Order Nisi</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  There is no apparent reason to depart from the usual rule that costs should follow the event.  There will accordingly be a costsorder <i>nisi</i> pursuant to Ord 42 r 5B(6) that the costs of this action be paid by the plaintiffs to the defendant, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Andrew Chung)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Simon Lam, instructed by Messrs Fung, Wong, Ng &amp; Lam, for the Plaintiffs</p>        <p>Defendant acts in person and present</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p><appeal><p>1st Plaintiff's appeal to Court Appeal dismissed.
