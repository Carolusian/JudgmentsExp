For the present purpose, its <i>modus operandi</i> may be put shortly as follows.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant maintains a running account with the casino ship for gambling chips.  The gambler will be introduced to the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant by a âjunket leaderâ.  Deposit will be made by or on behalf of the gambler into the bank account of the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, and chips will be given to the gambler on board out of the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendantâs account with the casino.  At the end of the day, the chips will be counted, and the winnings or losses will be reckonedas between the gambler and the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, and in turn between the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant and its casino.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> On 24 December 2003, the plaintiff received a transfer instruction by fax purportedly form State Street Global Advisors in Sydney,operator for the account of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, Australia, to transfer, <i>inter alia</i>, HK$175 million into the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendantâs bank account with HSBC in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> It transpired that the instruction fax was a fraud.

The upshotwas that the gambler was given chips by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant and he lost HK$19.7 million.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant was liable to the casino for the sum on the running account.  As the plaintiff had made the claim for restitution, the3<sup>rd</sup> defendant had returned HK$175 million less HK$19.7 million.

It has never been suggested that, in the case of a mistake of fact, hecould not recover if everyone would probably have shared the same false belief.

Their Lordships find themselves to be in agreement with Professor Peter Birks who, in his articlealready cited on âChange of Position and Surviving Enrichmentâ at p41, rejected the adoption of the criterion of relative faultin forthright language.  In particular he stated (citing Thomas v Houston Corbett &amp; Co  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%20NZLR%20151" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] NZLR 151)</a> that the New Zealand courts have shown how hopelessly unstable the defence (of change of position) becomes when it is used to reflectrelative fault.

If I may encapsulatethem, striking out should only be done in plain and obvious cases, there should be no trial upon affidavit.  Disputed facts are tobe taken in favour of the party sought to be struck out.  The claim must be obviously unsustainable, the pleadings unarguably badand that it be impossible, not just improbable, for the case to succeed before a court will strike out.  If the court does not thinkthe matter to be clear beyond doubt or if it fails to be satisfied that there is no reasonable cause of action or that the proceedingsare frivolous or vexatious, then, there should be no striking out.  One must be careful not to drive a plaintiff from the judgmentseat nor should the court decide difficult points of law in proceedings such as this.â</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Miss Wee submitted that where there is an area of law which is developing, <i>a fortiori</i>, the court should be slow to strike out the pleading.  She referred to <i>Malayan Banking Berhad v. China Insurance Co. Ltd</i>, CACV424/2002 (12 November 2003), para.11 where Wo JA (as he then was) cited <i>Lonrho Plc v.

The methodology of English law is to decide cases not by a process ofa priori reasoning from general principle but by deciding each case on a case-by-case basis from which, in due course, principlesmay emerge.  Therefore, in a new and developing field of law it is often inappropriate to determine points of law on the assumed,and scanty, facts pleaded in the statement of claim.â</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Under the present law, in order to make out the defence to restitution of <i>bona fide</i> purchase and change in position, it is not necessary for the defendant to prove negligence on the part of the plaintiff.  If thedefendant relied on the fact of the payment which resulted in a change of position in circumstances that he is not to be affixedwith any knowledge to make it unconscionable to retain the money, the defence is made out. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> In <i>Lipkin Gorman</i>, Lord Goff noted that there was a remarkable unanimity of view, the consensus being to the effect that the defence of change of positionshould be recognized in English Law.  However, it is far from being the case in respect of relative fault.   In <i>Dextra Bank</i>, their Lordships recognized the strength of <i>Kelly v. Solari</i>, and the uncertainty in the law the examination of relative fault may bring.  Both Grubb and Burrows also recognized the realityof the rejection of the relevance of relative fault given the decision in <i>Dextra Bank.</i>  Unlike New Zealand, there is no statue providing for apportionment in restitution for contributory negligence or relative faultin Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> In the premises, I hold that negligence on the part of the plaintiff is not relevant to the recovery by the plaintiff, and thereis no real prospect of success in the defendantâs argument of relative fault in the defence of change of position.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Late application</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Miss Wee pointed out that the plaintiff has obtained a <i>Mareva</i> injunction against the HK$19.7 million for 20 months, the pleadings have long been closed, and the plaintiffâs application to strikeout is very late in the day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Mr Chua pointed out that the issue of negligence on the part of the plaintiff is not addressed by the plaintiffâs witnesses, noris the issue of suspicion of money laundering dealt with by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendantâs witnesses notwithstanding the earlier mention in affidavits.
