Ocean Land Development Limited is a public company which was incorporated in Hung Kong inAugust 1972. Under the Articles one of the circumstances in which the office of a director is vacated is if he is requested in writingby all his co-directors to resign. At about 10 o'clock in the morning of the 15th May 1982, Mr. Samuel Tak Lee, who had been on theHeard of directors since the incorporation of the Company, received a notification dated 12th May signed by all seven of his co-directorsrequesting Trim to resign his office. Mr. Lee immediately sought legal advice, and some time in the afternoon o_Â° the 15th May issueda writ against the remaining seven directors, with the Company as the 8th defendant. The Writ was endorsed with claim for declarationsthat the notice requesting his resignation under the Articles was null and void and consequently he remained a director of the company.Further declarations and orders were sought based on the principal claim for relief.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> On an ex - parte summons heard by the Chief Justice at his home in the early evening of the 15th May, the plaintiff obtained variousinjunctions against all the defendants and the return date for the hearing of the inter - partes summons for interim relief was Fixedas the 19th May. On that date the defendants tonic out summonses under 0.18 r.19 applying for orders that the Writ be struck out,and the action be dismissed, on the grounds that the action had beer irregularly constituted; the Writ disclosed no reasonable courseof action; and the action was frivolous, vexatious and otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court. Counsel representing the partiesagreed that I should deal with the 0.18 r.19 summons first, and after a hearing which tuck just over one day, I granted the applicationand ordered the endorsement on the Writ to be struck out and the action dismissed, giving brief oral reasons so that Counsel whohad to return to the United Kingdom could give their clients the benefit of their advice before they left Hong Kong. I promised togive more detailed reasons in writing later. I now do so.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The plaintiff is at present the registered holder of 248,000 shares in the Company. The 1st defendant, who is Chairman and ManagingDirector, has a 20% holding, as has the 2nd defendant: The 6th defendant owns 600,000 share. The Articles do not require a directorto be a shareholder. They contain common form provisions relating to the rotation of directors, variations in the number of directorsand the circumstances in which alternate directors can be appointed. Article 85 provides that the Company may remove a director byan ordinary resolution before the expiration of his period of office and by the same method appoint another person in his stead.As 'regards disqualification, Article '73 is in the following terms -</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="14%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="12%" valign="top">                <p align="justify" class="quote">"73.</p>            </td>            <td width="74%" valign="top" class="quote">                The Office of an Ordinary Director shall be vacated                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="1%" valign="top" class="quote">                <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">(a)</p>            </td>            <td width="108%" valign="top" class="quote">                If he becomes bankrupt insolvent or compounds with his creditors;                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="1%" valign="top" class="quote">                <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">(b)</p>            </td>            <td width="108%" valign="top" class="quote">                <p align="justify" class="quote">If he becomes of unsound mind;</p>                <p align="justify" class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%" style="text-align:center" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="1%" valign="top" style="text-align:center" class="quote">(c)</td>            <td width="108%" valign="top" class="quote">                If he be convicted of an indictable offence;                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%" style="text-align:center" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="1%" valign="top" style="text-align:center" class="quote">(d)</td>            <td width="108%" valign="top" class="quote">                <p align="justify" class="quote">If he is requested in writing by all his co-directors to resign;</p>                <p align="justify" class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%" style="text-align:center" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="1%" valign="top" style="text-align:center" class="quote">(e)</td>            <td width="108%" valign="top" class="quote">                <p align="justify" class="quote">If he becomes prohibited from being a Director by reason of any order made under Section 223 0: 275 of the Ordinance;</p>                <p align="justify" class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%" style="text-align:center" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="1%" valign="top" style="text-align:center" class="quote">(f)</td>            <td width="108%" valign="top" class="quote">                If he gives the Company one month's-notice-in writing that he resigns his office.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"> </p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">But any act done in good faith by a Director whose office is vacated as aforesaid shall be valid unless, prior to the doing of suchact, written notice shall have been served upon the " Company or an entry shall have been made in the Directors Minute Book statingthat such Director has ceased to be a Director of the Company."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> It is common ground that the plaintiff did receive a document, dated the 12th May 1982, signed by all the directors who are the 1stto the 7th defendants. This notice is addressed to Mr. Lee and is as follows: -</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="16%" valign="top" class="quote">"</td>            <td width="74%" valign="top" class="quote">                Re: Ocean-Land Development Ltd.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="90%" colspan="2" valign="top" class="quote">                We, the undersigned, being all the Co-Directors of the above company hereby give you notice that you are requestedto resign your office as a Director of the company with effect from the date of this notice. This notice is issued pursuant to Article73(D) of the Memorandum and Articles of Ocean-Land Development Ltd which states that the office shall be vacated if a Director isrequested in writing by all his Co-Directors to resign.                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">Yours faithfully,             "</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Counsel appearing before me acknowledged that provisions identical to Article 73(d) were by no      means uncommon in Hong Kong whatevermight be the position in the United Kingdom. Mr. Richard Scott, on behalf of five of the directors and the Company (Mr. Charles Chingadopted Mr. Scott's arguments for the two directors he represented), submitted that if any of the six events expressed in Article73 occurred then, ipso facto, the office of the director concerned was vacated. The language was clear and as a matter of construction,the only inquiry that could be made was to determine whether or not a particular event set out in the Article had, in fact, happened.Mr. Scott suggested that this was a perfectly sensible provision and the formula adopted was a necessary way of framing the Articleto achieve .the result aimed at so that the Board could know who was, and who was not, a director at any given moment. The matterwas not capable of challenge; litigation might take many months and during all .t hat time there would be uncertainty as to the positionof the director who sought to deny the express words of the Article. All the leading text books without exception accepted the lawto be that upon the happening of any of the specified events which lead to disqualification of a director, his office is ipso factovacated, as demonstrated by <u>Re Bodega Co.,</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1904%5d%201%20Ch%20276" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1904] 1 Ch. 276.</a> Of course, a director whose office was so vacated could be re-elected provided the grounds for his disqualification did not continueto subsist.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Mr. Scott anticipated Mr. Goldblatt's contentions (that this was the exercise of a power by the directors and therefore it had tobe shown that they had acted bona fide in .the interests of the Company) and submitted that even if-one were able to describe therequest to resign as the exercise of a power, that did not change the character of the article. He pointed out that it was plainthat even on the plaintiff s own case the facts had been accepted, and therefore the office of his directorship had been vacated.If this argument did not find favour with the Court, he submitted that in a case where there was an all eyed breach of duty by adirector, the duty was-awed not to the shareholders, not to fellow directors, but to the Company and so .the proper plaintiff wasthe Company any. This basic principle had been re-stated in <u>Prudential Assurance</u> v. <u>Newman (No.2)</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%202%20WLR%2031" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 2 W.L.R. 31.</a> The instant case was not a minority shareholders action but a personal action brought by the plaintiff, and if he were right in sayingthat when they signed the notice his co-directors were not acting in the interests of the Company, then the proceedings were plainlyimproperly constituted and wholly misconceived.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Mr. Goldblatt, for the plaintiff, characterised Mr. Scott's contentions as plausible but wrong. He contended that it would be highlydangerous to treat the present application as if it were a hearing on a preliminary point of law which had not been pleaded and couldnot properly be argued out. He accepted that the Court could look at the affidavits filed in relation to the interlocutory reliefsthat had been sought, but submitted that this was not a plain and obvious ease for the plaintiff had a serious case to argue. Heargued that the directors had clearly been exercising a power when they had sent their request in writing to the plaintiff to resignhis office. What, he asked, were the directors doing if they were not exercising a power? That being so, each director was requiredto carry out his fiduciary duties to the Company and he must therefore have acted in good faith in its best interests. The law couldnot permit the request to resign to be treated as valid if the directors had acted not in good faith but for their own private interests,in defiance and in fraud of the Company's interests. If the document was bad in law, then the event which was said to have causedthe office as director of the plaintiff to be vacated had not happened.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> There was, Mr. Goldblatt argued, a presumption that every power of the directors (including that far which provision is mad? in Article73(d)) had to be applied in the interests of-the Company unless that presumption was totally inconsistent with the language used.If the Article had been employed as part of a fraudulent design, surely, he contended, in such circumstances a director who was aggrievedhad a personal remedy. He put his argument another way - if the power was exercised in bad faith, then the piece of paper on whichthe resignation was called for 'was not a Company document and had no effect. Mr. Goldblatt suggested that the Court had to ask itselfwhether the other directors had succeeded in silencing a director who was asking too many questions. The mere coming into existenceof the document was not enough for it had to come into existence bona Fide. Were this not the position, there would be a great temptationto directors to abuse powers such as those given by Article 73(d) and would, he argued, be tantamount to a licence to commit Fraudby getting rid of the one man who stood in the way. Why should the plaintiff pursue other remedies that he might have and not proceedwith his personal action to uphold his status as a director? It was merely fortuitous that he happened also to be a shareholder.The position of a director who did not own shares in the Company had to be borne in mind. Mr. Goldblatt contended that if the Courtwere to construe the Article so 'that the Company could be cheated, as a matter oï¿¡ public policy, great mischief would result.He summarised the plaintiff s case as being in essence an argument that if the defendants act had not been done bona fide, then itwas done without jurisdiction and, as would be the case if a Court acted without jurisdiction, what was done would be a nullity.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The principles upon which a Court may properly eicercise its discretionary power to strike out a pleading (or an endorsement on aWrit) under 0.18 r.19 are too well known to require setting out. Of course, it is a power and must be sparingly exercised and onlyin "plain and obvious cases. It is a serious matter indeed to close the doors of the Court in the face of a plaintiff before hiscomplaints are heard out on their merits.' On the other hand, I think the principle is equally clear that the Court must not refrainfrom exercising this salutary power if a claim as formulated and which no reasonable amendment can poi in order) is doomed to failure.The interests of justice so demand because the defendants should not be subjected to unnecessary anxiety and expense. Since my decisionin effect involves the construction of a document, clearly it would be wrong to strike out the endorsement if the language to beconstrued was reasonably open to more than one interpretation, for it is well established that the hearing of a summons under 0.18r.19 is not the proper occasion to go into complicated and difficult points of law.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> It need hardly be said that a company is entitled to adopt any provisions it considers desirable in its Articles to regulate itsinternal administration. This, of course, is subject to any overriding provisions of applicable Companies legislation and the generalprinciples of Company law laid down in the oases. It must be said that the legislature has not been slow to intervene in the Companylaw area. I do not think it is open to a Court to say that, this provision or that provision should not have appeared in the Articles,and refuse to apply it If clear and unequivocal language is used, language which is capable of only one meaning, then in mg judgmentthe Court is bound to give effect to the provisions of an Article however harsh the results might be.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> It may perhaps be said that paragraph (d) of Article 73 Lies somewhat uncomfortably with the specific events set out in the otherparagraphs, but the paragraph is firmly placed within the paramenters of a provision which stipulates when the office of a directorshall be vacated. It is to be noted that paragraph (d) does not say, as it may well have said, that the request to resign must onlybe made on reasonable grounds, nor does the paragraph require (as does, for example, s.184 of the United Kingdom Companies Act) thatthe director whose removal is contemplated is to be given an opportunity to make representations. There will be cases, and therehave been cases, where a Court is called upon to adjudicate on facts to determine whether ox not a specified event leading to disqualificationhas occurred, but here it has beer expressly accepted that all the directors presently in office have subscribed their signaturesto a paper in writing requesting the plaintiff's resignation as a director. One can imagine circumstances which do not obtain here,in which the issue might be whether or not a director had the mental capacity to sign his name, or whether he knew what he was signingand, indeed, whether his signature was obtained by fraud. In the instant case, once it is acknowledged that the document compliedwith the provisions oï¿¡ Article 73(d); I do not think it could reasonably be argued, with the utmost respect to Mr. Goldblatt'sarguments, that the Court is free to permit the directors who made the request to be examined as to their motives or reasons fortaking the course that they did. No cases have been Found directly in point, but in my view the ordinary principle that directorsmust exercise their powers bona fide .in what they believe to be in the interests of the Company cannot be prayed in aid to investigatethe deliberations of .the directors which led to the making of their decision.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> If the plaintiff were able to allege fraud he will, no doubt, have a personal action in tort, but nothing of the kind has been allegedhere. One has only to look at the plaintiff's first affidavit to see how slender and uncertain is the basis upon which he alleges(para, 20) that "the notice cannot have been signed by the several personal defendants each acting bona fide in what he believesto be the best interests of Ocean Land". In paragraph 21, he says that the lst defendant's motives are clear and "he wants to gagme". He also suggests, after stating certain facts, that the matters which prompted the lst defendant to act are likely to effectthe 2nd defendant too. He says, in respect of the 2nd defendant, "He has his own reason to gag me. He is acting in bad faith", (para.22), As regards the 3rd defendant (para. 23) he states certain facts after which he says "His natural instinct would be to support'the 1st defendant and to believe whatever he was told by him." That defendant might for all he knew not have recovered from an illnessof which he learned during a telephone conversation. He adds "It is clear that he has not exercised an independent judgment in signingthe notice and he has totally lest sight of 'the point that, before asking a fellow director to leave, you should hear what he hasto say, As regards the 4th defendant (para. 24) he speaks of a quarrel last year and adds "He would be glad, of an opportunity todo me doom". He describes the 5th defendant as " the 1st plaintiff's man", for he and his immediate family owed their whole livelihoodto him "And he would not dare to stand oat against a request or direction by Mr. Chou to sign the notice" (para. 25). I do not wishto be unkind to the plaintiff but on the material before me 1 have to say that it seems that he has allowed his suspicions to lethypothesis turn in his mind into fact. I do not need here to consider how far the plaintiff might have disobeyed the rules relatingto the proper contents of affidavits.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> I am bound to say that by the endorsement on his Writ, the plaintiff is claiming declarations that in my jugement no Court could,on tae facts he himself has accepted, grant him. It seems to me, too, that all the other reliefs owe so much to the principal reliefsthat he claims that they cannot possibly stand alone. It was for all these reasons that I concluded that as presently formulatedthe endorsement on the plaintiff's Writ was, in the terms of the Order, "Frivolous and vexatious". The plaintiff might well havea number of other equitable, common law or statutory remedies but I was firmly of the opinion that as presently conceived and putforward he did not have a grievance which he was entitled to bring before the Court.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(K.T.
