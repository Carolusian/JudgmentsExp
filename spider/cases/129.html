It followed that, if liability were to be excluded, it must be on the basis of some factor other than remoteness,or the mere fact that the Commissioner was a public official, or the mere fact that the loss was economic. It should be excludedon the basis that the damage alleged was not of a kind for which the Commissioner should be required to pay compensation. It wouldnot hinder the proper development of the law to deny any general rule of exclusion of pecuniary loss caused by negligence but todraw a line against allowing claims for such loss in cases where the loss had resulted as much from the plaintiff's own commercialmisjudgment as from the defendant's failure to take action which was open to him in the performance of his public duties.</p>                <p align="justify"> </p>                <p align="justify"><u>Per Fuad, J.A.</u>: As a matter of law, a statutory authority could not be held liable in negligence for economic loss suffered by another as a resultof the failure of a third party to meet his contractual obligations in a financial or commercial transaction, even if it could beshown that the authority had failed to perform statutory functions whose objects were to prevent or mitigate that type of loss.</p>                <p align="justify"> </p>                <p align="justify"><u>Per Kempster, J.A.</u>: Where a plaintiff was shown, by the application of the neighbour principle, to be so closely proximate to the defendant that thedefendant must have realised that the plaintiff relied or would rely upon his knowledge or skill in relation to tangible and physicalproperty, the plaintiff could recover economic loss which, by reason of the defendant's failure to use such knowledge or skill andof consequent defect in the property, he had suffered. Applying that proposition to the supposed facts; to the provisions and effectof the Ordinance, and to the agreed question", the test of proximity failed because no knowledge or skill in relation to tangibleand physical property had been relied upon.   The Commissioner would, were the supposed facts established, not be held to have owedthe plaintiffs a duty of care as depositors in the circumstances alleged in respect of the type of loss or damage claimed.</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p align="left">IN THE COURT OF APPEAL</p>            </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:right">1985, No. 119</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:right">(Civil)</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <!--sino section party --><parties>        <p align="justify">BETWEEN</p>        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="60%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">                    <p style="text-align:center">YUEN KUN YEU</p>                </td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Plaintiffs</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="60%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">LAU KA KEI</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="60%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">TING AH LAM</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="60%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">LIEM JEN DJIANG</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="60%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="60%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">AND</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="60%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="60%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">THE ATTORNEY GENERAL for and on behalf of the COMMISSIONER FOR BEPOSIT-TAKING COMPANIES</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Defendant</td>            </tr>        </table>        <p style="text-align:center">________________</p>    </parties><!--sino section text -->    <!--sino section coram --><coram>        <p align="justify">Coram: Sir Alan Huggins, V.-P.,  Fuad &amp; Kempster, JJ.A.</p>    </coram><!--sino section text -->    <date>        <p align="justify">Dates of Hearing: 29 - 31 January, 3 and 4 February 1986</p>    </date>    <date>        <p align="justify">Date of Judgment: 7 March 1986</p>    </date>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:center">__________</p>    <p style="text-align:center">JUDGMENT</p>    <p style="text-align:center">__________</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="justify"><strong>Sir Alan Huggins, V.-P.:</strong></p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p1" class="pseudopara" id="p1">1.</a> This case raises difficult questions relating to the liability of a public officer for negligence in the discharge of his duties.The Attorney General is sued for damages under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Proceedings Ordinance</a> in respect of losses alleged to have been suffered by four depositors in America and Panama Finance Co. Ltd. (a deposit-taking companyregistered under the Deposit-taking <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>) as a result of the company's going into liquidation.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The appeal before this court is against an order of Jones, J. under 0.18 r.19 striking out the Statement of Claim on the ground thatit discloses no reasonable cause of action. The Statement of Claim alleged that prior to the dates on which the plaintiffs made theirdeposits it was, or should have been, apparent to the Commissioner for Deposit-taking Companies that this company was being run insuch a manner that its collapse was imminent, and further alleged, in effect, that the Commissioner was therefore under a duty totake steps to protect the Plaintiffs against the alleged losses. The contention of the Attorney General, which found favour withthe judge was that the Commissioner was under no such duty.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Mr. Litton, on behalf of the Plaintiffs, contends that it was not appropriate to strike out the Statement of Claim under 0.18 r.19,because it was not open to the judge to decide as a pure matter of law that the suggested duty of care did not exist: whether ornot there was such a duty was a question of mixed fact and law and it could not be decided until the evidence had been heard: thereforeit could not be said as a matter of law that the action must fail. The answer to that is that, although the existence of a duty ofcare is a question of mixed fact and law, on an application under 0.18 r.19 the judge is bound to assume the primary facts allegedin the Statement of Claim in favour of the Plaintiff. If on those assumed facts there is an arguable cause of action, the Statementof Claim will not be struck out. The Attorney General submits, however, that even when all the primary facts alleged here are assumedthe circumstances are such that the Commissioner cannot be held liable to the Plaintiffs. The basis of that submission is that theCommissioner, even if negligent, owed no duty of care to the Plaintiffs and, alternatively, that the damage suffered by the Plaintiffswas such that the Commissioner should not be held liable to compensate for it.

He says that a public officer is not, solely by reasonof his status as such, exempt from liability in negligence, and that, if the officer has been negligent, there may be circumstancesin which an action does lie against him. Accordingly the proper approach is in the first instance to regard him like any other defendantand to inquire whether on general principles he is prima facie liable in damages. If he is, then the further question has to be asked,whether there are any considerations which, as a matter of public policy, ought to negative that liability because (1) the particularplaintiff is in a class of persons to whom he should not owe a duty, (2) the duty to that plaintiff should be limited in scope, or(3) the damages for breach of the duty ought to be limited. The Attorney General does not argue against this approach, but his caseis that the Commissioner is not in such a relationship with the Plaintiffs that a prima facie liability arose and that even if thatrelationship did exist, there were good policy grounds for holding that his liability did not extend to compensate the Plaintiffsin the present case.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Mr. Litton's assertion that public officials as such are not exempt from liability is not disputed, nor could it be: there are numerouscases where they have been held to be liable, and <u>Dorset Yacht Co.

First one has to ask whether, as between the alleged wrongdoer and the person who hassuffered damage there is a sufficient relationship of proximity or neighbourhood such that, in the reasonable contemplation of theformer, carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to the latter - in which case a prima facie duty of care arises. Secondly,if the first question is answered affirmatively, it is necessary to consider whether there are any considerations which ought tonegative, or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty of the class of person to whom it is owed or the damages to which a breachof it may give rise: see <u>Dorset Yacht</u> case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%20AC%201004" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) A.C 1004</a>, per Lord Reid at p.1027.

Nevertheless, without treatingwhat Lord Wilberforce said as a statutory definition, I prefer to wait until the House of Lords holds that his exposition was, notappropriate for general application before departing from it. <u>The Aliakmon</u> was concerned with a casualty from which physical damage could and did result, although the cargo involved was not the property ofthe plaintiff: the plaintiff was merely a buyer to whom the bill of lading had been endorsed and delviered. Sir John Donaldson, M.R.thought that there was sufficient relationship of proximity or neighbourhood between the plaintiff and the defendant shipowner toraise a prima facie duty of care but that there were policy considerations, including the operation of the Hague Rules, which limitedthat duty. Goff, L.J., on the other hand, saw no good reason why the buyer should not have a direct cause of action against the shipownerin tort and based his decision upon the absence of any responsibility for storage on the shipowner under the time charter and thereforeof any breach by the shipowner of its duty of care. I do not think they differed on the issue of proximity and for my part I respectfullybuild on Lord Wilberforce's statement as the foundation for my judgment.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Prima facie liability in negligence arises where the defendant is a "neighbour" of the plaintiff within the principle ennunciatedby Lord Atkin in <u>Donoghue</u> v <u>Stevenson</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1932%20AC%20562" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1932 A.C 562</a> and the loss in respect of which the claim is made is not too remote.

On that basis he argues thatthe Commissioner was not in such a relationship of proximity that the Plaintiffs can succeed on the first stage of the inquiry. Iam quite unable to accept that contention, it is to confuse the proximity of the relationship with the proximity of the damage whichmay be caused by the Defendant's negligence - the existence of a duty of care with the possible remoteness or irrecoverability ofthe damage which may flow from a breach of that duty.

It is not merely an issue of fact to be left to be found as such. When it is said to result ina duty of care being owed to a person or a class, the statement that there is a 'duty of care' denotes a conclusion into the formingof which considerations of policy have entered. That foreseeability does not of itself, and automatically, lead to a duty of careis, I think, clear.

Moreover, theloss (if any) which they will incur is the very loss which the Commissioner should have foreseen would be suffered if he were negligent:it was the only direct loss which the depositors as such could suffer, although they might also suffer remote damage as a resultof a failure to repay the deposits. It was, of course, conceded that there was no duty on the Commissioner to take any specifiedaction, but the argument is that the general duty to make provision for the protection of depositors required that this Company shouldnot have been registered in the first place and, if registered, should not have been allowed to continue in business: at least theCommissioner should have considered the suspension or revocation of the company's licence. (I think this should be a reference tothe revocation of the registration, since licences are issued not by the Commissioner but by the Financial Secretary: s.16B). Mr.Litton suggests that the apparent inaction of the Commissioner amounted in the circumstances to a total abrogation of his responsibilitiesand not to a mere error in the exercise of a discretionary power. Indeed, it created a trap to members of the public who might, inreliance upon an assumption that the Commissioner had satisfied himself as to the proper conduct of the Company's business, depositmoney with it.

I accept that a public official who, by his conduct,shows that he has totally abrogated his responsibilities so as to frustrate the objects of a statute may be said to be in breachof his "operational" functions as distinct from his "policy" functions, but there is no allegation of such abrogation of responsibility:on the contrary, it is common ground that the Commissioner did make some inquiries into the business of the company, and the allegationis that the Commissioner was negligent in not acting differently upon the information obtained In deciding whether there is a primafacie duty "to some extent the decision ...... must be a matter of impression and instinctive judgment as to what is fair and just": per Lord Pearson in <u>Home Office</u> v <u>Dorset Yacht Co.

I have had the advantage of reading Fuad,J.A 's detailed analysis of the provisions of the Ordinance and I do not think it necessary to say more than that the legislatureclearly intended that the Commissioner should keep in mind the interests of depositors and the possibility of loss to them and that,in the words of Lord Morris in <u>Home Office</u> v <u>Dorset Yacht Co.

Nothing can turn upon that, because in practiceno question of actionable loss could arise until the plaintiff had made a deposit. Thus, even if a duty of care were owed to allthe world, the only damage which could reasonably be in the contemplation of the Commissioner would be damage to actual depositors. I see no reason why the class of depositors should be regarded as too indeterminate: the depositors might vary from day to day buttheir names were readily ascertainable at any time.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The real debate revolves around the fact that the damage suffered by the Plaintiffs (if any) will be what is described as "pecuniary"or "economic" loss as distinct from physical damage to person or property. (I keep saying if any" because, until the liquidationof the company is complete, it will not be known for certain that the depositors cannot recover their deposits in full with interest- unlikely as that outcome may be.) It is accepted that in a sense all actionable loss is economic loss, but the Attorney Generalcontends that the existence of physical damage is a prerequisite in any claim for damages. Here there is no physical damage: in thenature of things the loss suffered by the Plaintiffs is, and could only be, the diminution in value of a chose in action, their rightsto recover their deposits with interest.

The pumps were supplied by the 2nd defendant andwere fitted with motors supplied by the 3rd defendant, which was treated as the manufacturer of the motors, although the motors hadin fact been manufactured in France by the 3rd Defendant's parent company. The pumps proved to be unsatisfactory because the motorswere not wound for the range of voltages found in the United Kingdom. As a result a large number of lobsters died. The judge heldthat the physical damage (i.e the death of the lobsters) was not foreseeable by the 3rd defendant but that the 3rd defendant shouldhave foreseen the type of special damage in respect of which the plaintiffs claimed, namely:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(a) the cost of the pumps: Â£4,284.46 plus V.A.T.; (b) additional labour in boiling and refrigerating salvaged dead lobsters, estimated:Â£500; (c) additional costs of electrical engineers to attend to pumps estimated Â£500; (d) additional working time and labour forattendance upon pumps to check, correct tripping out, etc. estimated: Â£1,500; (e) loss of interest on capital deployed and/or lossof availability of working capital: to be quantified; (f) loss of profit on intended sales, estimated: Â£127,375; and (g) loss oflobsters at cost, estimated: Â£11,000."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <blockquote>                        <p align="justify"> </p>                    </blockquote>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">He awarded damages under each of those heads but held that damages claimed for inconvenience and anxiety suffered by the plaintiffwere too remote.

The degree of reliancemay, therefore, be an indicator of the existence or absence of the necessary proximity of relationship to establish a duty of care,but it does not seem to me to supply a good reason for excluding economic damage in a case where compensation for physical damageis allowed: that must depend upon remoteness of the damage or some other aspect of public policy.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Why, then, should economic damage necessarily be ignored where there is no physical damage - otherwise than on the ground of remotenessor some other reason of public policy?

(3d) 1</a> is the closest to ours. Mr. Litton contends that it is directly in point and argues that it is desirable that the courts in all theCommon Law jurisdictions should advance in the same direction. The Attorney General submits that the Canadian Federal Court of Appealwrongly analysed <u>Anns</u> v <u>Merton London Borough Council</u> and that the decision does not represent the law applicable in Hong Kong. The action was brought against the Crown for negligenceand breach of statutory duty on the part of the Minister of Finance and Superintendent of Insurance in licensing, inspection andregulation under their Companies Act. The judge at first instance dealt with the case as a matter of ascertaining the intention ofthe Legislature. Le Dain J. (with whom the others agreed) said at p.9:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">".... the question whether there is to be civil liability for breach of statutory duty is to be determined, in so far as it necessarilyremains a question fo policy, not by conjectures as to legislative intention but by the application, in a public law context, ofthe common law principles governing liability for negligence."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <blockquote>                        <p align="justify"> </p>                    </blockquote>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">I adopt that as indicating the correct approach, although the constant repetition of, and emphasis on, the words "in a public lawcontext'' during the argument before us leads me to say that the context does not alter the principles. The Court of Appeal heldfirst that the financial condition and conduct of a controlling shareholder could conceivably be relevant to the opinion to be formedby the Minister of Finance whether the company was in a financial position to justify its transaction of the business of a trustcompany. That was relevant to the power of the Minister under s.71(2) to issue a licence to a company where the Minister was of opinionthat the company was in such a financial position. As I understand it, the Attorney General's submission here is that, even thoughthe financial condition and conduct of a controlling shareholder could conceivably be relevant to the Minister's opinion, that doesnot mean that the Minister could be held liable for issuing a licence where, as a result of his negligence, he formed the wrong opinioneven less, in the present case, could the Commissioner be liable for failing to remove the America and Panama Finance Co. Ltd. fromthe Register. Secondly, the Federal Court of Appeal was not prepared to say that there might not be actionable negligence in theSuperintendent's failing to report the improper practices alleged against the company and in his failing to request the company todispose of, and realise, unauthorized investments. Again, as I understand it, the Attorney General argues that, however negligentthe Superintendent may have been, it was wrong to say that he could be held liable for loss of moneys invested in associated companies,and he bases that argument (i) on the ground that there could be no recovery for purely economic loss and (ii) that the Superintendentought not to have been held liable for any loss resulting from such negligence.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Having regard to the conclusion which I have reached as to the principle involved, I am driven to agree that <u>Baird</u> v <u>Reg</u>. ought not to be followed in Hong Kong. In the present case the damage which has resulted was, as I have said, the very damage whichcould be foreseen as a likely result of any negligent performance of the Commissioner's duties. It follows that, if liability isto be excluded, it must be on the basis of some factor other than remoteness, than the mere fact that the Commissioner was a publicofficial and than the mere fact that the loss was economic. In the result I am of opinion that it should be excluded on the basisthat the damage alleged was not of a kind for which the Commissioner should be required to pay compensation. The clue to the resolutionof the problem seems to me to lie in the fact that the Attorney General has argued not simply for the exclusion of "pecuniary loss"but of "pecuniary loss arising from a commercial transaction". The purpose of the Deposit-taking <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> was not to guarantee the financial stability of every registered deposit-taking company. It was conceded that if the Commissionerhad given a direct undertaking to the Plaintiffs of the stability of the America and Panama Finance Co. Ltd. the position might bevery different: it would come directly within the <u>Hedley Byrne</u> principle. The duty of the Commissioner towards the Plaintiffs was no different from that which he owed to everyone else.  The damagewhich they suffered flowed as much from their own misjudgment of the company's stability as from the assumed negligence of the Commissioner.It is argued that the Plaintiffs were lulled into a sense of security by their knowledge of the existence of the Ordinance. Again,we must assume that they were - it is not impossible, because the advent of the welfare state has produced an attitude which looksto the state for protection against all the world's ills and regards self-responsibility as an anachronism. However, we have notyet in Hong Kong reached the stage where the existence of legislation under which a public official is appointed to regulate a tradein the interests of the consumer guarantees the consumer against loss. I appreciate that the Commissioner had means of knowledge- and, on the assumption which we are bound to make at this stage of the action, had actual knowledge - which the Plaintiffs didnot have. Nevertheless, it was a matter of discretion what steps the Commissioner should have taken. He had to consider many factors,some of which we could enumerate but some of which would be known only to him there might be circumstances in which even a deposit-takingcompany which was found to be operated fraudulently should not be struck from the Register forthwith. Bearing in mind the warningof Lord Roskill in <u>Junior Books Ltd.</u> v <u>Veitchi Ltd.</u> at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1983%20AC%20539D" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1983 A.C 539D</a> that there is a limit to the application of the "floodgates argument", I think it will not hinder the proper development of the lawif we deny any general rule of exclusion of pecuniary loss caused by negligence but draw a line against allowing claims for suchloss in cases where the loss has resulted as much from the plaintiff's own commercial misjudgment as from the defendant's failureto take action which was open to him in the performance of his public duties.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> I would dismiss the appeal.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><strong>Fuad, J.A.:</strong></p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment just delivered by my Lord the Vice-President, and the judgment about tobe delivered by my Lord Kempster J.A. Their review of the background of the appeal and the issues raised makes it possible for memove directly to addressing certain aspects of the issues before us, which seem to me to be important and, indeed, conclusive. Beforedoing so, I think it would be helpful to review the provisions of the Deposit-taking <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/328">Cap. 328</a>) as shortly as may be, for it is upon its provisions that the appellants found their stand.

However he did not take this course and, as will be seen, I considerit possible to decide the crucial points of law raised on the assumption that all the assertions in the Statement of Claim are correct.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> The Deposit-taking <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> ("the Ordinance") was enacted in 1976 and has fairly frequently been amended.

This section does not,on its face, give the Commissioner any discretion, but paragraph (e) of subsection (2) of s.10 states that he must refuse to registera company: "if it appears to the Commissioner that by reason of any circumstances whatsoever, the company is not a fit and properbody to be registered."   Section 12(1) requires the Commissioner to maintain a register of D.T.C.s which shall contain "such otherparticulars <i>[</i>as well as the name and business address of the D.T.C.<i>]</i> of such companies as the Commissioner thinks fit." Section 12(2) provides that the register must be kept in a place notified in the<u>Gazette</u>, and under subsection (3) any member of the public has access to it, and may obtain a copy or extract of documents lodged with theCommissioner when the application for registration was made, and of the annual accounts required to be lodged with the Commissionerunder s.17.

In the contextof the financial scene of Hong Kong, the legislature has thought it necessary to control the activities of D.T.C.s and, by amendingOrdinances enacted almost every year since the coming into force of the principal Ordinance, the legislature has sought to strengthenthat control by imposing further obligations and restrictions upon D.T.C.s, and by giving additional powers to the Commissioner.Despite the other objects for which the Ordinance was passed, indicated by its long title, I do not consider that a fair readingof the statute can deny that it was the interests of depositors with which the legislature was primarily concerned: to protect depositors,so far as a regulatory statute can, from the risk of losing their money. In my judgment, a notional Commissioner cannot be heardto say that if he neglected his duties he could not reasonably foresee that they would be likely to suffer loss. But, as the casesshow, this is not conclusive on the issue whether a duty was, or was not, owed.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> I now return to address Lord Wilberforce's formulation in <u>Anns</u> v. <u>Merton London</u> <u>Borough Council.</u> <strong><sup>(1)</sup></strong> In my respectful judgment, the present state of the law does not require us to attempt to answer either of Lord Wilberforce's twoquestions without bearing in mind other considerations, laid down by authorities which bind this Court, or which are of high persuasiveauthority. I am emboldened to say this, in view of the speech Lord Keith of Kinkel in <u>Peabody Fund</u> v. <u>Sir Lindsay Parkinson Ltd.</u> <sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup> at p.240: "There is a tendency in some recent cases to treat these passages as being of themselves of a definitive character. Thisis a temptation which should be resisted." This note of warning was adverted to by Lord Frazer of Tyllybelton, giving the adviceof the Privy Council in <u>Candlewood Navigation Corporation Ltd.</u> v. <u>Mitsui O.S.K.</u> <u>Lines Ltd.</u><sup><strong>(3)</strong></sup> (an appeal from New South Wales) at p.390.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> I say all this because it seems to me that we are bound to consider whether the depositors are right in submitting that claims for"pure economic loss" have, once and for all been assimilated into the mainstream of the principles of negligence, so that the lineof authority which restricts the recoverability of such loss has been rendered irrelevant.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> I think it can safely be said that, historically, the law of tort did not recognise claims for pure economic or financial loss. Anearly case, often relied upon in subsequent decisions of the Courts, was <u>Cattle</u> v. <u>Stockton Waterworks Ltd.</u> <strong><sup>(4)</sup></strong> where a builder had contracted, by a "lump sum" contract, to build a tunnel under a road. He failed in his action for the additionalcosts he had incurred by reason of the delay caused by water percolating into the tunnel from a pipe owned by the defendants whichhad been fractured by their negligence. The cases that followed showed that it was taken as authority for the denial of a remedyfor purely economic loss in tort to someone who had suffered loss of this kind as a result of damage to, or even the destructionof, a chattel in which he had no possessory or proprietary interest.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> But in <u>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. Ltd.</u> v. <u>Heller &amp; Partners Ltd.</u> <strong><sup>(5)</sup></strong> the House of Lords recognised as valid a claim in negligence by a person who had suffered pecuniary loss through relying on falsestatements carelessly made, where the defendant had assumed responsibility for the advice, opinion or information which he had tenderedto the plaintiff, in circumstances that the plaintiff could reasonably rely on the defendant's skill and judgment. There the plaintiffsasked their bankers to look into the financial stability of a company with which they contemplated having business dealings. Whenthe bankers did this, the company's bankers carelessly gave favourable references about the company's financial standing. The plaintiffrelied on these references and lost ï¿¡17,000. They would have succeeded against the company's bankers but for the fact that thelatter had expressly disclaimed responsibility for the information they had supplied.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> It was in this case that Lord Devlin characterized as nonsensical the distinction that had been sought to be drawn between physicaland economic loss, pointing out that where there had been damage or injury, no difficulty arose in claiming consequential economicloss. In the course of his speech he said, at p.517: "The interposition of the physical injury is said to make a difference in principle.I can find neither logic or common sense in this." These sentiments have been echoed in later cases.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Nevertheless, the special status of "economic loss" cases has persisted. An example is <u>Weller &amp; Co.</u> v. <u>Foot and Mouth Disease Research Institute.</u> <strong><sup>(6)</sup></strong> There the defendant Institute negligently allowed virus to escape which infected cattle in the neighbourhood. The responsible Ministerthereupon made a statutory order closing the local cattle market thus making it impossible for the plaintiffs (who were a firm ofauctioneers at the market) to carry on their business. The plaintiffs' claim failed before Widgery J. (as he then was). He said,at p.587: "The decision in <u>Hedley Byrne</u> does not depart in any way from the fundamental that there can be no claim for negligence in the absence of a duty of care owed tothe plaintiff......", and later, "What that case does not decide is that an ability to foresee indirect or consequential loss toanother as the result of one's conduct automatically imposes a duty to take care to avoid that loss." On my understanding of thelater authorities to which we have been referred, it cannot be said that <u>Hedley Byrne</u> wholly abolished the distinction between cases where pure economic loss alone is claimed and where such loss is claimed as a consequenceof personal injury or physical damage. Two very recent cases (to which I shall have to return) show that this distinction still hassome vitality: <u>Leigh &amp; Sillivan Ltd.</u> v. <u>Aliakmon Shipping Co. Ltd.</u><strong><sup>(7)</sup></strong> and <u>Muirhead</u> v. <u>Industrial Tank Specialities Ltd.</u>,<strong><sup>(8)</sup></strong> both cases in the Court of Appeal.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> I think it can be said, too, of <u>Junior Books Ltd.</u> v. <u>Veitchi Co. Ltd.</u> <strong><sup>(9)</sup></strong> that although the House of Lords applied <u>Anns</u> v. <u>Merton London Borough Council</u><strong><sup>(1)</sup></strong> their Lordships had in mind economic loss considerations. In that case the defendants were sub-contractors who had no contractualrelationship with the plaintiffs. They laid a defective floor in a factory they were building for the plaintiffs, who were put toexpense in re-laying the floor and suffered a loss of profit while the new work on the floor was being undertaken. The plaintiffs'claim was upheld by a majority. Although Lord Roskill firmly rejected the "floodgates" argument, Lord Frazer of Tulleybelton emphasizedthat the basis of his decision was on the facts. At p.533 he said:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The proximity between the parties is extremely close, falling only just short of a direct contractual relation-ship.... The presentcase seems to me to fall well within the limits already recognised in principle for this type of claim, and I would decide this appealstrictly on its own facts. I rely particularly on the very close proximity between the parties which in my view distinguishes thiscase from the case of producers of goods to be offered for sale to the public."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Lord Roskill, at p.546, listed eight factors in the case which he regarded as being of "crucial importance" in deciding whether therewas "the requisite degree of proximity so as to give rise to the relevant duty of care..." In his short concurring speech, Lord Russellof Killowen made reference to the "immediate proximity" of the parties.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> In my opinion, although <u>Junior Books</u> enabled claims for economic loss to be made which would earlier have failed, it did not absolve the courts from taking into considerationother relevant factors in "pure economic loss" cases. I gain support for this view from the judgment of Robert Goff L.J. (as he thenwas) in <u>Muirhead</u> v. I<u>ndustrial Tank Specialities Ltd.</u> <strong><sup>(8)</sup></strong> where he said, at p.1107: ".... it is, I think, safest for this court to treat <u>Junior Books</u> as a case in which, on its particular facts, there was considered to be such a very close relationship between the parties that thedefenders could, if the facts as pleaded were proved, be held liable to the pursuers." And Nourse L.J. had this to say, at p.1012:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I am in complete agreement with the judgment of Robert Goff L.J. and find that there is very little which I wish to add. In his analysisof <u>Junior Books Ltd.</u> v. <u>Veitchi Co.

Having been so decided, that case cannot, in myrespectful opinion, be taken to be authority for the proposition that where those features are absent a defendant is liable in tortin respect of economic loss which is not consequent upon physical damage to the person or property of the plaintiff. Where thosefeatures are absent, I agree with O'Connor L.J. that we remain bound by the decision of this court in <u>Spartan Steel &amp;</u> <u>Alloys Ltd.</u> v. <u>Martin &amp; Co.

I say at once, and withgreat respect, that I have found their analysis of the cases of great assistance in reaching my decision in this appeal. In referringto the passage of Lord Wilberforce's speech in the <u>Ann's case</u><strong><sup>(1)</sup></strong> at p.751, Oliver L.J. said at p.305:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="89%">        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="87%" valign="top">                <p align="justify" class="quote">"It is, as it seems to me, a misreading of Lord Wilberforce's formulation to treat it as laying down some general principle that inall cases a duty of care is the necessary consequence of the fact of foreseeability of damage and that once that is found the courtthen has to give effect to the concomitant duty unless it can discern for itself some policy consideration which in the particularcase appears to it to afford a valid ground for restricting it. As I read his speech in <u>Anns</u> case <i>[</i>1978<i>]</i> A.C. 728, 749, he was not intending to suggest that what he posited as the first question was, in itself, a sufficient analysis ofthe duty of care or was more than the initial provision of an essential foundation without which no duty of care can exist. In asense, of course, it may be said that in every case in which a remedy is given or withheld, it is so because it is the policy ofthe law to give or withhold it. But policy is not arbitrary and I do not read Lord Wilberforce's formulation as absolving the court- at any rate at any level below their Lordships' House - from inquiring into the basis in logic or in precedent for the adoptionof a particular policy or as dictating any new approach to the duty of care on the basis of foreseeability alone and as a questionof fact in each case."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> I regard the following passage from Oliver L.J.'s judgment, at p.308, of particular importance:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="87%" valign="top">                <p align="justify" class="quote">"         There is,   after all, nothing particularly startling or revolutionary in the recognition that, given a breach of duty inthe first place, damages could be recovered for the foreseeable loss which the plaintiff had suffered in his pocket. Outside thesphere of simple physical injury to person, all loss is 'economic' and its character and quality is not altered by adding to it theword 'purely.'  If my chattel is damaged by negligence, my loss is that I am put to the expense of repairing or replacing it andam deprived of its (possibly profitable) use in the meantime. The law compensates me for both and always has done.</p>                <p align="justify" class="quote"> </p>                <p align="justify" class="quote">The difficulty which has arisen in finding any logical limitation to the recoverability of damages stems, as it seems to me from thedevelopment by the law of the same test both for the circumstances in which a duty is to be found and for the extent of the lossfor which compensation will be given. But that development does not entail the conclusion that all previous limitations arrived atby the application of different criteria have necessarily to be abandoned. Actual damage is an essential ingredient not merely ofrecoverability but of the cause of action itself in negligence, and the duty of care itself falls to be defined and can only be definedby references to the consequence of breach. It is, to put it broadly, a duty not to cause damage by carelessness, and it is restrictedin its ambit to those who can reasonably be foreseen as likely to be damaged by the act in question. Thus defined there is no particulardifficulty, conceptually, in seeing where the limits of the duty fall to be placed, although there may be difficulties in applyingthe concept to particular facts. The limit is defined by foreseeability as regards the person who may be injured and by the necessityof demonstrating that it was the act complained of which caused the damage. So long as the law continued to recognise a distinction,possibly never logically defensible, between 'direct' and 'indirect' loss, the boundary could be found in the type of loss whichthe law recognised as flowing from, or being 'caused' by, the act or omission complained of. Once however foreseeability became,as it has as the law has developed, the touchstone by which there is established not only the nexus between plaintiff and defendantbut also that between the act or omission and the damage, one has either logically to accept that the duty exists and is broken whereverforeseeable damage occurs or to look elsewhere for guidance as to where the limits of liability are to be set."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> In referring to the recoverability of economic loss not associated with damage to the plaintiff's property, at pp. 311-312, OliverL.J. summarised the present state of the law, as follows:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"        So far as the English cases go, the position which has been established appears to be this, that loss of the type referredto above is now recoverable provided that it is consequential upon some physical damage to property of the plaintiff sustained asa result of the allegedly tortious act. Beyond that the law has, so far, declined, whether logically or not, to go. For my part Iam not sure that this involves anything like so radical a departure from the previously established position as is sometimes supposed.Whether one ascribes the limitations on recoverability to remoteness, absence of duty or 'policy', the damage actually held to berecover-able has been and is, as the law now stands, restricted to that which is consequential upon physical injury to the plaintiff'sproperty, that is to say, damage which always was recoverable under the first category mentioned above. There is nothing very novelabout this. It is merely the application of perfectly well known principles for the recovery of consequential loss to a situationin which the plaintiff is not, if one may be permitted the expression, the primary victim but where the damage to his property is,as it were, at one degree removed in the sense that it is the foreseeable result of damage sustained by the primary victim. To putit another way, what has occurred is not a wholesale abandonment of the policy established by the previous cases which denied recover-abilitywhere the loss claimed arose out of injury to another's property but without physical injury to the plaintiff's person or property,but simply the recognition that the ordinary rule governing the recoverability of 'economic' loss consequential on injury to personor property applies not only where that physical injury is directly inflicted but also where the injury results from other and differentinjury inflicted upon a third party.</p>        <p class="quote"> </p>        <p class="quote">        For my part, therefore, I do not find myself able to regard these authorities, as establishing some new and more extensiveprinciple governing the general recover-ability of 'economic' loss."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p align="justify"> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Robert Goff L.J. was of the same view - at P.325 he said: "And so we have seen the development of the cases, not as a generalisedright or recovery in negligence for economic loss, but of recovery in specific cases." And at P.326, occurs the following passage:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The effect of the authorities can be summarised as follows. First, there is a greater readiness to examine cases of economic lossin order to ascertain whether there should be liability in negligence, as exemplified by the decisions of the House of Lords in the<u>Hedley Byrne</u> case <i>[</i>1964<i>]</i> A.C. 465; the <u>Dorset Yacht</u> case <i>[</i>1970<i>]</i> A.C. 1004 and the <u>Anns</u> case <i>[</i>1978<i>]</i> A C. 728 itself.  Secondly, there has been a reaffirmation of the widely accepted view that there cannot be a general right of recoveryfor economic loss on the simple basis of proximity, as in cases of damage to person or property: see <u>Weller's</u> case <i>[</i>1966<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20QB%20569" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 Q.B. 569</a>; <u>S.C.M.(United kingdom) Ltd.</u> v. <u>W.J. Whittal &amp; Son Ltd.</u> <i>[</i>1971<i>]</i> Q.B.27. But, thirdly, there has been a gradual recognition of a right or recovery for purely economic loss in certain specific cases,in particular in <u>The Greystoke Castle</u> <i>[</i>1947<i>]</i> A.C. 265; the <u>Hedley Byrne</u> case <i>[</i>1964<i>]</i>A.C. 465; <u>Ross</u> v. <u>Caunters</u> <i>[</i>1980<i>]</i> Ch.297; the <u>Caltex Oil</u> case, in Australia,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=136%20CLR%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">136 C.L.R. 529</a>, and (as I read it) <u>Junior Books Ltd.</u> v. <u>Veitchi Co.

That was a case which decided whether a time charterer could recover damages for pecuniaryloss caused by the damage to the chartered vessel by a third party. Lord Frazer of Tulleybelton, at p.385 described the issue as"one of fundamental importance in maritime law and in the law of negligence generally." At p.394, he had this to say:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Their Lordships consider that some limit or control mechanism has to be imposed upon the liability of a wrongdoer towards those whohave suffered economic damage in consequence of his negligence. The need for such a limit has been repeatedly asserted in the cases,from <u>Cattle's</u> case,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=LR%2010%20QB%20453" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">L.R. 10 Q.B. 453</a> to <u>Caltex</u>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=136%20CLR%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">136 C.L.R. 529</a>, and their Lordships are not aware that a view to the contrary has ever been judicially expressed. The policy of imposing such alimit is consistent with the policy of limiting the liability of ships and aircraft in maritime and aviation law by statute and byinternational agreement. The common law limitation which has been generally accepted is that stated by Scrutton L.J. in <u>Elliott Steam Tug Co. Ltd.</u> v. <u>Shipping Controller</u> <i>[</i>1922<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20KB%20127" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 K.B. 127</a>, 139-140, which has been already mentioned. Not only has that rule been generally accepted in many countries including the UnitedKingdom, Canada, the United States of America and until now Australia, but it has the merit of drawing a definite and readily ascertainableline. It should enable legal practitioners to advise their clients as to their rights with reasonable certainty, and their Lordshipsare not aware of any widespread dissatisfaction with the rule. These considerations operate to limit the scope of the duty owed bya wrongdoer, and they do so at the second stage mentioned by Lord Wilberforce in the passage cited above from his speech in <u>Anns</u> v, <u>Merton London Borough Council</u> <i>[</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1978%5d%20AC%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1978] A.C. 728</a>,751-752."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Approaching the issues before us at "the second stage" as required by the last sentence of the passage I have just quoted, I turnto consider "whether there are any considerations which ought to negative, or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the classof person to whom it is owed or the damages to which a breach of it  may give rise ...." in an attempt to answer the second of LordWilberforce's two questions.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> I start by noting that no case has been cited from any of the jurisdictions which make up the Commonwealth, so rich a source of authority,that has recognised the kind of claim made here. The Canadian case, <u>Baird</u> v. <u>The Queen</u><strong><sup>(10)</sup></strong> certainly involved just such a claim, but it concerned an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal from an order striking out a statementof claim, where no final decisions on the points of law raised were reached, for the action was remitted for trial. So we are faced,it can truly be said, with a novel action.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> It seems to me that the situation revealed by the facts of this particular case as pleaded cannot be looked at in isolation, forif this claim is to be allowed, any principle upon which the decision is reached, will apply to many situations in the financialand commercial life of Hong Kong where a public officer is given powers and duties by regulatory statutes and subsidiary legislation.I may interpolate here that I do not think it to be a conclusive consideration that the legislature can always (as it has now donein respect of the Ordinance) limit, the liability of such officials by express provision. Similar cases might arise out of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/155" class="autolink_findacts">Banking Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/155">Cap. 155</a>), the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/250" class="autolink_findacts">Commodities Trading Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/250">Cap. 250</a>), the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/119" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Unions Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/119">Cap. 119</a>), the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333" class="autolink_findacts">Securities Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333">Cap. 333</a>), the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/41" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Companies Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/41">Cap. 41</a>) and the Travel Agents Ordinance 1986, to mention just some of the statutes that regulate activity in the financial andcommercial field, in an effort to prevent or minimise loss to the public.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> In my view it is right to bear in mind how indeterminate would be the class of persons who might have a cause of action in analogouscircumstances if the present claim were to be recognised; a very wide field of potential liability would be opened up. I do not thinkthat the legislature should be discouraged from doing what it can to promote and protect the interests of the public. This claimarises out of the loss of money from a commonplace financial transaction. I am mindful of the fact that the Statement of Claim, inthe form in which it is proposed to be amended if the case goes on, avers that the depositors/ plaintiffs relied on the Commissioner'sdue performance of his duties, but I can see no reason why they should be allowed to pray in aid this alleged reliance.  Surely itmust be a commercial decision by an individual whether to put his money safely at sometimes low interest in a respectable bank orto go after higher interest in a D.T.C. The latter form of investment has, in it, an element of speculation. There is always a riskthat a D.T.C. will fail for one reason or another however sensibly the Commissioner exercises his powers or performs his duties.He has no control over the extent of his resources. There is plenty of advice to be had in Hong Kong from professionals in the relevantfields. The Commissioner has no duty to advise or inform depositors. Although the Commissioner necessarily has, and can acquire,more information than a depositor about a D.T.C., a depositor (as I have sought to show by my review of the Ordinance) is free, forexample, to examine the basic documents relied upon by the Commissioner when he made his decision to register a D.T.C., and alsothe D.T.C.'s annual accounts. He can find out what he can about the directors of the company.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> I bear in mind what Lord Keith of Kinkel said, at pp.240-241 of his speech in <u>Peabody Fund</u> v. <u>Sir Lindsay Parkinson Ltd.</u> <sup><strong>(2a)</strong></sup>:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="91%">        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="89%" valign="top">                <p align="justify" class="quote">"The true question in each case is whether the particular defendant owed to the particular plaintiff a duty of care having the scopewhich is  contended for, and whether he was in breach of that duty with consequent loss to the plaintiff. A relationship of proximityin Lord Atkin's sense must exist before any duty of care can arise, but the scope of the duty must depend on all the circumstancesof the case. In <u>Dorset Yacht Co.</u> v. <u>Home Office</u> <i>[</i>1970<i>]</i> A.C. 1004, 1038, Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest, after observing that at the conclusion of his speech in <u>Donoghue</u> v. <u>Stevenson</u> <i>[</i>1932<i>]</i> A.C. 562, Lord Atkin said that it was advantageous if the law 'is in accordance with sound common sense' and expressing the viewthat a special relation existed between the prison officers and the yacht company which gave rise to a duty on the former to controltheir charges so as to prevent them doing damage, continued, at p.1039:</p>                <p align="justify" class="quote"> </p>                <blockquote>                    <blockquote>                        <p align="justify" class="quote">'Apart from this I would conclude that, in the situation stipulated in the present case, it would not only be fair and reasonablethat a duty of care should exist but that it would be contrary to the fitness of things were it not so I doubt whether it is necessaryto say, in cases where the court is asked whether in a particular situation a duty existed, that the court is called upon to makea decision as to policy. Policy need not be invoked where reason and good sense will at once point the way. If the test as to whetherin some particular situation a duty of care arises may in some cases have to be whether it is fair and reasonable that it shouldso arise, the court must not shrink from being the arbiter. As Lord Radcliffe said in his speech in <u>Davis Contractors Ltd.</u> v. <u>Fareham Urban DistrIct Council</u> <i>[</i>1956<i>]</i> A.C. 696, 728, the court is the spokesman of the fair and reasonable man.'</p>                        <p align="justify" class="quote"> </p>                    </blockquote>                </blockquote>                <p align="justify" class="quote">So in determining whether or not a duty of care of particular scope was incumbent upon a defendant it is material to take into considerationwhether it is just and reasonable that it should be so."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> In my judgment it would be neither just nor reasonable to hold that the Commissioner owed the depositors "a duty of care having thescope which is contended for". To admit this claim would, in my view, have overwhelming implications, and would be tantamount tomaking the Commissioner the D.T.C.'s guarantor, or the depositors' insurer, at the expense, ultimately, of the whole body of tax-payers,some of whom will have been more cautious, and have invested their money more securely, if less profitably.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> I have reached the firm conclusion that as a matter of law, a statutory authority cannot be held liable in negligence for economicloss suffered by another as a result of the failure of a third party to meet his contractual obligations in a financial or commercialtransaction, even if it can be shown that the authority has failed to perform statutory functions whose objects are to prevent ormitigate that type of loss. This, it seems to me, would be to impose a limitation or "control mechanism" upon common law principlesgoverning liability for negligence in the public law context which can be readily understood and applied, and which would not leadto a capricious result.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> In my view the only sanction depositors have against the Commissioner in respect of the alleged negligence pleaded is political,by harnessing public opinion; and, of course, the Commissioner is generally accountable to the legislature.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> In the light of these conclusions, it is not necessary for me to examine the other issues raised by this appeal. I have no doubtthat Jones J. was right to strike out the Statement of Claim, for neither principle nor authority justified the contention that aviable cause of action had been pleaded, and, for the reasons I have given, I would dismiss this appeal.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify">(1)    <i>[</i>1978<i>]</i> A.C. 728.<br />    (2)    <i>[</i>1985<i>]</i> A.C. 210<br />    (2a)    <i>[</i>1985<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20AC%20210" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 A.C. 210</a><br />    (3)    <i>[</i>1985<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=3%20WLR%20381" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">3 W.L.R. 381</a><br />    (4)     <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281875%29%20LR%2010%20QB%20453" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1875) L.R. 10 Q.B. 453</a><br />    (5)    <em>[</em>1964<em>]</em> A.C. 465<br />    (6)    <i>[</i>1966<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20QB%20569" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 Q.B. 569</a><br />    (7)    <i>[</i>1985<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20WLR%20289" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 W.L.R. 289</a><br />    (8)    <i>[</i>1985<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=3%20WLR%20993" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">3 W.L.R. 993</a><br />    (9)    <i>[</i>1983<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20AC%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 A.C. 520</a><br />    (8)    <i>[</i>1985<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=3%20WLR%20993" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">3 W.L.R. 993</a><br />    (10)     <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20148%20DLR%20%283d%29%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 148 D.L.R.

After a four day hearing Jones J. made the order sought on 9th July 1985. The plaintiffs appeal.Thus we find ourselves in the unwelcome but inescapable predicament of having to reach important conclusions of law in a developingand fluid area of tortious liability on hypothetical facts.

Conversely a negative answer will result in the appeal and the action being dismissed. The "agreedquestion" is "Did the Commissioner owe a duty of care to the plaintiffs as depositors in the circumstances alleged in respect ofthe type of loss or damage claimed?"</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> The proposed Amended Statement of Claim runs to 39 pages of foolscap but the gravamen is that by statute the Commissioner was enjoinedto have the interests of depositors and potential depositors in mind and given powers to protect them. He was required prudentiallyto supervise Panama Finance Co., Ltd.  Upon all these considerations the plaintiffs claim to have relied in making their deposits.The Commissioner is alleged to have owed them a duty of care accordingly. Then it is alleged that, having been made aware as from22nd September 1980, when it was registered, of Panama Finance Co., Ltd.'s under-capitalization, its suspect bona fides, its breachesof the terms of the ordinance and later of its fraud the Commissioner, in breach of his alleged duty of care, failed and neglectedso to exercise, or to consider the exercise of, any of his powers as to revoke or suspend the company's registration before the plaintiffsmade their respective deposits or, alternatively, to prevent its failure thereafter. The damage claimed is the loss of the severaldeposits made by the plaintiffs during 1982, being their life savings, together with interest. On analysis this means that theirseveral choses in action became worthless or diminished in value. These are claims in tort for economic loss.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> Jones J. accepted the submissions of the Attorney General that, prima facie, no duty of care is owed to prevent economic loss unrelatedto injury to person or property even if foreseen; that the terms of the ordinance do not have the effect of creating proximity asbetween the Commissioner and depositors or potential depositors apt to satisfy the neighbour test postulated by Lord Atkin in <u>Donoghue</u> v. <u>Stevenson</u> <strong><sup>(1)</sup></strong> at pp. 581-2 and that considerations of public policy preclude the courts from allowing the plaintiffs relief in the circumstances."It would lead" he held "to the opening of the flood-gates - "</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> The classic test postulated by Lord Atkin at PP.580 and 581 and referred to above was couched in these terms:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.Who, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be - persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I oughtreasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are calledin question. This appears to me to be the doctrine of <u>Heaven</u> v. <u>Pander</u> <strong><sup>(2)</sup></strong> as laid down by Lord Esher (then Brett M.R.) when it is limited by the notion of proximity introduced by Lord Esher himself and A.L. Smith L.J. in <u>Le Lievre</u> v. <u>Gould</u> <strong><sup>(3)</sup></strong> Lord Esher says: 'That case established that, under certain circumstances, one man may owe a duty to another, even though there isno contract between them. If one man is near to another, or is near to the property of another, a duty lies upon him not to do thatwhich may cause a personal injury to that other, or may injure his property.'  So A. L. Smith L.J.: 'The decision of <u>Heaven</u> v. <u>Pender</u> <strong><sup>(2)</sup></strong> was found upon the principle, that a duty to take due care did arise when the person or property of one was in such proximity tothe person or property of another that, if due care was not taken, damage might be done by the one to the other.'  I think that thissufficiently states the truth if proximity be not confined to mere physical proximity, but be used, as I think it was intended, toextend to such close and direct relations that the act complained of directly affects a person whom the person alleged to be boundto take care would know would be directly affected by his careless act."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify">Clearly this duty was confined to the prevention of personal injury or damage to property. It was so generally understood for overfifty years albeit in <u>Hadley Byrne</u> v. <u>Heller</u> <strong><sup>(4)</sup></strong> the House of Lords allowed recovery for economic loss unrelated to personal injury or damage to property in circumstances where therepresentations of a party possessed of a special skill, which he accepts is relied upon by another, are made negligently to theother's detriment. Of <u>Donoghue</u> v. <u>Stevenson</u> <strong><sup>(1)</sup></strong> Lord Reid said, at p. 482:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"That is a very important decision, but I do not think that it has any direct bearing on this case.

LordKeith's speech in <u>Junior Books</u> v. <u>Veitchi</u> <strong><sup>(8)</sup></strong> at p. 535 was to like effect. However, as his speech in <u>Anns</u> v. <u>Merton L.B.C.</u> <strong><sup>(6)</sup></strong> proceeded, at p.759, Lord Wilberforce concluded that "the relevant damage is - material, physical damage."   That was a case wherethe local authority, by its surveyors, was held potentially liable in damages to leaseholders in respect of maisonettes which haddeveloped cracks due to failure properly to inspect the foundations.

There a beneficiary under a will recovered against a testator's solicitor the value of the benefits she had lost - or failed togain - through the solicitor's failure to advise the testator as to the provisions of the Wills Act 1837.

No question of reliance arose.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> In the meanwhile recovery of economic loss had been allowed in Australia: <u>Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty.</u> V. <u>The Dredge Willemstad</u> <strong><sup>(10)</sup></strong>. Two of the judges held that only plaintiffs who were specifically identifiable, as opposed to an indeterminate class, could recoverdamages caused them by the fracture of another's oil-pipeline and which was attributable to the defective navigation of a dredgeroperated by one defendant and to a defective chart prepared by another. The question had also thoroughly been examined in New Zealand:<u>Bowen</u> v. <u>Paramount Builders</u> <strong><sup>(11)</sup></strong>.</p>    <p align="justify">           </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> The next English case to allow recovery for economic loss was <u>Junior Books Ltd.</u> v. <u>Veitchi Co. Ltd.</u> <strong><sup>(8)</sup></strong> the ratio decidendi of which effectively binds this court. It is of critical importance to establish what that ratio decidendi wasand I do not believe that we can hide behind the anodyne formula "a decision on its own special facts". The supposed facts were thatdefendants laid a defective floor, which posed no present or foreseeable danger to person or property, in a factory being built forthe plaintiffs with whom as nominated sub-contractors, they had no contractual relationship. They made no negligent misstatementas to its suitability. Economic loss was suffered by the plaintiffs in that they would be put to the expense of replacing the floorand sustain reduced profits meanwhile. By a majority the House of Lords held that the plaintiffs could recover these monies by wayof damages and thus gave effect to the opinion which had been expressed by Lord Reid in <u>Home Office</u> v. <u>Dorset Yacht Co. Ltd.</u> <strong><sup>(12)</sup></strong> at p. 1026 to the effect that Lord Atkin's statement of principle in <u>Donoghue</u> v. <u>Stevenson</u> <strong><sup>(1)</sup></strong> "ought to apply unless there is some justification or valid explanation for its exclusion", but not to his view that economic losswas validly to be excluded. Lord Roskill at pp. 545-6 accepted the principles of the tort of negligence which had been enunciatedby Lord Wilberforce in <u>Anns</u> v. <u>Merton L.B.C.</u> <strong><sup>(6)</sup></strong> at p. 751 and, in the light of the plaintiffs' reliance on the defendants' skill and knowledge, that the test of proximity was satisfied.In relation to policy he concluded:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I see no reason why what was called during the argument 'damage to the pocket' simpliciter should be disallowed when 'damage to thepocket' coupled with physical damage has hitherto always been allowed. I do not think that this development, if development it be,will lead to untoward consequences."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify">Lord Fraser and Lord Russell agreed as, with some reservations, did Lord Keith. The only obstacle to recovery for economic loss postulatedby Lord Russell which would not be surmounted on proof of the supposed facts before us is that of identification by the Commissionerof the potential depositors but in <u>Candlewood</u> v. <u>Mitsui</u> <strong><sup>(13)</sup></strong> at p.24 Lord Fraser explained:</p>    <p align="justify">           </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">- their Lordships have difficulty in seeing how to distinguish between a plaintiff as an individual and a plaintiff as member of anunascertained class. The test can hardly be whether the plaintiff is known by name to the wrongdoer. Nor does it seem logical forthe test to depend upon the plaintiff being a single individual. Further, why should there be a distinction for this purpose betweena case where the wrongdoer knows (or has the means of knowing) that the persons likely to be affected by his negligence consist ofa definite number of persons whom he can identify either by name or in some other way (for example as being the owners of particularfactories or hotels) and who may therefore be regarded as an ascertained class, and a case where the wrongdoer knows only that thereare several persons, the exact number being to him unknown, and some or all of whom he could not identify by name or otherwise, andwho may therefore be regarded as an unascertained class?"</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">He went on to suggest that it would matter not were the ascertained class large.</p>    <p align="justify">          </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> On the basis of the supposed facts before us the Commissioner is charged not with causing the financial collapse of Panama FinanceCo., Ltd. but with failing to prevent such an eventuality or to suspend the company's registration. His position closely parallelsthat of the building inspectors in <u>Dutton</u> v. <u>Bognor Regis U.D.C.</u> <strong><sup>(14)</sup></strong> and <u>Anns</u> v. <u>Merton L.B.C.</u> <strong><sup>(6)</sup></strong> and also of the prison officers in <u>Home Office</u> v. <u>Dorset Yacht Co.

It seems to me better to consider the particular relationship in hand, and see whether or not, as a matterof policy, economic loss should be recoverable, or not."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify">Applying that test to the supposed facts before us and despite the submissions of the Attorney General that many organs of governmentmight, by way of analogy, find themselves subject to claim for compensation were we to allow this appeal, I see no policy reasonor reason in strict logic why damages, which, in general terms, the Commissioner must have foreseen would result from failure effectivelyto exercise his powers, should not be recoverable if the plaintiffs are able to demonstrate at trial that, far from concerning themselvesonly with the rate of interest offered or exercising personal judgment on the basis of generally available information, they indeedrelied upon the Commissioner to protect their interests and that for no acceptable reason he failed so to do in the lamentable manneralleged. The Commissioner must, in any event, have appreciated that at least some depositors and potential depositors would be relyingon the prudential exercise of his responsibilities. As Lord Russell said in <u>Junior Books</u> v. <u>Veitchi Co.

One of those cases was <u>Leigh and Sillivan Ltd.</u> v. <u>Aliakmon Ltd.</u> <strong><sup>(18)</sup></strong> where Goff L.J. held that buyers of steel coils were unable to recover from shipowners damages to the goods sustained as a resultof bad storage. His reasons were that storage was not the (vicarious) responsibility of the shipowners. Sir John Donaldson M.R. wasof the opinion that although the necessary degree of proximity obtained as between the parties, special considerations, includingthe operation of the Hague Rules, precluded recovery while Oliver L.J. thought that foreseeability alone did not suffice to createa duty of care stating at pp. 374 and 382:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"- where there is a well-established line of decisions of superior courts from which it appears that the law has consistently adopteda policy of denying the existence of a duty of care in certain well-defined situations where loss to somebody is nevertheless clearlyforeseeable as an end result, one must, I think, inquire whether anything has occurred which renders those decisions no longer applicableas representing the policy of the law. - For my part, I consider that <u>The Wear Breeze</u> <strong><sup>(19)</sup></strong> still represents the policy of the law by reference to which the existence of a duty of care in negligence is to be judged in thesecircumstances."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p align="justify"> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">No well established line of decisions is available to guide us in the particular circumstances of the instant appeal.

One of the defendants had manufactured pumps used for the oxygenation of fish tanks in which reposed the plaintiff's lobsters. Thepumps failed, the lobsters died and the plaintiff claimed damages for breach of the duty of care said to be owed him by the defendantin question. It was held that there had been insufficient reliance by the plaintiff on the defendant and insufficient proximity togive rise to a duty of care in respect of economic loss but sufficient to allow recovery for the damages to and death of the lobstersand for the loss that resulted from such physical damage. In effect the court held that more exacting criteria are required to establisha duty in respect of economic loss unrelated to physical or material damage as compared with the criteria required to establish aduty when those factors are present. Robert Goff L.J. concluded at p. 1007:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"- it is, I think, safest for this court to treat <u>Junior Books</u> <strong><sup>(8)</sup></strong> as a case in which, on its particular facts, there was considered to be such a very close relationship between the parties that thedefenders could, if the facts as pleaded were proved, be held liable to the pursuers."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify">Nourse and O'Connor L.JJ. agreed and emphasized the requirements of close proximity and reliance.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> For my part I accept as the ratio decidendi of <u>Junior Books</u> <strong><sup>(8)</sup></strong> the proposition that when a plaintiff is shown, by the application of the neighbour principle, to be so closely proximate to thedefendant that the defendant must have realised that the plaintiff relied or would rely upon his knowledge or skill in relation totangible and physical property the plaintiff can recover economic loss which, by reason of the defendant's failure to use such knowledgeor skill and of consequent defect in the property, he has suffered. Applying that proposition to the supposed facts before us - whetheror not the draft amended pleading explicitly avers each relevant factor; to the provisions and effect of the Ordinance, already carefullyanalysed by Fuad J.A., and to the "agreed question" I conclude that the test of proximity fails because no knowledge or skill inrelation to tangible and physical property was relied upon. The other requirements are apparently satisfied.
