The plaintiff, a limited company,appeared, as it has before us, by counsel Mr. Benjamin Chain. The Defendant has appeared throughout in person.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The action was founded on trepass. Paragraph 1 of the Amended Particulars of Claim - the writ was first issued in the District Court- alleged "the Plaintiff is and was at all material times the registered owner and entitled to possession of the premises ... " TheDefendant's wrongful entry is said to have been "on a date unknown to the Plaintiff prior to September 1983".</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The Defendant did not dispute the Plaintiff's title but sought to justify his possession. In his Defence, as it stood at the commencementof the trial before the learned Judge, he relied upon -</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="89%">        <tr>            <td width="21%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="79%" class="quote">...... an oral agreement (which was never reduced into writing) made on or about the 17th day of March 1983, the Plaintiff by itsservants or agents, Mr. and Mrs. Lee Tse Kong (who were in occupation of the said premises) and Gainfast Property Agency, grantedto the Defendant a tenancy of the said premises at a rent of $2,600 per month exclusive of rates payable in advance on the 15th dayof each month, to be paid direct to the Plaintiff's servant or agent, at its registered office......"</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify">He further averred -</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="21%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="79%" class="quote">..... that the Plaintiff by its servants or agents one Jennie Shuen and one Mrs. Catherine Wong granted to the Defendant a tenancyof the suit premises, by consenting for the Defendant to occupy the suit premises on the 20th day of April 1983 and the 23rd dayof May 1983 respectively."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <blockquote>                        <p align="justify"> </p>                    </blockquote>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Then, just before the learned Judge gave judgment, the Defendant obtained leave to add a further grant of tenancy by one Tan GeokTee, a director of the Plaintiff. However the Judge's rejection of that suggestion is not challenged by any ground of appeal.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Finally on the third day of the hearing in this Court we gave leave to add yet another ground of justification which, after amendmenton the 5th and final day, suggests that the Defendant is and was at all times the licencee of one Chan Chun Hon Annette ("Annette")and that the Plaintiff has treated him as such.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> To understand the Defendant's case it is necessary to go back to 1978. On the 29th November of that year the Plaintiff granted a3 year tenancy to Annette at a rent of $2,000 per month exclusive of rates payable in advance on the 15th of each month. The learnedJudge below assumed that when the 3 year period expired on the 14th December 1981 the tenancy was automatically continued by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7" class="autolink_findacts">Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7">Cap. 7</a>.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Until July 1979 the rent was paid regularly by cheques drawn on the account of one Louis Lee Kwok Kin. The Defendant suggests thatat that stage Annette moved out and that the flat was taken over by a Mr. and Mrs. David Lee together with their child and amah.There is evidence from another tenant which tends to support this suggestion and certainly from then until April 1983 the rent wasregularly paid by cheques drawn on the account of one Lee Tee Kong David. The rent receipts however remained in the name of Annetteand an application submitted to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation in September or October 1981, which resulted in an increaseof rent to $2,600 as from December, named Annette as the Respondent.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The evidence of the Defendant was that in March 1983, when Mr. and Mrs. Lee were preparing to move elsewhere, he was introduced tothem by a David Fan of the Gainfast Property Agency. He was taken to the premises and there was at that time, as the Judge lateraccepted on the balance of probabilities, a notice attached to the main gate advising that space was available for rent. The Defendantwas then taken to another flat in Bowen Road but preferred the one in question. He went back later with the agent and paid Mr. Lee$6,500 for the purchase of fixtures and fittings, something towards the rent already paid and $6,000 "by way of deposit". He foundthe request for that last amount curious, but was assured that it was common practice in Hong Kong, "landlords not concerning themselvesto execute a tenancy agreement with every occupant of the premises". The Defendant had at the time only very recently arrived inthe Colony. He was also told that the landlord did not want the name changed in any other document or bill.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> His evidence continues that he duly paid the agency fee to Mr. Fan and moved in on the evening of 20th April. He had difficulty withsome of his larger furniture and Stephen Liu, a solicitor's clerk who was helping him move, approached a Jennie Shuen who lives onthe ground floor. Jennie Shuen is employed by a company associated with the Plaintiff by common directorships and which shares thesame office premises and telephone lines. Stephen Liu said in his evidence that he told Jennie Shuen that the Defendant had rentedthe top flat and that she kindly allowed him to leave a bed at the bottom of the staircase overnight.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The Defendant concedes before us that he has no evidence to support the suggestion that either David Lee or Gainfast had authorityto act on behalf of the Plaintiff. He says that he believed what he was told, but that does not assist him. The crucial questionis how much the Plaintiff knew of what had in fact occurred, for undoubtedly the Plaintiff accepted rent for the ensuing 4 months.However, the two versions of how that happened, are in stark contradiction.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The rent due on the 15th May was paid by a cashier's order, drawn on the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation. The Defendantchose this method, so he said in evidence, partly for financial reasons and partly because he had been told that the landlord likedit that way. The order covered the rent then due and electricity charges with which Annette had been billed. The Defendant said thathe put the bill and the cashier's order in a plain envelope and went to the Plaintiff's office. There he specifically asked to seea Catherine Wong, who manages the premises for the Plaintiff, and when she came in answer to the receptionist's telephone call, hehanded her the envelope and told her that he had movedin since the 20th April. She acknowledged, he said, with a smile and walkedaway. Rent was paid similarly on the 27th June and the 28th July, save that he drew his own cheques. Each time he asked specificallyto see Catherine Wong and each time he handed the cheque to her personally. He delayed payment of the rent due in August becauseof problems with water in the toilet and lighting on the staircase. But when he did pay it, on the 14th September, he did it in likemanner by a cheque handed personally to Catherine Wong. On all save the first occasion he was accompanied by a Miss Chui, who gaveevidence in his support.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> As the water and lighting problems continued and Jennie Shuen, the lady on the ground floor, was declining to discuss the situationthe Defendant, so he said, wrote a letter of complaint. This he left at the reception desk in the Plaintiff's office. He receivedno reply. However on the 5th November he decided it would be wrong to withhold the rent further and left a cheque, together witha note referring to his letter, also on the reception desk in the Plaintiff's office. He, and Miss Chui, said that the cheque waspushed under his door a few days later.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The Defendant said further that he was concerned over the arrears of rent and therefore, on the 12th November, he took to CatherineWong a cheque to cover one month's rent and outstanding electricity charges. He informed her that he was withholding the second month'sdue until the services were properly restored. It was then, and only then he said, that she made the suggestion that he was an illegaltenant.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The version of Catherine Wong is very different. The first time she saw the Defendant was on the 15th September, (not the 14th Septemberwhich was the day the Defendant said he paid rent to her). The receptionist was not on duty that day and Catherine Wong was in herboss' room discussing business when the Defendant and a Chinese lady came to the counter outside. She approached to enquire his businessand the Defendant complained about the state of the premises in question. Upon further inquiry he said that he was the tenant ofthe top floor. This surprised her and she informed her boss. As a result of what he said she told the Defendant that he was not alegal occupant and should leave the premises immediately. At this he repeated his complaints and threatened action should he sufferan accident. He then left. In November he returned to make similar complaints to which she observed that she had already told himto move out. Thereafter the Plaintiff returned all cheques tendered by him in payment of the rent. (It is common ground that thecheque dated the 14th September was the last payment accepted by the Plaintiff.)</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The Judge preferred the evidence of Catherine Wong to that of the Defendant and Miss Chui. He said that he was "on the whole of theevidence ..... satisfied that Catherine Wong did not meet the Defendant until 15/9/83". He does not expressly say that he was satisfiedthat until then she had no idea that he was even there at all, or that Annette had moved out, but he found Catherine Wong "accuratein all material parts of her evidence", "an honest witness," and "a witness upon whom I felt I certainly could rely", and those twocontentions permeated the whole of her testimony. The Judge accepted that Jennie Shuen knew the Defendant was there, but he was notpersuaded that she was "an agent of the Plaintiff for any purpose other than simply, perhaps from time to time, to carry some messagesor keys". He found nothing in the evidence relating to her "from which it could be imputed, on the balance of probabilities, thatthe Plaintiff had knowledge of the Defendant's occupation as a tenant".</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The Notice of Appeal, as first served, set out 51 grounds. Two more were added when the appeal was called on and we gave leave toadd yet another on the third day of the hearing and to amend it on the last. Several of the original grounds were withdrawn duringthe hearing, including a few which had already been argued. Some were later reinstated. I do not propose to deal with those now inissue seriatim. It has not been in all cases easy to understand the exact ground of complaint but very broadly speaking I think theymay be conveniently dealt with under the four following heads, and I append to each the grounds which I think subsumed thereunder.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="4%" valign="top" height="44">1.</td>            <td width="79%" height="44">                Findings of fact (Grounds 4, 5, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 28, 31 and 33)                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%" height="44"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="4%" valign="top" height="20">2.</td>            <td width="79%" height="20">                Irregularities in the trial (Grounds 38, 39 and 40)                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%" height="20"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="4%" valign="top" height="20">3.</td>            <td width="79%" height="20">                Legal submissions (Grounds 12, 52, 53 and 54)                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%" height="20"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="4%" valign="top" height="20">4.</td>            <td width="79%" height="20">Damages (Grounds 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49 and 50)</td>            <td width="17%" height="20"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><u>Findings of Fact</u></p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Three findings of the learned Judge appear to be attacked: -</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%"></td>            <td width="9%" valign="top">1.</td>            <td width="64%">                That Jennie Shuen had no authority to let;                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%"></td>            <td width="9%" valign="top">2.</td>            <td width="64%">                That Catherine Wong had no authority to let; and                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%"></td>            <td width="9%" valign="top">3.</td>            <td width="64%">That Catherine Wong had no knowledge of the Defendant's presence until the 15th September 1983.</td>            <td width="17%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The whole of the building at 28 Arbuthnot Road is owned by the Plaintiff. It contains 7 flats, one unit on each floor, and a carpark below. Catherine Wong said that the Plaintiff had authorised no one to act as its agent for letting out flats because the flatswere not put out for general rent. They were kept for the use of local staff, or for personnel who came up from branch offices inSingapore or Taiwan. There were exceptions. One was the flat let to a Dr. and Mrs. Li on the 4th floor. That was a decision madeby her boss. So far as the "to let notice" on the gate was concerned it was not authorised by the Plaintiff even though the telephonenumbers given on it, for enquiry by day or night, belonged respectively to the Plaintiff and to Jennie Shuen.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Mrs. Li's evidence was that it was through a similar notice in 1977, and a telephone call to the number given, that her tenancy wasin fact obtained. But she added however, that the person who showed her over the flat did not have the authority to grant her a tenancy.That had to wait until she and her husband had been seen by "Mrs. Tan, the wife of the boss".</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> In these circumstances it does not seem unreasonable to me for the Judge to conclude, as he did, that the building was "not on themarket" in the usual sense. Even had it been, the mere exhibition of Jennie Shuen's telephone number for those wishing to make inquiriesby night would not of itself have indicated that she had been given authority to grant a tenancy binding upon the Plaintiff. It issaid that she held herself out as having such authority. I am not sure that the evidence of Stephen Liu really went that far, buteven if it did there is no evidence which might impose liability for her words upon the Plaintiff.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> As to Catherine Wong, she conceded herself to be the manager of the building and responsible for collection of rent and other charges.It is true that she signed the tenancy agreement with Dr. Li and with Annette, but in each case it was only as a witness to the signatureof someone else who then represented the Company. There is no evidence which indicates any wider authority.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The Defendant has launched a wide ranging attack on the credibility of Catherine Wong. He observes that when giving evidence in theDistrict Court, before the action was transferred, she had dealt with the incident of the 15th September in much lesser detail. Shehad not mentioned her speaking to her boss, the Defendant's threat of action against the Company or the repetition of his complaints.In that court too she was certain that he returned on the 15th November, whereas later she was not sure whether it was the 15th orthe 12th. She had also there denied seeing a letter written by the Defendant on the 12th November although in the trial below sheadmitted that the person in the firm whom she called "the legal adviser" had shown it to her. She had spoken then of Jennie Shuenas "one of our staff" who had worked for the Company since 1975. In view of the close relationship of the two companies that is perhapsan understandable looseness of language.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> In the Court below there is said to be a contradiction between her evidence and that of Mrs. Li as to whether or not the latter complainedto her of the way in which the Defendant dealt with his garbage on the staircase.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Then the Defendant draws our attention to the lack of possible corroboration. Miss Mak was not called - we understand that she tookanother job some time before the trial and was not to be found at the address given by the Plaintiff's office -, nor was a book availablein which she was said to have kept a record of all incoming cheques or money orders. Mr. Tan, Catherine Wong's boss, did not come,despite the Defendant's efforts to serve him with a subpoena.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Much play has been made of the addition of the words "without prejudice" to the majority of rent receipts issued as from September1981. Catherine Wong said that the caveat should have been added to all receipts, but that sometimes the typist forgot. She alsosaid that instructions to that effect had been given to her in 1978, and at one stage in cross-examination she put the date as 1964.If either date is correct there is no apparent reason why the first use is not until 1981. It is suggested that the words were introducedthen because it was then that the landlord discovered that Annette was in breach of her tenancy in some way, as for example by sublettingor parting with the possession of the premises, and that the landlord wished to preserve its position while still being able to collectthe rent.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The Defendant has drawn our attention to the electricity charges. Catherine Wong said that the cost of lighting the public parts,that is the staircase, was shared equally between all the tenants, but a perusal of the receipts seems to show that once the Defendantwent into occupation the bills sent to Annette, and which he paid, covered the whole of that expense.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Finally the Defendant asked us to take into account the fact that neither he nor Miss Chiu, "an independent witness", were shakenin cross-examination.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In my judgment none of these considerations, whether taken individually or in the whole, can in any way whatsoever be conclusive.They are such as could be, and no doubt were in this instance, properly urged upon the trial Judge. He would have taken them intoaccount to such extent as he thought fit. Moreover he had the advantage, which we do not, of being able to assess their value inthe light of his judgment on each particular witness. In fact he relied heavily on the contemporaneous documents. In his opinion,with which I agree, these provided "support for the Plaintiff's case and Catherine Wong's evidence". He referred in particular tothe rent receipts. He could have mentioned as well the Defendant's letter of the 12th November. This was written on the Defendant'sreturn from the office on that day when, as he claimed, he was first told that his presence in the flat was illegal. He writes inthe letter that that allegation came to him as a matter of great surprise, since Jennie Shuen had seen him actually moving in. Hecomplains that Jennie Shuen was in the office at the time but Catherine Wong refused to verify what he said. He continues by referringto complaints he had made subsequently to Jennie Shuen, to letters he had written to the Plaintiff and to his attempt to pay a reducedrent. He concludes with the threat of criminal proceedings. If in fact Catherine Wong had at the outset given tacit agreement tohis becoming a tenant I would have expected that to have been the main thrust of his letter. It was of far greater moment than theknowledge of someone who at most was no more than a part-time concierge. I would have expected an indignant outburst at CatherineWong's perfidious conduct in reneging from that agreement. Yet there is nothing. The best that the Defendant can now suggest is thatit is incorporated in the contention that "you .... had been accepting $2,600 rent from me personally since the 15th May 1983". Formy <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7#p1" class="autolink_findacts">part I</a> see no reason to interfere with the factual conclusions of the Judge below.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><u>Irregularities of trial</u></p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The first step that the Plaintiff took to recover the premises by way of litigation was an application lodged in the Victoria LandsTribunal in October 1984. It alleged principally an unlawful subletting by Annette to the Defendant and made both of them respondents.On the 5th March 1985 the Plaintiff obtained judgment in default against Annette for possession, arrears of rent, mesne profits upto the delivery of vacant possession and small amounts by way of repair and electricity charges. The hearing of the application againstthe Defendant had been set for the 3rd April, but on that day he failed to appear and judgment was given in default. The judgmentwas later set aside and further proceedings were discontinued on the 30th July.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Paragraph 10 of the Particulars of Claim lodged in support of the Application alleged that the plaintiff first came to know of theDefendant's presence in the premises on or about the 12th November. It will be recalled that that was the date the Defendant saidcomplaint had first been made about his presence.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Mr. Lau Wing Keung, the Plaintiff's solicitor, said in evidence below that he was handed the Lands Tribunal file about 3 weeks beforethe hearing against the Defendant and observed the apparent inconsistency between the first discovery on the 12th November and therefusal to accept rent, also alleged in the same paragraph, since the 15th September. He therefore "called conference with Mrs. Wong.In consequence, I drafted amended grounds". In fact they were not used, for at the hearing, after discussion with the President ofthe Tribunal he withdrew his application to amend.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> In answer to the Defendant in cross-examination Mr. Lau said -</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="19%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="81%" class="quote">                <p align="justify" class="quote">        I spoke to Catherine Wong about a week before the hearing in Lands Tribunal.

This is not borne out by the Judge's record, which merely refers to her not seeing any document which mentionedthe 12th November. Be that as it may, it is common ground that objection was taken to any further cross-examination of Mr. Lau inthis respect and that the objection was upheld. The Defendant complains that the Judge was wrong to prevent his going further. Heconcedes that the information he hoped to obtain from Mr. Lau was privileged, but submits that since Mr. Lau himself broke the privilegehe the Defendant was entitled to carry on.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Support for the submission may be derived from <u>Great Atlantic Insurance</u> v. <u>Home Insurance</u> <sup>(1)</sup> where to read part of a privileged document in open court was held to be a waiver of privilege in respect of the rest. The privilegeis of course that of the client, not the legal representative, but counsel in the course of a trial carries the client's authority.Mr. Lau in the present instance, although the Plaintiff's solicitor, was giving evidence as a witness. There is nothing to indicatethat he had similar authority, and indeed the objection of the Plaintiff's counsel indicates that he did not. In my view the objectionwas properly upheld.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> In paragraph 5A of the Defence it was alleged that by reason of various matters earlier set out the Plaintiff was "estopped fromclaiming the Defendant to be a trespasser", and by 5B that the Plaintiff was "barred from recovering possession by reason of lathes,quasi estoppel, waiver and/or acquiescence by its servants or agents one Catherine Wong (manager) and one Jennie Shuen (caretaker/employeeof the said premises)."</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The Defendant claims that he was discouraged from pursuing these defences below because of adverse comments made by the Judge duringthe course of the Plaintiff's opening speech. That was unfortunate, but has not ultimately prejudiced the Defendant. He has pursuedthose defences before us and I am not persuaded that any one of them is sustainable.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><u>Submissions of law</u></p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> These may be divided into three. The first is that the Defendant is the licencee of Annette and has been treated as such by the Plaintiff.The submission was initially put in the alternative. Either the Plaintiff knew that the Defendant was in occupation and by raisingno objection must be taken to have accepted him as the licencee of Annette. Alternatively by allowing David Lee to take up occupation,Annette granted David Lee a licence, which he in turn assigned to the Defendant. The alternative approach was subsequently abandoned,together with the suggestion that when Annette's interest was terminated on the 5th March 1985 the Defendant became instead the licencesof the Plaintiff by operation of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 53(6A)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7" class="autolink_findacts">Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7">Cap. 7</a>. But in any event, however the Defendant may have become a licencee of Annette, if he did, his interest as such came to anend on the 5th March and cannot thereafter justify his possession against the Plaintiff.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The second suggestion is that although it was found that neither the Lees nor Gainfast had the requisite authority to support thetenancy which had been granted to the Defendant, the Plaintiff, by his acceptance of the Defendant as tenant or occupant, had providedthat authority by subsequent ratification. However if the Plaintiff had in fact accepted the Defendant as tenant, this submissionis to that extent otiose. And as the Judge did not accept that the Plaintiff knew of the Defendant's presence until the 15th September,it is to that extent misconceived.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Thirdly it is suggested that the Judge had no jurisdiction to make an award of mesne profits as the Plaintiff had already, on the5th March, obtained a similar order in the Lands Tribunal against Annette. We have been referred to Order 13 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 1</a> of the Rules of the Supreme Court, to the notes in the White Book at 13/1/6 and 13/1/16 and to the authority of <u>Cross</u> v. <u>Matthews</u><sup>(2)</sup>. Order 13 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 1</a> relates to claims for liquidated damages. <u>Cross</u> v. <u>Matthews</u><sup>(2)</sup> was concerned with the alternative contractual liability of an agent and his principal. The Defendant is liable as a tort feasor.So, according to the judgment of the Lands Tribunal, is Annette. There cannot of course be double recovery - although we understandthat nothing has as yet been recovered from Annette - and there may be perhaps a question of contribution, yet I see no reason whyjudgment should not actually be entered against both.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> During the course of his submission the Defendant has referred us to a few rules of court, authorities and ordinances other thanthose I have already mentioned. I do not mean to be discourteous when I say that I have found in them no help in the formulationof my conclusion.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><u>Damages</u></p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> There only remains the question of the level of mesne profits, together with that of interest payable thereon and costs.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> The learned Judge took as a starting point the rent payable by Annette until the 14th December 1983. He assumed that in normal circumstancesthe Plaintiff would at that time have applied for and been granted an increase, which the Judge thought would have been at least$500. He assumed that there would have been a similar increase again in December 1985 and he made his award accordingly, paymentto commence as from the 15th September 1983.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> With every respect to the learned Judge that date cannot be correct, for until the Plaintiff obtained the termination of Annette'stenancy on the 5th March 1985 the Plaintiff had no right to possession and could not have maintained an action for trespass.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Mr. Chain however seeks to uphold the Judge's order, at least to some extent, on the ground that by the 5th March, and by one meansor another Annette's tenancy had already come to an end. The first means suggested is surrender by operation of law. The possibilitythat a tenancy within the protection of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> of the Ordinance can be so surrendered is supported by authority<sup>(3)</sup>. It occurred in the present instance, says Mr. Chain, because Annette abandoned her tenancy and the Plaintiff accepted the position.For the purposes of the argument I am prepared to accept that Annette did abandon her tenancy at some time before the Defendant movedin. The question is whether the plaintiff subsequently accepted that. Reliance is placed upon 4 letters. The first is by the Plaintiff'sformer solicitors and is dated the 19th December 1983. It is addressed to the Defendant and requires him to vacate the flat underthreat of legal proceedings. I note in passing that it expressly refers to Annette as "the rightful tenant". The second letter waswritten to Annette by the Plaintiff itself. It is with respect not in the clearest of terms but appears to assume that Annette stillhad possession or control of the flat. The next letter of the 20th June was sent by the Plaintiff's present solicitor to the Defendantand threatened to go against him in trespass. That of course would not be possible if Annette's tenancy was still in existence andso it is suggested that the Plaintiff must have accepted that it was not. However as the same solicitors' letter to Annette one monthlater clearly accepted her still to be the tenant, and that as 3 months after that, and presumably on their advice, the Plaintiffbrought proceedings against her in the Lands Tribunal, it seems to me with respect that the letter of the 20th June represented nomore than a misconception of the Plaintiff's position. In my judgment Annette's tenancy was at no time surrendered by operation oflaw.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Mr. Chain next has recourse to the common law doctrine of relation back, which establishes that, if I may quote from <u>Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation</u> v. <u>Ilford Gas Company</u> <sup>(4)</sup>, to which he referred us -</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="83%">        <tr>            <td width="19%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="81%" class="quote">..... in an action of trespass the right to sue, as against the wrong-doer, relates back after entry to the time at which the rightto enter accrued, so as to give a right of action for trespass intermediate in point of time between the date of the right to enterand that of the actual entry."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <blockquote>                        <p align="justify"> </p>                    </blockquote>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> It is suggested that the Plaintiff's right to enter accrued as soon as Annette parted with possession to the Lees. Of course in onesense that may have given the Plaintiff a right to re-enter but until it did so her tenancy continued and whoever might have beenthere with her permission was in no sense a wrong- doer. By the time the Defendant moved into occupation the Plaintiff had no contractualrights of re-entry. His right depended upon a court order.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Finally Mr. Chain makes the bold proposition that when the contractual period expired on the 14th December 1983 the tenancy had alreadylost the protection of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> and was therefore not automatically continued by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52(1).</a> The proposition requires reading into <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 51</a>, which provides that a "domestic tenancy", to which <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> applies, means a tenancy of "premises let as a dwelling", the additional words, "for the tenant". Thus, as before the end of thecontractual tenancy the premises had become the dwelling not of Annette but of Mr. and Mrs. Lee, the premises fell beyond the definition.I see no reason to make that addition to the ordinance.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> The principle on which mesne profits should have been assessed was recently explained in England by Megaw L.J. in <u>Swordheath Properties</u> v. <u>Tabet</u> <sup>(5)</sup> and accepted by this Court in <u>Attorney-General</u> v. <u>Stephen Chiu Kwok Chun</u> <sup>(6)</sup> -</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="89%">        <tr>            <td width="19%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="81%" class="quote">        It appears to me to be clear, both as a matter of principle and of authority, that in a case of this sort the plaintiff, whenhe has established that the defendant has remained on as a trespasser in residential property, is entitled, without bringing evidencethat he could or would have let the property to someone else in the absence of the trespassing defendant, to have as damages forthe trespass the value of the property as it would fairly be calculated; and, in the absence of anything special in the particularcase it would be the ordinary letting value of the property that would determine the amount of the damages."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <blockquote>                        <p align="justify"> </p>                    </blockquote>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> The Judge made no attempt to adopt that approach, although in the circumstances it would not have been easy, for there was not muchin the way of evidence to help him. The rateable value, that is the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation's estimate of the ordinaryletting value, jumped dramatically from $12,000 per annum in January 1984 to $52,800 as from April of the same year. However CatherineWong would have been prepared to accept $3,000 as at July 1985 and the rent charged to Mrs. Lee for a larger flat on the 4th floor- the premises has no lift - is still only $3,734. The Plaintiff was content to limit its claim in the Lands Tribunal to $2,600 permonth. The Defendant's own assessment in a letter to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation at the end of 1983 was between $15,000and $17,000, taking into account the physical state of the premises and construction work in its environment. Some allowance shouldbe made in figures derived from the Plaintiff for the fact that the Plaintiff was only willing to accept tenants of whom its directorapproved, but even an "open market" tenant would expect some discount for an unlit staircase, inadequate water in the toilet anda defective window. All in all I would propose $3,000 per month as the appropriate figure, to commence, as I mentioned earlier, fromthe 5th March 1985.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> The Judge awarded interest on the mesne profits at the rate of 4.5% per annum. It is in my experience unusual for interest to beawarded in cases of this kind, possibly as a result of the authority to which my Lord Kempster J.A. will refer. No special reasonis here indicated and I would suggest that the award be deleted.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Finally the Judge ordered costs of the two days' hearing in the District Court to be taxed on the High Court scale with certificatefor counsel. If my assessment of the value of the flat be correct the action could have concluded within the District Court and soit would, had the Defendant been content to let the District Judge's original decision as to jurisdiction stand. It was only hissubsequent reopening of the question that led to the transfer of the action to the High Court, and I would therefore make no variationin the order of the Judge below.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> For these reasons I would allow the appeal, but only to the extent of varying the order for mesne profits in the ways that I haveindicated.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(D.

I am satisfied that there are no grounds for interfering with the finding of Mortimer,J. that the defendant was at no time the plaintiffs' tenant or for our making an alternative finding that he was at any time thelicensee either of Annette Chan or of the plaintiffs.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> The plaintiffs had no right to enter upon the flat occupied by the defendant and, consequently, to claim possession or damages fortrespass not injurious to the reversion until, on 5th March 1985, they secured an order, by default, in the Lands Tribunal for possessionas against their tenant, Annette Chan. Neither this order nor the supporting affirmation of the plaintiffs' assistant manager, LiangShe Chieh, made on 11th December 1984, were put before the trial judge. By the affirmation the plaintiffs claim to have become awarethat their tenant had parted with possession in about November 1983 and, ostensibly by some process of precognition, already to haveceased to accept payments from the defendant on account of rent as from the 15th September. However, according to the evidence ofCatherine Wong at trial it was in September that she, and therefore the plaintiffs, had learned of the defendant's presence and ofhis claim to be their tenant. Further, and upon what evidence we know not, the plaintiffs went on to assert that, also in breachof covenant, Annette Chan had sublet to the defendant on or about 20th April 1983. The grant by her of a licence to occupy wouldnot of itself have constituted a breach. <u>Lam Kee King</u> v <u>Lam Shes Tong</u> <sup>(7)</sup>. Prior to September 1983 the plaintiffs had been at pains to affirm Annette Chan's tenancy albeit her rent and other financial obligationswere invariably discharged by third parties.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> As from 5th March 1985 the plaintiffs, whose title to the premises has not been challenged, became entitled to secure an order forpossession as against the defendant and to recover damages for his trespass. "It is in their Lordships' view unnecessary to considerto what extent at the present day, more than a century after the abolition of forms of action, actual entry by the person havingtitle to the land is necessary to found a cause of action in trespass as distinct from ejectment or recovery of possession." perLord Diplock in <u>Ocean Estates Ltd.</u> v <u>Pinder</u> <sup>(8)</sup>.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> Faced with this probable conclusion and anxious to retain their award of damages as from 15th September 1983 the plaintiffs soughtto adopt some of the defendant's arguments and to impeach the Lands Tribunal Order, which they themselves had obtained, on the footingthat such tribunal had acted without jurisdiction. They submitted that Annette Chan's tenancy had not continued pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7" class="autolink_findacts">Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance</a> after 14th December 1981, when the term expired, since she had not retained possession. It was an exercise doomed to failure. Thesection in question applies to domestic tenancies, not to domestic tenants, and, prima facie, a continuing domestic tenancy, as definedin <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.51</a>, may only be determined as provided in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52(1).</a> Even if such a tenancy may be surrendered by operation of law otherwise than as provided by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s52a.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 52A</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">53</a>(1), as held in <u>Hong Kong Investment Co. Ltd.</u> v  <u>Dawstan Ltd.</u><sup>(3)</sup> and as to which I express no opinion, the thrust of the evidence at trial, accepted by the judge, was that nothing was done by theplaintiffs which could be construed as an assent to any act by or on behalf of Annette Chan inconsistent with the continuance ofher tenancy. Alternatively it was submitted that, despite the express terms of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52</a> (1B), the continuing tenancy could notionally be deemed forfeited by the plaintiffs so as to allow the recovery of damages from theearlier date pursuant to the doctrine of "trespass by relation". This submission too was unsustainable.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> The amount of damages recoverable by the plaintiffs is the measure of the value to the defendant of his occupation and to be gaugedby market rates. <u>Attorney General</u> v <u>Stephen Chiu</u> <sup>(6)</sup>. The rate of $2,600 per month was claimed in Mr. Liang's affirmation and, when the hearing of the present action began in the DistrictCourt, Catherine Wong said she would ask for $3,200 but might agree to $3,000 per month. Presumably her answer was given in the contextof a lease in similar terms to that granted to Annette Chan. There is also evidence as to the rateable value and as to the rent payablefor a larger flat in the same block. Mortimer J. awarded $3,600 per month on the basis of likely permitted increases. But it wasfor the plaintiffs positively to establish the letting value of the 5th Floor, No. 28 Arbuthnot Road and, in my view, the evidenceadduced warranted an award of damages as from 6th March 1985 until possession be given at the rate of $3,000 per month and no more.Further, the award of interest could overcompensate the plaintiffs. <u>Whitwham</u> v <u>Westminster Brymbo Co.</u> <sup>(9)</sup> per Chitty J.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Damages may properly be awarded against the defendant albeit the plaintiffs have obtained an equivalent order as against AnnetteChan in the Lands Tribunal.
