style="text-align:center">___________________________________</p>    <p style="text-align:center"><b> </b></p>    <p><b>Hon Tang JA</b> (giving the reasons for judgment of the Court):</p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  The plaintiffsâ claim against the defendants is for damages for libel and slander, interference with economic relations and maliciousfalsehood as well as an injunction to prevent further libel and interference with the plaintiffsâ contractual relations.  The plaintiffsâclaim was âpermanentlyâ stayed on the basis of forum non conveniens by Deputy Judge Carlson.  The plaintiffs appealed that order.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant are rivals in the garment trade, having extensive business interests in both the US and Japan.  They are registered inHong Kong.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff is a director of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and chairman of the Esquel group of companies, of which the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff is part.  She is a Hong Kong resident.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is a director of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, maintaining a residence here although he also resides elsewhere abroad.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  For the libel claim, the plaintiffs rely on two letters dated 20 October 2003 and 8 March 2004 written by or on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to Mitsui, one of the plaintiffsâ customers at its Tokyo office.  This is pleaded in para. 14 of the statement of claim. Publication was therefore in Japan.  The gist of the letters was an assertion that the shirts which were sold by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to Mitsui infringed the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs patents in Japan.  These Japanese patents related to a method of manufacture of shirts that ensured the product tobe wrinkle free.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The slander claim is pleaded in para. 15 of the statement of claim.  As explained by Mr Chua, SC, counsel for the plaintiffs, thecomplaint is that in 2003 and 2004, the defendants, through their staff and agents, had said in the US to various of the plaintiffsâUS customers, that the plaintiffsâ wrinkle free shirt products infringed the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs US patents and also that the Japanese customers of the plaintiffs had been told in Japan that the plaintiffsâ wrinklefree products infringed the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs Japanese patents.  The alleged slander therefore took place in the US.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The claims made in respect of interference with economic relations and malicious falsehood are essentially based on the same allegedacts of defamation just identified.  It is unnecessary to deal with these causes of action separately.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  It can thus be seen that underlying the plaintiffsâ complaints is the issue of whether the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs patents in Japan and the US have been infringed.  The statement of claim actually pleads that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs products do not.  In our view, it is inevitable that the issue of infringement will be at the heart of the litigationbetween the parties.  The defendants are bound to plead justification as a defence to the defamation claims.  The judge said thatthe present case âis all about patents â not Hong Kong patents but Japanese and US patentsâ.  With respect, we agree.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  It will be convenient to refer to the libel claim in Japan as the Japanese defamation, and to refer the alleged US slander as theUS defamation.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  From the foregoing it can be seen that there are two distinct claims for defamation, one claim concerning the US patents, the otherclaim the Japanese patents.  The Japanese defamation was committed in Japan, the US defamation in the US.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Mr Chua SC submitted:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ that an appellate court can only interfere in 3 cases on an appeal against a decision whether to allow or refuse a stay ofan action:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1) Where the judge has misdirected himself with regard to the principles in accordance with which his discretion had to be exercised;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2) Where the judge in exercising his discretion, has taken into account matters he ought not to have done, or failed to take intoaccount matters he ought to have done; or</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3) Where his decision is plainly wrong.<br />        <b>Louvet v .

The only amendment required of the order below was that a stay of the action begranted, rather than a permanent stay.  Mr Liao SC for the defendants accepted this.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The test on applications for a stay on the basis of forum non conveniens is well-known.  It is derived from the decision of theHouse of Lords in <i>Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20AC%20460" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 AC 460</a> and adopted by this court in <i>The Adhiguna Meranti</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20HKLR%20904" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] HKLR 904.</a>  The judge has correctly identified the applicable legal principles, taking them from the note to O. 11 r. 1 para. 10 of the HongKong Civil Procedure, 2006, namely, that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the fundamental principle â¦ is that the court will choose that forum in which the case can be tried more suitably for theinterests of all the parties and for the ends of justice.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The judge adopted the three-stage approach commended by Hunter JA in <i>The Adhiguna Meranti</i> at page 907F-908B, and abbreviated by Nazareth J (as he then was) in the <i>Lanka Muditha</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20HKLR%20741" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 HKLR 741</a> at page 744:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(I)    Is it shown that Hong Kong is not only not the natural and appropriate forum for the trial, but that there is another availableforum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Hong Kong ...</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(II)    If the answer to (I) is yes, will a trial at this other forum deprive the plaintiff of any âlegitimate personal or juridicaladvantagesâ? The evidential burden here lies upon the plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(III)   If the answer to (II) is yes, a court has to balance the advantages of (I) against the disadvantages of (II) ... Deprivationof one or more personal or juridical advantages will not necessarily be fatal to the applicant provided that the court is satisfiedthat notwithstanding such loss âsubstantial justice will be done in the available appropriate forumâ ... Proof of this ... restsupon the applicant for the stay.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  At stage I, the judge followed the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <i>The</i> <i>Albaforth</i> [1984] 2 Lloydâs Rep. 91 which held:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ that the jurisdiction in which a tort has been committed is <i>prima facie</i> the natural forum for the determination of the dispute.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Since the Japanese defamation was committed in Japan and the US defamation committed in the US, the courts of Japan and the US are<i>prima facie</i> the natural fora for the determination of the Japanese and US defamations respectively.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Mr Chua has submitted that the place of commission of the tort is only a starting point and not determinative.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  However, the judge never said that the place where the tort was committed was determinative.  Insofar as Mr Chua relied on para.37 of the judgment as a contrary indication, Mr Chua has misunderstood the learned judge.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  This is what Mr Chua said in para. 5.8 of his submission:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âHowever, after finding that the torts complained of were committed abroad, the deputy judge went on to say (at judgment para. 37(D/24)) that:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthis <u>alone</u> will have been sufficient for the defendants to have succeeded at this stage of the enquiryâ (emphasis added).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  But in para. 37 of the judgment, the judge was dealing with the plaintiffsâ claim based on an alleged interference with the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs contractual relations.  This is what the judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ And so where the libel/malicious falsehood action so clearly falls under the purview of the courts of Japan, should the plaintiffsseek their assistance, so does the allegation concerning interference with the plaintiffsâ contractual relations.  This alone wouldhave been sufficient for the defendants to have succeeded at this stage of the enquiry.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The judge was not saying that the place of the commission of the tort was determinative, but that since the claim based on the allegedinterference with contractual relations was part and parcel of the libel action, as the libel/malicious falsehood action should betried in Japan so should the claim for interference with the plaintiffsâ contractual relations.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Mr Chua also referred us to the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Berezovsky v Michaels and Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%201%20WLR%201004" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 1 WLR 1004.</a>  That decision involved the 30 December 1996 issue of the Forbes magazine where the plaintiff and one Glouchkov (whose appeal wasdealt with at the same time) were described as âcriminals on an outrageous scaleâ.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  âForbesâ had an international circulation and the sale of that particular issue was 785,000 in the US and Canada, 1,900 in Englandand Wales and 13 in Russia.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr Berezovsky and Mr Glouchkov sought leave to serve a writ out of the jurisdiction in respect of the English circulation, in otherwords, for the libel allegedly committed in England.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The High Court set aside the leave that had been granted by a master and stayed the proceedings.  The Court of Appeal reversed thejudge.  The House of Lords by 3 to 2 affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The House of Lords affirmed the correctness of the decision in <i>The Albaforth</i>, Lord Steyn saying at p. 1014E-F, that the principles from that case were âestablished, tried and tested, and unobjectionable inprincipleâ.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In <i>Berezovsky</i>, the plaintiff was libelled in England as well as in the United States, Canada and Russia, and presumably in other countries or territorieswhere that particular issue of the magazine was available.  It was concerned with the question whether, notwithstanding that theplaintiffs had been defamed in England, they should be allowed to sue the defendants by serving them out of the jurisdiction.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mr Chua also referred us to the case of <i>King v Lewis</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%20EMLR%204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] E.M.L.R. 4</a> (page 45).  That involved an article which was posted on a website based in the California which could be downloaded.  The articlewas downloaded in England.  It was accepted that subject to any defences on the merits, the defendant had been libelled in England. This, like <i>Berezovsky</i>, was concerned with what Lord Steyn called âtrans-nationalâ libels.  At page 57 the Court of Appeal said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ Where there is publication, say in two jurisdictions only, it remains relatively confined, and the <i>Albaforth</i> starting-point may remain very meaningful. But in relation to Internet libel, bearing in mind the rule in <i>Duke of Brunswick v Harmer</i> that each publication constitutes a separate tort, a defendant who publishes on the Web may at least in theory find himself vulnerableto multiple actions in different jurisdictions.  The place where the tort is committed ceases to be a potent limiting factor.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Relying on <i>King v Lewis</i>, Mr Chua submitted that the judge has placed undue weight on the places of publication.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  But we are not here concerned with trans-national libels at all where publication takes place in a number of different jurisdictions. We are only concerned with two groups of libel, one committed in the US and the other in Japan.  More importantly, we are concernedwith a case where no defamation was committed in Hong Kong.  It has not been alleged that there has been any publication in HongKong.  So we see nothing wrong with the judge regarding the place of commission, namely the places where publication took place,as <i>prima facie</i> the natural fora for the determination of the claim.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  In para. 35 of the judgment, the judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThis is one of those cases where there is much that can be, and has been, said on both side.  Ultimately, I am persuaded that MrLiao must be right when he said that the natural forum for this action is Japan and the US rather than here.  What has persuadedme is that the alleged libels, and for person purposes, the claim based on malicious falsehood goes with it, were published abroadand not in Hong Kong.  In such circumstances the cases to which I have already referred in this regard are clearly applicable â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  As already noted we are concerned with an exercise of discretion by the judge.  We remind ourselves of the words of Lord Templemanin <i>Spiliada</i>, at page 465:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIn the result, it seems to me that the solution of disputes about the relative merits of trial in England and trial abroad is pre-eminentlya matter for the trial judge.  Commercial court judges are very experienced in these matters.  In nearly every case evidence is onaffidavit by witnesses of acknowledged probity.  I hope that in future the judge will be allowed to study the evidence and refreshhis memory of the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Goff of Chieveley in this case in the quiet of his room without expenseto the parties; that he will not be referred to other decisions on other facts; and that submissions will be measured in hours andnot days.  An appeal should be rare and the appellate court should be slow to interfere.  I agree with my noble and learned friendLord Goff of Chieveley that there were no grounds for interference in the present case and that the appeal should be allowed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Mr Chua SC stressed the close connection which the plaintiffs and the defendants have with Hong Kong.  These factors were acknowledgedin the judgment.  The judge was entitled to give such weight to the connection as he considered appropriate.  We agree with the judgethat though at least three of the parties are Hong Kong based, in reality this was not a weighty factor to suggest that Hong Kongwas the natural forum.  All the parties are very much international in profile and in the way their business is carried out.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The judge then went on to refer to another argument of Mr Liao, SC, counsel for the defendants, which he said carried weight.  Thatargument was based on the so-called <i>MoÃ§ambique</i> Rule (from <i>British South Africa Company v The Companhia de MoÃ§ambique</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1893%5d%20AC%20602" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1893] AC 602).</a>  Mr Chua argued that the so-called <i>MoÃ§ambique</i> Rule had no application as the plaintiffs were prepared to accept for the purpose of these claims that the Japanese and US patentswere valid.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  He referred us to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Pearce v Ove Arup Partnership Ltd and Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%20Ch%20403" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] Ch 403</a> and <i>R Griggs Group Ltd v Evans</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%20Ch%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] Ch 153</a> where a distinction was made between cases where the validity of the patents was challenged and cases solely concerned with infringementof patents (see <i>R Griggs</i> at para. 138(2)).  But the judge has not said that the <i>MoÃ§ambique</i> Rule as such was applicable.  Indeed, it is obvious that he did not regard it as directly applicable, since had it been strictlyapplicable, it would have been decisive (rather than just carried weight) of the application before him.  Further, as pointed outin <i>Pearce v Ove Arup</i>, the <i>MoÃ§ambique</i> Rule went to jurisdiction and justiciability, and that, under that rule, the English court has no jurisdiction âto entertain anaction for trespass to foreign landâ,  at 425G, and at page 431:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIt is, we think, clear from analysis of the judgments in the <i>MoÃ§ambique</i> case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1893%5d%20AC%20602" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1893] A.C. 602</a> that the House of Lords treated the question whether the English courts should entertain an action for trespass to foreign land asone of justiciability.  The English courts should not claim jurisdiction to adjudicate upon matters which, under generally acceptedprinciples of private international law, were within the peculiar province and competence of another state.  We think it significantthat both Lord Herschell L.C. and Lord Halsbury placed emphasis on the same passage in <i>Vattelâs Law of Nations</i>, written one hundred years earlier:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>âas property of this kind is to be held according to the laws of the country where it is situated, and as the right of grantingit is vested in the ruler of the country, controversies relating to such property can only be decided in the state in which it depends.ââ</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  In <i>Coin Controls Ltd v Suzo International (UK) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20Ch%2033" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] Ch 33</a>, the <i>MoÃ§ambique</i> Rule was applied to a case where the validity of foreign patents was in issue.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  <i>Coin Controls Ltd v Suzo International (UK) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20Ch%2033" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] Ch 33</a> was referred to in argument in <i>Pearce v Ove Arup</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%20Ch%20403" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] Ch 403</a>, but not in the judgment.  This is what Laddie J said in <i>Coin Controls Ltd</i> at page 51E:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ Secondly, whether there is infringement is dependent on the wording of the claims.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Furthermore, in <i>Plastus Kreativ AB v Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%20RPC%20438" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] RPC 438</a>, Aldous J (as he then was), said, at page 447 line 42:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI also believe that it would not normally be right for the courts of this country to decide a dispute on infringement of a foreignpatent in respect of acts done outside this country provided there is an adequate remedy in the relevant country.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Whether or not a patent has been infringed depends not only on the validity of the patent but also its width and scope, which wouldin turn depend on the meaning of the wording of the claim.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Moreover, although <i>Pearce v Ove Arup Partnership Ltd and Anor</i> and <i>R Griggs Group Ltd v Evans</i> can be taken as authorities for the proposition that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the MoÃ§ambique Rule does not require the English court to refuse to entertain a claim in respect of the alleged infringementof Dutch copyright â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(<i>Pearce v Ove Arup Partnership Ltd and Anor</i> at page 445A) and that the same approach might be taken with regard to foreign patents, they certainly do not support any argumentto the effect that where the case involves the infringement of a foreign patent that this somehow cannot be a weighty factor to holdthat the foreign jurisdiction involved is the most appropriate forum.  In fact, in our view, this must clearly be a weighty factor.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  This is what the judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ Nevertheless, I am concerned that our court may proceed on an erroneous view of foreign patent law and either award or refusedamages and the other relief asked for based on such a bad finding quite apart from the other misgivings expressed by Laddie andAldous J.J.âs to which I have previously referred.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">39.  In saying this, I am cogniscent that these patent cases were purely patent cases but the sentiments and principles upon whichthey were decided have sufficient application here (if not identically so) that I should have regard to them.  This part of Mr Liaoâssubmission therefore must also and does weigh in my decision.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>With respect, we can detect no error of approach.  He rightly held that such considerations added weight to the fact that <i>prima facie</i> the natural forum for the determination of the dispute was where the defamation was committed and where the relevant patents werelocated.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Mr Chua also made the point that insofar as the Judge was of the view that the Japanese defamation should be tried in Japan andthat the US defamation should be tried in the US, the <i>Spiliada</i> test was not satisfied.  There could not be a stay in favour of more than one jurisdiction.  The cases referred to an alternativeforum, not alternative fora.  He referred to us what Lord Goff said in <i>Spiliada</i> at page 476:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â        (a)   The basic principle is that a stay will only be granted on the ground of forum non conveniens where the court issatisfied that there is some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the trial ofthe action, i.e. in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Mr Chua paraphrased this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAt stage 1, the defendant must satisfy the court that there is another forum abroad which is the appropriate <u>forum</u> for <u>the trial</u> of the action.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Mr Chua submitted since the trial of this action will involve the trial in the USA as well as in Japan, this is not a case whereit could be said that there is only one appropriate forum for the trial of the action.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  But as Lord Steyn explained in <i>Berezovsky v Michaels</i> at page 1014C:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn <i>Spiliada</i>, the House examined the relevant questions at a high legal of generality. The leading judgment of Lord Goff of <i>Chieveley</i> is an essay in synthesis: he explored and explained the coherence of legal principles and provided guidance. Lord Goff of <i>Chieveley</i> did not attempt to examine exhaustively the classes of cases which may arise in practice, notably he did not consider the practicalproblems associated with libels which cross national borders. On the other hand, the line of authority of which <i>The Albaforth</i> is an example was concerned with practical problems at a much lower level of generality.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  We agree with Mr Chua to this extent: where the party seeking a stay cannot point to one forum for the trial of the relevant causeof action but only to a number of possible fora, he will not be able to demonstrate a forum âclearly or distinctlyâ more appropriatethan Hong Kong.  However, we believe that, where as here, an action involves two distinct causes of action and that, in relationto each, there is an appropriate foreign forum but different to one another, a stay may nevertheless be granted.  Mr Chua seemedto have accepted this proposition in principle, because in the course of his submissions he accepted that a plaintiff who suffered,say, personal injuries caused by the same defendant but on different occasions in Japan as well as in the US, could have his actionin Hong Kong stayed to be determined by the courts of those two countries.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  However, he argued, relying on cases such as <i>King v Lewis</i> dealing with what he called multiple torts, that a stay should not be granted simply because a tort was committed in more than onecountry.  As explained above, <i>King v Lewis</i> was concerned with âtrans-nationalâ libels, and therefore has little relevance.  In the end, the court must decide each caseon its own merits and not apply dicta from cases such as <i>Spiliada</i> too rigidly as though they were a preset formula or a statute.  Sometimes, there may be a perfectly sensible justification for evenparallel (a fortiori separate) proceedings:  see for example <i>The Kapitan Shvetsov</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20HKLRD%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] HKLRD 374.</a></p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Mr Chua also argued under the stage II test that a trial in the US or Japan would deprive the plaintiffs of legitimate personalor juridical advantages, these being, for example, the availability of assets in Hong Kong to satisfy any judgment which the plaintiffsmay obtain against the defendants.  He also referred to the possibility that the defence of qualified privilege may be of more limitedin scope in Hong Kong than in the US.  However, as explained in <i>Adhiguna Meranti</i> at page 922:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âThe decision in <b>de Dampierre</b> has resolved our doubts.  This makes it clear that it is the first view which is correct: that the test is now not injustice to theplaintiff but justice to both parties; and that our jurisdictional doubts were ill-founded.  We must consider, <i>per</i> Lord Templeman, whether it is âjustâ that the plaintiffs âshould be allowed to exploit their Hong Kong advantageâ and weshould âonly refuse a stay if it would be unjust to confine the plaintiffsâ to their remedies in Indonesia.  We must consider,<i>per</i> Lord Goff, âthe balance of fairness between the partiesâ.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The stage II inquiry was properly considered by the judge in his judgment: see paras. 42 to 44.  There is no basis on which we couldinterfere with his exercise of discretion.  Indeed, on the material before us, we would have exercised the discretion the same way.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The availability of enforcement procedures in Hong Kong of foreign judgments (such as any judgment from the courts of Japan or theUS) are not so difficult or cumbersome that it can really be said that the plaintiffs will somehow be deprived of a legitimate personalor judicial advantage by litigating in those countries.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Nor are we persuaded by Mr Chuaâs submission based on any supposed difference in the law of qualified privilege between Hong Kongand the US.  Even if such a difference existed and it mattered to a significant degree in the claims made by the plaintiffs, we failto see what injustice there could be in letting the courts of the US determine, according to their domestic law, a defamation thatoccurred there.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Subsequent to the writ in the present case, several proceedings were instituted in the US.  They concern US patents.  So far, noproceedings have been commenced in Japan.  Since the judgment appealed from was delivered, the position regarding the US proceedingshave become clearer.  However, Mr Chua has submitted that all the Japanese patents have their âequivalentsâ in the US patents. To summarise the position, it seems that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and an associated company (Taltech) have restricted their patent infringement claim to only 2 US patents, namely, â779âand â615â and that in relation to 6 other US patents, (â343â, â292â, â394â, â191â, â554â and â542â),the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and Taltech have undertaken not to sue the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff or its affiliates for patent infringement.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  In the relation to the Japanese patents, the plaintiffsâ case is that â2859137â, â3093708â and â3205725â correspondto US patents â615â, â292â and â394â.  Thus, Mr Chua submitted that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(3)   In the light of TALâs recent undertaking, it is unlikely that it maintains any allegation of patent infringement in relationto Japanese patents â<b>3093708</b>â and â<b>3205725</b>â.  TAL has maintained on Affirmation that its US and Japanese patens are â<i>in substance the same</i>â, so that the U.S.A. proceedings âare likely to be in practice determinative of Taltechâs or the 1st Defendantâs patent rightsin Japanâ: H. Lee 1st Â§30 <b>[B/13]</b>.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Nevertheless, whether there has been any infringement (of whatever patent) remains crucially a live issue.  We agree with the judgethat the appropriate fora for the determination of such questions must be the courts in the US and Japan.  These are the countrieswhere the relevant patents are located and as far as the defamation claims are concerned, where they took place and where the relevantreputations of the plaintiffs are to be considered.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Geoffrey Ma)<br />            Chief Judge, High Court</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Robert Tang)<br />            Justice of Appeal</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Chua Guan-hock, SC and Mr Anson M K Wong , instructed by Messrs Vivien Chan &amp; Co., for the Plaintiffs/ Appellants.</p>        <p>Mr Andrew Liao, SC and Mr Colin Shipp, instructed by Messrs Clifford Chance, for the Defendants/ Respondents.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2006/34.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
