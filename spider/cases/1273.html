Claimantsâ Statement of Claim be struck out or alternatively, pursuant toO. 14A of the RDC, for the determination of the questions of law specified in the said summons, and in either case for the dismissalof the action.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The application is supported by the Affirmation of Li Ka Lai Elizabeth, who is the Cabin Crew Administration Manager of the InflightServices Department of the Respondent.  The facts set out in Ms. Liâs Affirmation are not controversial as no affidavit evidencehas been filed on behalf of the Claimants to oppose this application.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Background of the application</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  It is the Claimantsâ case that the Respondent had unlawfully discriminated against them by reason of their being women in respectof the terms of employment it afforded them and subjecting them to a detriment contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss. 5(1)(a)</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">11</a>(2)(b) and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">11</a>(2)(c) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480" class="autolink_findacts">Sex Discrimination Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480">Cap. 480</a> (âSDOâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Claimants joined the Respondent as cabin attendants on various dates between 1975 and 1979.  Under the conditions of serviceapplicable to the Respondentâs flight attendants by that time, female flight attendants were normally required to retire from servicein that capacity upon attaining the age of 40, though with the possibility, but no assurance, of being transferred to ground dutiesthereafter, whereas male flight attendants were normally permitted to continue in service in that capacity until they reached theage of 55.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  These conditions of service provided for the payment to flight attendants of a retirement grant upon being compulsorily retiredat the retirement age applicable to their sex according to a formula whereby the amount of the retirement grant in any particularcase was, in part, calculated by reference to the number of eligible years of service (âthe Old Schemeâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Each of the Claimants was compulsorily retired when respectively they each reached the age of 40.  They were then each paid a retirementgrant according to the prescribed formula.  After their compulsory retirements, each of the Claimants accepted a series of 5-yearlyextension contracts on much the same terms as applied to their previous employments save and except that they were expressly excludedfrom any further retirement benefits (âthe Extension Contractsâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The SDO was then enacted in Hong Kong in 1996.  On various dates in 1997 and 1998, the fifth of the Extension Contracts of eachof the Claimants expired when they reached the age of 45, and the Claimants ceased to work for the Respondent altogether.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In 1999, the Respondent offered to re-employ former flight attendants, including all the Claimants, on terms, <i>inter alia</i>, as follows: (a) the flight attendants would be re-employed in the same capacity when they previously left the Respondent; and (b)the Respondent would provide each such person with full compensation for loss of salary, allowances and bonuses for the period betweenthe date of cessation of employment and the date of commencement of re-employment.  For easy reference, this period would be referredto in this judgment as the âGap Yearsâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Each of the re-employment contracts also contained a term in the following similar wording:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i><u>Full and Final Settlement of All Outstanding Claims</u></i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>By signing these terms of reinstatement you hereby accept such terms freely and as full and final settlement of any claims that youmight otherwise have against the [Respondent] either in respect of the circumstances under which you previously employment was notrenewed or in respect of any remedies, whether arising by statute or otherwise, that you might otherwise have, or have had, againstthe [Respondent] in respect of such non-renewal.â</i></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The terms on which the Claimants were offered re-employment provided that, on acceptance, the Claimants would be eligible to jointhe Respondentâs Provident Fund Scheme (âPFSâ).  The PFS rules in place in 1999 provided that only the years of service aftera cabin attendant, whether male or female, joined the PFS would count for the purposes of calculating retirement benefits.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  After their final retirements at the age of 55, the Claimants obtained the retirement benefits under the PFS.  However, it is theClaimantsâ case that the Old Scheme is a more generous scheme as compared with the PFS, and the retirement benefits obtained underthe PFS are much less as the Respondent did not take into account the Gap years as eligible years of service in calculating the retirementbenefits.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  On the basis of these facts, the Claimants allege that, taking the period of employment of each Claimant as a whole from her firstengagement to her final retirement at the age of 55, they had been subject to a âcontinuing regimeâ of discrimination by reasonof their sex which was only partially remedied by their re-employment and the terms on which such re-employment was offered to them. It is also the Claimantsâ case that terms in the re-employment contracts made in 1999 were discriminatory in nature, as they wereless favourable than those offered to their male counterparts who joined the Respondent at the time of the first engagement of eachof the respective Claimants.  The Claimants therefore claim for the loss of the retirement benefits that they would otherwise havegot under the Old Scheme by reference to the years of service from their first engagements until their final retirements at the ageof 55.  The total amount of the claims is about $10,000,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Respondent disputes the claims on the following grounds:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(i)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">it is wrong in law to view each Claimant as having been continuously employed by the Respondent from her first engagement to her finalretirement at the age of 55, and so it cannot be said that the Claimants were subject to a âcontinuing regimeâ of discrimination;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(ii)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the offers of re-employment made in 1999 were made in full and final settlement of any claims that the Claimants might otherwise havehad against the Respondent, and so the Claimants are bound by the settlement agreements;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iii)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 11(4)</a> of the SDO provides a defence to the Respondent as it specifies that statutory provisions prohibiting discrimination would not applyto âprovision relating to death or retirementâ made for a woman before 15 October 1997; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iv)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the Claimantâs claims are time-barred under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 86(1)</a> of the SDO; and </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(v)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the terms of the re-employment agreements made in 1999 were not discriminatory in nature. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The meaning of âemploymentâ under the regime of the SDO and waiver of the claim</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  As the first two issues are inter-related, I will deal with them together.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In substance, the Claimantsâ claims are framed in the following manner.  The entire history of each of the Claimantsâ employmentfrom the first engagement to the final retirement at the age of 55, including the period when she was engaged on a series of theExtension Contracts, each of just 1-yearâs duration after the mandatory retirement upon attaining the age of 40, the subsequentcessation of her service upon reaching the age of 45, and the period of service since she was reinstated, involved a continuing courseof conduct by the Respondent which was unlawfully discriminatory against each Claimant within the meaning of the SDO.  Although theRespondent, under the re-employment agreements, paid the Claimants compensation for the loss of earnings which they had sufferedduring the Gap Years, they were not compensated for being precluded from accruing retirement benefits during: (a) the 5 years ofthe Extension Contracts; and (b) the subsequent period of exclusion from the Respondentâs service, and they therefore suffer damagesas a result.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  It is submitted by Mr. Collins, counsel for the Claimants, that the offer of re-employment made in 1999 was, in the first place,an explicit recognition by the Respondent that the Claimants should never have been compulsorily retired at all.  The decision tomake that offer was undoubtedly prompted by the changes in the legal framework brought about by the enactment of the SDO, and thatwas why the offer letters sent to the Claimants in 1999 contained, <i>inter alia</i>, the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>I attach a copy of a CX CCNL Special newsletter of 16<sup>th</sup> July 1999 advising of the Companyâs decision to extend the retirement age to 55 years of age for female cabin crew, who joinedthe Company before July 1993.

Hence, according to the Claimantsâ submission, the object of there-employment was to restore that which had been unlawfully taken away from the Claimants and to re-establish the continuity of anemployment which was unlawfully interrupted, and it is therefore an error to treat the reinstatement of employment simply as a matterof re-employment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  In support of his submission, Mr. Collins relies on the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>Helen Tsang v Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%204%20HKC%20585" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 4 HKC 585.</a>  In that case, the claimant worked as a cabin attendant for the same Respondent.  She reached the age of 40 in 1992 and was askedto retire by the Respondent but she, like the Claimants in the present case, continued to work for the Respondent under a seriesof back-to-back contracts.  After the claimant reached the age of 45 in October 1997, she was not offered any extension of her employment. Instead of accepting the offer of re-employment in 1999, she brought an action for unlawful discrimination against the Respondent. At the first instance, HH Judge Saunders, as he then was, ruled the case in favour of the claimant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  At the hearing of the appeal, the Respondent argued that even though its retirement policy prior to 1993 was discriminatory, butsince the claimantâs employment ended in October 1992 when she received the retirement entitlements, and thereafter she was employedon separate and independent contracts of one yearâs duration, there was no contravention of the provisions in the SDO which onlycame into effect on 20 December 1996 during the currency of the claimantâs last extension contract.  As the statutory provisiondid not have any retrospective effect, the contract of employment was not unlawful.  The Respondent further argued that the trialjudge was in error in considering that the claimantâs employment was continuous as âemploymentâ in the light of the actualcontractual context.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  In upholding the judgment of the lower court, the Court of Appeal held that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(i)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the SDO should be interpreted with a purposive approach so that its objects could be achieved, and it was clear that the SDO wentbeyond any contractual terms which might have been concluded between the employer and the employee; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(ii)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">it was employment at large which afforded a person with the statutory protection under the provisions in the SDO, and so the claimantwas in the employment of the Respondent when the SDO came into effect; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iii)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">in the case of discrimination in the field of employment, what mattered was the existence of a policy or regime pursuant to whichdecisions may be taken from time to time, not a specific act of an employer which triggered its application to the complainant; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iv)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">throughout the claimantâs employment by the Respondent, there was a discriminatory policy in place with reference to which decisionswere taken from time to time, and so the discrimination suffered by the claimant was not a âone-offâ act that predated the entryinto force of the SDO, rather it was a continuing act of discrimination that extended to the end of the period during which the claimantwas employed by the Respondent. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Based on the aforesaid, the Court of Appeal held that the lower court was right in holding that the Respondent was guilty of discriminationwhen the SDO came into effect.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In law, it is clear that there was no employment relationship between the Claimants and the Respondent in the periods from the respectivedates on which the last of the Claimantsâ respective Extension Contracts expired until the dates on which they were each re-employed,ie. the Gap Years.  However, the Claimants submit that the court, in construing the protection under the SDO, should go beyond theterms in the employment contracts.  Coupled with the fact that the Respondent had, by reference to its acknowledgment in the referenceletters and the same capacity in which each of the Claimants was re-employed, treated the Claimants as its employees from their firstengagements to their final retirements at the age of 55, the Claimants claim that they had been subject to a continuing regime ofdiscrimination, and the waiver clause in the so-called âre-employmentâ agreements does not have any effect for the purpose ofdetermining the Respondentâs liability under the SDO.  As the retirement benefits obtained by them are less than those receivedby the comparable male cabin attendants who joined the Respondent at the dates of the respective Claimantsâ first engagements,the Respondent is liable to pay compensation for its unlawful discrimination.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  I cannot accept such argument.  As I see it, there are two important distinctions between the facts in the <i>Helen Tsangâs</i> case and those in the present one.  In the former, although the claimant was working under the last of her Extension Contracts atthe time of the enactment of the SDO, there was no break in the employment relationship between the parties, and so one can stillsay that the claimant was by then subject to a continuing regime of discrimination.  However in the present case, each of the Claimantsceased to work for the Respondent after the termination of the last Extension Contract, and there was a <i>de facto</i> break in the employment relationship in the Gap Years.  In such circumstances, it cannot be right to say that the Claimants stillworked for the Respondent in the Gap Years even for the purpose of the SDO.  The second important distinction is that there was awaiver clause in each re-employment agreement which would, in my judgment, operate to extinguish the Claimantsâ claims.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  To me, the relationship between the parties was a simple one.  The Claimants ceased to work for the Respondent after the expiryof their last Extension Contracts.  Prior to that, the Claimants had been subject to a regime of discrimination under the Respondentâspast retirement policy.  After the enactment of the SDO in 1996, the Claimants were entitled to commence action for unlawful discriminationagainst the Respondent, just like the claimant in the <i>Helen Tsangâs</i> case.  In order to avoid such legal claims, the Respondent, after the termination of the Claimantsâ respective employments underthe previous regime, offered to re-employ the Claimants on terms common to all the cabin attendants by that time.  The Respondentalso offered to pay compensations to the Claimants, on the condition that the Claimants agreed to waive any claims arising from thepast discriminatory retirement policy.  This was a genuine attempt to settle all legal claims arising from the previous unlawfulact, and to allow the Claimants to continue with the existing claims is simply contrary to the terms of the settlement agreementsmade in 1999.  Hence, the waiver clause operates to extinguish the claims.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  I entirely agree with the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal in the <i>Helen Tsangâs</i> case.  As the SDO is a piece of social legislation with a view to eliminate sex discrimination, the statutory provisions should beconstrued in a manner which would not defeat the object of the legislation.  However, I cannot see why the legislature should preventan employer, who had previously adopted a discriminatory practice, to make a genuine attempt with the employee to settle a claimarising from the past unlawful act and for them to make a fresh start in their relationship.  If the Claimantsâ argument is correct,it would never be possible for parties to settle a discrimination claim, as the court would always reopen the issue and to examinewhether the employees have been adequately compensated under the settlement agreements.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  We can also test the Claimantsâ argument in another way.  Suppose in 1999, the Respondent offered to pay monetary compensationswithout the option of re-employment to the Claimants to settle any claims arising from the previous unlawful discrimination.  EachClaimant agreed and a settlement agreement was reached.  In such case, even Mr. Collins cannot dispute that the settlement agreementsare binding on the parties, and the court would not reopen each agreement by examining whether the settlement sum is reasonable bycomparing that with the benefit that would have been received by a comparable male cabin attendants who joined the Respondent atthe time when each of the Claimants was first engaged.  In such case, why is the inclusion of the re-employment as part of the settlementagreement makes the difference?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Neither can the Claimants benefit from the statements made by the Respondent in the reference letters about the years of serviceof each of the respective Claimants.  Obviously, the Respondent made a mistake in the first batch of letters which it sought to rectifyin subsequent correspondence.  In any event, what the Respondent said about the years of service is not relevant for the court indetermining the true legal relationship between the parties, whether under the regime of the SDO or otherwise.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  At one stage, Mr. Collins seems to suggest that the settlement agreements are not genuine ones as the Claimants had no alternativeto the terms being put forward if they desired to be re-employed.  As Mr. Collins puts it, âthe Respondent had the Claimants overa barrelâ.  But I do not agree.  Firstly, there is no affidavit evidence put forward by the Claimants to substantiate such allegation. Secondly, it is clear that after the enactment of the SDO, the Claimants had the right to commence legal actions against the Respondentto claim for damages arising from the early unlawful dismissal of the Claimants, just like the claimant in the <i>Helen Tsangâs</i> case who had decided to exercise such right.  With such option available to them, the Claimants were not bound to accept the Respondentâsoffers.  Thirdly, as part of the settlement agreements, the Respondent offered to pay full compensation to the Claimants for theloss of salary during the Gap Years, even if the Claimants were not actually working for the Respondent by that time.  Although theincome earned by the Claimants from other employment might be deducted from the compensation, the Claimants, in getting the fullcompensation for loss of salary, did not need to go through the scrutiny of the court in assessing their damages, for example, whetherthey had discharged the duty of mitigation of loss.  In such case, the re-employment offered to the Claimants in 1999 was, in myjudgment, a genuine attempt by the Respondent to settle any claims arising from the previous discriminatory retirement policy.  Havingaccepted the settlement terms, the Claimants have no right to maintain the present claims.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Validity of the waiver clause</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Mr. Collins further submits that the waiver clause in the re-employment contracts is either void or unenforceable under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss. 87(1)(b)</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">87</a>(2) of the SDO.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I disagree.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">S. 87</a> reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>87.</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="3"><i>Validity and revision of contracts</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(1)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="84%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2"><i>A term of a contract is void where-</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(a)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="79%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>its inclusion renders the making of the contract unlawful by virtue of this Ordinance;</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(b)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="79%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>it is included in furtherance of an act rendered unlawful by this Ordinance;

As the waiver clause is part ofthe settlement agreement, it is not void under the section.  However, Mr. Collins makes two submissions about the section.  Firstly,<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 87(4)</a> provides that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 87(3)</a> shall not apply to a contract settling a claim to which <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 76</a> applies.  As the waiver clause is not a provision which purports to exclude or limit any provision of the SDO, such clause is nota term falling within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 87(3).</a>  It then follows that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 87(4)</a> has no relevance.  Secondly, Mr. Collins argues that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 87(4)</a> contemplates a claim which is actually in being, at least to the extent that a letter before action asserting it has been made andpossibly that proceedings have actually been commenced.  It does not apply to a contract to compromise in advance all conceivableand still yet inchoate claims which may arise.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  I also cannot subscribe to such arguments.  Had there been no settlement agreements, the Claimants would have the right to commencelegal proceedings for sex discrimination against the Respondent.  The effect of the waiver clause is to exclude and limit the Claimantsâright under the SDO, and it is therefore a term falling within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 87(3).</a>  It then follows that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.87(4)</a> is applicable in the present case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Further, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 87(4)</a> does not refer to a claim in being, and instead it mentions a claim to which <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 76</a> applies.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">S. 76</a>, on the other hand, provides that a person who has committed an act of discrimination within the meaning of the SDO may be made thesubject of civil proceedings in like manner as any other claim in tort, and proceedings of such nature can be commenced in the DistrictCourt.  According to the plain wording of such statutory provision, there is simply no requirement for the issuance of pre-actionletter or the commencement of legal proceedings in order to justify the legitimacy of the settlement agreement.  Hence, if a personhas a possible claim under the SDO, it is permissible for the relevant parties to settle the claim under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 87(4).</a> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  As I understand the position, one of the duties of the Equal Opportunities Commission is to facilitate parties to a complaint tosettle any possible discrimination claim.  With such effort, a lot of conciliation agreements would be made before the commencementof legal proceedings.  If Mr. Collinsâ argument is correct, these conciliation agreements would not be binding and it would notbe possible for any parties to settle a discrimination claim before the commencement of legal action.  This simply cannot be right.

Parliament, in enacting the [SDA] of 1975, was seeking to eliminateall discrimination between men and women.  However, it was faced by a widespread and inherently discriminatory practice deeply embeddedin the social organization of the country, namely, the differential in retirement ages between men and women.  This differentialtreatment was blatantly discriminatory.  However, the effect of such discriminatory practice percolated throughout society.  Statepensions reflected the differential; the vast majority of occupational pension schemes reflected the differential; normal ages ofretirement maintained the differential.  Accordingly, unless all this was to be swept away, the [SDA] had to exclude claims arisingout of this inherently discriminatory practice.  For this reason section 6(4) appeared in the [SDA].â </i></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  In England, it was held in <i>Roberts v Cleveland Area Health Authority, Garland v British Rail Engineering Ltd., MacGregor Wallcoverings Ltd. v Turton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20WLR%20754" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 WLR 754</a> that the words âprovision in relation to death or retirementâ in s. 6(4) of the SDA means provision âaboutâ death or retirement,with the additional comment by Lord Denning that such phrase is indeed âvery wideâ (at p. 757B).  As the claims herein relateto the differential treatments under the previous retirement scheme of the Respondent, they are <i>prima facie</i> covered by the exemption under s. 11(4).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  However, the matter does not rest here as the exemption is subject to the qualifications in s. 11(5).  In this regard, Mr. Collinsprovides me with a useful account about the historical development of the corresponding statutory provision in England, which isextremely helpful in assisting the court in construing the ambit of the exemption.  As this part of the judgment would only be <i>obiter dicta</i>, I would try my best to be as brief as possible.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  When the SDA was enacted in 1975, s. 6(4) just provided that provisions concerning unlawful discrimination in the employment contextdid not apply to âprovision in relation to death or retirementâ.  There was no provision similar to s.11(5) of the SDO.  As thewording of the exemption was âwideâ, a number of different retirement-related provisions were held by the English Court of Appealin <i>Roberts v Cleveland Health Authority, Garland v British Rail Engineering Ltd., MacGregor Wallcoverings Ltd. v Turton, ibid.</i> as falling within the ambit of the exemption.  In the case of <i>Roberts</i>, retirement scheme which provided for differential retirement ages for men and women fell within the exemption.  In the <i>Garlandâs</i> case, the Court of Appeal held that retirement scheme which provided for differential travel concessions for the families of ex-employeesafter retirement, with families of male ex-employees entitled to obtain the travel concessions but those of female ex-employees didnot, was also covered by the exemption.  The last case of <i>MacGregor</i> was about a complaint by a woman that she was discriminated against because of differential retirement ages for men and women, with65 for men and 60 for women, depriving her of the benefit of a redundancy scheme by which employees over 60 who were made redundantreceived 10 weeksâ additional pay because she, as a woman, could never qualify for it.  All these schemes fell within the exemption.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Only the case of <i>Garland</i> proceeded to the House of Lords, and there was then an issue as to whether discrimination as to the post-retirement travel concessionswas compatible with the European Community law.  A preliminary ruling was sought from the European Court of Justice (âECJâ),which held that the practice was discriminatory under Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome (the E.E.C. Treaty): the travel concessionwas an extension into retirement of facilities granted during employment, thereby enabling them to be treated as âpayâ for thepurposes of that Article.  The House of Lords accordingly allowed the appeal, thus restoring the decision of the Employment AppealsTribunal which had interpreted s. 6(4) as not extending so far as to cover a privilege that had existed during the subsistence ofthe employment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Despite the successful appeal in the <i>Garlandâs</i> case, the decision in the <i>Robertâs</i> case, which concerned the lawfulness of imposing different retirement ages, remained untouched.  As a result, the courts in the lattercases of <i>Robert v Tate &amp; Lyle Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20ICR%20521" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] ICR 521</a> and <i>Duke v G.E.C. Reliance Ltd., ibid.,</i> held that schemes which concerned differential retirement ages for men and women were covered by the exemption.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  There was then an important development in the case of <i>Marshall v Southampton and South West Hampshire Health Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%202%20All%20ER%20584" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 2 All ER 584</a>, which was heard shortly before the case of <i>Duke v G.E.C.

This related to another simple differential retirement ages scheme, and the ECJ held that such differential provision offended theguarantee of equal treatment of sexes enshrined in Article 5(1) of the Council Directive 76/207, which reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>Application of the principle of equal treatment with regard to working conditions, including the conditions governing dismissal, meansthat men and women shall be guaranteed the same conditions without discrimination on the grounds of sex.â</i> (emphasis added) </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Article 7(1) of the Directive only exempted differential ages for granting retirement pensions in the form of social security benefits.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  The ECJ reinstated the view it had taken in the earlier case of <i>Burton v British Railways Board</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%203%20All%20ER%20537" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 3 All ER 537</a> that the term âdismissalâ contained in Article 5(1) must be given a wide meaning, and the following comment was expressed inthe judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>Consequently, an age limit for the compulsory dismissal of workers pursuant to an employerâs general policy concerning retirementfalls within the terms âdismissalâ construed in that manner, even if the dismissal involves the grant of a retirement pension.â</i> (at p. 598h) </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  This landmark decision prompted the legislature in England to make urgent amendments to the SDA and the Equal Pay Act to bring themin line with the Community law as declared in the <i>Marshallâs</i> case.  As a result, s. 6(4) of the SDA was substantially revised in 1986 with the addition of a provision similar to the existings. 11(5) of the SDO.  It also brought an end to the uncertainty as to whether retirement scheme which provided for dismissals uponattaining different retirement ages was lawful.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  When the SDO was enacted in 1996, the Hong Kong legislature decided to adopt the same modifications in s. 6(4) of the SDA, and sothe historic development in England provides a very good background for me in construing the meaning of our ss. 11(4) and 11(5). In my judgment, as the word âdismissalâ is used in ss. 11(5)(a) and 11(5)(c), it is clear that a retirement scheme which providesfor differential retirement ages, even if such scheme was made prior to 15 October 1997, is unlawful, because such scheme providesfor the dismissal of female employees upon reaching an earlier retirement age.  This must be the case, otherwise the claimant inthe <i>Helen Tsangâs</i> case would not have been able to succeed in her claim, and this is also in line with the English position taking into account therequirement of compliance with the Community law.  However, if the retirement scheme just provides for differential retirement benefitsfor male and female employees which does not involve dismissals upon reaching different retirement ages, for example the provisionof differential travel concessions as in the <i>Garlandâs</i> case, then such scheme may fall within the exemption.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Notwithstanding the above, the Respondent submits that the claims herein are covered by the exemption.  As I understand it, theargument runs as follows.  It may be the case that a scheme which provides for differential retirement ages is unlawful, and theaggrieved employees can make a claim for loss of salary that could have been earned by them had they not been unlawfully dismissedat an earlier retirement age.  However, such employees cannot claim for loss of retirement benefits arising from such earlier dismissal,because such claim is one which concerns âprovision relating to retirementâ and is therefore caught by the exemption.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  If that is the argument put forward by Mr. Ashley Burns S.C., counsel for the Respondent, that simply cannot be right.  As the retirementscheme which provides for differential retirement ages is unlawful, a claim for loss of retirement benefits would only be part andparcel of the claim for unlawful discrimination.  What should be considered by the court is that whether the retirement scheme asa whole is covered by the exemption.  If such scheme does not fall within the exemption and is unlawful, as it is in the presentcase, the aggrieved employees would be able to claim for loss of retirement benefits together with other loss of earnings, as theseare all damages arising from the unlawful discrimination on the part of the employer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  As I see it, with the qualifications in s. 11(5), the ambit of the exemption under s. 11(4) is rather limited.  It would only covercases where the differential treatments in the retirement scheme do not involve dismissal, promotion or transfer of an employee,otherwise it would be difficult for the employers to rely on such exemption.  In the present case, since the previous retirementpolicy involved early dismissals of the Claimants which resulted in loss of retirement benefits, the Respondent cannot rely on theexemption under s. 11(4).  Hence, although it is only an academic point, I find against the Respondent on such issue.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Time-bar</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Based on my ruling above on the continuity of the employment contracts, it would not be too difficult for me to deal with the tworemaining issues in the present case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  It is also the Respondentâs contention that the claims are time-barred under s. 86(1) of the SDO, which provides that the courtshall not consider a claim under the SDO unless proceedings in respect of the claim are instituted within 24 months from the timewhen the act complained of was done.  S. 86(3) empowers the court to extend the time for the commencement of the claim if it is justand equitable to do so. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  It is the Claimantsâ argument that they had been subject to a continuing regime of discrimination from their first engagementsby the Respondent to their final retirements, and so the time for the commencement of the action would not have started to run untilthe dates of their respective final retirements at the age of 55.  However, as I have analyzed above, the Claimants had ceased towork for the Respondent after the respective dates of the termination of their final Extension Contracts upon reaching the age of45.  Before that, it can be said that the Claimants had been subject to a continuing regime of unlawful discrimination, just likethe claimant in the <i>Helen Tsangâs</i> case.  However, after they had obtained the retirement benefits under the Old Scheme and they had ceased to work for the Respondent,it would be too far fetched, even considering the object of the SDO, to say that they were still subject to a continuing regime ofdiscrimination.  The time for the commencement of proceedings then started to run when they were unlawfully dismissed by the Respondentupon the expiry of their last Extension Contracts.  They had the right to bring legal proceedings against the Respondent for thepast discrimination, but the Claimants decided not to do so and chose to accept the offers of re-employment made by the Respondentin 1999.  As I see it, such offers were made with a view to settle any claims arising from the past unlawful discrimination, andso the re-employment represented a fresh start in the relationship between the parties.  Hence, as the present claims were commencedmore than 2 years after the termination of the respective Claimantsâ last Extension Contracts, the claims are now time-barred.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The choice of suitable comparator</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The same reasoning applies to the choice of suitable comparator for the purpose of determining the lawfulness of the re-employmentcontracts made in 1999.  Obviously, if one has to determine whether the retirement policy under the Old Scheme, which provided fordifferential retirement ages of 55 for men and 40 for women, was discriminatory, then the suitable comparator must be a male cabinattendant who joined the Respondent at the time of the first engagement of each Claimant.  By making such comparison, it is commonground that the Respondentâs previous retirement scheme was unlawful, and the Claimants had the right to commence legal actionagainst the Respondent.  However, the relationship under the old regime terminated upon the expiry of the last Extension Contractswhen each of the Claimants reached the age of 45.  Later when the Respondent offered to re-employ the Claimants, such offer was partand parcel of the settlement agreement in respect of any discrimination claims under the previous retirement scheme, and the re-employmentmarked a fresh start in the relationship between the parties.  Hence, in determining whether the terms under the re-employment agreementswere lawful, the suitable comparator must be the male cabin attendants who joined the Respondent in 1999.  Adopting such a comparator,the terms in the re-employment agreements were not discriminatory.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  By reason of the aforesaid, the claims in this action are wholly unsustainable as the Claimants had already waived such claims by accepting the offers of re-employment in 1999, and their claims are also time-barred under s. 86(1) of the SDO.  In such circumstances,I strike out the Statement of Claim and dismiss the action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  For the sake of completeness, I also answer the questions of law framed by the Respondent for determination as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(i)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether, in accepting the terms upon which each of the Claimants (a) were reinstated as employees of the Respondent and (b) were offeredcompensation on reinstatement in 1999, the Claimants compromised and/or waived any claims that they might then have had against theRespondent, whether pursuant to the SDO or at all, in relation to the earlier non-renewal of their respective contracts of employment:the answer is âyesâ; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(ii)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether the express provision in each of the Claimantsâ respective yearly extension contracts which subsisted on 15 October 1997to the effect that there was no entitlement to retirement benefits, are or were exempted from the provisions of s. 11 of the SDOby virtue of sub-section (4) thereof: the answer is ânoâ; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iii)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether the terms upon which each of the Claimants was re-employed as an employee of the Respondent were non-discriminatory withinthe meaning of the SDO and, for the purposes of determining this question, whether the correct comparator is or was a male cabinattendant who either commenced employment or who was re-employed in 1999 or who might have commenced employment or might have beenre-employed in 1999: the answer is âthe terms were non-discriminatory and the correct comparator was a male cabin attendant whocommenced employment in 1999â. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s73b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 73B(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336">Cap. 336</a>, I make an order <i>nisi</i> that the parties shall bear their own costs of the action, which shall be made absolute 21 days after the date of the handing downof this decision.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to both counsel for their invaluable assistance rendered to this court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(David Lok)<br />            District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr. James Collins, instructed by Messrs.
