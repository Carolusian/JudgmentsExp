In April 1988,the Defendant security alarm service company installed a six-zone security and burglar alarm system in the premises. Zone 3 of thesystem covers the balcony area, which is secured by six sets of infra-red beam emitters. If the beams became mis-aligned for whateverreason, a false alarm would be created. Initially, the Plaintiffs subscribed to a maintenance programme for the system with the Defendant,but they were not satisfied with the Defendant's service. Then they discontinued the maintenance programme and called on the Defendantfor repairs as and when problems arose.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> On 3 July 1997, a false alarm at Zone 3 occurred. Mr Thomsen telephoned the Defendant and requested for repairs. Mr Fong, a technicianof the Defendant, attended the premises. Because of the heavy rain, he was unable to adjust the alignment of the infra-red beam emittersinstalled in the balcony. Thus he by-passed Zone 3 and re-set the system. Without either by-passing Zone 3 or adjusting the alignment,the entire system could not be activated and the other five zones would also be left without protection.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Between the late hours of 1st or early hours of 2nd November 1997, the premises was burgled by a person or a number of persons whoentered the master bedroom through the balcony and stole a substantial quantity of jewellery from the Plaintiffs' safes. At the time,the Plaintiffs were attending a social function and were not in the premises.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The above factual background is not in dispute. The only disputes as to facts are whether on 3 July 1997 Mr Fong had verbally informedthe Plaintiffs' maid, Miss Guansing, about the by-passing and whether he had left her a service certificate to that effect.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> There is also no dispute that the Defendant owed the Plaintiffs a duty of care when providing its services on 3 July 1997. The disputeis as to the scope of that duty of care and whether that duty has been discharged. The other legal issues are causation and contributorynegligence on the part of the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p class="heading">The request for service:</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Initially, there was some dispute as to what precisely was said over the telephone between Mr Thomsen and Mr Lam (whom Mr Thomsenmistook as a Mr Chan) of the Defendant. According to Mr Lam, Mr Thomsen requested for a technician to check and repair the alarmsystem, if possible. That qualification is denied by Mr Thomsen who said he requested the Defendant to "fix" the alarm system. However,as the evidence unfolds and as the legal issues surface, the dispute assumed no real significance. Certainly, at the time of thetelephone call, the parties had no definite idea what was wrong with the system. By answering the call, the Defendant could not beassumed to have undertaken to complete the repair on the same day. Mr Thomsen had antiques and valuables in his apartment and wasabout to proceed on vacation leave out of Hong Kong. He must be anxious to have the system repaired before going on leave. It isunlikely that he would have asked for the repair to be made only if possible. I accept his evidence that he requested the Defendantto fix the alarm system, which was malfunctioning. However, even if I were to hold otherwise, the same question still remains, i.e.what is the scope of the duty of care owed by the Defendant.</p>    <p class="heading">The technician's conversation with Miss Guansing:</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The technician, Mr Fong, attended the Plaintiffs' premises at about 5 p.m. He was no stranger to the premises as he had been thereon many previous occasions, including the latest one on 19 June 1997. He went straight to the pantry where the control panel wasand worked on it. Then he went to the balcony and then returned to work on the control panel. He left after about half an hour.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> According to Mr Fong, he diagnosed the problem as mis-alignment of the infra-red beams, but it could not be adjusted because of therain. The only thing he could do to re-activate the system was to by-pass Zone 3, otherwise the entire system could not function.So he by-passed Zone 3 in the control panel. He told Miss Guansing in English, "Raining problem, disconnect Zone 3." He wrote outthe service certificate and asked Miss Guansing to write down the address of the premises and to sign on the certificate. Then herepeated the same words to her in English and pointing at the certificate at the same time. She indicated that she understood bysmiling. The words he wrote on the certificate are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Because Zone three required. Now Zone three to be disconnect. The alarm system in good operated."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> According to Miss Guansing, Mr Fong did not say anything when he entered the premises. He just worked on the control panel and examinedthe infra-red beam housing. He told her he had finished and asked her to write down the address of the premises, which she did. ThenMr Fong said, "and your signature", and she signed on the certificate. He did not say "raining problem, disconnect Zone 3", nor didhe give her the certificate or leave it behind. This was the first time she had dealing with Mr Fong as in the past it was the othermaid, Miss Ramos, who attended to Mr Fong.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Mr Fong retracted from what he said in his witness statement that he had informed Miss Guansing that after the disconnection of Zone3 the remainder of the system could still function properly and that Miss Guansing nodded her head to indicate that she understood.Whoever prepared his witness statement would not have written those words down without his instruction. Those words are so clearthat they could not have been written down by misunderstanding. But Mr Fong denied that that was what had happened. I think he wastrying to minimize his role in the incident.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Another significant departure of his evidence from his witness statement is that he had not mentioned in his witness statement thathe had told Miss Guansing twice, "raining problem, disconnect Zone 3". These words are very significant and material. One wonderswhy they were missing in a well prepared witness statement and why they were not recorded in the certificate. But instead, he choseto write down something so incomprehensible and grammatically incorrect. If he had said those words, he would have written them downin the certificate. They were so much simpler to say and write. I think he is exaggerating and concocting his evidence in court.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> I find Mr Fong an inconsistent witness and I do not believe in his evidence. Miss Guansing is not a very impressive witness either.She appears to have difficulties in understanding the questions asked of her. However, I am satisfied that she is an honest witness.I accept her evidence and reject Mr Fong's except where it is consistent with the Plaintiffs' case. I find that Mr Fong was not veryconversant in English and did not take the trouble to speak to Miss Guansing. As Miss Guansing said, he went straight to the pantryand worked on the control panel without saying anything. I find that he had not told Miss Guansing anything about the work he hadperformed on the system on 3 July 1997.</p>    <p class="heading">The Service Certificate:</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> According to Mr Fong, he gave a copy of the service certificate to Miss Guansing. He demonstrated in court how he would in the usualcourse tear the certificate from the pad, give the customer's copy to the client and then fold up the office copy and put it at theback of the pad. He said that was what he normally did. Miss Guansing denied ever having been given any copy. She said if she hadbeen given a copy of the certificate, she would have placed it on Mrs Thomsen's desk. In that event, Mr Thomsen would have seen thecertificate.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Mr Thomsen said he checked Mrs Thomsen's desk as she was on holiday with the children out of Hong Kong. He did not notice the certificate.If he had, he would have contacted the Defendant because the certificate, as he now sees it, is ambiguous as it referred to a disconnectionto be made in the future but also certified that the system was in good operating condition. He was about to go on leave and wascertainly very concerned that the security alarm system was in proper working order. I have no doubt that Mr Thomsen who cared toinstall a security alarm system to protect his home and to install roller shutters over the bedroom windows must view security asa top concern, particularly as he would be going away for a long vacation. I have no doubt that Mr Thomsen had not seen the certificate.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The issue is whether Mr Fong had given a copy of the certificate to Miss Guansing. There is no reason for Mr Fong not to give a copyto Miss Guansing, as he had already procured Miss Guansing to sign on the certificate. But if he had, there is no reason why MissGuansing would have ignored it and would not have given it to Mr Thomsen. There are several possibilities. Mr Fong would have subconsciouslyfolded the customer's copy with the office copy and put it at the back of the pad without giving it to Miss Guansing. He might havesimply left it in the pantry without physically handing it over to her and the copy went astray. Mr Fong might also have deliberatelywithheld the certificate pending a follow up visit to adjust the alignment of the infra-red beams (see Paragraph 34 below). MissGuansing might have received the certificate but misplaced it. Either of them would find it equally convenient to lie about havinggiven or not having received the certificate so as to minimize their responsibility over the matter.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> In view of my adverse finding of credibility against Mr Fong, I prefer the evidence of Miss Guansing. I find that Mr Fong had notgiven a copy of the certificate to Miss Guansing. If he had simply left it behind, he had not sufficiently brought it to the noticeor attention of Miss Guansing or Mr Thomsen and the copy had gone astray.</p>    <p class="heading">The Defendant's duty of care:</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> It is not the Plaintiffs' case that the Defendant had undertaken to rectify the fault. There is no dispute that by sending a technicianto carry out the repair, the Defendant, being a supplier acting in the course of a business, was under a duty to exercise such reasonablecare, skill and diligence in carrying out the repair as is appropriate in the circumstances, whether as a matter of implied contractualterm, or as the general duty of care at common law or under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/457/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/457" class="autolink_findacts">Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/457">Cap 457</a>. Mr Yin refers to <strong>Tai Hing Cotton Mill v Liu Chong Hing Bank</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20AC%2080" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] AC 80</a> at 107 and submits that where the parties are in a contractual relationship, their mutual obligations in tort cannot be any greaterthan those to be found expressly or by necessary implication in their contract. I agree and in my view in the absence of expresscontractual terms, the duty of care, skill and diligence under implied contractual term, or in tort or under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/457" class="autolink_findacts">Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance</a> are all the same.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> What then is this duty? The Defendant was asked to "fix", i.e. to repair a security alarm system. There are two important startingpoints in considering the nature and extent of this duty. Firstly, a person installs an alarm system because he has or is likelyto have valuable property to protect inside his premises. It is foreseeable that if the repair is not carried out properly the customerrequesting the repair would be exposed to serious risks and would suffer substantial loss. Secondly, only a company licensed underthe <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/460" class="autolink_findacts">Security and Guarding Services Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/460">Cap 460</a> may provide security work including installing, maintaining or repairing a security device. A degree of confidence is thereforeimposed on these licensed companies to exercise care, skill and diligence in the execution of their work in a responsible and professionalmanner. Codes of practice and industry standard may be referred to in deciding the scope and standard of the duty of care. In general,these companies must exercise such care, skill and diligence in the execution of their work as will in all the circumstances ensurethat the customer will be adequately protected and will be adequately warned of any danger or inadequacies in the protection as aresult of the work executed.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/460/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/460" class="autolink_findacts">Security and Guarding Services Ordinance</a>, the Security and Guarding Services Industry Authority specified in Gazette No 41/1995 that all intruder alarm sensors, detectors,control panels and signaling equipment should be designed to Underwriters Laboratories Inc Standard or British Standard or equivalent.Section 4.5 and 4.6 of British Standard BS4737 regarding maintenance of records provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"4.5 Corrective maintenance record</em></p>        <p class="quote">There should be a record of the date and time of receipt of each request for emergency service, together with the date and time ofcompletion of corrective maintenance and the necessary action(s) carried out.</p>        <p class="quote">This information should be kept for at least 2 years after the emergency call to which it refers.</p>        <p class="quote">The results of a corrective maintenance inspection should be entered on a maintenance visit record and the signature of the subscriberor his representative obtained on the record. A copy of the record should be given to the subscriber.</p>        <p class="quote">This information should be kept for at least 15 months after the inspection to which it refers.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">NOTE: If a preventative maintenance inspection is made at the same time as the corrective maintenance visit, separate visit recordsshould be completed.</p>        <p class="quote"><em>4.6 Temporary disconnection record</em></p>        <p class="quote">There should be a record of any temporary disconnection of the alarm system or of any part of it. This should identify which partof the system and the associated detectors or signalling equipment is not operable. The reason for the disconnection and the dateand time of disconnection and of subsequent reconnection should be given. A signed authorization for each disconnection should beobtained from the subscriber or his representative. This authorization should be kept for least 3 months after reconnection."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Mr Yin submits that BS4737 applies to preventative maintenance record keeping and not corrective or ad hoc maintenance record keepingas in the present case. However, so far as section 4.5 is concerned, it is expressly applicable to corrective or ad hoc maintenancerecord keeping.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> While it can be argued that section 4.6 is applicable only to preventative maintenance record keeping, the spirit of the sectionis that temporary disconnection of an alarm system or any part of it is a step to be taken with utmost caution and the subscribermust be informed of the disconnection, the reason for the disconnection and consents to the disconnection. Hence, the subscriber'ssigned authorization is required for each disconnection. As a disconnection exposes the customer to serious risks and likelihoodof substantial damage, a licensed security company should handle any disconnection in a responsible and professional manner. Thusin my view, the spirit applicable to preventative maintenance record keeping must be equally applicable to ad hoc maintenance recordkeeping.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Summing up from these observations, I conclude that disconnection of the system or part of it is a very serious step to be taken.It exposes the user, whether a subscriber to a preventative maintenance programme or a non-subscriber, to a certain degree of riskand likelihood of substantial loss. Hence the same duty of care applies to a subscriber or a non-subscriber. Such disconnection shouldonly be effected if it is inevitable and only on a very temporary basis pending adequate follow up. If such by-passing is inevitable,the company making the disconnection owes the user of the system a duty to inform him of the disconnection and a duty to take followup action.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> To discharge the duty to inform, the company must ensure that the user is well informed of the disconnection, well informed of theneed for follow up action, that he understands the risks he is being exposed to while the system or part of it is disabled and consentsto the disconnection.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The company should also take such follow up action as is appropriate in the circumstances to have the system fully re-connected,unless the user having been well informed of the risks as above decides otherwise. Here the standard of care differs in the caseof a subscriber from a non-subscriber. For the subscriber, the position is governed by the maintenance contract. Usually, the securitycompany is obliged under the terms of the contract to restore the system as soon as possible to its full capacity. Subject to theterms of the maintenance contract, it may have to do so at its own costs. For the non-subscriber, what follow up action is appropriatedepends on the extent of the initial service agreement and all the circumstances, such as the cost of the follow up repair, availabilityand cost of spare parts, and whether the duty to inform has been properly discharged. If the initial agreement is to repair and restorethe system, the contract has not been performed until the system has been restored or the agreement otherwise terminated for exampleby notice that the system could not be repaired. Hence, in addition to the duty to inform, the company should arrange follow up repairsand provide quotations if appropriate, unless the user having been informed of the repairs required decides not to have the repairs.If the initial agreement is to check the system and/or effect minor repairs, then the contract would only be performed when thoseminor repairs have been completed. If it turns out that substantial repairs are required, the duty ends with the duty to inform andperhaps to give a quotation for the repairs and offer to follow up. If the repairs, though of a minor nature, could not be effectedduring the initial visit, it would be incumbent on the company to make a second follow up visit to complete the repair. In general,follow up repairs may form the subject matter of a separate contract, in which case the company is free not to offer the service,provided it has duly discharged its duty to inform. The company may, for example, be unable to effect follow up repairs due to lackof spare parts or expertise or failure in reaching agreement with the user as to the cost of repairs.</p>    <p class="heading">Breach of duty of care:</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The Defendant contracted to fix or repair the alarm system. The problem was a mis-alignment of the infra-red beams which necessitateda minor repair but which could not be carried out because of the rain. Hence, it was reasonable and even inevitable to have Zone3 by-passed so as to re-activate the rest of the system and give the Plaintiffs at least a five-zone protection. There could be nocomplaint as to the disconnection. The issue is whether the duty to inform and the duty to take follow up action have been discharged.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The Defendant ought to know that after making the by-pass, the control panel became a source of misrepresentation and a cause ofmisunderstanding. Despite that Zone 3 had been by-passed, when the system was turned on, the red indicator for Zone 3 was not litup which indicated that there was no problem with Zone 3, while the green indicator was on showing that the system was functioningproperly. This would give the user the false impression that the whole system including Zone 3 was functioning properly. Indeed thatwas what Mr Thomsen thought, and in my view, very reasonably so. Prudence would require the Defendant to have the situation clearlyexplained to Miss Guansing or Mr Thomsen and to ensure that it is understood by them.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The Plaintiffs have been using the system for ten years and should be reasonably familiar with the system and fully aware of therisks involved should any zone be by-passed and of the need to have follow up repairs. Thus had Mr Fong informed the Plaintiffs thatZone 3 had been disconnected and that the indicator light for Zone 3 in the control panel was inoperative or misleading, I wouldconsider that sufficiently discharged the duty to inform in the circumstances. However, on the facts, I reject Mr Fong's evidencethat he had told Miss Guansing that Zone 3 had been disconnected and that he had given her a copy of the service certificate.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Even if Mr Fong had given a copy of the service certificate to Miss Guansing, that would not have sufficiently discharged the dutyto inform. While I have sympathy for the Defendant because of Mr Fong's inadequacy in English, one must take an objective view andask oneself what meaning the language used in the certificate conveys to a reasonable man with a reasonable understanding of theEnglish language and of the surrounding circumstances. The certificate is ambiguous. The first sentence, "because zone three required",is meaningless. The second sentence certifies that "now Zone three to be disconnect". That must mean for some reason, Zone 3 hasto be disconnected in future. The word "now" may be inconsistent with disconnection in future, but is also inconsistent with thezone having been disconnected in the past and with the last sentence. That last sentence which certifies that "the alarm system ingood operated" is fatal. Despite the clumsiness in the language, it must mean that the whole system and not just part of it is nowin good operating condition. In summary, the certificate gives no hint that Zone 3 has been disconnected or that follow up repairsare required. Thus even if that certificate had been given to Mr Thomsen, it could not have discharged the Defendant's duty to inform.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Mr Fong is not conversant in English. Mr Thomsen and Miss Guansing can not speak Chinese. It is therefore up to the Defendant toensure that Mr Thomsen or Miss Guansing knew Zone 3 was disconnected. So far as the Defendant sought to rely on the service certificate,it should ensure what was written on the certificate was comprehensible. If it was not, because of Mr Fong's inadequacy of the Englishlanguage, it should ensure that someone competent in the English language would subsequently speak or write to Mr Thomsen and informhim of the disconnection and the risks involved. That had not been done.</p>    <p class="heading">Duty to follow up:</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Mr Thomsen requested for repairs. At that stage it was not known what was the extent of repairs necessary. Though Mr Thomsen wasnot a subscriber of maintenance programme, he was nevertheless a regular customer and the Defendant had been last provided serviceabout two weeks ago. It must be their understanding that if the system need minor repairs, the Defendant would carry out the repairs.If the repairs were likely to be substantial or costly, the Defendant would give Mr Thomsen a quotation and seek his instructionbefore executing the repair. As it turned out, the repair required was just a re-alignment, though it could not be carried out thereand then because of the rain. It would have been the Defendant's duty to complete the repair by making an appointment to come againas soon as possible or, out of caution, inform Mr Thomsen of the problem and the need to charge for an additional visit. If the Defendantdecided not to provide the follow up repair for any reason, including Mr Thomsen's refusal to pay for the additional visit, it shouldbring that to Mr Thomsen's notice after discharging its duty to inform of the disconnection, the risks and need for follow up repairs.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> On the facts, Mr Fong knew follow up visit to adjust the re-alignment was necessary. The defence case is that Mr Lam decided to waitfor Mr Thomsen's call. He may be acting on the basis that the service certificate had been sufficiently brought to Mr Thomsen's notice.Even if it had, the certificate is ambiguous. In view of the very onerous duty to inform, that the indicator for Zone 3 had becomeinoperative or misleading, the inadequacy of Mr Fong's English and the ambiguity of what was written on the certificate, the Defendantshould take the initiative either to perform the follow up repairs or seek instruction from Mr Thomsen. Had Mr Thomsen been informedthat Zone 3 had been disconnected and that the Defendant was prepared to offer follow up repair at additional charge, then it wouldbe up to the Plaintiffs to decide whether to have the follow up repair by the Defendant or by another security company or not atall. However, the Defendant had not done so. It is clearly in breach of its duty to perform follow up repairs.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Despite the visit on 3 July 1997, the Plaintiffs have not been invoiced for the services. Mr Fong said that if the Plaintiffs werea subscriber for the maintenance programme, he would have effected follow up service, i.e. re-align the infra-red beams, as soonas possible. As they were not, he reported the work he did to his section head, Mr Lam. Mr Lam told him to wait for notificationfrom Mr Thomsen and to perform the follow up work only if requested. According to Mr Lam, he thought Mr Thomsen might call him againfor follow up service unless he decided to go to another company for assistance. He therefore withheld the service certificate withoutpassing it to the accounts department for issue of invoice. Thereafter he forgot about the whole matter. Hence the Plaintiffs havenever been invoiced for the service on 3 July 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> I find such explanation very strained and incredible. The Defendant was asked to repair the system. Mr Fong found that it neededa simple re-alignment, which was the usual problem with that system. He could not adjust the alignment because of the rain. As atemporary measure, he disconnected Zone 3 so as to re-activate the rest of the system. He knew that exposed the Plaintiffs' premisesto risk of unalarmed intrusion. On his evidence, he considered the work not yet complete and required follow up. Hence he did notsign his name against the corresponding entry in the service record. He said he was told by Mr Lam to withhold follow up action becausethe Plaintiffs were not subscribers. Both Mr Fong and Mr Lam realized the need to take follow up action as soon as possible if thePlaintiffs were a subscriber. Considering the very minor repair that was required but the very serious risk the Plaintiffs were beingexposed to, I find the explanation of Mr Fong and Mr Lam so ridiculous as to be incredible. The irresistible inference is that theDefendant, whether it be Mr Fong or Mr Lam, simply overlooked the outstanding follow up work required and hence neglected to followup and to issue the invoice. The distinction they drew about subscriber and non-subscriber is just a convenient excuse to cover uptheir neglect.</p>    <p class="heading">Causation:</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Mr Yin submits that in the ordinary course of events, the Plaintiffs' alarm system would have been inspected at least once between3 July 1997 and 1 November 1997 as part of routine maintenance and it was reasonable for the Defendant to expect a routine inspectionwould have been performed. He submits by not subscribing for preventative maintenance the Plaintiffs assumed the obligation to maintainthe system and the responsibility for not discovering the disconnection which such routine inspection would have revealed. He submitsthat the Plaintiffs' failure to maintain was an unexpected intervening act which broke the chain of causation and relieved the Defendantof liability. He referred to the following passage in <em>Charlesworth &amp; Percy on Negligence, 9th Edition</em> at paragraph 5-65 in support of his argument:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Finally, the situation must be considered where the defendant anticipates that a third party will do some intervening act and, ifhe is reasonably entitled to rely upon that other doing so, he may be relieved of liability. In actions based on negligence againstthe manufacturers, retailers, repairers and transferors of goods, if no examination of the goods is anticipated, the damage is nottoo remote. On the other hand at common law, if such manufacturer, retailer, repairer or transferor of goods reasonably could haveexpected an intermediate examination or some important instruction to be carried out, he could and may still be able to avoid liabilityfor damage arising from the defect which would have been disclosed by such examination, or more certainly for the damage arisingfrom the failure to carry out the instructions properly."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The principle referred to by Mr Yin is applicable where an intermediate examination would reasonably have been expected or some importantinstructions would reasonably have been followed. For example, instruction for skin test for a noxious hair dye: see <strong>Parker v Oloxo Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%203%20All%20ER%20524" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] 3 All ER 524</a> and <strong>Holmes v Ashford</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1950%5d%202%20All%20ER%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1950] 2 All ER 76</a>; or where the work would be inspected by some authority charged with ensuring compliance with certain standards: see <strong>Buckner v Ashby &amp; Horner</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1941%5d%201%20KB%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1941] 1 KB 321.</a> The scope of operation of this principle is very limited. Intermediate examination or compliance with instruction must reasonablybe expected. Mere warning of the dangers of the product supplied is insufficient: see <strong>Good-Wear Treaders v D &amp; B Holdings</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%2098%20DLR%20%283d%29%2059" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 98 DLR (3d) 59.</a></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> In the present case, as a matter of good practice, BS4737 recommends service inspection of an alarm system once every three months.This is only what the industry regards as a matter of prudence, but is not a routine which consumers are reasonably expected to observe.Many alarm systems are sold in the market without maintenance agreement. In particular, the Defendant knew the Plaintiffs were notsubscribers of such a maintenance programme and that they only called on its services on an ad hoc basis as and when required. ThePlaintiffs were precisely the sort of persons from whom a routine three monthly inspection could not reasonably have been expected.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Further, I think the principle referred to by Mr Yin has to be carefully applied. The Plaintiffs requested for repairs. The Defendantis a licensed security company, whose business it was to provide such repair service. It has contracted to carry out repairs forthe Plaintiffs and to do so by exercising reasonable care, skill and diligence. At the time of the contract, it must be in the contemplationof the parties that if the Defendant is in breach of its duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence, the premises willbe unprotected and the Plaintiffs will suffer damage if someone burgles into the premises. The Plaintiffs relied on the Defendant'scare and skill. It cannot lie in the Defendant's mouth to say despite you pay me for my care and skill, yet if I do my work negligently,you will and you should check it out yourself in the next routine inspection in three months.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> This is not a case where the Plaintiffs had by their own act or neglect rendered the system inoperative, for example, by failingto ensure the battery is charged or defective wires or light bulbs replaced. Nor is this a case where a fault has developed throughtime or lack of maintenance as to render the alarm system inoperative. This is nothing of the sort. There is nothing that the Plaintiffshave done or have failed to do which have broken the chain of causation. What happened was simply that Zone 3 has been by-passedand the Plaintiffs were not informed.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> So far as causation is concerned, I think the proper test is that set out by Stuart-Smith LJ in <strong>Allied Maples Group v Simmons &amp; Simmons</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20WLR%201602" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 WLR 1602</a> at 1609 to 1610:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In these circumstances, where the plaintiffs' loss depends upon the action of an independent third party, it is necessary to consideras a matter of law what it is necessary to establish as a matter of causation and where causation ends and quantification of damagebegins.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1) What has to be proved to establish a causal link between the negligence of the defendants and the loss sustained by the plaintiffsdepends in the first instance on whether the negligence consists of some positive act or misfeasance, or an omission or non-feasons.In the former case, the question of causation is one of historical fact. The court has to determine on the balance of probabilitywhether the defendant's act, for example the careless driving, caused the plaintiffs loss consisting of his broken leg. Once establishedon balance of probability, that fact is taken as true and the plaintiff recovers his damage in full. ...</p>        <p class="quote">(2) If the defendant's negligence consists of an omission, for example to provide proper equipment, given proper instructions or advice,causation depends, not upon a question of historical fact, but on the answer to the hypothetical question, what would the plaintiffhave done if the equipment had been provided or the instruction or advice given? This can only be a matter of inference to be determinedfrom all the circumstances."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Thus the issue is what would the Plaintiffs have done if Mr Thomsen had been informed of the disconnection of Zone 3. According toMr Thomsen, had he known that Zone 3 had been disabled or was otherwise not functioning properly, he would have telephoned the Defendantimmediately and instructed that a full repair be carried out prior to his going on vacation and he would never have left the securityalarm system only partially repaired or Zone 3 unprotected. He certainly considered the balcony a vulnerable point and hence increasedthe number of infra-red beam emitters there. I have no doubt about his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> On Mr and Mrs Thomsen's evidence and those of the caretaker and cleaner on duty, the caretakers have been given standing instructionsthat they should alert the police immediately should the security alarm went off for more than one minute. Thus if Zone 3 had beenfunctioning properly on the night of 1 or 2 November 1997, when the burglar(s) entered the balcony, the security alarm system wouldhave been triggered. The alarm would have been sounded and the flood lights turned on. If that was not sufficient to deter the burglar(s),the police would have been alerted and arrived before the burglar(s) could have enough time to break open the safes and leave withthe jewellery. In all the circumstances, the loss could have been avoided. By by-passing Zone 3 without informing the Plaintiffs,the Plaintiffs lost a real or substantial chance of avoiding the loss. I am satisfied that causation is established and the damageis not remote whether in contract or in tort.</p>    <p class="heading">Contributory negligence:</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Mr Yin relied on the Plaintiffs' failure to carry out routine maintenance or inspection as their contributory negligence. I do notthink the Plaintiffs owed the Defendant any duty to carry out routine inspection on the system to rectify the Defendant's neglect.They contracted with the Defendant for its services and were entitled to rely on its skill, care and diligence. Nothing of what theyhad done or failed to do have broken the chain of causation. Similarly nothing of what they had done or failed to do have contributedto the disconnection. What caused the loss was the by-pass and the failure to inform. I would attribute no fault to the Plaintiffsand dismiss the Defendant's claim for contributory negligence.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion:</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Accordingly, I am satisfied that the Defendant is in breach of the duty to exercise reasonable skill, care and diligence impliedunder the contract to repair or at common law or by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/457/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/457" class="autolink_findacts">Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance</a> and as a result the Plaintiffs suffered loss. I therefore enter judgment on liability with damages to be assessed against the Defendantand make an order nisi that the Defendant shall pay the Plaintiffs' costs to be taxed, if not agreed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(Anthony To)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Anderson Chow, instructed by Messrs Dibb Lupton Alsop, for the Plaintiffs</p>        <p>Mr Michael Yin, instructed by Messrs Paul C W Tse &amp; Co., for the Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2001/1334.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
