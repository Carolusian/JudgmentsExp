The writ was issued on the 30th March 1994.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> On the 14th October 1993, the first named Plaintiff Mr. Chung Man Yau (P1) was walking along the pavement (which is part of the highway)in Bowring Street Kowloon, together with the second named Plaintiff, Madam Kwan Siu Hung (P2) who is his wife. As they were passingthe building at No. 2 Bowring Street, a concrete balcony which was part of that building and which protruded over the pavement, collapsed.Some of the concrete fell upon and injured them. The Registered Owner of the building at that time was the Defendant, Sihon CompanyLimited.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The Plaintiffs' claim as amended is for damages for negligence or alternatively nuisance.</p>    <p class="heading">Negligence</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The burden of proof lies upon the plaintiffs who rely upon the doctrine of res ripsa loquitur in view of the fact that the balconycollapsed and injured them. I find that the doctrine does apply. Just as the fall of the ceiling of a theatre, hitting a member ofthe audience, was held to be prima facie evidence of negligence on the part of the occupiers of the theatre - <strong>Page v. St Helen's Theatre Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20KB%2030" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] K.B. 30</a> - so here the collapse of the balcony on the plaintiffs is prima facie evidence of negligence on the part of the person responsiblefor the maintenance of the building.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The Defendant tried to rebut the presumption of negligence. In order to succeed it had to show that the accident was just as consistentwith its having exercised due diligence as with its having been negligent. That it failed to do and I find that the plaintiffs havedischarged the onus of proving negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The building was an old one, the Occupation Permit having been issued in 1948. The various floors were let separately. A full surveyafter the accident showed that the building was generally dilapidated and that comprehensive maintenance had not been carried outsince work had been done by a previous owner pursuant to a statutory repair notice in 1981.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> It was the opinion of Mr. Lee Yun Sang, Chief Structural Engineer of the Building Department, that the cause of the collapse wascorrosion in the reinforcing steel in the concrete balcony, due to seepage of water into the concrete.</p>    <p class="heading">Responsibility for maintenance</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> There was no evidence of any arrangement made between the Defendant and the tenant of the 1st floor flat with regard to repairs butit was clear from the evidence of Mr. Peter Wong Wing Cheung, the Company Secretary and Managing Director of the Defendant that theDefendant did consider itself under a duty to carry out repairs to the building generally. He said in evidence:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Whenever we received a complaint of any problem from tenants we would attend to it - usually I personally or notify a decoratingcompany or someone to take care of it."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>When asked "if repair work was needed to be done would you do it and pay?" He replied</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It depends on what the repair is. If the damage was done by the tenant or relates to interior equipment the tenant will take responsibilityhimself. In some cases I do not care because if I think the complaint is not justified I will not take action."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The Defendant's accounts show a paltry $3,000 spent on maintenance from the purchase of the building in 1991 to its sale in 1995.</p>    <p class="heading">Building out of Plumb - MTR works</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> There was some evidence that the building had in 1976 been found to be slightly out of plumb but I was satisfied by the evidenceof Mr. Lee Yun Sang that the total lean was an insignificant 1 in 88. It had not increased since 1981 and had not caused the collapse.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Work connected with the Mass Transit Railway in 1976 may have contributed slightly to the lean of the building and may have causedsome vibration damage but I am satisfied that it did not produce a latent defect which caused the collapse. Repairs had been carriedout in 1981 by a previous owner.</p>    <p class="heading">The Load on the Balcony - Change of Use</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The photographs show that the tenant had used the balcony to store thread and buttons, though the flat was designed for domesticuse and that at some time additions had been made to the balcony's structure. Mr. Lee's evidence was that the extra load might overtime have caused micro-cracks to develop. The cracks would have made it easier for water to seep into the concrete and corrode thereinforcing rods.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> It was, however, Mr. Lee's evidence, that visible signs would have appeared well before the collapse and the corrosion would havebeen detected upon inspection by an expert. I am satisfied that, if the landlord had bothered to inspect, it would have detectedcracks and should then have called in an expert who would have diagnosed the problem.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Some indication of the Defendant's attitude to its responsibilities may be found in the fact that, having been served with a statutoryrepair notice after the collapse, it promptly sold the building unrepaired and at a large profit. It appears that the Defendant'sonly interest was in profiting from the rents and it ignored its duty to keep the building in repair. Mr. Wong said that he had noright to enter and inspect the flat but there is no evidence that he ever sought to do so or attempted to inspect the exterior.</p>    <p class="heading">Concrete mix</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The cement content of the concrete used in the construction of the balcony was shown by tests to be 9.5% whereas the recommendedcontent is 11.97% but Mr. Lee said that the strength was acceptable (assuming, of course, that the reinforcing steel was intact).</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> I find that negligence is proved. The balcony collapsed because of the failure by the Defendant to keep the building in good repair.The seepage of water was due to want of maintenance. The water corroded the reinforcing rods and caused the collapse. There musthave been warning signs if the Defendant had bothered to look for them.</p>    <p class="heading">Nuisance</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> As is said in the headnote to the report of <strong>Wringe v. Cohen</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1940%5d%201%20KB%20229" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1940] 1 KB 229:</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If, owing to want of repair, premises on a highway become dangerous and constitute a nuisance, so that they collapse and injure apasser-by or an adjoining owner, the occupier or owner of the premises, if he has undertaken the duty to repair, is answerable, whetherhe knew or ought to have known of the danger or not.</p>        <p class="quote"><em>Aliter</em>, if the nuisance is created not by want of repair, but by the act of a trespasser or by a latent defect."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> It is common ground that the premises in question became dangerous. It is not denied that they constituted a nuisance. The balconyundoubtedly collapsed and injured the Plaintiffs. The flat to which the balcony belonged was part of the building which the Defendantowned. It was the Defendant's duty to keep it in good repair. The nuisance was not due to the act of a trespasser or a latent defectas I have already found when considering the negligence issue. It resulted from the Defendant's failure to keep the building in goodrepair. I find that the Defendant is liable in nuisance as well as negligence.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum of Damage</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> At the time of trial the Plaintiffs sought to rely upon a decision of Cheung, J. in order to persuade me to depart from the conventionalbasis for assessing damages in a case such as this. The result of the appeal against Cheung, J.'s decision is now known. See <strong>Chan Pui Ki v. Leung On</strong> CA 263 of 1995, as yet unreported. The tariff for damages for pain suffering and loss of amenities has now been brought up to datebut a novel method of calculating future loss of earnings, accepted by the trial judge, did not find favour with the Court of Appeal.Insofar as it may be necessary to calculate future loss of earnings in this case, I can disregard the actuarial evidence led forthe Plaintiffs in support of the method of calculation which has now been disapproved by the Court of Appeal.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum of Damage. P1.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Mr. Chung Man Yau was born on the 14th July 1954 and on the 14th October 1993, the date of the accident, he was a healthy man aged39 years working as a hawker of children's garments. He is now 42.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> P1 was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital on the day of the accident. According to the medical report concerning his admissionhe was fully conscious with stable pulse and blood pressure but there is some evidence from him and from his wife that he was driftingin and out of consciousness.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> There was an 8cm long deep laceration at the right occipital area with a depressed skull fracture underneath. His left fourth andfifth ribs were also fractured. He was managed conservatively and discharged on the 28th October 1993.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> On the 30th October 1993 he was admitted to the Kwong Wah Hospital complaining of numbness of the left fingers. Surgery was carriedout on the 5th November 1993 to remove the depressed fracture and P1 was discharged on the 18th November "with no neurological deficit".</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> On the 11th March 1994 P1 was admitted to the same hospital for "post-traumatic cranial defect". On the 18th March he underwent surgerywhen an acrylic cover was placed over the hole in his skull. He was discharged on the 26th March 1994, after which he received follow-uptreatment as an out-patient.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> The several medical reports which are in evidence indicate that as a result of the operation P1 has weakness in his left arm andleg and he suffers from post-concussional syndrome as evidenced by headaches, dizziness and tinnitus. There is also evidence thathe suffers from depression and irritability which causes difficulties in his personal relationships. Because of the dizziness hehas given up driving. The accident has had an adverse effect on his libido.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Medical estimates of the cumulative permanent impairment of P1 vary. He obviously exaggerated his complaints when examined by a doctoron behalf of the defence. Dr. Yu Yuk Ling in November 1995 put the cumulative permanent impairment at 18% and the loss of earningcapacity at 25%. Doctor Philip Wen-Chee Mao assessed impairment of the whole person at 22% and disability at 50%. He had apparentlybeen told by P1 that he was unable to do any work whereas the evidence indicates the contrary. Doctor Singer's psychiatric reportsuggested a permanent loss of earning capacity, with psychiatric treatment, at 60% and without it at 75%. His opinion was that impairmentof the whole person was 30% with treatment and 40% without it. Doctor Law Wun Tong examined P1 on behalf of the defence on the 5thDecember and 9th December 1995. He found that P1 did not cooperate and exaggerated his disabilities but his general findings as topost-concussional syndrome were similar to those of the other doctors and his assessments were that permanent impairment was 15%and loss of earning capacity 25%.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> In addition to the medical reports and the evidence given by the doctors in Court I had the advantage of being able to observe P1closely while he gave evidence of a period of 4 days. He appeared to me to be in full possession of his mental faculties, copingextremely well with cross-examination in the sense that he employed various tactics to avoid difficult questions and to advance hisown case. His memory appeared to be very good. Whilst I am satisfied that he did suffer some irreparable brain damage which has hadan effect on the strength of his left arm and leg and that he did suffer post-concussional syndrome, I am also satisfied that hehas exaggerated his deficiency with an eye on this litigation. That exaggeration has impressed some doctors more than others butI find on the basis of all the evidence, not excluding that of himself and his wife, that he should properly be treated as havingsuffered an impairment of the whole person of 20%.</p>    <p class="heading">Pain, suffering and loss of amenities</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> It is common ground between the parties that the Defendant's claim is one which falls into the "Serious Injury" category in the tariffaffirmed in the Court of Appeal in <strong>Chan Pui Ki</strong> (<em>supra</em>). The range is between $400,000.00 and $540,000.00. Neither party has provided the Court with any decisions on comparable facts.The Plaintiff contends for the top of the scale and the Defendant for the bottom of it. Apart from the weakness in his left arm andleg and the physical symptoms of dizziness and headache, P1 has suffered adverse psychological effects in that he has lost his formerenergy and drive, his family life is affected and having been a happy and outgoing man he is now suffering a degree of clinical depression.A sum of $470,000.00 will be awarded for pain, suffering and loss of amenities.</p>    <p class="heading">Loss of future earnings</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In the schedule of damages, P1's loss is described as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"1. Loss of future earnings</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) Earnings from retail business in Hong Kong</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(i) the 1st Plaintiff is suffering a continuing loss of earning from his retail business in Hong Kong of at least HK$72,100.00 permonth on average.</p>                <p class="quote">(ii) the annual loss of earning from his retail business is at least HK$865,200.00."</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> It is common ground that P1 did not and does not hold a hawker licence. Hawking without a licence is illegal as being a contraventionof Section 83B of the Public Health and Urban Services Ordinance <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/132">Cap. 132</a>. A plaintiff in an action for damages for personal injuriesis not entitled to any award in respect of a loss of earnings from unlicensed hawking. In <strong>Tam Choi v. Ho Wai Hing and Anor</strong> CA19 of 1974 (unreported) the Full Court upheld a decision of Briggs, C.J. that an illegal hawker could not recover damages for lossof earnings as such in a running-down case. This principle has been followed in a number of High Court decisions. See <strong>Mak Yuk-kiu &amp; Anor v. Tin Shing Auto Radio CTR Ltd. and Anor</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20HKLR%2077" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] HKLR 77.</a></p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> I find that P1's claim in respect of loss of earnings and of future loss of earnings must fail since it relates to his earnings asan illegal hawker.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> P1 pleaded that he was running his own business and gave evidence to that effect. Because he was unable to procure the issue of ahawker licence to himself, he found a lady who held a hawking licence in respect of the former business of her deceased husband.The lady was old and in poor health and was not running a hawker business so P1 paid her monthly sums of something over $2,000 forthe use of her licence. By-law 13(1) of the Hawker (Urban Council) By-laws <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/132">Cap. 132</a> provides that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"a licensee shall not transfer his licence to any other person. Any transfer or purported transfer of a licence shall be of no effect".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The licensee, P1 and P2 made false declarations to the Urban Council to the effect that P1 and P2 were assistants to the licenseein the licensee's hawking business (which did not exist). Later, further false declarations were made so that P2 was appointed deputyto the licensee. Thus it was made to appear to the officials responsible for enforcing the Hawker By-laws that a hawker businesswas being run by the licensee at the stall with the assistance of P1 and P2. That was a complete sham. P1 was unlawfully runninghis own hawker business without a licence.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> This is not a case where the authorities were deliberately turning a blind eye to the arrangement. The authorities were being deceived.In any event, if the authorities had, as a matter of policy, turned a blind eye to the illegal hawking, such a policy would not haverendered the activity legal. I am aware of a decision of Jones, J. in <strong>Ho Wing-chu v. Chan Kwok-keung and Anor</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20HKLR%2095" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 HKLR 95</a>, which was not cited at the trial. There, Jones, J. held that damages were recoverable in relation to loss of earnings from an illegalbusiness carried on in Kowloon Walled City because it was the Government's policy to turn a blind eye to the carrying on of an unlicensedand therefore illegal food business there. With respect to the learned judge, I do not think that it was open to him to disregardthe illegality but in any event the case was decided on its own special facts in view of the unique circumstances which prevailedin the Kowloon Walled City before it was demolished. I would not follow it in the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> Though I must ignore P1's illegal business when considering the matter of damages, I have given some thought to the question whether,quite apart from loss of future earnings from that business, he is entitled to an award of damages in respect of the effect whichhis injuries have had on his earning capacity in general. A claim on that basis was not pleaded but the decision in <strong>Chan Wai-tong and Anor v. Li Ping-sum</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20HKLR%20176" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] HKLR 176</a> suggests that a failure to plead a claim for loss of future earning capacity does not necessarily bar a plaintiff from recoveringsuch damages since loss of future earning capacity is included in general damages.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In <strong>Tam Choi</strong> (<em>supra</em>) the Full Court was dealing with a case where a plaintiff had been making the greater part of her income as a hawker but had supplementedit by work in a factory for about 10 days each month. The judge based his assessment of loss of earning capacity, ignoring the illegalactivity, upon the assumption that the plaintiff would never do more than an average of 10 days legal work in a month. Huggins, J.,as he then was, said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In my view the learned judge came to right conclusion on this point. Such evidence as there was tended to show that the Plaintiffpreferred hawking when she had the capital to buy stock. Indeed her evidence that her work in the factory was confined to times whenshe did not have enough capital is hardly consistent with her evidence of her higher earnings as a hawker and of the apparent regularityof her employment in the factory. It would not be justifiable to infer that the Plaintiff would change the habit of the past eightyears, but rather was there a probability that she would continue it. It is true that if she did wish to make the change she would,on the findings of the learned judge, be unable by reason of her injuries to make it, but the possibility must be regarded as tooremote for that loss of earning capacity to have a quantifiable value. The result may seem to some a harsh punishment for makinga living in a manner regarded by society as criminal, but our task is to apply the law as we find it."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It may well be that the learned judge intended to insert the word "not" before "regarded" in the last sentence and that it was accidentallyomitted but it makes no difference to the effect of what was decided.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> Unfortunately for P1 all the evidence is that he was engaged full time in his illegal hawking business both before and after theaccident and that he intended to continue to run that business full time. In the circumstances, there is no evidential basis formaking any award in respect of notional future lawful earnings. I find on the evidence that P1 intends to continue with his illegalbusiness. If I were to award him a notional sum for loss of future lawful earnings I would in fact be supplementing his future unlawfulearnings so that he would obtain by a fiction that to which he is not entitled. Such a course would be against public policy.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> P1 does not come to Court with clean hands. He has never paid any tax on his profits. He has deceived the authorities in order tobe able to hawk without a licence.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> A great deal of time was taken up at the trial in a detailed examination of such business records as P1 produced. P1 did not keepproper accounts and never submitted any tax return in respect of his business. The only tax return he ever caused to be submittedwas on his own testimony wholly false and represented him to be an employee receiving a very low salary. A substantial number ofrelevant documents surfaced only during the course of the trial. It was left to counsel for the defence to try to make some senseout of the records and the evidence. He came up with a difference in net after tax profit per month, before and after the accident,of $4,371.70.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Counsel for the defence submitted that some account must be taken of exaggeration on the part of the Plaintiff and of the well-knownfact that there has been a general decline in the retail market in Hong Kong. I do take notice of the well-known fact that retailshop business has been declining in Hong Kong but there is no evidence as to the extent of the decline and there is no evidence asto trends in the hawker market. It may well be that the customers who are deserting the shops are making their purchases from hawkers.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> I find that P1 was an unreliable witness when he was giving financial estimates unsupported by documents and I was not satisfiedas to the authenticity of the written records which had been compiled after the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Had I felt able to make an award for loss of earnings I would have estimated the loss at $3,000.00 per month and for loss of futureearnings I would have taken a multiplier of 12.</p>    <p class="heading">Loss of China investment income</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Again the evidence is not clear but it seems that P1 had an investment of RMB500,000 in a business in Mainland China. Either it wasa loan to the proprietor of the business or it was working capital contributed by the 1st Plaintiff as a sleeping partner. P1 wasunable to be more specific. The yield was an astonishing RMB35,000 per month. P1 withdrew the investment after his operation forthe removal of the indented skull fracture and before the second operation when a cover was placed over the resulting hole. P1 wasunable to make up his mind in evidence as to whether his motive was to protect the fund in case he did not survive or to deal witha cash shortage.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> I am satisfied that there is no basis whatever for a claim for damages against the Defendant based upon the fact that the 1st Plaintiffchose of his own accord to bring to an end a high yielding investment, thus depriving himself of a substantial income. There willbe no award under this head.</p>    <p class="heading">Special Damage: P1</p>    <p class="heading">Medical expenses</p>    <table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="60%">These are agreed at</td>            <td style="text-align:right" width="20%">$5,815.00</td>            <td width="20%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p class="heading">Tonic food</p>    <table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="60%">The sum claimed is excessive at $40,030.00.</td>            <td style="text-align:right" width="20%"></td>            <td width="20%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="60%">I will allow a token sum of $5,000.00</td>            <td style="text-align:right" width="20%">$5,000.00</td>            <td width="20%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading">Travelling expenses</p>    <table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="60%">These are agreed at</td>            <td style="text-align:right" width="20%">$4,210.00</td>            <td width="20%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading">Medical reports.

Both claims were misconceived and failed. These misconceivedclaims caused a trial, which in my estimation could have been finished in 3 days, to be extended to just over 9 days.
