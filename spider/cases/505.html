It is this application which is the subject of this judgment.</p>    <p class="heading">THE FACTS</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The material facts can be shortly stated. The Plaintiff, a Hong Kong company, is a supplier of medical equipment. In particular,it is the owner of a piece of equipment known as an "Elan Analyser". The 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant, a Hong Kong company, is a freight forwarder, and the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant is a Chinese commercial airline operating within the PRC.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> What happened was this. The 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant contracted with the Plaintiff to transport the Elan Analyser and ancillary equipment (packed, I understand, in three woodencrates) by land and air from a medical exhibition site in Beijing to another exhibition site in Shanghai. The 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant used the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant for the air carriage leg of the trip. Unfortunately the equipment did not arrive in one piece; to the contrary, it appearsto have arrived in several pieces, and the damage in question was revealed only upon the unpacking of the crates at the exhibitionsite in Shanghai. In the event, the Analyser was sold for scrap, and this case is brought by the Plaintiff to recover the sum ofUS$80,612.39, which it claims is its net loss.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> By Amended Points of Claim dated 27<sup><kbd>th</kbd></sup> June 1997 the Plaintiff sues the 1st Defendant, the freight forwarder; as might be expected, the case is framed in contract and tort.It also seeks to recover against the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant, the air carrier, which had issued the airway bill relevant to the air carriage portion of the Beijing-Shanghai trip; inthis connection the plaintiff says that the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant, as sub-bailee of the cargo, was under a duty safely to deliver the cargo to the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant, as holder of the airway bill, in Shanghai, and that the damage complained of was caused by the negligence or breach ofduty of the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant as sub-bailee. An alternative pleaded case is that the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant, as agent for the Plaintiff, entered into the contract of carriage, evidenced by the airway bill, with the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant, and that in breach of that contract, the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant failed to take care of the cargo and deliver it up to the Plaintiff in the same order and condition as it was on deliveryto the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant; in the further alternative, in breach of contract the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant failed to effect the necessary insurance thereof. As to the contract element of the case, however, Mr Clifford Smith, appearingfor the Plaintiff, made it clear during argument that he placed no reliance thereon.</p>    <p class="heading">BASIS OF THE EX PARTE ORDER</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The application before Mr Justice Waung was supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr Barber, a solicitor with Richards Butler, the Plaintiff'ssolicitors. As Mr Barber's supplemental affidavit confirms, the application was made, and granted, solely upon the basis of Order11 rule 1(1)(c) RSC<strong>,</strong> the relevant part of which provision reads :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... service of a writ out of the jurisdiction is permissible with the leave of the Court if in the action begun by the writ--</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(c) the claim is brought against a person duly served within the jurisdiction ... and a person out of the jurisdiction is a necessaryor proper party thereto;"</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> I note two further important requirements which must be met in connection with rule 1(1)(c) :- viz. Order 11 rule 4(1)(d) :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" An application for the grant of leave under rule 1(1) must be supported by an affidavit stating -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(d) where the application is made under rule 1(1)(<em>c</em>), the grounds for the deponent's belief that there is between the plaintiff and the person on whom <em>a writ has been served a real issue which the plaintiff may reasonably ask the Court to try</em>." (emphasis added)</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>And O.11, r.4(2) :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" No such leave shall be granted <em>unless it shall be made sufficiently to appear to the Court that the case is a proper one for service out of the jurisdiction</em> under this Order." (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On the basis of the evidence placed before him, the learned judge granted the Order which the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant now seeks to set aside.</p>    <p class="heading">RELEVANT PRINCIPLES</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The general principles to be applied in an Order 11 jurisdictional debate are now, I think, tolerably well-established; see in particularthe useful commentary in the Supreme Court Practice 1997, in particular at Marginal Notes 11/1/6, 11/1/7, 11/4/3 and 11/4/10.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> As a result of the speech of Lord Goff in the leading case of <em><strong>Seaconsar Ltd. v. Bank Markazi</strong></em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20AC%20438" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 AC 438 (H.L.)</a>, it is now accepted that all such applications for leave to serve out under Order 11 involve a three stage evaluation. As Lord Goffput it (<em>op.cit.</em>, at 456H) :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Accordingly, a judge faced with a question of leave to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction under Order 11 will in practicehave to consider both (1) whether jurisdiction has been sufficiently established, on the criterion of the good arguable case laiddown in <em>Korner's</em> case, under one of the paragraphs of rule 1(1), and (2) whether there is a serious issue to be tried, so as to enable him to exercisehis discretion to grant leave, before he goes on to consider the exercise of that discretion, with particular reference to the issueof <em>forum conveniens</em>."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Order 11 rule 1(1)(c) traditionally has been set somewhat apart from the other categories within Order 11, possibly because therewas a tendency for its provisions to be creatively utilised in order to establish jurisdiction when difficulties were encounteredin fitting a particular case within the more "substantive" sub-heads of rule 1(1). A substantial proportion of the earlier case lawin this area dealt with the situation wherein it was the party sought to be joined who was the real focus of the Plaintiff's claim,and to guard against the use of an existing Defendant as a sort of jurisdictional Trojan Horse, so to speak, the cases establisheda "ring fence" of protective principle. There has arisen, therefore, a certain amount of commentary and judicial authority upon theprecise ambit of the term "necessary or proper party" - see, for example <em>Dicey &amp; Morris, The Conflict of Laws, 1st Ed., Vol.1 at p.324 et.seq.</em> and the cases cited therein; see also Supreme Court Practice 1991 at M/N 11/1/12 (p.89).</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Some of these cases are considered later in this judgment. At the end of the day, however, the ultimate issue for consideration,in the words of Order 11 rule 4(2), must be whether it appears to the Court that the case is "a proper one" for service out of thejurisdiction.</p>    <p class="heading">RIVAL CONTENTIONS</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The present case is notable in that the party in direct contractual relationship with the Plaintiff for the carriage of these cratesof medical equipment from Beijing to Shanghai is the 1st Defendant, with regard to which, of course, no jurisdictional difficultyexists; the 1st Defendant is a local Hong Kong company which has been served and over which jurisdiction has been established asof right. So that there is no question of the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant being, in effect, an artificial player impleaded to facilitate the assumption of jurisdiction; to the contrary, the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant, as contractual carrier, is the Plaintiff's main target, a point which was stressed by Mr Jat Sew Tong for the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant; in his fetching phrase, the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant was simply "icing on the cake" as far as the Plaintiff was concerned.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Mr Jat's primary submission was that, in the circumstances of this case, the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant should not be considered a "necessary or proper" party, so that the Plaintiff fell at the first jurisdictional fence, soto speak. He put his case thus. It was the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant, the freight forwarder, against whom there was unquestionably a valid claim. It followed that the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant was under a clear duty, whether such was in contract, tort or bailment, to take all reasonable care of the equipment duringthe entire carriage, and to deliver it undamaged to the Plaintiff; <em>ergo</em>, this was not a case of mutually exclusive claims against the two Defendants, and accordingly there was no <em>necessity</em> for the Plaintiff to mount a claim against the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Nor was the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant a <em>proper</em> party because the Plaintiff had not shown that it had a valid claim against the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant. Even on the assumption that the machine was in good order and condition when it was received by the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant (and the airway bill would have indicated only its <em>apparent</em> condition) there was no evidence that it was <em>not</em> re-delivered in like good order and condition to the agents of the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant, who themselves had completed the land portion of the journey to the Shanghai exhibition hall; put another way, since theonly evidence before the Court was that the machine was found damaged <em>after</em> re-delivery by the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant to the Plaintiff at the Shanghai Exhibition Center, there was no evidence whatever that the machine was damaged in thecustody of the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant, the latter being, of course, one only of the two carriers involved. It followed from this that the Plaintiff had not shownvalid claims against the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant in tort and bailment, whilst the purported claim in contract was a non-starter (as Mr Smith effectively accepted) and theclaim for failure to insure was even weaker (both latter points not having been raised in the affidavit seeking leave). And, to capit off, the Plaintiff's claim against the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant was time-barred under PRC law, if such was the applicable law.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The like arguments were adopted to underpin the assertion that there was no serious issue to be tried on the merits. And in any event,said Mr Jat, Hong Kong patently was <em>not</em> the <em>forum conveniens</em>. In this regard he submitted that the entire incident had occurred in the PRC, the relevant personnel involved in the carriage werein the PRC (the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant's local Chinese agents having dealt with the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant), and it was plainly more appropriate for substantive legal disputes governed by PRC law (for example as to the cause ofaction and limitation issues) to be resolved by the PRC Courts themselves.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Mr Smith, who appeared for the Plaintiff, adopted a broader and forensically attractive approach. His basic premise was that the2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant is a "necessary or proper party" to the action against the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant because the liability of each Defendant depended upon one investigation (see White Book MN 11/1/12, quoting <em><strong>Massey v. Heynes</strong></em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1881%5d%2021%20QBD%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1881] 21 QBD 330 (C.A.)</a>, and that in this action the common investigation against both Defendants concerned the cause of the damage to the Plaintiff's goods,the extent of that damage, and the loss arising therefrom. Jurisdiction was therefore satisfied, in his submission. If this was thecase, there were plainly serious issues to be tried, given that the equipment had patently been damaged during carriage, so thatthe case then came down to the exercise of the <em>forum conveniens</em> discretion; and in this regard, the Courts had consistently deprecated the bringing of parallel proceedings in two different jurisdictionsfor the eminently good reason of the consequent risk of inconsistent results and increased costs. Indeed the continuation of relatedproceedings in a given forum had often been held to be an overriding factor in stay applications, and similar principles appliedunder Order 11, said Mr Smith. He further suggested that where one Defendant is a necessary or proper party to an action where atleast one other Defendant is being sued here, then inevitably there would need to be some very strong reason for discharging serviceof the writ upon the foreign defendant; and no such strong reason existed in this case.</p>    <p class="heading">PRINCIPLES APPLIED</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Such, therefore, was the outline of the respective arguments, and I turn now to examine the constituent elements of the debate.</p>    <p class="heading">(a) Jurisdiction : Good Arguable Case</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Plainly, who is or is not to be regarded as a "necessary or proper" party within the meaning of Order 11 rule 1(1)(c) is not simplya matter of discretion, but requires a primary determination by the Court upon the facts of the particular case; the term is notone of infinite elasticity, however, and guidance in principle exists.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> In terms of the "proper" element of the rubric, I drew counsel's attention to the case of <em><strong>Qatar Petroleum Producing Authority &amp; another v. Shell Internationale Petroleum Maatschappij B.V. &amp; anr.</strong></em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%2035" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 Lloyds LR 35 (C.A.)</a>, a decision of Lord Justices Ackner and Dillon on appeal from a decision of Mustill J. (as he then was). The facts are complex, andfor present purposes do not, I think, require rehearsing, particularly since the ultimate decision in that case was substantiallyaffected by the existence of parallel arbitration proceedings. What is of considerable assistance, however, is the following extractfrom the judgment of Ackner L.J. (<em>op.cit.</em>, at p.41, bearing in mind that the previous nomenclature of Order 11 rule 1(1)(c) was 1(1)(j)) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" It is of course well settled that we must approach the exercise of our jurisdiction under R.S.C., O.11, particularly in relationto r.1(1)(<em>j</em>) with caution (see <em>The Brabo</em>, (1948) 82 Ll.L.Rep. 251;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%20AC%20329" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] A.C. 329</a> at pp.258 and 338). Moreover, the case must fall within the spirit as well as the letter of the Order (<em>Johnson v. Taylor Bros. &amp; Co.</em>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1920%5d%20AC%20144" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1920] A.C. 144</a> at p.153). It is well accepted that the question whether a person out of the jurisdiction is a 'proper party' to an action againsta person who has been served within the jurisdiction must depend upon whether, supposing both parties had been within the jurisdiction,they would have been proper parties to the action <em>(see Massey v. Heynes,</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281888%29%2021%20QB%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1888) 21 Q.B. 330</a> at p.338 per Lord Esher, M.R.). R.S.C., O.15, r.4, so far as is material to the question we have to decide, provides that two ormore persons may be joined together in one action where if separate actions were brought by or against each of them, as the casemay be, some common question of law or fact would arise in all the actions."

Where a number of underwriters are sued in relation to loss arising from the same casualtyeach is plainly a proper party to an action instituted against another.

The 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant was a U.S. company who had designed the furnace, and the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant had been responsible for its installation. The Plaintiff had duly served the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant within the jurisdiction, and had obtained leave to serve out of the jurisdiction on the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant under Order 11 rule 1(1)(j) (the equivalent at that time of the current Order 11 rule 1(1)(c)).</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Argument in <em><strong>Selas</strong></em> provided echoes of Mr Jat's approach in the present case, it being submitted before the Court of Appeal that, <em>inter alia</em>, it was not <em>necessary</em> to join the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant in order for justice to be done to the plaintiff, nor that any real advantage would be conferred upon the Plaintiff byso doing. This argument was shot down in terms, Slade L.J. observing as follows (<em>op.cit.</em>, at p.32) :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" I respectfully agree with Pearson J., and fully accept, that the court should be very careful before it allows a writ to be servedout of the jurisdiction, and that in exercising its discretion it is a relevant factor whether it is necessary for the jurisdictionto be invoked. However, I cannot, and do not, derive the principle from this passage that leave must never be given under Order 11unless it is strictly necessary. The very wording of paragraph (<em>j</em>), which I quoted earlier in this judgment, though that paragraph is not directly relevant in the case before us, belies this proposition.The disjunctive word 'or' in that paragraph shows that in an appropriate case leave may be given for the service of a writ out ofthe jurisdiction in a case where a person out of the jurisdiction is a proper party to an action properly brought against a personduly served within the jurisdiction, even if he is not a necessary party. The necessity or otherwise of the joinder is, in my judgment,only one relevant factor for the court to consider.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">...</p>        <p class="quote">I would accede to Mr. Gratwick's argument on the point of principle to this limited extent. It does seem to me that if the court takesthe view that service out of the jurisdiction in a particular case is likely in practice to achieve no potential advantage whateverfor the plaintiff, this would ordinarily not be a proper case for service out of the jurisdiction within the meaning of Order 11,rule 4(2).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">...</p>        <p class="quote">However, it seems to me that if a plaintiff has a good cause of action for damages against two defendants, one in this country andone out of the jurisdiction, it must, at least ordinarily, be of potential advantage to him to obtain a judgment in this countryagainst the foreign defendant as well as against the defendant in the United Kingdom, because this will enable him to choose againstwhich of the defendants he will seek to enforce his judgment. This right of choice may well be valuable to him, for a number of quitedifferent reasons. The respective financial situations of the two defendants may be one reason, but there may be several other goodreasons. For example, it may be practically easier to enforce the judgment against one defendant than against the other. Alternativelyhe may prefer, for good commercial reasons, to enforce his judgment against one defendant rather than against the other." (emphasisadded)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> On the basis of the foregoing statements of principle, which I accept, I do not consider that Mr Jat's submission in terms of theprimary jurisdictional issue is well-founded. To the contrary, upon the (crucial) assumption that sufficient evidence exists to underpinthe action, in my view a good arguable case is made out that the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant is a "necessary or proper party" within the terms of Order 11 rule 1(1)(c). Had the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant been available for service within the jurisdiction, plainly (on the basis of sufficient evidence) it would have been "proper"to join the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant as a party to this action, whilst in terms of "necessary" joinder Mr Smith has made the point that it is in any event anadvantage to the Plaintiff to be able to enforce any judgment against the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant; although he does not suggest that the 1st Defendant is not good for any judgment, he points out that the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant's terms and conditions of carriage are subject to an express package limitation, and the Plaintiff should therefore bepermitted alternatively to attempt to obtain, and thereafter enforce, judgment in the full amount against the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> The interesting issue which arises in this particular case is whether the obvious paucity of evidence against the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant (of which Mr Jat naturally has made much) is a jurisdiction or a merits issue within the Order 11 analysis. The point wasnot, I think, developed in argument, and I have been unable to identify any authority directly on the point. Nor perhaps does referenceto other substantive sub-heads of Order 11 rule 1(1) particularly assist. Take, for example, rule 1(1)(d)(i). In <em><strong>Seaconsar,</strong></em> <em>op.cit.</em>, (at p.454A-455B) Lord Goff made it clear that satisfaction of the jurisdictional requirement depended not upon mere <em>assumption</em> as to the existence of a contract, but upon establishing that there was in fact such a contract made within the jurisdiction; compliancewith this head, therefore, necessarily involved an examination of the merits at the primary jurisdictional stage. By parity of reasoningin the present case, it could possibly be argued that, in considering Order 11 rule 1(1)(c), consideration of the merits should be"hoisted" into the jurisdictional analysis, so to speak, so that if clearly there is no evidence underpinning the claim itself then,<em>ex hypothesi</em>, it is not "proper" to join the foreigner as a party to the existing action.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Such is not, I think, mere arid discussion; the differing burdens upon the Plaintiff dependent upon whether "jurisdiction" or "merits"is in issue seem to me to render this of significance. However, whilst instinctively I should like to hold that this is a mattergoing to jurisdiction, in terms of basic principle I think that (probably) it is not. It seems to me that the fundamental rationaleof the "proper party" element within Order 11 rule 1(1)(c) is to facilitate the trial of a common question of law or fact, and ifthis be the correct basis for the jurisdictional requirement under rule 1(1)(c), this requirement must be satisfied in the presentcase; looked at in these terms, the commonality of the issues in these proceedings arising from the carriage of this equipment fromBeijing to Shanghai depends not upon analysis of the strength of the specific case against one of the undisputed carriers.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Accordingly, contrary to Mr Jat's contentions, I hold that a good arguable case has been made out that the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant is a "necessary or proper" party to this action, although perhaps ultimately it does not greatly matter whether jurisdictionalcompliance is established either as "necessary" <strong>or</strong> "proper"; the requirements under Order 11 rule 1(1)(c) are disjunctive, as Slade L.J. pointed out in <strong>Selas,</strong> <em>op.cit.</em>, and I have accepted the arguments advanced by Mr Smith as to the potential advantage accruing to the Plaintiff from the joinderof the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant, and hence satisfaction of the "necessary" element within the rule.</p>    <p class="heading">(b) Serious issue to be tried</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The jurisdictional basis under rule 1(1)(c) having been established, the focus of the argument moves into the discretionary arenaand to a consideration of whether there is a serious issue to be tried in the Plaintiff's case against the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In applications of this type the courts have always been concerned about the strength of the case against a foreign party soughtto be impleaded pursuant to the provisions of Order 11. Lord Justice Mustill (as he then was) succinctly expressed the position thusin <strong>The</strong><strong>Eras Eil Actions</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20570" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 Lloyds LR 570</a>, at 588 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... This is not to say that there is no minimum level of conviction about the soundness of the claim. This would not be consistentwith the authorities, nor would it be right. If the claim is too weak, it would be wrong to put the foreigner to the trouble andexpense of coming to England to answer it. ..." (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> And as Lord Goff noted in<em><strong>Seaconsar,</strong></em> <em>op.cit.</em>, at 452B-E :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... if in support of the plaintiff's ex parte application an affidavit is sworn in proper form deposing to facts which, if proved,provide a sufficient foundation for the alleged cause of action, that should generally be enough for present purposes. This is nodoubt what a number of judges have referred to when they have used the expression 'prima facie case' in this context. The problemarises from the fact that the court will consider, on an application to set aside leave so given, affidavit evidence on the partof the defendant, and will take such evidence into account when deciding whether or not to exercise its discretion in favour of theplaintiff. But the court cannot resolve disputed questions of fact on affidavit evidence; and it is consistent with the statementof the law by Lord Davey that if, at the end of the day, there remains a substantial question of fact or law or both, arising onthe facts disclosed by the affidavits, which the plaintiff bona fide desires to try, the court should, as a rule, allow the serviceof the writ. If this approach is correct, the standard of proof in respect of the cause of action can broadly be stated to be whether,on the affidavit evidence before the court, there is a serious question to be tried." (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>And, further, at 456G :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" Once it is recognised that, so far as the merits of the plaintiff's claim are concerned, no more is required than that the evidenceshould disclose that there is a serious issue to be tried, it is difficult to see how this matter, although it falls within the ambitof the court's discretion, has not in practice to be established in any event. This is because it is very difficult to conceive howa judge could, in the proper exercise of his discretion, give leave where there was no serious issue to be tried." (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The question, therefore, is whether in this case the affidavits before the Court disclose a case against the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant which merits consideration at trial.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> In terms of the Plaintiff's evidential shortfall, Mr Jat drew my attention to the content of Mr Barber's affidavits in support ofthe application, in particular in so far as such evidence purported to support a substantive cause of action against the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant. The totality of the evidence used to implead the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant, said Mr Jat, was effectively contained in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the first affidavit of Mr Barber, which for convenienceI reproduce hereunder :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"7. The equipment was in good condition when delivered by the Plaintiffs or their servants or agents to the First Defendants and appearsto have been in good condition when delivered by the First Defendants to the Second Defendants as evidenced by the clean Air Waybill.</p>        <p class="quote">8. Some time between the date of delivery of the cargo to the Second Defendants or their servants or agents in Beijing and the re-deliveryof the cargo by the First Defendants to the Plaintiffs or their servants or agents in Shanghai, severe damage was caused to the equipment.The Plaintiffs instructed the Shanghai Import and Export Commodity Inspection Bureau of the People's Republic of China to inspectthe cargo and the inspection was carried out on 28<sup><kbd>th</kbd></sup> September 1994. On 29<sup><kbd>th</kbd></sup> September 1994 an inspection certificate was prepared."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Little, if anything, was added by paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of Mr Barber's third affidavit, said Mr Jat, which was the only other relevantmaterial before the Court going to the merits of the case.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> I agree that the evidential cupboard is pretty bare. As "thin" cases go, this is perhaps as good an example as any; indeed, the lesscharitable might say that as the 'evidence' currently stands, the Plaintiff's chances of getting home against the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant look distinctly remote.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Mr Smith's response to this line of argument is to say, in terms, that since the equipment was crated up his client "cannot knowwhen the loss occurred", and that it "may not be the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant's fault" although it is "equally possible that the loss did occur by some negligence on their part". The 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant's negligence during the air carriage leg of the trip was therefore "one of a number of possible causes" and that it was"not fanciful" to suggest that it could well have been the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant who permitted damage to the cargo. An inquiry was clearly necessary as to the cause of this damage, and precisely the sameinvestigation were required to take place in China as would be required here. Essentially, therefore, the case was put thus : thecrated goods clearly had had a bad bump, there was as good a chance as any that this had happened on the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant's "watch", so to speak, and discovery may shed some light upon the situation.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> Is this enough for Order 11 purposes? In my judgment it is not. Service out of the jurisdiction is to be regarded as an exceptionaljurisdiction, and the wide-ranging and authoritative case law that has developed over the last quarter of a century in particularhas reflected this fact. Against this backdrop, I do not think it is sufficient successfully to implead a foreign carrier and tosubject that carrier to the process of our Courts on the basis solely of undisputed participation in the combined carriage. In myview it is not good enough to say, as Mr Smith now does, that it is "as likely as not" to have been the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant's responsibility simply by reason of the overall factual matrix. The 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant was <em><strong>not</strong></em> the sole carrier; had it been so the position may (possibly) have been different. As I understand the facts, the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant's agents were involved at <em>both</em> the Beijing and at the Shanghai ends of the journey for the non-air carriage parts of the overall trip, and even taking into accountthe lesser burden of a "serious issue to be tried", 'evidence' such as this does not in my view suffice to enable the Plaintiff toget its foot in the door, and to persuade the Court to exercise its jurisdiction over a foreigner otherwise not susceptible to ourjudicial process.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In this connection I have further borne in mind what this application is <em>not</em>. It is not an application by the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant to serve a third party notice out of the jurisdiction on the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant : see Order 16 rule 3(4), and White Book MN 16/1/22. Indeed, in this application I have heard nothing from or on behalfof the 1st Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> It seems to me to be axiomatic that a plainly weak case on the merits must be a key consideration in the evaluation by the Courtin arriving at its conclusion as to whether the case is "a proper one" for the exercise of its discretion within the terms of Order11 rule 4(2); in considering a similar type of argument, Slade L.J. put the matter thus in <em><strong>Selas,</strong></em> <em>op.cit.</em> at p.30 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... the principal points of alleged inadequacy in the evidence really go more to the question whether, on the evidence, the plaintiffshave established an arguable case for infringement on the merits. This, I accept, was an important point for Whitford J. to consider,because the establishment of an arguable case on the evidence must be one of the necessary requirements of Order 11, rule 4(2), whichprecludes the court from granting leave unless it is satisfied that 'the case is a proper one for service out of the jurisdictionunder this Order'.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">There appears to be no doubt that it was strenuously argued before the learned judge that, apart from the alleged non-disclosure ofmaterial facts, even on the evidence submitted to him no good arguable case had been shown. If the evidence before him had consistedsolely of the rather sparse evidence contained in Mr. Harriss's first affidavit, for my part I would have seen some force in thesubmission." (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Nor does the fact that there is within the jurisdiction an existing action relevant to the loss necessarily assist in the meritscontext; as Lord Goff observed in <strong>Seaconsar;</strong> <em>op.cit.</em>, at 456 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" I wish also to refer to the view expressed by Stuart-Smith L.J. in the Court of Appeal that it was relevant to take into accountthe fact that proceedings in respect of the first presentation would in any event take place in England, and that this factor providedan additional and cogent reason why the court should exercise its discretion in favour of Seaconsar in relation to the second presentation... However, if the plaintiff's case is not sufficiently strong on the merits, I cannot see that that weakness can be compensatedfor by the fact that other related proceedings are to proceed within the English jurisdiction. That is a matter which may be relevantto the question whether England is the forum conveniens for the proceedings in question. ..." (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> At the end of the day, therefore, and given the present state of the evidence, I do not consider that the Plaintiff has surmountedthe burden of showing that there is a serious issue to be tried on the merits in its case against the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant. Participation in the carriage apart, there does not appear to be a scintilla of evidence that the damage in question isto be placed at the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant's door. Accordingly, in the exercise of my discretion upon an Order 11 application, I am disinclined to uphold the <em>ex parte</em> Order permitting service out of the jurisdiction solely upon the basis of adverse inference arising from the factum of carriage,given that the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant was not the sole carrier. In this regard, therefore, the Plaintiff has not been able to get its case off the ground.</p>    <p class="heading">(c) Forum Conveniens</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> I turn, finally, to consider the issue of <em>forum conveniens</em>, the third element in the Order 11 analysis, and I bear in mind here Lord Goff's comments upon the separate nature of this consideration(<em><strong>Seaconsar,</strong></em> <em>op.cit.</em> at 456C) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... I cannot see that a case particularly strong on the merits can compensate for a weak case on forum conveniens. Likewise, in myopinion, a very strong connection with the English forum cannot justify a weak case on the merits, if a stronger case on the meritswould otherwise be required. In truth, as I see it, the two elements are separate and distinct. ..." (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Unlike the situation in <strong>Seaconsar</strong>, <em>op.cit.</em>, where there was no issue upon the point, on the facts of this case Hong Kong as the <em>forum conveniens</em> is very much in issue. Mr Jat's recital of the relevant connecting factors is met by Mr Smith's inviting submission that the courtsare wary of permitting parallel proceedings in separate jurisdictions. This case is necessarily "anchored" in Hong Kong against the1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant, says Mr Smith, not only because it is a Hong Kong company but also because the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant's terms of carriage contain a binding exclusive jurisdiction clause. <em>Ergo</em>, the entire matter should be dealt with here.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> There is no doubt that the burden upon a Plaintiff seeking Order 11 relief is to show that Hong Kong is clearly the appropriate forum,although in considering this element the significance of the different Order 11 grounds will vary from case to case : see the judgmentof Bingham L.J. (as he then was) in <em><strong>Du Pont v. Agnew</strong></em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20585" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 2 Lloyds LR 585</a> at 588 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" Where the exercise of jurisdiction by the English Court is resisted not by a party duly served within the jurisdiction but by aparty served pursuant to O.11, r.1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court, the Court's task is essentially the same : to identify theforum in which the case can be suitably tried for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice. But in this casethe burden is on the plaintiff to persuade the Court to exercise its discretionary power to permit service on the defendants outsidethe jurisdiction.

I have noted earlier in this judgment the observationsof the English Court of Appeal in <em><strong>The "Goldean Mariner"</strong></em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 Lloyds LR 215 (C.A.)</a>, a case in which the Court was considering an appeal from the judgment of Mr Justice Phillips, wherein the learned judge had grantedleave to serve out of the jurisdiction against a number of foreign underwriters in a hotly contested marine insurance action. MrJustice Phillips had laid great stress upon the necessity of determining the litigation against all concerned (there were in thatcase a total of some 18 defendants) in a single hearing binding upon all those involved, and he had noted that the justice of thecase demonstrably required that all parties to be brought before a single tribunal. Although not dissenting from the exercise ofthe judge's discretion in this regard, Lord Justice Lloyd nevertheless observed as follows, <em>op.cit.</em> at p.222 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" I agree with Mr. Tomlinson that caution must always be exercised in bringing foreign defendants within our jurisdiction under O.11,r.1(1)(c). It must never become the practice to bring foreign defendants here as a matter of course, on the ground that the onlyalternative requires more than one suit in more than one different jurisdiction. But I see no reason to suppose that the Judge didnot have this important consideration well in mind when he exercised his discretion in the present case. As with the renewal of thewrit, I can see no ground for us interfering with the discretion which he exercised."

Accordingly, the Order of Waung J. must be discharged and the service upon the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant set aside, and I make an Order in terms of paragraph 1 of the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant's summons dated 8<sup><kbd>th</kbd></sup> August.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> In light of the conclusion I have reached in this case, there can I think be little dispute but that the costs of this action, includingthe costs of and occasioned by this application, must be to the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant, to be taxed if not agreed, and I make also an Order <em>nisi</em> in these terms.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">(William Stone)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Clifford Smith, inst'd by M/s Richards Butler, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr Jat Sew Tong, inst'd by M/s Herbert Smith, for the 2<sup><kbd>nd</kbd></sup> Defendant</p>        <p>No appearance by the 1<sup><kbd>st</kbd></sup> Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/1997/509.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
