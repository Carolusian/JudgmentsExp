Ltd. (WMI) was the principal shipping arm of a group of companies controlled by Wheelock Marden &amp;Co. Ltd. (WM).  WM were general managers of WMI and conducted its business through the fifth defendant (Mr. Brothers) under the supervisionof WMâs two managing directors, the third defendant (Mr. Lees) and the sixth defendant (Mr. Leung).  All three were directors ofboth companies.</p>    <p>In 1979, WMI embarked on a plan to modernise its fleet.  Through various one-ship-owning subsidiaries, it contracted to buy 21 newvessels, although some were disposed of before delivery.  7 vessels, all Panamax type, were ordered from the Burmeister &amp; Wainyard in Denmark.  Loans for these 7 vessels were provided by th Danish Ship Credit Fund or its subsidiary, the plaintiff (ADS). The financing arrangements were complex.  WMI borrowed US$ from commercial banks.  These funds were placed on deposit in Danish kronerwith Danish banks at interest rates of 17-18%.  The interest rate payable on the loans, however, was only 8%, this cheap financebeing available under a Danish scheme to aid Danish shipbuilding.  The Danish Central Bank would buy bonds issued by ADS at par andabsorb the loss.  The interest differential enabled WMI to acquire the vessels for a sum significantly less than their contract price</p>    <p>The kroner deposits formed security for the commercial banks pending delivery of the vessels.  On delivery, there was to be a swap- the banks would take a first mortgage as their principal security, to be serviced out the vesselsâ earnings; ADS would get thedeposits as its security.  The deposits were so structured that they would pay off each instalment of ADSâ loans as it fell due. WMI provided its guarantee for any shortfall that might occur on default by any of its ship-owning subsidiaries.</p>    <p>In 1982 the shipping market, which had until then been at record levels, dropped.  Panamax vessels, which had been earning US$14000per day, were reduced to as little as $3-4000.  Values fell commensurately.  Available earnings were hardly sufficient to pay operatingcosts, let alone debt.  WMIâs directors realised its plight and began formulating plans to solve its problems.  Then, in November1982, there was a meeting of senior directors of WM.  Following that meeting, WMI began trying to reduce its cash drain - principallyby the sale of vessels, the cancellation of newbuildings, and the restructuring of existing debt.</p>    <p>It was an issue as to whether what took place at that meeting constituted some form of commitment by WM to support WMI.</p>    <p>By the beginning of 1983 WMI was commercially insolvent, being unable to pay its debts as they fell due, and reliant on third partysupport, support which could only realistically come from WM.  The principal issue in the case was whether the defendants honestlybelieved that that support would be forthcoming.</p>    <p>Mr Brothers was primarily responsible for implementing WMIâs plans.  In February 1983, Mr. Brothers approached ADS for help in relationto the 3 vessels still pending delivery.  After negotiation, ADS agreed to defer repayment of the first 6 instalmentsof the loanon the next vessel, Sealock.  The equivalent parts of the deposits were released to the commercial bank so that its loan was reducedto an amount commensurate with the then value of the vessel.  Without that reduction, the bank would not have agreed to the swapbecause of the drastic drop in charter hire.  The deferred instalments were to be paid in one balloon payment at the end of the 81/2 year period of the ADS loan.</p>    <p>Sealock was delivered in April 1983.  At the end of the year, agreement was reached in relation to the other 2 vessels.  There wasto be a similar arrangement for the next, Annalock, which was delivered in March 1984.  The final vessel was sold back to the yardfor $1 and resold to another buyer.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, WMI had some success in preserving its future.  A number of older vessels were sold.  Mr. Brothers negotiated a reductionin the price of 4 vessels being built in Spain that was commensurate with the current value.  These 4 vessels and another were thensold to Iran as part of a package deal in exchange for oil which was in turn sold to Shell.  A modest loss was incurred on the salebut the debt burden was much reduced.  What Mr. Brothers did not obtain, however, was a 3 year moratorium from WMIâs bankers whichWMIâs financial advisers considered essential.  The banks required support from WM but, after much hesitation, in September 1983WM provided only a US$4m. facility.  That was some way short of the $12m. thought to be necessary at that stage to obtain the cooperationof the banks.  Further, that support was secured on shares owned by WMI in a joint venture.</p>    <p>Mr. Brothers also failed to refinance before delivery of Annalock 2 older vessels which would have provided much-needed cash.  Finally,another joint venture in which WMI was involved, Pacnorse, also got into cash difficulties because of the shipping market.  At thebeginning of 1984, it began to make calls on WMI in respect of a shareholderâs loan, calls for which WMI had not budgeted.</p>    <p>Throughout, WMI was living a hand-to-mouth existence, relying heavily on the $4m. facility which it had not really expected to useto any great extent.  Also throughout, the directors had been receiving legal and financial advice.  That advice was, among otherthings, that WMI could continue to trade as long as the directors remained confident that WMI would be able to pay its debts in thefuture.</p>    <p>In March 1985, WM was taken over by Wharf which refused any further support for WMI.  A firm of accountants formulated a restructuringplan which achieved a measure of acceptance among creditors.  2 creditors, however, one being ADS, would not agree to the plan. On 29th July, ADS defaulted the 2 loans for Dkr225m. and 210m.  WMI was placed in voluntary liquidation on 2nd August 1985.  A smalldividend was subsequently paid.  ADS was dissatisfied with the dividend and with the way in which it felt it had been treated byWMI and its directors.  With the consent of the liquidators, ADS commenced these proceedings in 1988 against WMIâs directors. It claimed a total of Dkr436,702,059.35.</p>    <p>ADS had 2 principal claims.  First, it alleged that by the time of delivery of Sealock and at all material times thereafter WMI wasdoomed to failure and should have been put in liquidation.  By failing to do this,  the defendants as directors of WMI had carriedon or had been parties to the carrying on of WMIâs business in fraud on its creditors or for other fraudulent purposes.  The directorswere therefore liable for WMIâs debts under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s275.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.275</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>.  ADS claimed that WM was a de facto alternatively a shadow director of WMI.</p>    <p>Second, ADS alleged that it had entered into the revised loan arrangements as a result of fraudulent or negligent misrepresentationsmade by WM and Mr. Brothers.  The misrepresentations were in essence that ADS had been encouraged to believe that WM would standbehind WMI; that a cashflow for newbuildings and unsecured creditors prepared in March 1983, which projected a deficit by 1991 ofsome US$60m., was witheld; and that WMIâs true financial position was not revealed to ADS.</p>    <p> The defendants denied they had carried on WMIâs business fraudulently.  They also asserted that, even if otherwise found liable,the court did not have power under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s275.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.275</a> to make an order against them in favour of ADS.  WM and Mr. Brothers denied making the misrepresentations alleged.  They claimedthat, even if the misrepresentations were made, they had no effect on ADS which passed responsibility for a decision about the revisedarrangements to the Danish Export Credit Council (EKR) which had countered-guaranteed the loans.</p>    <p>Finally, the defendants allegd that the loans as revised were illegal under European Community law, the law of the contract beingEnglish law, and unenforceable.  The thrust of this allegation was that the loans constituted both an export credit and state aidto the shipyard.  The revised terms took the loans outside of the terms permitted by the Community.  The defendants asserted thatthe new terms should have been notified to the European Commission for consideration and, in the case of the aid, for approval. Because this was not done, the loans became illegal.</p>    <p>After a trial lasting 158 days, the court held:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1.  In a case involving allegations of fraud of such gravity, the standard of proof required is indistinguishable from that in criminalproceedings.</p>        <p>2.  ADS failed to establish to that standard that the defendants had no honest belief that WM would ultimately support WMI, notwithstandingthe finding that at the meeting in November 1982 there was no commitment by WM or anyone to support WMI, only approval of the strategyfor stopping the cash drain.  The claim for fraudulent trading, including the alternative claim that the defendants had fraudulentpurposes other than defrauding creditors, was dismissed.</p>        <p>4.  If necessary, an order would have been made in favour of ADS under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s275.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.275</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>.</p>        <p>5.  On the facts, WM was a de facto director of WMI; alternatively, because the line is so fine, a shadow director.</p>        <p>6.  WM and Mr. Brothers dishonestly witheld the newbuildings cashflow and failed to provide ADS with a true picture of WMIâs financialposition.  In this they were fraudulent.</p>        <p>7.  ADS made its own decisions, relying on the misrepresentations, to revise the terms of the loans.</p>        <p>8.  The proper loss was the shortfall between the deposits when realised and the outstanding loans, an amount made good by EKR.</p>        <p>9.  European Community law does not declare whole contracts illegal, only those parts which infringe.  It is then for the nationalcourt to determine whether or not what remains constitutes a whole agreement of the type contemplated by the parties.  In the presentcase, the illegal parts of the revised loan arrangements were the deferred balloon payments.  They could be excised, leaving enforceableagreements.</p>        <p>10. There was judgment for ADS against WM and Mr. Brothers for Dkr188,970,200. and interest at 13%.</p>    </blockquote>     <p align="center">(Actions consolidated pursuant to the Order of Mr. Justice Jones<br />    dated the 28th June 1991.

Ltd., the 1st Defendant (WM), was (and still is) a well-known public company.  It hada wide area of activity, in particular, real property and shipping.  Its shipping activities it conducted primarily through WheelockMaritime International Ltd (WMI) a subsidiary in which it had a controlling interest.</p>    <p><a name="p1.1.2" class="para" id="p1.1.2">1.1.2</a> WMI was also a Hong Kong public company.  It traded through a number of wholly-owned one-ship owning companies which were registeredin countries such as Liberia.  The vessels owned by these companies were on long bare-boat charters which were coming to an end. The shipping market was buoyant.  A decision was made to modernise the fleet.  Between 1979 and 1981 WMI, through its subsidiaries,contracted to buy 22 new vessels, all bulk carriers.</p>    <p><a name="p1.1.3" class="para" id="p1.1.3">1.1.3</a> The shipping market peaked in 1981 when charter hire for Panamax type bulk carriers, of which 12 were ordered, was in the regionof US$14,000.00 per day.  Unfortunately, the usual laws of nature then asserted themselves.  The shipping tide which had risen toalmost unprecedented heights receded to a commensurately low level, leaving WMI holed by a reef of considerable debt.  Because, asthe tide of charter rates and vessel values dropped, WMI was left with expensive newbuildings, the hire rates for which when deliveredwould barely cover operating expenses, let alone payments of principal and interest on the loans taken to acquire the vessels.</p>    <p><a name="p1.1.4" class="para" id="p1.1.4">1.1.4</a> Considerable effort was made to keep WMI afloat.  Eventually it sank, overburdened by the debt, in 1985.  A dividend of 16 centswas paid.</p>    <p><a name="p1.1.5" class="para" id="p1.1.5">1.1.5</a> In support of its subsidiaries, WMI had given guarantees to various creditors who had provided funds for the purchase of the newbuildings. Amongst these creditors was the Plaintiff (ADS) which provided funds for vessels purchased from Burmeister and Wain (BW) of Denmark. Two vessels, hulls 910 Sealock, and 911 Annalock, were delivered to two WMI subsidiaries upon the security, inter alia, of guaranteesgiven by WMI.</p>    <p><a name="p1.1.6" class="para" id="p1.1.6">1.1.6</a> The Sealock and Annalock loans were defaulted on 29th July 1985 for Dkr225,726,063 and 210,557,401 respectively. WMI went into liquidationon 2nd August 1985.  ADS was unhappy with the dividend received and also with the way in which it had been treated by WMI and itsdirectors.  With the consent of the joint liquidators, ADS now claims against the Defendants on the ground of fraudulent tradingunder <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s275.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 275</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>; and against WM and the 5th Defendant (Mr. Brothers) for misrepresentation.  In essence, the issue is whether or not the Defendantswere dishonest.</p>    <p><a name="p1.1.7" class="para" id="p1.1.7">1.1.7</a> Defendants 2-11, were duly appointed directors of WMI.  Only Defendants 2-6, however, remain.  Defendants 8, 9 and 11 have died sincethe inception of these proceedings and are no longer pursued.  The 7th Defendant is too sick to give any instructions to his solicitorsand is also not pursued.  The proceedings were discontinued against the 10th Defendant (Mr. Yuen) after he had given evidence.  ADSno doubt recognised (as was my view) that, whatever his shortcomings as a director of a public company, Mr. Yuen was plainly notdishonest.  The claim against the 12th Defendant I dismissed on Day 40 after I refused an amendment to the statement of claim againsthim.  The 2nd Defendant (Mr. Marden) was too ill to participate in the trial but made a witness statement which is in evidence byway of hearsay notice.</p>    <p><a name="p1.1.8" class="para" id="p1.1.8">1.1.8</a> The claim against WM, which was not only parent but also general manager of WMI, is made on the basis that it was a shadow or defacto director.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading"><a name="1.2">1.2    THE STRUCTURE OF THE JUDGMENT</a></p>    <p><a name="p1.2.1" class="para" id="p1.2.1">1.2.1</a> ADS' principal claim is based on fraudulent trading, in that the Defendants carried on the business of WMI with intent to defraudcreditors or for some other fraudulent purpose.  The gravamen of the complaint is that at the time the loans were drawn down WMIwas insolvent, being unable to pay its debts as they fell due and dependent on WM for support which support the directors could nothonestly have believed would be forthcoming.</p>    <p><a name="p1.2.2" class="para" id="p1.2.2">1.2.2</a> The claim in misrepresentation, primarily that it was fraudulent, involves allegations in the defences of WM and Mr. Brothers thatthe misrepresentations were not made and, in any event, did not affect any decision making by ADS which had simply deferred to anotherbody, the Danish Export Credit Council (EKR), which in turn had been influenced at least in part by political considerations.</p>    <p><a name="p1.2.3" class="para" id="p1.2.3">1.2.3</a> Finally, the Defendants plead that the loans made by ADS to WMI were illegal under European Community law and unenforceable in thiscourt.  They assert this as their first line of defence because, if successful, it will not be necessary to deal with any of thesubstantive claims.  I prefer, however, to deal with the substantive claims first.</p>    <p><a name="p1.2.4" class="para" id="p1.2.4">1.2.4</a> It will be appropriate, therefore, first to introduce the principal parties and explain the financial arrangements.  Then, in orderto understand why ADS confidently asserts fraudulent trading, I will have to deal in some detail with WMIâs activities between1979 and 1985.  I shall then examine the position of each of the Defendants and dispose of fraudulent trading.</p>    <p><a name="p1.2.5" class="para" id="p1.2.5">1.2.5</a> Because of the Defendantsâ case on misrepresentation, I shall go on to consider seperately how ADS and EKR behaved at the relevanttime.  I can then deal with the question of which was the decision maker and the individual allegations of misrepresentation.</p>    <p><a name="p1.2.6" class="para" id="p1.2.6">1.2.6</a> Although European Community law was dealt with as a discrete issue, its application is more easily made and understood when the factualbackground has already been assimilated.  Apart from quantum, which I should anyway determine, I shall, as I have already indicated,deal with illegality last.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading"><b><a name="2">2.    THE PARTIES AND THEIR FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS</a></b></p>    <p class="heading"><a name="2.1">2.1    THE PLAINTIFF</a></p>    <p><a name="p2.1.1" class="para" id="p2.1.1">2.1.1</a> ADS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Danmarks Skibskreditfond (DSKF).  Together I will refer to them as the Fund.</p>    <p><a name="p2.1.2" class="para" id="p2.1.2">2.1.2</a> DSKF was established by law in Denmark in 1961 because shipbuilding was so expensive that the normal banking system could not putup the liquidity.  DSKF is a self owning independent foundation without shareholders.  It finances itself by way of bonds.  Guaranteecapital is subscribed by various national interests including banks, insurance companies, ship owners, shipyards and the Danish CentralBank. </p>    <p><a name="p2.1.3" class="para" id="p2.1.3">2.1.3</a> DSKF runs on three levels.  First, there is a board of representatives.  It consists of up to 28 members from the subscribing institutions. It meets very rarely.  No more need be said about it for the purpose of these proceedings.  Second, the board of directors whichhad, at the time, nine members, four from the bankersâ association and one each from the other interests.  It meets as necessary,usually 10 to 12 times per year.  Primarily, it makes decisions as to whether or not to grant loans.  Third, the administration,which processes applications for loans before submitting a proposal to the board for a decision.  Staff for the administration areprovided by the Danish Housing Mortgage Bank pursuant to a commendably brief written agreement between it and DSKF.  The mortgageBank pays the staff.  DSKF pays a contribution to the Mortgage Bank for this service.</p>    <p><a name="p2.1.4" class="para" id="p2.1.4">2.1.4</a> The full time staff of the administration were headed by a manager or head of department.  The manager, together with his variousassistants, would consider applications for loans, carry out any necessary investigation or negotiation, prepare all relevant documentationand finally formulate a paper containing a proposal for consideration by the board.  From 1969 until November 1980, the manager wasMr. Bent Mebus.  He was succeeded by Mr. Kristian Edelmann who held the position until 31 March 1984 and who was principally involvedwith WMI.  Unhappily Mr. Edelmann died in about 1990 so his evidence was confined to a draft witness statement introduced by wayof hearsay notice.  Mr. Edelmann was succeeded by Mr. Stig Kaare Lyngsie who had had some exposure to WMI.</p>    <p><a name="p2.1.5" class="para" id="p2.1.5">2.1.5</a> Between the administration and the board, however, stood a person described as a managing director but who is more akin to a generalmanager without any directorial responsibilities.  In Denmark, commercial institutions in practice do not allow administrative staffto sit on the board and board members may not work for the institution.  This tradition is in fact enshrined in law in relation tofinancial institutions.  The managing director of the Mortgage Bank performed the same role for DSKF.  At all material times Mr.Henning Axel Nielsen was the managing director.  He spent between 25% and 33% of his time on work for the Fund.  His principal rolewas to vet proposals which had been prepared by the administration.  He would discuss these with the manager and only allow themto go to the board for consideration once he was satisfied as to their merits.  This exercise he carried out by a consideration ofthe proposal file itself and by way of discussion with the manager.  Over time Mr. Nielsen became so familiar with the working ofthe board and in turn the managers became so familiar with Mr. Nielsen that very rarely were any significant alterations made toa draft proposal and very rarely was a proposal rejected by the board.</p>    <p><a name="p2.1.6" class="para" id="p2.1.6">2.1.6</a> Mr. Nielsen would attend board meetings and present any paper.  He would be assisted in this by the manager.  They would answer questionsand discuss any proposal during board meetings.  Mr. Nielsen therefore effectively controlled the flow of work for the board andwas uniquely placed to speak as to what matters would concern and be of significance both to the board and to the administration.</p>    <p><a name="p2.1.7" class="para" id="p2.1.7">2.1.7</a> The loans themselves were made by way of bonds issued to the owner.  Such bonds, however, were not attractive upon the Danish market. Accordingly, the Central Bank which was, of course, a subscriber to the Fund undertook to buy the bonds at par, after which it discountedthem on the commercial market and absorbed the loss.  The proceeds of sale of the bonds would be transferred to the shipyard forthe purchase of the vessel.  All these activities necessarily had to fall within the rules of the Organisation for Economic Co-operationand Development (OECD) and of the European Community of which Denmark was a member.  The element of subsidy was within those rules. Crucially, the loans had to be for periods not in excess of 8Â½ years.</p>    <p><a name="p2.1.8" class="para" id="p2.1.8">2.1.8</a> Initially, the loans to WMIâs subsidiaries complied with those rules.

In relation to foreign owners such as WMI, the Fundâs rules requiredthat any lending should be subject to a guarantee being granted by EKR or, in exceptional cases, another âcast ironâ guaranteefor the whole loan amount.  Accordingly, the Fund worked in close co-operation with EKR and would as far as necessary provide itwith all information to enable it to evaluate any risk involved.  Accordingly, upon an event of default in relation to any loan,if the collateral or any other guarantees obtained by the Fund fell short of covering the amount outstanding on the loan, the Fundcould fall back on EKR.</p>    <p><a name="p2.1.10" class="para" id="p2.1.10">2.1.10</a> ADS itself was formed for English ship owners building ships in Denmark to enable them to benefit from the double taxation agreementbetween UK and Denmark.  ADS simply borrows money from DSKF in order to provide loans to ship owners who in turn repay ADS.  ADSâboard is elected by the board of DSKF.  Loans can only be made, however, with permission of the DSKF board.  ADSâ board is thereforeessentially nominal and meets only once a year.</p>    <p><a name="p2.1.11" class="para" id="p2.1.11">2.1.11</a> ADS was therefore nothing more than a device designed to channel funds to English ship owners.  It was operated by and was to allintents and purposes DSKF.

He was theequivalent of Mr. Nielsen of the Fund.  Mr. Gideon was too ill to travel from Denmark to Hong Kong in order to give evidence.  Hegave his evidence by live video link, a procedure which I understand had not before been used in Hong Kong.  Although the examinationof Mr. Gideon proceeded rather more slowly than would normally be the case, the procedure did not inhibit an effective cross-examinationand did not pose any real problems for me in watching and assessing Mr. Gideon.</p>    <p><a name="p2.2.2" class="para" id="p2.2.2">2.2.2</a> Although in existence before 1960 as a committee of the Ministry of Trade (sometimes referred to in the documents as the Ministryof Commerce) now the Ministry of Industry, EKR was formalized in that year by statute as part of the Danish Trade Fund.  It was knownas Eksportkreditradet until 1992 when it became A/S EKR Eksportkredit.  It is an export credit guarantee institution.</p>    <p><a name="p2.2.3" class="para" id="p2.2.3">2.2.3</a> Under the statute, EKR was established to screen applications for export credit support.  It is generally self-funding out of premiumincome but any shortfall will be met by the Danish Treasury.  It consists of a council supported by a secretariat.  The Queen appointsa chairman of the council.  There are about 16 other members, appointed by the Minister, representing other Government ministriesand also private interests, such as banking, agriculture and fishing.  The council is responsible for deciding whether or not togrant guarantees.  It is autonomous.  However, in the case of exceptional risks, a reference would be made to the Minister by whoma direction in writing will be given.  At the time of the events in issue, the same procedure was adopted for loans which the councilwas being asked to guarantee, the terms of which would exceed OECD rules.  That responsibility has since been taken over by EKR.</p>    <p><a name="p2.2.4" class="para" id="p2.2.4">2.2.4</a> According to Mr. Gideon, if the Ministerâs representative expresses a strong view at a council meeting, that view would carry considerableweight.  The council would not, however, be directed by the representative.  If the council disagreed with the representativeâsview, it would refer the matter to the Minister for a written order.  EKR would be obliged to follow any written direction.</p>    <p><a name="p2.2.5" class="para" id="p2.2.5">2.2.5</a> The councilâs secretariat was a government agency which, like the administration of the Fund, dealt with applications for guarantees. A proposal would then be made to the council by the secretariatâs managing director.  To all intents and purposes, therefore,the structure and procedure of EKR was identical to that of the Fund.  Mr. Gideon dealt with the WMI problems in consultation withthe managing director.  He had close contact with Mr. Mebus, Mr. Edelmann and Mr. Lyngsie of the Fund.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading"><a name="2.3">2.3    THE WHEELOCK MARDEN GROUP (THE WM GROUP)</a></p>    <p class="heading"><u>History</u></p>    <p><a name="p2.3.1" class="para" id="p2.3.1">2.3.1</a> WM was founded and incorporated in Shanghai in 1932 by George Marden who remained with the company until his retirement in 1960. Initially, the company was concerned in shipping and insurance but, over the years, developed a wide range of business.  In 1960,Mr. Marden took over from his father and remained as chairman until WM was taken-over by Wharf in 1985.  Mr. Mardenâs particularinterests remained in shipping and insurance in which he had had a thorough training both before and after World War II.  He hadless interest in property.  Apparently, he felt it was not a wise investment after his experience in Shanghai.</p>    <p><a name="p2.3.2" class="para" id="p2.3.2">2.3.2</a> In the 1960s, Mr. John Cheung, a property developer, came on the scene.  WM floated Mr. Cheungâs company, Realty Development Corporation(RDC) in Hong Kong.  A year or so later, Mr. Cheung sold his controlling interest in RDC in exchange for a block of WM shares.  RDCthus came within the Group.  Mr. Cheung became with Mr. Marden one of the 2 major shareholders.  He joined the Board of WM althoughhe had left it by the time of these events.  Mr. Cheungâs interests of course lay in the property side of the Group.  He had veryfirm views about the business.  By hard work, he had built up a property empire for himself.  He had, in the mid 1960s, just developedtwo tall buildings on the waterfront.  Completion, however, coincided with the Cultural Revolution in China and a banking crisisin Hong Kong so that letting the buildings was causing serious problems.  Mr. Cheungâs bankers were putting pressure on him toput more money into his projects, pressure which Mr. Cheung resisted because he felt that, just as the banks were prepared to supporthim when prospects were good, they should bear with him over what was essentially a short-term problem. </p>    <p><a name="p2.3.3" class="para" id="p2.3.3">2.3.3</a> Mr. Cheung subsequently brought this attitude to bear in relation to WMIâs problems.  He took the attitude that the shipping marketwould recover in due course.  In the meantime, banks had at least some security through the various vessels and should continue tosupport WMI by not calling in their loans, but rather deferring repayment until the market improved.  He therefore opposed providingunlimited resources from the WM Group for WMI.  Given this attitude and given Mr. Cheungâs supporters on the WM Board during thecrucial time, there seems to me to be no doubt that this was a factor which significantly contributed to WMIâs failure to solveits problems. </p>    <p><a name="p2.3.4" class="para" id="p2.3.4">2.3.4</a> There also appears to have been an underlying tension between Mr. Marden and Mr. Cheung.  Mr. Cheung was believed to be acquiringB shares in WM which would give him cheap voting rights.  Mr. Marden was suspicious of Mr. Cheungâs motives.</p>    <p><a name="p2.3.5" class="para" id="p2.3.5">2.3.5</a> Meanwhile, in 1962, WM merged most of its shipping interests with Sir Y.K. Paoâs World-Wide Shipping Group (WWS, an abbreviationwhich I shall use to include World-Wide Shipping Agency) by way of a joint-venture between subsidiaries.  WWS managed most of thevessels.  This joint-venture was dissolved in about 1970.  WMâs vessels were then transferred into WMI which was the brain-childof the 3rd Defendant (Mr.Lees).  Mr. Lees was by then one of the managing directors of WM.  He proposed putting the WM Groupâsshipping into a company called Metal Industries of China Limited which had been incorporated in 1937 and whose name was changed toWMI in December 1971.  In December 1972, a new joint-venture was entered with WWS through a WMI subsidiary, Glamorgan Carriers Incorporated(Glamorgan) and a WWS subsidiary, Liberian Aurora Transports Incorporated (Aurora).  The joint-venture was called Worldwide WheelockShipping Incorporated (WWW).  Most of the WWW vessels were on long bare-boat charter to Japanese companies so that, as far as WMIand its vessels were concerned, it was little more than an owner and financier which received appropriate charter-hire.</p>    <p><a name="p2.3.6" class="para" id="p2.3.6">2.3.6</a> By the mid 1970s, it became apparent that the Japanese would not be engaging in these long-term charters.  If WMI was to continuein shipping, therefore, it would have to become operational in the sense of not only owning but also fixing and managing its vessels. Its fleet would also have to be modernized to compete in world markets.  A modernization was programmed in consultation with Mr.Marden and Mr. Cheung - a programme which they endorsed and which was followed.</p>    <p><a name="p2.3.7" class="para" id="p2.3.7">2.3.7</a> In order to deal with chartering and management matters, in the late 1970s subsidiaries called Wheelock Marine Services Ltd.

(WMC) were set up.</p>    <p><a name="p2.3.8" class="para" id="p2.3.8">2.3.8</a> Apart from WMI, WM also conducted some shipping activity through another subsidiary, Allied, and its subsidiary, Beauforte.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Management Structure</u></p>    <p><a name="p2.3.9" class="para" id="p2.3.9">2.3.9</a> From about 1972, a management committee used to discuss the Groupâs affairs.  The committee included Mr. Marden, the 6<sup>th</sup> Defendant (Mr. Leung), Mr. Cheung and Mr. Lees.  There were two divisions of the committee:  an operations division and a financeand administration division, the latter headed by Mr. Leung.  Within the operations division, there were several sub-committees includingone for real estate headed by Mr. Cheung, and others for shipping and for investments, both of which were headed by Mr. Lees.</p>    <p><a name="p2.3.10" class="para" id="p2.3.10">2.3.10</a> In 1974, a three-tier structure was set up to carry out the executive and administrative functions of WM Group.  The tiers were:</p>    <p>(a) <u>The policy committee</u></p>    <p><a name="p2.3.11" class="para" id="p2.3.11">2.3.11</a> This consisted of Mr. Marden, Mr. Cheung and Peter Griffiths (Mr. Griffiths) who was apparently legal adviser both to WM and to Mr.Cheung.  The duties of this committee were âto lay down all policies as delegated and approved by the Board of WMâ.  The committeeconsidered the business affairs of the Group in areas such as future development and proposals for the sale or purchase of majorassets.  Meetings of this committee ceased, at least on a formal basis, when Peter Scales (Mr. Scales), the senior managing director,left the Group in 1976.  Thereafter, according to Mr. Lees, Mr. Cheung, Mr. Marden and Mr. Griffiths met informally as and when required.</p>    <p>(b) <u>The senior managing director and two managing directors</u></p>    <p><a name="p2.3.12" class="para" id="p2.3.12">2.3.12</a> These three officers were Mr. Scales - the senior managing director, Mr. Leung and Mr. Lees.  Their duties were âto  carry outthe policies laid down by the policy committee from time to time and to supervise the general administration of WM and its subsidiariesand affiliatesâ.  After Mr. Scales left in 1976, Mr. Leung and Mr. Lees continued as managing directors.  They no longer held formalmeetings but met and discussed the Groupâs affairs informally. </p>    <p><a name="p2.3.13" class="para" id="p2.3.13">2.3.13</a> The informality of these two tiers is easily understandable.  The Group operated as a small head office on one floor which housedall the senior executives who were able to meet, talk and exchange information every day.  Board meetings of the Group companiestook place in the WM Board room, often occurring one after the other and consisting of the same core of directors.</p>    <p>(c)  <u>The committee of senior management</u></p>    <p><a name="p2.3.14" class="para" id="p2.3.14">2.3.14</a> This committee included Stewart Cameron - the chief financial officer (Mr. Cameron), Duncan Graham - the Group company secretary(Mr. Graham), David Walker and the 5th Defendant (Mr. Brothers), who were appointed executive managers.  Later, Ray Tipper (Mr. Tipper)was appointed to the committee.</p>    <p><a name="p2.3.15" class="para" id="p2.3.15">2.3.15</a> The duties of the committee were  âto carry out all administrative functions delegated to them from time to time either individuallyor as a committee by the managing directors and to report as and when required to the managing directors or any of themâ.

It kept minutes.  These minutesare, however, unavailable - a fact for which Mr. Lees was unable to account.  It is a pity that the minutes between 1980 and 1983are missing because, after its reconstitution, the senior management committee discussed the question of support for WMI.  It isnot unreasonable to assume that this committee in its earlier composition also discussed this topic and such discussion may haveshed light on the matter.</p>    <p><a name="p2.3.18" class="para" id="p2.3.18">2.3.18</a> The management committee was reconstituted at a Board meeting of WM held on 15th July 1983.

It also provided a balance of power betweenthe two major shareholders: Mr. Marden, whose interests lay in shipping, and Mr. Cheung, whose interests lay in property and whohad different views on long-term policy.  Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung and Mr. Brothers represented Mr. Marden while Mr. Poon, Mr. Hsu andMr. Ying represented Mr. Cheung.  Although this committee could, if the necessary consensus was reached, only make a recommendation,Mr. Lees agreed that such a recommendation carried a mandatory force.  He said that no recommendation was ever over-ridden and hewould not have expected it to be.  He said the recommendation would be acted upon by the Board of WM and its subsidiaries becausedirectors who were not involved in the management committee would take the view that any recommendation had been considered carefullyby the respective directors and therefore they were entitled to rely and act on it.  Mr. Lees was prepared to accept that the committeeâsrecommendations were, in effect, rubber-stamped.</p>    <p><a name="p2.3.20" class="para" id="p2.3.20">2.3.20</a> Finally, by resolution of the WMI directors dated 28th February 1983, a shipping committee was set up.  (see para. 3.5.40).  Thiscommittee, in conjunction with WMIâs general managers and financial advisers, was to monitor appropriate measures to be taken torelieve WMIâs situation.  The committee consisted of Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung, Mr. Brothers and Mr. Tipper.  Apart from Mr. Tipper,who was Mr. Leesâ personal assistant, the other three members of the committee were directors also of WM.  Later, Mr. Tipper leftthe committee and Mr. Graham and Colin Campbell (Mr. Campbell) joined the committee.  Mr. Campbell was an executive of WM and a highlyqualified chartered accountant.  He had been an internal auditor but, because of the difficulties which WMI were facing, he was secondedfull-time to assist Mr. Brothers with preparing cash flows and other accounting matters.</p>    <p>(e)  <u>General managers</u></p>    <p><a name="p2.3.21" class="para" id="p2.3.21">2.3.21</a> WM were general managers of WMI and indeed of many other subsidiaries.

Mr. Griffiths was a director until July 1983 when he retired and was replaced byMr. Michael Ying (who was the 11th Defendant).  Mr. Ying was a supporter of Mr. Cheung as were Irene Cheung, S.K.

Mr. Yuen was director from 5th February 1983 until 31st December 1984.

WM expected its subsidiaries tobe profitable in their operations and to overcome temporary financial difficulties on their own.  If, however, a subsidiary couldnot, after taking all reasonable measures, overcome any difficulties, WM would produce the necessary support provided it thoughtthe subsidiary would probably return to profitability.  Mr. Lees expressed this as being prudent business practice to protect aninvestment in subsidiaries.</p>    <p><a name="p2.4.2" class="para" id="p2.4.2">2.4.2</a> There are examples of such support.  Between 1964 and 1976, WM advanced HK$16 million to Southern Cross Investments Limited throughwhich it held various companies in Australia.  In Hong Kong, between 1972 and 1976, WM injected some HK$12.5 million into and loanedat least $82 million to subsidiaries involved in computer and computer systems.  WMI itself received a capital injection of $40 mllionin 1974 and was provided in 1976 with at least one letter of comfort to enable it to refinance certain ships.</p>    <p><a name="p2.4.3" class="para" id="p2.4.3">2.4.3</a> The comparatively generous way in which advances, guarantees or letters of comfort had been given prompted concern on the part ofMr. Cheung.  As a result, in 1976, a finance committee was set up to consider the provision of advances and guarantees to subsidiaries. Thereafter, there developed a policy against providing guarantees although whether it was a strict policy or one that could be departedfrom in an appropriate case is a matter of dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p2.4.4" class="para" id="p2.4.4">2.4.4</a> It is an article of faith with the remaining Defendants that WM would in the end come to the aid of WMI and bail it out of its difficulties. Whether or not that faith was justified is the real issue to be decided in this case.  In order to decide that issue, it is unfortunatelynecessary to go, in some detail, into the events that took place between 1979 and 1985.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading"><a name="2.5">2.5    FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS</a></p>    <p>(a)  <u>The money machine</u></p>    <p><a name="p2.5.1" class="para" id="p2.5.1">2.5.1</a> The bond financing scheme was designed as a means by which assistance could be given to the Danish shipbuilding industry.  At theheart of the scheme (for foreign buyers) was what was effectively an interest rate subsidy provided by way of an arrangement wherebythe buyer was able to obtain long term funding at well below the open market interest rates prevailing at the time.  This was doneas follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i) DSKF agreed to make available to the buyer a fixed interest loan denominated in Danish Kroner (DKr) for 80% of the cost of thevessel.  The loan was to be repayable over 8Â½ years and would bear interest at the fixed rate of 8%.</p>        <p class="quote">(ii) The loan would be made available by DSKF issuing negotiable bearer bonds to the buyer, in this case WMI or its subsidiary.  Thebuyer was therefore indebted to DSKF for the nominal value of the bonds.</p>        <p class="quote">(iii) Danish commercial banks were prepared to acquire the DSKF bonds from the buyer at par (for a nominal commission of 0.15%) becausethe Central Bank of Denmark, in turn, undertook to likewise acquire the bonds at par from the commercial banks.  Thus, the DSKF bondswere effectively underwritten by the Central Bank, who could either resell the bonds in the market or hold them to maturity and receiveeventual repayment on redemption of the bonds.  In practice the negotiation of the bonds with the Danish commercial banks was handledby DSKF or ADS and the cash advanced to the shipyard.</p>        <p class="quote">(iv) At about the same time, the buyer would obtain a US$ loan from a (non Danish) commercial bank.  The US$ proceeds were convertedinto Danish kroner and placed on deposit with a Danish commercial bank.  The deposit was structured in such a manner that would enablethe deposit maturities to match (and extinguish) the loan repayments due to DSKF. </p>        <p class="quote">(v) The interest paid by the bank on the deposit was at a rate considerably above the rate payable by the buyer to DSKF.  Becauseof the interest rate differential the deposit was for a lesser sum than the loan due by the buyer to DSKF (e.g. Sealock liabilitiesof DKr228 million were to be extinguished by a deposit of DKr129 million).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p2.5.2" class="para" id="p2.5.2">2.5.2</a> Thus, the buyer received interest on a deposit at commercial rates (around 17%) and paid interest on the loan at 8%.  The abilityof DSKF to provide loans at an interest cost of 8% was due to the Central Bank of Denmark effectively underwriting the bonds issuedby DSKF by undertaking to purchase these bonds from the commercial banks at par, which would have been at well above their marketvalue.  The deposit rate obtained by the buyer was fixed by reference to the bonds issued by the Danish Government, which thereforeeffectively provided a subsidy to the extent of the interest differential (i.e. it bought bonds on which it received 8% and issuedbonds on which it paid 17%).</p>    <p>(b)  <u>Procedure</u></p>    <p><a name="p2.5.3" class="para" id="p2.5.3">2.5.3</a> To take advantage of the money machine, the following procedure was adopted:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i) At about the time WMI through its subsidiaries signed building contracts with BW, DSKF agreed to make a fixed rate interest subsidisedloan to WMI to meet the delivery instalment (80% of the vesselâs cost at 8% per annum repayable over 8Â½ years).</p>        <p class="quote">(ii) WMI would raise a US$ loan, convert the proceeds to Danish Kroner and place the monies on deposit at a fixed rate substantiallyhigher than that payable on the loan from DSKF (the Sealock loan was deposited at 17.8% per annum).  The deposit would be arrangedin such a way that it matured in tranches which exactly matched, in timing and amount, the DSKF loan repayments and, additionally,would be sufficient to meet certain of the pre delivery instalments.</p>        <p class="quote">(iii) The US$ loan, which was at commercial rates, would (initially) be secured on the Danish Kroner deposits, and would be repaidin instalments (commencing after delivery of the vessel) from operating revenues.</p>        <p class="quote">(iv) On delivery, it was intended that the DSKF loan would be drawn down, the US$ lender would swap its security over the depositsfor a first mortgage over the completed vessel and DSKF would take an assignment of the deposits and a second charge on the vessel. However, this proposed swap was always subject to the vesselâs earnings condition in the agreement with the US$ lender being satisfied.</p>        <p class="quote">(v) DSKF would also receive a guarantee from BW as surety for the entire loan, and a counter guarantee from EKR for the yardâs guarantee.</p>        <p class="quote">(vi) Because the rate of interest payable on the DSKF loan was substantially below that earned on the deposit, the amount of the depositwas less than the amount of the loan, the shortfall being made good over the period of the loan by the excess interest being earned. Therefore, if the borrower defaulted and DSKF chose to liquidate the deposits rather than allow them to run to maturity, they wouldnot be sufficient to cover the loan.  DSKF normally asked for this potential security shortfall to be covered by a bank guarantee. In the event, WMIâs guarantee was accepted.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(c)  <u>The loans</u></p>    <p><a name="p2.5.4" class="para" id="p2.5.4">2.5.4</a> The building contracts for 4 BW hulls 909-912, Rangelock, Sealock, Annalock and unnamed, were signed on 24th February 1981.  Sealockwas to be purchased by Mayport with delivery on 15th March 1983; Annalock by Cape Vincent with delivery on 1<sup>st</sup> February 1984.  The price was to be paid in 4 instalments, the 4th instalment of 80% being payable on delivery.</p>    <p>(e)  <u>Sealock</u></p>    <p><a name="p2.5.5" class="para" id="p2.5.5">2.5.5</a> The price was Dkr 240,500,000 (approx. US$ 41 million) of which Dkr 192,400,000 was payable on delivery.  In March 1981 DSKF offereda loan of that amount, payable over 8Â½ years at 8%.  Following WMIâs request that it provide the necessary shortfall guarantee,a formal offer was made on 27<sup>th</sup> April and accepted.  On 5th May, Mayport borrowed US$20 million from MMB and placed Dkr 129,214,000 on deposit with Privatbankenat 17.8% under arrangements that enabled it to pay off the 2nd and 3rd instalments of the price, totalling 15%, and the DSKF loan.</p>    <p><a name="p2.5.6" class="para" id="p2.5.6">2.5.6</a> The effect was that the deposit extinguished a liability of Dkr 228 million, WMI having paid the first instalment of Dkr 12 million. The total cost to WMI, including interest capitalised on the US$20 million loan, was approximately US$26 million.  MMB had securityof inter alia the deposit and a WMI guarantee.  Its loan was to be repaid by 17 semi-annual instalments commencing 6 months afterdelivery.  On delivery, MMB would swap the deposit for a first ship mortgage.</p>    <p><a name="p2.5.7" class="para" id="p2.5.7">2.5.7</a> In November 1982, the price was increased by Dkr 27 million to cover the cost of additional fittings.  MMB increased its loan toenable WMI to acquire a further Dkr deposit against a further loan from DSKF.  WMI was also trying to arrange a sale and lease-backof the vessel as a means of reducing debt in a market which had by then dropped.  Such an arrangement would have enabled the newowner to benefit from UK capital tax allowances.  The scheme fell through and WMI was forced to ask DSKF for help because it couldno longer meet the charter cover required by MMB.</p>    <p><a name="p2.5.8" class="para" id="p2.5.8">2.5.8</a> After difficult negotiations, MMB agreed a 3-year moratorium on its loan upon its loan being reduced to US$15.9 million.  The reductionwas achieved by DSKF agreeing to release 6 principal payments to MMB from the Dkr deposit.  DSKF also agreed to defer payment ofthose instalments to the end of the 8Â½ year period of its loan in November 1991 with interest at 13%.  These 6 instalments wereno longer secured by the deposit.  So WMIâs guarantee now covered this amount and any other shortfall.</p>    <p><a name="p2.5.9" class="para" id="p2.5.9">2.5.9</a> Agreements were signed and delivery took place on 8<sup>th</sup> April 1983.

The price was Dkr 249,500,000.  Cape Vincent borrowed US$19million from LBI to fund the 2nd and 3rd instalments and DSKFâs loan of Dkr 199,600,000, and placed Dkr 112 million on depositat 18.47% with Handelsbank in October 1981.</p>    <p><a name="p2.5.11" class="para" id="p2.5.11">2.5.11</a> As with Sealock, WMI needed help from DSKF.  After negotiation, agreement was reached.  The price was increased to Dkr 256m to includeextras, and DSKFâs loan to Dkr 204,800,000.  LBIâs loan was reduced to US$17.5m.  To do this, Cape Vincent borrowed US$3.7m fromNordic Asia to fund principal and interest to be paid to LBI.  In turn, DSKF released 4 principal instalments from the deposit assecurity for Nordic.  These instalments were again to be paid in a balloon at the end of the 8Â½ years with interest at 13%.  DSKFwas secured by WMIâs guarantee and a 2nd mortgage over WMIâs 51% shareholding in WWW.</p>    <p><a name="p2.5.12" class="para" id="p2.5.12">2.5.12</a> Mastship, another UK subsidiary of WMI, was substituted for Cape Vincent, again with possible UK tax advantages in mind.

This is hardly surprising because, the events being more than a decadeago, witnesses had little actual recollection of what occurred and relied heavily upon the documents of which there is an abundance. Disputes largely turn upon the construction or accuracy of certain of those documents, the absence of certain documents and aboveall, the Defendantsâ knowledge and beliefs.</p>    <p><a name="p3.1.2" class="para" id="p3.1.2">3.1.2</a> On 21st March 1979, there was a management committee meeting at which modernization of WMIâs fleet was considered.  It was decidedto proceed in two ways.  First, to sell old vessels as they came off long-term hire to Japanese charterers if market conditions wereright, and second, to acquire new tonnage or newbuildings.  Modern second-hand vessel prices were high while charter rates were notattractive.  New building prices, however, while also high, had been held down by competition and government subsidies.  These priceswere anticipated to go higher because it was a time of high inflation.  The result was, by 1981, the acquisition through varioussubsidiaries of WMI of 21 new building contracts and of one vessel, Bannerlock, built in 1977.  Of the newbuildings, two contractswere transferred to Allied, three vessels were sold to Pacnorse (a joint venture, details of which are in paras. 3.3.13-15) and oneto WWS.  The remaining 15 were or should have been delivered to WMI.  On 31st December 1982, WMIâs capital commitments as a percentageof net assets was 285%.</p>    <p><a name="p3.1.3" class="para" id="p3.1.3">3.1.3</a> An enormous sum was therefore committed to modernization.  According to Mr. Lees, the policy committee always understood that furthercapital would have to be injected over the years, probably from rights issues underwritten by WM.  Mr. Lees accepted that if WM changedits mind about underwriting, WMI would be unable to survive.</p>    <p><a name="p3.1.4" class="para" id="p3.1.4">3.1.4</a> Following that meeting in March 1979, Mr. Brothers set out to look for suitable purchases.  For this, he relied heavily upon Mr.Lloyd of WMC which dealt with chartering and the commercial side of operations.  Mr. Lloyd assisted in locating the right newbuildingsand, once approval had been obtained, he would handle negotiations with the shipyard up to the stage where it was appropriate toprovide a letter of intent or provisional contract.</p>    <p><a name="p3.1.5" class="para" id="p3.1.5">3.1.5</a> Negotiations were begun with BW for the purchase of two economic 60,000 dwt Panamax vessels and options for four more at US$19 millioneach.  Having obtained approval from the managing directors, Mr. Brothers signed heads of agreement on 14th June 1979.</p>    <p><a name="p3.1.6" class="para" id="p3.1.6">3.1.6</a> On 20th July 1979, Mr. Brothers produced the general managersâ report.  He reported that the market had been active, leading toan increase in second-hand prices and resulting in an increase in new building prices which were unlikely to fall off.  Meanwhile,pending an increase in charter-hire rates, vessels would be fixed on short- or medium-term charters so that it would be possibleto take advantage of future increased rates.  This report was discussed at a WMI Board meeting on 23rd July when Mr. Brothers saidthat purchases would be in anticipation of an increase in future rates.</p>    <p><a name="p3.1.7" class="para" id="p3.1.7">3.1.7</a> Meanwhile, negotiations with BW were proceeding slowly.  On 27th July, the WMI directors, by circular, authorized the general managersto negotiate the purchase of one new Panamax at a price of US$19.5 million from the Koyo yard in Japan, and one second-hand 27,000-tonneLakes carrier built in 1977 for US$11.5 million, or alternatives of similar specifications.</p>    <p><a name="p3.1.8" class="para" id="p3.1.8">3.1.8</a> On 11th August, WMI by Mr. Brothers made an offer to BW to buy four Panamax for delivery between December 1980 and September 1981at prices of US$19.5 to US$20.5 million with 90% financing from DSKF over ten years.  These terms exceeded terms permitted underOECD and European Community rules and required special treatment, while BW had its own problems at the time, so that on 26th SeptemberWMI withdrew from negotiations although talks continued.</p>    <p><a name="p3.1.9" class="para" id="p3.1.9">3.1.9</a> On 15th August, WMI, by circular, authorized the acquisition from WWS of another Japanese new building, a bulk carrier of 27,000tonnes.</p>    <p><a name="p3.1.10" class="para" id="p3.1.10">3.1.10</a> On 1st October, at a WM Board meeting, Mr. Brothers reported the purchase of Bannerlock, for US$11.5 million and anticipated theacquisition of two Japanese vessels.</p>    <p><a name="p3.1.11" class="para" id="p3.1.11">3.1.11</a> The management committee on 17th October noted that the WMI Group was now committed to two new Panamax from Kasado yard for deliveryin 1981.  These became the Inverlock and Fenlock.  Another vessel  was to be built at the Koyo yard and two in Osaka.  No difficultywas anticipated in arranging up to 85% financing over 8 to 10 years.  The required payments were well within WMIâs cash resourcesand the purchases covered WMI against the inevitable further price increases.</p>    <p><a name="p3.1.12" class="para" id="p3.1.12">3.1.12</a> Following that meeting, Mr Brothers prepared a circular dated 19th October for WMI directors.  The circular commenced:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAn extensive investigation has been carried out to advise on how best the Companyâs declared policy of modernisation might beachieved.  This has been undertaken over a period which has seen a considerable increase in general optimism over the future of thedry-cargo market with a related tendency for yard prices to harden, to a significant extent.  This increase in prices has been acceleratedby the recognition that inflation is affecting Japan to a greater extent than was hitherto thought coupled by increased orderingin Japan by European owners (who are unable to build in Europe at the same price) where the number of available berths for 1980 and1981 is now practically exhausted.  All in all, it has become apparent that unless the Group is able to crystalize its forward positionat this time, it will be faced with the necessity of paying substantially higher prices in the future.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.1.13" class="para" id="p3.1.13">3.1.13</a> The circular went on to seek ratification for the purchase of the newbuildings from the Kasado, Koyo and Osaka yards.  Ratificationwas provided the same day.  Details of these newbuildings were included in the general managersâ report dated 29th November whichalso reported a profit of HK$38 million for the first six months of 1979 and a satisfactory working of the fleet.  The report wasapproved by the WMI Board on 30th November.</p>    <p><a name="p3.1.14" class="para" id="p3.1.14">3.1.14</a> In November, agreement was reached with BW for the purchase of two Panamax vessels for US$32.9 million each.  By using the Danishmoney machine, the effective cost was reduced to US$22.2 million with 90% finance from DSKF.  WMI gave performance guarantees forits subsidiaries taking these two vessels, Thorlock and Hydrolock.  It is to be noted that WMI reserved the right to examine BWâsfinancial arrangements in the light of difficulties BW was then experiencing and took steps to do so through its London solicitors,Norton Rose.  The enquiries proved satisfactory so that the agreement proceeded.  In the event, these two vessels were transferredto and taken by Allied.</p>    <p><a name="p3.1.15" class="para" id="p3.1.15">3.1.15</a> It is also to be noted that, although all preliminary negotiations for these vessels involved finance from DSKF, the formal offerof finance came from ADS and it was to ADS that Mr. Brothers replied as director of WMI confirming a pledge to ADS of the subsidiariesâshares as part of the arrangements.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading"><a name="3.2">3.2    1980</a></p>    <p><a name="p3.2.1" class="para" id="p3.2.1">3.2.1</a> On 24th June 1980, Mr. Lees produced the general managerâs report for 79/80.  He said it was fortunate that WMI had placed ordersfor new tonnage when it did because prices had risen sharply in the previous six months reflecting strong market conditions whichhad encouraged owners.  The report, however, contained perhaps the first hint of trouble when it continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAs stated above, the shipping market has been extremely strong during the year and at the present time rates are continuing tofirm.  Most charterers are however adopting a cautious attitude and it is difficult to obtain period business for over 12 monthswithout accepting a substantial discount.  Our current policy has been to fix the older tonnage for two years thereby locking inexisting very profitable trading conditions and we are seeking three to five year time-charter employment for newbuildings.  However,it is not expected that we will be able to find employment for any of these vessels until nearer delivery.  The tanker market remainsvery weak although its effect on the Group is only in respect of the âStraits Dahliaâ which is of a size least affected.  Ownersof 7 and 8 year VLCC tonnage with turbine engines are now increasingly selling these units for demolition as the chance of them everoperating profitably becomes less and less likely.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.2.2" class="para" id="p3.2.2">3.2.2</a> The report concluded its review of shipping activities on a congratulatory note:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe Group continues to follow its stated policy of replacing its older units with modern tonnage either newbuildings or good modernsecond-hand vessels.  It is unlikely however that we will be as active in the coming 12 months as we have been in the past as wedo not think that the current rise can continue and there may well be a downturn in rates and prices early next year.  This willprovide us with an opportunity for further acquisition.  The Group has been most successful so far in securing tonnage at advantageousprices and if we take advantage of the current strength of the market to fix as long as possible, we will be assured of a continuedgrowth in our earnings base.  All financing arrangements in respect of these acquisitions have been concluded on terms which possiblyrepresent as good as have ever been negotiated by any Hong Kong shipping company.  Our ability in this respect no doubt underlinesthe overall financial strength of the Group.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.2.3" class="para" id="p3.2.3">3.2.3</a> The report was approved by the WMI Board on 27th June 1980.</p>    <p><a name="p3.2.4" class="para" id="p3.2.4">3.2.4</a> On 16th July, the management committee noted that one of the Osaka hulls was to be sold to WWS while WMI would buy another Koyo atjust below market price for delivery in 1982.

On the same day,Mr. Brothers signed on behalf of WMI a performance guarantee of the contract by Newark.

On the following day, he began toseek loans to underpin the 80% financing that would be made available by the Fund.  He plainly had some misgivings about these purchasesbecause on 26th February he telexed Philip Brothers, charterers, about fixtures and said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âBasic premise for us is that we will not accept any charter rate below dollar 7.50 which although still at a loss - making levelis probably the present market and is bearable for a limited period.  The other factor to be taken into account that with DKR/USDrate over 6.60, each ship would probably command a premium of nearly DLR3 million more than level we contracted at three months ago.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.3.6" class="para" id="p3.3.6">3.3.6</a> Mr. Brothers went on to propose charters at a combination of rates ranging from US$7.50 to $10.50.</p>    <p><a name="p3.3.7" class="para" id="p3.3.7">3.3.7</a> Mr. Brothers produced the next general managersâ report on 24th March.  Apart from the BW hulls, he advised that two more subsidiarieshad each contracted to buy a 27,000-tonne bulk carrier from the Dalian yard in China.  (These became simply âthe Daliansâ - asource of trouble).  He said the bulk carrier market was extremely buoyant and the two Kasado hulls, Inverlock and Fenlock, had beenfixed on good three-year time-charters.  He went on:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âNegotiations are presently also taking place with a view to securing a charter for the Koyo Hull No.1013 which is being deliveredin November this year.  This is the only newbuilding being delivered this year not yet fixed.  With regard to existing tonnage onbareboat charter and in addition to the two vessels referred to above, the âASIA FIDELITYâ will be redelivered in June 1981 andâASIA FLAMINGOâ will be redelivered at the end of the year.</p>        <p class="quote">3.  Much of the current strength in the Panamax market can undoubtedly be attributed to the present severe congestion on the EastCoast of the United States which in itself is the result of inefficiencies exacerbated by increased demand for U.S. coal as a resultof strikes in Australia and Poland.  The general consensus of opinion is that this particular market, i.e. Panamax type, will weakenas the congestion difficulties are overcome and more newbuilding tonnage is delivered on to the market.  There is an undoubted truthto this although in general there does seem to exist an underlying very firm tone in the bulk market which makes it seem unlikelythere will be any drastic fall back in market rates.</p>        <p class="quote">4.  On the newbuilding side, the sharp rise in prices experienced in the second half of 1980 has levelled off due to buyer resistancealthough it seems unlikely that there will be any falling back to the price levels of twelve months ago.  If chartering market ratesindeed fall back during this year, there may be opportunities to acquire re-sale contracts fixed early in 1980 (but well below presentyard contract prices) and this is an area to be closely watched in the future.  With inflation running at current levels and an increasingunwillingness on the part of Governments to subsidise their shipbuilding industries, it is unlikely that we shall see lower newbuildingprices in the future.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.3.8" class="para" id="p3.3.8">3.3.8</a> The report was considered by the WMI Board on 26th March when the purchase of the Dalians was ratified, as were the four lettersgiving performance guarantees on the four BW hulls and another letter by which Mr. Brothers had accepted a loan offer from MMB onSealock.</p>    <p><a name="p3.3.9" class="para" id="p3.3.9">3.3.9</a> On 13th April, Mr. Marden was in Beijing and signed contracts for the Dalians.

Of the market, he said:  âIt appears weakness continues on all fronts,â but Panamax were looking up. He had acquired short time-charters of US$6-8,000.00.

In a memo to WMI directors, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWith the decreasing interest by the major Japanese time-charterers for non-Japanese tonnage, it is important that Hong Kong shipownersexpand their International contacts while at the same time dealing more directly with the direct sources of the cargoes.  As faras our own Group is concerned, it is particularly important that we seek to establish overseas relationships as early as possibleas we do not have the back-up experience and contacts which other local owners have been able to develop over a longer period.  Weare inevitably at a disadvantage as compared with local owners when it comes to dealing with Japan but it is also clear that Europeanand American Operators find themselves more comfortable dealing with a British Group.  Wheelock Marden wishes to limit the size ofits organisation which could not be the case if we were to effectively participate in the Contract-of-Affreightment market.  It istherefore most important to link ourselves with an experienced and well respected Pool Operator specialising in this field.  In thisrespect we have been in negotiation for some time with A/S Kristian Jebsens Rederi, a well respected Norwegian Shipowner who operatesa successful Pool business with vessels of a type similar to those owned by our Group.</p>        <p class="quote">The Jebsens Pool undertakes Contracts-of-Affreightment for bulk cargoes in sizes up to 40,000 tons and presently employs over 30 vesselsof which 22 are owned by Jebsens.  The balance are time chartered-in to meet specific contract requirements.</p>        <p class="quote">Jebsens own a Bermuda based company named Pacific Norse Shipping Ltd.  Originally 50% of this company was owned by Dillingham of Hawaii. Dillingham however were forced to sell their share due to other pressures and Jebsen are now offering us the chance of purchasing50% of this company.  We stated that we could only contemplate such an investment if all the assets owned by PacNorse other thantheir eight modern 35,000 bulk-carriers were sold out of the company.  We also stated that we would like to sell into PacNorse ourthree Koyo Panamax vessels.  The capital assets of this company would thus be eleven ships comprising of our three Koyos and eightmodern bulk-carriers.  All the vessels would be Liberian flag and would be employed in the Jebsen Bulkcarrier Pool.  Valuation ofthe company would be on a net asset basis with the vessels valued on current day market less 7Â½%.  A further vital component ofthis whole arrangement is access to the Pool operation which will bring with it certain benefits including the existing Pool Contractsand Equipment.  This comes without charge.</p>        <p class="quote">Negotiations on this whole matter has been extended over the past six months and have now been concluded subject only to WMI Boardapproval.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.3.14" class="para" id="p3.3.14">3.3.14</a> Mr. Brothers noted the sale of three Koyo vessels to Pacnorse would generate a profit of about $12 million.  The cost of acquiringa half-share would be US$47 million of which $12.5 million would be by way of a shareholdersâ loan.  Mr. Brothers did not thinkthe acquisition would strain WMIâs cash resources.  He concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI believe that this presents us with an absolutely unique opportunity which will not be repeated.  We could not hope to establishthe breadth of contracts and experience that has been accumulated over the years within the Jebsen bulkcarrier pool.  We are nowjoining a âgoing concernâ without paying a premium and our future operation will undoubted benefit, both from the contracts thatthe association will bring us and the extra employment that we may expect for our wholly-owned vessels as Jebsens are themselvessubstantial charterers.  The association will be especially valuable in times of poor market conditions when time-charters are hardto find.  It will bring the Wheelock Maritime Group into international recognition which in itself can only lead to âspin-offsâthat will be beneficial.  It would be difficult to conceive of a better investment at this moment for the WMI Group nor one whichis more harmonious with its present activities and Board approval is highly recommended.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.3.15" class="para" id="p3.3.15">3.3.15</a> There was a meeting of the WMI Board on 2nd July at which the proposal was considered.

The minutes thenrecord:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMr. R.J.F.

He also referred to the fact that a Pool operationwas more subject to market movements than medium term timecharters.  If WMI was worried about future employment, World-Wide wouldalways assist in securing timecharters.

After commenting on a number of factors, the report continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âNevertheless, although these are positive indicators, no market commentator is forecasting an early return to 1980 conditions andalthough we can certainly see an increase in rates from their existing record low levels, there will not be a return to viable tradinglevels until the end of the recession and there will be the opportunities for purchases of further tonnage at distressed prices.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.4.4" class="para" id="p3.4.4">3.4.4</a> The report concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn the circumstances of the present very adverse market conditions and with the earnings of the Group now more subject to fluctuationsin charter rates we cannot expect that earnings will be maintained at their current levels and there will be a reduced profit inthe current year from the record levels announced for 1981.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.4.5" class="para" id="p3.4.5">3.4.5</a> The report was discussed at a Board meeting on 23rd March when the Board approved the arrangements that had been made for Marilock,which was to be sold upon delivery to Cable &amp; Wireless in England and leased back to a subsidiary, WMI(UK) Limited.  Cable &amp;Wireless expected to realise capital allowances permitted by English tax law (see para. 4.5).  The existing loan arrangements withADS were to remain in place.  WMI was required to give, and gave: a guarantee of its subsidiariesâ obligations under the lease;a guarantee to ADS of the loan; a pledge in favour of ADS of WMIâs shareholding in Newark which had taken the loan; and a guaranteeto HSS which was to guarantee a letter of credit in favour of Cable &amp; Wireless on which Cable &amp; Wireless could call if WMI(UK)was in breach of its obligations.  The benefit to WMI was a cheap interest rate of 8.43% on the lease which represented Cable &amp;Wireless sharing its capital allowance benefits.  Such an arrangement, therefore, was a source of cheap finance. </p>    <p><a name="p3.4.6" class="para" id="p3.4.6">3.4.6</a> The WM Board considered WMI at a meeting on 25th May at which during Mr. Brothersâ report:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt was noted that since the middle of last year there had been a downturn in rates and the current outlook was not encouraging.

Unencumbered assets worth US$12.5 million could then be sold to reduce WMIâs debtand improve its liquidity.  This proposal seems to have been prompted by a note (now unavailable) from Mr.  Cameron to Mr. Brotherswhich suggested WMI would have a cash requirement due to adverse market conditions.  In a memo dated 28th June, Mr. Brothers wroteto Mr. Cameron commenting on the proposal and concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI feel that present market conditions (i.e. a low shipping market combined with a low market price for WMI shares) create idealconditions for us to proceed and it is important for WMI to maintain its liquidity.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.4.10" class="para" id="p3.4.10">3.4.10</a> A few days earlier, on 21st June, Mr. Yuen, who was in charge of WMS, had written to Mr. Brothers saying:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWith the very bleak and low shipping market in front of us which may last until 1984/85, I try to see how to save some money bytaking advantage of the poor shipping market together with the very new Hong Kong Government depreciation tax allowance of 55% formachinery/fixed assets initial installation and 15% for the first year.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.4.11" class="para" id="p3.4.11">3.4.11</a> Mr. Yuenâs scheme in essence was for some of the newbuildings to be taken by otherwise profitable Hong Kong companies which couldoffset those profits against the vessels because âno  Hong Kong profit tax will be payable because of the foreseeable poor shippingmarketâ.  Then, said Mr. Yuen:  âAfter 2/3 years, when the shipping market recovers, the ships will be sold to WMIâs subsidiariesor any ship holding company within the Groupâ.</p>    <p><a name="p3.4.12" class="para" id="p3.4.12">3.4.12</a> There is disagreement between Mr. Brothers and Mr. Yuen about when the market was likely to recover, Mr. Brothers anticipating anupward trend in 1984.

Nothing it may be noted came of either of these proposals.</p>    <p><a name="p3.4.13" class="para" id="p3.4.13">3.4.13</a> Mr. Brothers produced the next general managersâ report on 16th September.

He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe fall in profits can almost entirely be attributed to the very adverse trading conditions that we are presently experiencingin the international shipping market.  The benefit of a strong U.S. dollar has been negated by the high level of interest prevailingduring the period under review.

Turning to the principal activities of the Group:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><u>Shipping</u></p>        <p class="quote">The first six months have been characterised by a steady slide in rates to distress levels in all sectors, and particularly in respectof the larger bulk carriers.  Present rates are barely sufficient to cover operating costs and in some instances have been belowoperating costs.  Inevitably the earnings of the Group have been badly affected.  In the case of the âManila Spiritâ ex âJaylockâa trading loss of just under $6 million has been incurred.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.4.14" class="para" id="p3.4.14">3.4.14</a> Mr. Brothers also reported on the sale and lease-back of Marilock, saying a cash surplus of US$5 million had been realized.  It washoped to make similar arrangements for Rangelock, Sealock and the two Sestao hulls due for delivery in 1983.  On Pacnorse, Mr. Brothersreported that the adverse market conditions had had an effect and that a provision of HK$8 million had been made in the Groupâsaccounts for their share of Pacnorseâs losses.  The loss, however, had been inflated by the sale by Pacnorse to Carrian of eightof its vessels and their charter-back at relatively high rates.  Mr. Brothers concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe continuation of a stagnant world economy and the increase of newbuilding tonnage on to the market makes it unlikely that anysignificant improvement in shipping market conditions can be realised during the rest of the year.

The current fall in interest rates will be of assistance and may also help to revive the economy.  The immediateoutlook however is very bleak and although every effort is being made to ensure that earnings are maximised there is very littlethat one can do to âbuckâ the trend and a policy of continuing to trade on the short term market to await a turn-around in tradingconditions will be followed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.4.15" class="para" id="p3.4.15">3.4.15</a> The report was considered by the WMI Board on 16th September at a gloomy meeting.

A summary of this cashflow, with major assumptions and an illustration in graph form, is at App.2/1.</p>    <p><a name="p3.4.21" class="para" id="p3.4.21">3.4.21</a> Mr. Cameron subsequently sent this document to the two managing directors on 21st September under cover of a memorandum in whichhe said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âObvious observations that can be made on the Projections are:-</p>        <p class="quote">1)  The need to reduce the total shortfalls by:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">a)  New lines of borrowings on debt free vessels, and as advised by RJFB he has asked BNP for a US$10.0 million line.</p>            <p class="quote">b)  Disposal of either some vessels in the present fleet or newbuildings</p>            <p class="quote">c)  The generation of cash from sale and lease back proposals</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">d)  Obtaining new money market lines of revolving credit</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2)  As the current levels of income are being severely affected by the available charter rates and thus the ability to service debtrequirements (principal repayments and interest), operation costs and dividends etc. is limited by this reduced cash inflow.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">3)   To meet its commitments it has recently been necessary for WMI to borrow US$ from WM &amp; S after we had checked that WM &amp;S could spare such funds for the temporary needs of WMI.

I will not approve any borrowings from WM &amp; Co. without the prior consentof HWL/WJL.  Meanwhile, I have requested American Express and Sun Hung Kai Bank each to provide lines of US$2.0m.

He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âExtremely depressed conditions prevail in all trades and all sizes.  Rates on major trades (and consequently time-charter) areas low as I can ever remember them.  Tonnage supply is plentiful and cargoes scarce.  The Pacific is probably the worst area andthe Atlantic the best.</p>        <p class="quote">The severity of the current shipping slump has taken most observers by surprise.  It has followed, predictably, the world-wide recessionwhich is lasting longer and proving more severe, and damaging, than had been forecast.  A recovery of sorts is now expected, andthe world is watching and waiting for the United States to lead the way.  Shipping markets traditionally start to recover 6/12 monthsafter an up-swing in world trade.  Therefore, in my opinion, we have face a full year, though hopefully not two years, of depressedconditions.</p>        <p class="quote">Whilst shipping must be principally influenced by world trade conditions, other factors can also play an important part - factorssuch as port congestion and slow-steaming - international tensions and their effect upon stock piling policies - lay up levels affectingtonnage supply - a vigorous scrap market (which in turn will reflect a good demand for steel).  These factors are all on the positiveside but the spectre of newbuildings flowing from the shipyards of the world every day through 1983 makes progress an up-hill fight,though some relief may result from cancellations, postponements and substitutions.  Also the deepening of the Suez Canal has comeat the worst possible time and now permits transits by fully laden vessels of 150,000 tons as compared with about 75000, which hitsthe major bulk trades of iron ore and bauxite, as well as oil.</p>        <p class="quote">Traditionally, medium to long-term time charter (say 3/7 years) provides a much lower, but more secure, earnings base as comparedwith the single voyage or time charter trip markets, and for decades operators have made money by chartering in long and charteringout short term.

It had before it a lengthy paper containing a detailed analysis of the shipping marketand of Pacnorse problems.  The paper provided various forecasts.  It also contained some glimmers of light.  It referred to a revenueforecast based on a bulk shipping model designed by the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration and stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âUsing consensus values of OECD demand, and Clarkson values of vessel supply growth the model predicts a mild rate recovery in 1983followed by a strong recovery in the 1984/1985 time frame.  Optimistic recovery GNP growth figures, more consistent with prior cyclicrecovery patterns, yield on even a more rapid rate recovery of even greater intensity.  On the other hand if growth remains sluggish,indicating a more permanent economic structural change, rate levels will rise slowly throughout the planning period but never achievelevels adequate to service vessel debts.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.4.24" class="para" id="p3.4.24">3.4.24</a> The paper also referred to a forecast by Clarksons which was âcautiously optimistic for a market revival in 1983 and beyondâand stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âDespite present difficulties a moderate upturn is anticipated by Clarkson for 1983, resulting in some expansion of seaborne bulktrade movements.  Some recent developments may have understandably reinforced scepticism as to the timing and extent of economicrecovery, but Clarkson feels that there is now some justification for taking a reasonably optimistic view.  In their view, the mainfactor causing and prolonging the present recession has been the need to reduce inflation rates worldwide to an acceptable level. Corrective measures in many countries, particularly in the United States, are now achieving success, although it remains to be seenwhether this improvement can be sustained.  Nevertheless, signs are emerging that there has been at least a partial lowering of theinflationary expectations which had become deeply entrenched during the mid to late 1970s.  If this trend can be maintained, thenprospects for economic growth are very good.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.4.25" class="para" id="p3.4.25">3.4.25</a> Also on 16th September, WMI issued an interim statement.  In reviewing prospects, the chairman, Mr. Marden said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI indicated in my Statement accompanying the 1981 Accounts that the earnings of the Group would become more subject to fluctuationsin charter rates and accordingly a lower level of profits was anticipated for the current year.  Nevertheless it was expected thesame rate of distribution could be maintained.  Charter rates in the bulk cargo section of the shipping market have since worsenedto unprecedented depressed levels.</p>        <p class="quote">The severity of the current shipping slump has taken most observers by surprise.  It has followed the world-wide recession which islasting longer and proving deeper and more damaging than had been forecast.  There is, as yet, no significant improvement in theworld economic climate and the newbuilding tonnage now coming onto an already depressed market makes it extremely doubtful that therewill be an early recovery in the shipping market.</p>        <p class="quote">In the light of circumstances prevailing at the present time it is unlikely the Group will achieve a profit for the current financialyear.  The present shipping slump is expected to last well into 1983 with some improvement emerging in the latter half.

They were called shipping meetings.  At the first meeting, it was agreed to produce a revised cash flow. Mr. Lees asked if the fleetâs cash position was healthy.  Mr. Brothers said he was negotiating a US$10 million loan from BNP usingthree ships as security.</p>    <p><a name="p3.4.27" class="para" id="p3.4.27">3.4.27</a> At this time, Mr. Brothers did two things to try and ease WMIâs position.  First, he approached the Spanish yards proposing that90%, instead of 5%, of the contract price be payable on delivery of which 85% would be a buyer credit to be made available by a loanfrom a Spanish bank whose interest rates were lower than prevailing commercial rates.  At the same time, the buying subsidiarieswould obtain a loan from Chemical Bank which would be used to purchase U.S. dollar bonds to match payments due to the Spanish bankwhich would thus be secured.  Chemical Bank would take a first mortgage on the ships.</p>    <p><a name="p3.4.28" class="para" id="p3.4.28">3.4.28</a> Second, he went to the Dalian yard to try and obtain a deferment of 24 months on the delivery of the two hulls.  The minutes of themeeting note that Mr. Brothers made the approach with extreme reluctance and that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âHe could not over-emphasize how bad was the state of the Shipping Market.  These terrible conditions would lead to the bankruptciesof many shipowners and as Bankers had seen the values of their security decimated, they had stopped shipping loans.  Some ownershad put their berths on the market at low prices thereby effecting the Yardâs own marketing efforts.  He realistically could notsee the market improve until the end of 1984 and rather than face the embarrassment of coming back to the Yard a second time, theonly meaningful deferment would be 24 months.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.4.29" class="para" id="p3.4.29">3.4.29</a> Also Mr. Brothers:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âEmphasized that Wheelock Maritime valued its association with China and that it regarded itself as being a long-term customer forships to be built in China.  In times of difficulty, both sides should do their best to assist each other and it was certainly WMIâsintention and wish that the relationship with CSTC should be a long one beneficial to both sides.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.4.30" class="para" id="p3.4.30">3.4.30</a> A deputy director of the yard said such a delay was almost unthinkable but agreed that both sides should try and work to a solution.

This assumed, inter alia, 80% loans for the three Chinese newbuildings; thatRangelock, Sealock and the two Sestao newbuildings would be sold and leased back; and that a facility of US$10 million would be availablein November 1982.  There was a projected cash deficit of US$26 million in December 1983. This cash flow was discussed at the nextshipping meeting on 15<sup>th</sup> October.  Proposals for meeting the deficit were:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âa)  the sale of Pacnorse to Allied</p>        <p class="quote">b)  the sale of Pacnorse to an outside buyer</p>        <p class="quote">c)  the sale of WMI vessels on the market</p>        <p class="quote">d)  the deferment/rejection of the China newbuildingsâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.4.33" class="para" id="p3.4.33">3.4.33</a> On 20th October, BNP offered to make a loan through WMF of US$10 million over five years secured on three ships, Regent Pimpernel,Golden Lotus and Golden Orchid.  The offer was accepted.</p>    <p><a name="p3.4.34" class="para" id="p3.4.34">3.4.34</a> On 22nd October, another cash flow was prepared.  The assumptions now included postponement of delivery of the Dalians and two Sevillanewbuildings until December 1984; the loan on delivery of Manila Faith would be only 60% of the price; the final dividend payableby WMI for 1982 would be reduced from US$2.5 million to $600,000.00; and future charter-hire rates on both a high and low basis. Deficits of US$22.2 million and $24 million were projected by December 1983.</p>    <p><a name="p3.4.35" class="para" id="p3.4.35">3.4.35</a> This cash flow was discussed at a shipping meeting on 22nd October at which Mr. Leung:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âStated that it was very important that a solution be found to this problem now rather than allowing the situation to continue andbe faced with a crisis.  Further discussion took place on how best this deficit could be covered.  RJFB suggested that one immediatestep that could be taken was the sale of Wheelock Marden &amp; Stewart to Wheelock Marden.  WJL stated that he would be completelyagainst this move and that in any event Wheelock Marden did not have the cash for the acquisition.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.4.36" class="para" id="p3.4.36">3.4.36</a> To help meet the position, it was proposed that Allied should sell its four vessels and buy Fenlock and Inverlock from WMI.  It wasalso noted that WWS had approached Hudong yard on behalf of WMI about deferring delivery of Manila Faith, a similar approach havingbeen made in respect of a sister vessel to be acquired by WWW.  Mr. Brothers</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âStated his concern on the difficulty of financing this vessel due to the fall in values and the general malaise over the shippingindustry.

Without that sale, there was a deficit of US$52 million.  With the sale, the deficit would be $40 million.  Thiswas discussed at a shipping meeting on 5th November where Mr. Campbell said the deficits in December 1983 would be $11.5 millionor $20.5 million respectively.  There was no progress on the sales to be reported, while the market for Panamax vessels had droppedabout 15% to US$15/16 million.</p>    <p><a name="p3.4.38" class="para" id="p3.4.38">3.4.38</a> On 10th November, WM agreed to give a letter of comfort to West LB for a credit facility of US$5 million for WMI.

Five different bases were usedand they produced deficits ranging from US$13.5 million to $35 million.  There was a shipping meeting on the same day at which Mr.Brothers reported that documentation for the sale and lease-back of Sealock to Orion Royal Pacific Ltd., the leasing arm of RBC,was virtually complete, while the Spanish yards had offered a one-year moratorium on the payment of principal and US$4 million creditagainst costs arising out of any deferment of deliveries.  Negotiations were continuing.  At the next meeting, on 19th November,Mr. Brothers outlined a proposal for the sale and charter-back of Rangelock, with an option to purchase.  Negotiations were to takeplace in Denmark.</p>    <p><a name="p3.4.40" class="para" id="p3.4.40">3.4.40</a> There was a WM Board meeting on 26th November at which it was noted that WMI forecast a loss of HK$8 million for 1983.  Mr. Lee âadvisedthat there appeared to be little prospect of an improvement in the shipping market until 1984 or possibly 1985â.</p>    <p><a name="p3.4.41" class="para" id="p3.4.41">3.4.41</a> Following this meeting, there were informal meetings between Mr. Marden, Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung, Mr. Griffiths and Mr. Ortiz-Patino,an independent director who came from Switzerland for any WM business.  Discussion concerned what to do about WMI.  Consensus appearsto have been reached on what action should be taken.  On 29th November, at another informal meeting, Mr. Brothers was told aboutthis consensus and asked to reduce it into writing.  This Mr. Brothers did in a memorandum dated 8th December (the December memorandum)and which is at App. 3/1.</p>    <p><a name="p3.4.42" class="para" id="p3.4.42">3.4.42</a> Neither what I will call the November consensus nor the December memorandum were to be mentioned again, at least not directly.

Shortly after, on 28th December, Orient Leasing (Asia) Limited made an offer for the saleand lease-back of the vessel at a price of US$17 million.  Orient Leasing required, inter alia, a letter of comfort from WM.  A letterof comfort in a form previously used was offered by WM on 5th January 1983, but in the event, WM did not provide one.

A few days before delivery, a problem arose because therewas no three-year charter in place as required under the conditions on which LBI had made the loan of US$20 million to fund the purchaseof Danish Kroner.  Mr. Brothers offered earnings from other older vessels which were refused because the vessels were trading onthe spot market.  He telexed Mr. Marden, Mr. Lees and Mr. Leung on 10th January about the difficulties, saying:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe are very limited in our room to manoeuvre in that we have neither assets nor additional income to offer.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.2" class="para" id="p3.5.2">3.5.2</a> The solution devised (by whom is not clear but probably by Mr. Marden, Mr. Lees and Mr. Brothers) was for Rangelock to be charteredto a WMI(UK) subsidiary, Aquaship Ltd., at US$11,250.00 per day, that being the required rate.  As Rangelock would have to be tradedon the spot market at US$5-6,000.00 per day, WM provided LBI with a performance guarantee on behalf of Aquaship.

He did this in a memo of 22 January,copied to Mr. Marden and Mr. Griffiths.  He said the original plan for a sale and leaseback to a Danish company, DIFCO, had fallenthrough in December, after which LBI would not agree to a waiver of the earnings covenant.

Assuming the sale of 10 vessels; the postponement of thetwo Sevillas and the Dalians; the sale and lease-back of Manila Faith, the Osaka new building, Manila Spirit, and the three BWs;and the sale of Fenlock and Inverlock, the deficit would be US$26 million.  Other assumptions, including cancellation of the Daliansand all Spanish hulls, produced results ranging from a deficit of US$20m to a surplus of US$10.8m.

This sale had been put in hand because of WMIâs cash flow projections but had not yet taken place.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.10" class="para" id="p3.5.10">3.5.10</a> Also on 21st January, CSTC advised keel-laying of Dalian hull B 270-7 had been carried out on 7 January but the 2nd instalment ofUS$2.25 million had not yet been received.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.11" class="para" id="p3.5.11">3.5.11</a> On 26th January, there was a WM Board meeting at which the chairman, Mr. Marden, reported the arrangements which had been made forRangelock.  The Board approved these arrangements and authorized the signing of the guarantee to be given by WM.  The minutes thenrecord:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<u>POLICY IN RELATION TO THE ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES:</u></p>        <p class="quote">Mr. J. L. Marden proposed that it be resolved that it remains the strict policy of this Company not to assume liabilities of any ofthe subsidiaries or associates, either by way of guarantee or by assuming primary liability.  Further that if any situation arisesin which substantial liabilities have arisen or might arise which might jeopardize the financial position of any subsidiary or associate,a full report should be given immediately to all the Members of the Board of this Company.</p>        <p class="quote">The Resolution was seconded by Mr. P.J.

Lees and Mr. H.W. Leung confirmed that there was no existing circumstance which might result in a liability involvement by(WM).</p>        <p class="quote">Mr. Patrick Poon queried the Companyâs present policy with regard to the issue of Letters of Comfort and Letters of Awareness inrespect of loans, obligations, liabilities etc. of subsidiary and associated companies.  In reply, Mr. R.J.F. Brothers advised thatall Letters of Comfort and Letters of Awareness issued by the Company had been carefully vetted by Messrs. Johnson, Stokes &amp;Master and the issue of all such letters were formally approved by the Board.  He went on to say that one loan was currently beingnegotiated by (WMI) which would call for a Letter of Comfort to be given by the Company.</p>        <p class="quote">It was resolved that all Letters of Comfort or Letter of Awareness must follow the form of the attached Comfort Letter given to GrindlaysAsia Limited dated 24th December 1982 and that any variations to that standard form must be approved by Messrs.

It was further resolved that all Letters of Comfort and Letters of Awareness must be formally approved by the Board.</p>        <p class="quote">It was further agreed that all such letters should make it quite clear that such letters were not to be construed as a guarantee.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.12" class="para" id="p3.5.12">3.5.12</a> It is not in dispute that this resolution was brought about by Mr. Cheung, whose interests were represented by Mr. Griffiths, becausehe was angry that he had not been consulted about the Aquaship guarantee.  From this point on, Mr. Cheung took a much closer interestin WMIâs affairs.  Shortly after, on 29th January, Mr. Griffiths suggested to Mr. Marden and Mr. Leung that Mr. Shaw, a solicitorof JSM/Norton Rose, should be instructed.  At the same time, he arranged that there should be regular progress reports about theWMI situation.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.13" class="para" id="p3.5.13">3.5.13</a> On 18th January, Manila Faith had been launched and a payment of 25% of the purchase price became due on 28<sup>th</sup> January.  WMIâs subsidiary, Giant, was unable to pay because the sale and lease-back with Orient Leasing had not been completed. Payment was deferred until 31st January and arrangements were made for a loan of US$3.47 million from WWW which would be repaidfrom the proceeds of the sale and lease-back.  On 31st January, by circular, the WMI directors approved these arrangements.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.14" class="para" id="p3.5.14">3.5.14</a> On 4th February, WM made available to WMI US$850,000.00 as an advance on the purchase price for WM&amp;S.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.15" class="para" id="p3.5.15">3.5.15</a> Also at the beginning of February, Mr. Brothers prepared two papers.  One, dated 5th February, was for the managing directors ofWM as general managers of Allied.  Notwithstanding that âthe outlook for the shipping industry appears bleakâ, the paper recommendedthe purchase by Allied of Fenlock and Inverlock, the cost of which would be offset by the sale of Alliedâs four existing oldervessels.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.16" class="para" id="p3.5.16">3.5.16</a> The second paper, dated 8th February, was to WMI directors.  It reported the results of further negotiations by Mr. Brothers andMr. Lee with the Dalian yard.  Delivery scheduled for May and September 1983 was to be deferred to January 1985.  CSSC would arrangefinance of 50% or 60% of the price on delivery at 9%.  Compensation of US$55,000.00 per month per vessel would be payable pendingdelivery.  The effect was a substantial saving of funding.  The memo went on:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âDirectorsâ attention is drawn to the fact that WMI have not given any Performance Guarantee in respect of the subsidiaries holdingthe contracts.  It is also apparent that under present market conditions, there is a paramount need to preserve the Groupâs cashresources to whatever extent possible.  We are advised that should the Group at some time in the future wish to negotiate with itsbankers for a deferment on principal repayments, the existence of future commitments of this nature may be seriously questioned bythe Bankers involved to such extent that they may insist on either making no further payments or additional equity for shareholders. The prices of the contracts were relatively low at the time they were placed although at todayâs market level the contracts couldbe repeated in the region of US$11 million each.  Nevertheless, it is my belief that failure to perform under these contracts wouldhave far-reaching consequences not just in respect of the credibility of WMI as a shipowner but also the Parent Company WheelockMarden and Co. Ltd., as I have no doubt that it is with the Parent that CSSC considers, rightly or wrongly, they are dealing.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.17" class="para" id="p3.5.17">3.5.17</a> These two matters and many others were discussed at a lengthy WMI Board meeting on 9th February.  First, the chairman reported theWMI Group âwas facing serious cash flow difficultiesâ.  It was resolved to appoint Schroders &amp; Chartered Limited as financialadvisers to WMI.  Paul Banner (Mr. Banner) of S&amp;C joined the meeting.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.18" class="para" id="p3.5.18">3.5.18</a> Next, the meeting agreed to sell the shareholding in WM&amp;S to a subsidiary of HKR for HK$48 million, although WMI had had it valuedat $54.6 million.  The reduction was felt reasonable because a buy-back provision was to be deleted and because</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf WMS were extensively marketed it could also take some time before a buyer was located and it was essential that the sale takeplace for cash with the least possible delay.  Accordingly in view of the Companyâs urgent cash needs it was considered in theCompanyâs best interests to conclude the sale to Realty as soon as possible at the price of HK$48,000,000.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.19" class="para" id="p3.5.19">3.5.19</a> The meeting then went on to approve the sale of Fenlock and Inverlock to Beauforte at valuations of US$20.5 million and $20 million,a sale which would produce 8 to 9 monthsâ additional liquidity.  The meeting also agreed to sell another vessel, Manila Spirit,whose earnings were insufficient to cover debt repayments.  A price of US$10 million would almost wipe out the outstanding loan ofUS$10.1 million.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.20" class="para" id="p3.5.20">3.5.20</a> The meeting went on to consider a graph of the WMI Groupâs cash flow forecasts.  With the sale of WM&amp;S and two vessels, therewould be a cash deficit by June 1983 descending to US$83 million by December 1985.  If cancellation of two BW, two Dalian and twoSevilla newbuildings was included, together with a moratorium on principal repayments of the loans, there would be a deficit by August1984 which would reach US$14 million by December 1985.  (Summaries are at App. 2/6-7.)  Mr. Banner then</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âadvised that it appeared that the Groupâs bankers would have to be approached for a rescheduling of the Companyâs loans andthey would undoubtedly ask the shareholders to inject additional cash.  If the shareholders agreed the banks could be expected toco-operate, he said, but if the shareholders declined, then the banks would look at the cashflow forecasts and realise that by mid1984 interest payments which up to then had been paid could no longer be made.</p>        <p class="quote">The banks' attitude would, he said, be to ask the Group to reduce its cash outflows, to sell ships to reduce its debt and to negotiatecancellations, where feasible.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.21" class="para" id="p3.5.21">3.5.21</a> Mr. Banner re-emphasised this when the meeting then discussed Mr. Brothersâ memo on the Dalians.  According to the minutes, hesaid:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf an approach were to be made in the future to bankers for a moratorium on repayment of principal, then they would look very carefullyat any further cash payments out for anything other than reduction in loan principal.  They may, he felt, only agree to further paymentson the Dalian newbuildings on the basis that additional cash funds were injected and especially so because the contract price couldnot be justified in present market terms.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.22" class="para" id="p3.5.22">3.5.22</a> Mr. Brothers then explained the arrangements for the Manila Faith.  He said arrangements for the sale and lease-back to Orient Leasinghad been concluded subject to a letter of comfort from WM.  There would be a cash inflow of US$4.5 million on delivery.  It wouldtherefore be advantageous to take delivery as scheduled in April.  As to the Dalians, Mr. Brothers said the deferment he had negotiatedâwould not only give the Group breathing space but would also maintain its credibility with CSSCâ.  After discussion, the Boardapproved the Dalian arrangements.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.23" class="para" id="p3.5.23">3.5.23</a> At a board meeting later the same day, WMâs directors resolved that a subsidiary acquire WM&amp;S.  WM advanced HK$32 million toWMI against the sale.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.24" class="para" id="p3.5.24">3.5.24</a> At this time, WMI was being pressed for US$520,000.00 payable on the launch of Sevilla 260.  In a telex dated 11th February to Mr.Freeland in London, Mr. Brothers expressed the view that it would be appropriate to defer payment pending an overall settlement,although there was a long way to go before an agreement would be in sight.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.25" class="para" id="p3.5.25">3.5.25</a> Between 16th and 18th February, there was a meeting or meetings between Mr. Marden, Mr. Griffiths, Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung, Mr. Poonand Mr. Brothers, Mr. Shaw and Mr. Nicholson of Norton Rose, and Mr. Banner of S&amp;C.  Mr. Nicholson prepared a <u>note</u> of the meeting almost immediately.  Later, on 26th February he sent to Mr. Tipper a â<u>memorandum</u> setting out certain advice givenâ by JSM at the meetings.  There are differences between these 2 documents.  I do not attach anysignificance to this.  The documents fulfil different functions.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.26" class="para" id="p3.5.26">3.5.26</a> Paragraph 1 of the note reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âPeter Griffiths questioned whether WMI could dispose of a major asset when technically insolvent.  If the sale proceeded and thesale proceeds were disbursed to pay immediate creditors, he wondered whether WMI could be accused both of trading insolvently andfraudulent preference.  If WMI was to survive, it had to approach its bankers to agree a rescheduling of its loans and accordinglythis approach should be made immediately and in any event prior to the proposed sale of the âM.V. Fenlockâ and âM.V. Inverlockâ.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.27" class="para" id="p3.5.27">3.5.27</a> That paragraph is not included in the memorandum.  Both documents then record that Beauforteâs resources were reported to be insufficientfor the commitments.  The note adds a concern that if Allied got into financial difficulties, its directors might be accused of breachof duty.  The note and memorandum continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â4.  David Shaw said that, when the sale of the ships had originally been suggested, it formed the second part of a series of measuresthat if implemented would allow WMI to continue until September, 1983.  Although this period had subsequently been shortened untilJuly, 1983 the sale of the vessels could have been justified on the grounds that it permitted WMI to continue trading during theperiod in which it was negotiating a long term solution with its bankers and the directors were of the view that there was a reasonableprospect of meeting all the companyâs obligations if time were given by the bankers.  Now, however in the light of Wardleyâsadvice, it appeared that the sale of only one vessel might be possible and that the proceeds of this sale would only allow WMI topay its creditors as they fall due for a further period of three or four weeks.  Further difficulties which had emerged were thattwo of WMIâs bankers were unsecured and that it seemed unlikely that those banks that were well-secured on vessels would releasetheir vesselâs income to make interest payments to unsecured banks when capital repayments in respect of their own loans were outstanding.</p>        <p class="quote">5.  As had been discussed at the meeting on the previous day WMIâs Directors could properly sell one or both vessels despite WMIâspresent technical involvency if they believed there was a reasonable chance that agreement could be reached with the banks and thelong-term future of the Company secured.  However, in view of the potential difficulty with the unsecured banks and the fact thatthe sale of one vessel would only allow WMI to continue for a few more weeks, it was Mr. Shawâs advice that the banks should beapproached immediately and that the sale of the vessels should not proceed until such approach had been made.  In any event any saleproceeds should be retained and not disbursed in the payment of any one bank.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.28" class="para" id="p3.5.28">3.5.28</a> Mr. Griffiths then squashed any idea of a sale to Allied.  Mr. Brothers drew attention to the payment of principal due to BNP.  Itwas suggested BNP be asked to defer payment while S&amp;C completed their rescheduling proposals.  Both documents then record:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â9.  Mr. Shaw said that BNP should not be misled into believing that a payment was likely at the end of the deferment period.  Therisk of approaching BNP at this stage was that the other banks might hear of WMIâs difficulties before they themselves were approacheddirectly.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">10.  Mr. Leung asked what WMI should do in the event that it was agreed that no ships were sold.  Mr. Shaw advised that it was thenessential that every transaction to be entered into by WMI be considered carefully.  In particular no new credit should be incurredunless it was absolutely essential to preserve the assets (and there was a reasonable prospect of such credit being met).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.29" class="para" id="p3.5.29">3.5.29</a> The parentheses do not appear in the memorandum.  After discussion about approaching the banks and the need for a public announcement,the note continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â13.  Mr. Griffiths asked what WMIâs response would be if the banks asked whether Wheelock Marden was prepared to give the Companyany support.  It was stated that Wheelock Mardenâs attitude was that it was not prepared to inject further funds into such a partly-ownedcompany, and that it had always been made clear that WMI was an independent company.</p>        <p class="quote">14.  Mr. Shaw said that, if it was now decided not to sell a vessel and to approach the banks within the next few days and if thisled to the company getting into a liquidation situation at an early stage, there was a considerable risk that the return of advancepayment by Wheelock Marden to WMI in respect of the sale of Wheelock Marden &amp; Stewart would be challenged.  The sum of $32 millionhad been repaid to Wheelock Marden out of the $48 million received from Hongkong Realty.  Inevitably a liquidator or creditors ofWMI would argue that the sale had been made solely for the purpose of repaying an amount due to Wheelock Marden.  Mr. Shaw askedwhether the advance payment by Wheelock Marden could properly be regarded as having been taken over by, and thus credited to, HongkongRealty and that Hongkong Realty make the necessary reimbursement.  Mr. Leung replied that the payment by Wheelock Marden had, infact, been repaid directly by WMI as it had been a genuine prepayment and that this could be supported by internal memoranda andother evidence.  He was confident that although creditors might challenge the payment they would not be successful in establishingthat WMIâs motive in making the repayment was in any way incorrect.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.30" class="para" id="p3.5.30">3.5.30</a> Para. 13 does not appear in the memorandum.  As to para. 14, the details of the WM&amp;S sale are not important.  What is importantin that last paragraph, as far as ADS is concerned, are the references to liquidation and creditors.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.31" class="para" id="p3.5.31">3.5.31</a> A week later, on 25th February, Mr. Brothers telexed Mr. Edelmann to pursue the draw down of the loan on Sealock, which was stilldue for delivery on 17th March.  He said a moratorium of principal in respect of Marilock and Rangelock would be âa vital ingredientin providing the funds to enable us to draw down the credit for (Sealock)â.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.32" class="para" id="p3.5.32">3.5.32</a> On 18th February, Mr. Brothers had two meetings with the National Westminster Bank in Hong Kong which he hoped would advise and assistover WMIâs existing facility with the National Bank of North America (a subsidiary of Nat West), US$2 million of which was duefor renewal.  In the course of discussions, Mr. Brothers</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âstated that he was under very strict instructions that it should not be considered as part of any plan that there would be supportfrom the Parent Company.  Very definitely, WMI had to survive on its own resources.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.33" class="para" id="p3.5.33">3.5.33</a> On 23rd February, Mr. Banner of S&amp;C wrote to Mr. Tipper at WM to review the position in relation to WMI which had been code-namedâWarblerâ.  He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â2.  As agreed at our meeting on Monday evening, revised cash flows are being prepared on the basis of assumptions agreed by theWarbler Committee which reflect the most likely circumstances facing the Company.  In particular key assumptions were made relatingto the cancellation or rescheduling of newbuildings, without further cost to Warbler, and also the treatment of the outstanding loanto PacNorse.  On the basis of these assumptions it was agreed that cash flows would be prepared reflecting two differing financialscenarios.  The first and more optimistic scenario assumes a three year moratorium on loan principal repayments to banks.  The secondscenario assumes that lending banks will require all surplus income (after operating costs) to be applied to debt servicing liabilities. It was felt that the figures, particularly the second set, would give the Committee a real feel for the extent and timing of theâproblemâ and a basis for considering how the Company might trade its way out of the current situation.  This in turn will providethe basis for discussions with banks.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.34" class="para" id="p3.5.34">3.5.34</a> Mr. Banner then referred to a draft letter to be sent to WMIâs bankers and to various matters including the fundamental importanceof the newbuildings.  He continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<u>Presentation of adjusted Warbler balance sheet</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">This subject was discussed by the Committee on Monday evening and, in particular, WJLâs concern over presentation of this statementwas noted.  Unfortunately, and notwithstanding the fact that our whole approach to the banks will be slanted to cash flow considerations,the banks will require an adjusted asset statement.  Accordingly may I suggest its preparation be a matter for consideration by theCommittee.  In this context, the treatment of newbuildings and PacNorse - which together constitute the overwhelming ânegativeâadjustment - is of great importance.  I understand from David Shaw that the existence of such a pro-forma adjusted statement wouldnot require directors to consider âshutting the doorâ but does requires them to be ultra-sensitive when seeking new or extendedcredit.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and later</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âW<u>arbler parentâs support</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It has been made clear that our policy is that financial support is not available to Warbler from its parent.  However, this willinevitably become an issue with the banks particularly those who feel they have any recourse, albeit intangible by, say, a comfortletter, to the parent.  Accordingly I think it is important that the Company is well versed on its parentâs attitude.  It wouldbe most useful to have details of the intra-Group links that do exist such as provision of management, operating services and ofcourse loans, guarantees or other contingent liabilities.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.35" class="para" id="p3.5.35">3.5.35</a> The draft letter for bankers contained the sentence:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFurthermore, the Directors of WMI have been informed by WMIâs parent company, which is also a public company with responsibilitiesto its own public shareholders, that WMI should not consider that there can be any financial support for WMI from its parent company.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.36" class="para" id="p3.5.36">3.5.36</a> This sentence was deleted from the final version.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.37" class="para" id="p3.5.37">3.5.37</a> The draft also referred to an adjusted statement or balance sheet as at 31st December 1982 which showed net assets on a book-valuebasis as HK$571 million.  On a market value basis, however, there was a net deficiency of HK$50 million.  This was accounted for:by a reduction of approximately HK$77 million in the valuation of vessels; by removing the value of vessels under construction, amountingto $347 million; and by revaluing Pacnorse from $173 million to a liability of $76 million.  Reference to this statement was, however,also omitted from the final letter.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.38" class="para" id="p3.5.38">3.5.38</a> In the meantime, the delivery date for Sealock on 15th March was approaching.  Mr. Brothers had been endeavouring to arrange a saleand lease-back with Orion.  On 25th February, negotiations finally fell through.  One reason was that Orion required a categoricalassurance that WMI would remain in the business of shipping for the foreseeable future and be able to meet its commitments and indemnities. In his telex that day to RBC and Orion, Mr. Brothers said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThis is to confirm our telephone conversation last night when we agreed that with the time constraints on us it would be unfairto hold the March end lessors and that we therefore had no option but to abandon the lease.

In the meantime,the Manila Spirit was to be sold for a net price of US$9.9 million leaving a shortfall of US$325,000.00 on the outstanding loan.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.43" class="para" id="p3.5.43">3.5.43</a> At the end of the month, WMI produced a cash flow and graph for the period 1983 to 1992.  These documents do not exactly match. The graph dated 28th February (App. 2/8) showed the results of projections both with and without a moratorium.  With a moratorium,the maximum deficit would be US$25 million in January 1990 and a surplus of $2 million by December 1992.  Without a three-year moratoriumon repayments of principal, the maximum deficit was US$69 million in August 1989 falling to $17 million by December 1992.  The cashflow dated 1<sup>st</sup> March headed âsecured creditors without financingâ showed a surplus of US$81,000.00 in December 1992.  A further cash flow wasprepared on 3<sup>rd</sup> March for the period March 1983 to December 1992.  It covered only secured creditors.  With a three-year moratorium, the maximumdeficit was US$4 million up to December 1985 after which the deficit increased to $22 million in January 1989 returning to a surplusof $10 million by December 1992.  Without a moratorium, there would be a maximum deficit of US$60 million by April 1988 but a surplusof $3 million by December 1992.  Summaries of the 3rd March cash flows are at App. 2/9-12.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.44" class="para" id="p3.5.44">3.5.44</a> On 4th March, WMI sent out letters to its six secured bankers, BNP, Grindlays and Bank of Nova Scotia, Orion (otherwise RBC), Bankof America and LBI.  Mr. Brothers had meetings with Grindlays, Orion, BOA and LBI on the same day.  The letters stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âOn 8th February, 1983 I forwarded you a cash flow statement for Wheelock Maritime Finance International Limited (âWMIâ) thatwas based on the assumption that Wheelock Marden &amp; Stewart Limited and the vessels, m.v. âManila Spiritâ, the m.v. âInverlockâand the m.v. âFenlockâ, were to be sold by the beginning of March 1983.  Although we have sold Wheelock Marden &amp; StewartLimited and the âManila Spiritâ, the sales of the âInverlockâ and the âFenlockâ have not materialized and, as a result,WMI is now facing an immediate cash flow short-fall.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Under these circumstances and with no early improvement in the shipping market in sight, it is necessary for us to ask our eight lenderssecured on vessels to re-finance their existing credit facilities. ....</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">We have devised a proposal for debt re-financing which we consider is in the interest of the lenders as a whole, the success of whichis not dependent on any sales of vessels.  We are confident that with the support of our Bankers and on our conservative assumptionsregarding future charter rates, we will be able to continue our business throughout this period of depressed market conditions andat the same time be able to retain the ability to benefit from the revival in the shipping market in the future.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In essence, our proposal is as follows:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">1. All loan capital repayments are deferred for an agreed period.  We would suggest this period should be fixed for three years andduring this period, lenders will not seek to enforce repayment unless a material event of default occurs.  All other rights of thelenders will otherwise be preserved against their respective borrowers and guarantors.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2. All lenders receive interest in full throughout.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">3. In respect of newbuilding commitments and unsecured creditors, it is intended that separate and specific financing arrangementswill be made.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">4. During the three year re-financing period, the Company may wish to take advantage of market movements to sell some of its existingvessels.  It is also recognized that it is more difficult for lenders secured by older tonnage to accept a re-financing period ofthree years than for those secured by new vessels and we will consequently consult with lenders as to the appropriate time for disposalof such older tonnage.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">This proposal is being put to all mortgagees whose full and unanimous support, as well as the support of relevant creditors, is requiredfor its successful implementation.  Taking into account the serious cash position of WMI referred to earlier, we are advised thatit would be inappropriate to make further payments to our Bankers.  Nevertheless we do intend to continue with the payments of interestas and when they fall due pending successful outcome of our discussions.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.45" class="para" id="p3.5.45">3.5.45</a> The letter then referred to the cash flow and graph dated 3rd March and pointed out that these excluded newbuildings and unsecuredlenders.  It also enclosed a valuation of WMI vessels on both with-charter and charter-free basis.  In contrast with a book-valueof US$145 million, the with-charter-value was $132 million while a charter-free valuation was $100 million.  Outstanding commitmentson the vessels totalled US$111 million.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.46" class="para" id="p3.5.46">3.5.46</a> The WMI letter commented on the valuations:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAlthough we have prepared these valuations for your information, I believe it to be more appropriate to consider our proposal ona cash flow basis as the asset values are severely distorted by the currently depressed market.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.47" class="para" id="p3.5.47">3.5.47</a> The meetings held the same day were all friendly and gave WMI grounds for hope.  However, LBI made it clear that a demonstrationof parent support would be necessary.  Orion enquired about parent support.  Grindlays reminded Mr. Brothers that he had previouslyadvised them no such support would be forthcoming and enquired if the position remained the same.  A note of this meeting preparedby Mr. Brothers records that he:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âstated that the intention was still to find a solution to the problems without Parent Company support.  He considered that thereal problem however lay in arranging the financing for the newbuilding and unsecured creditors and he did not rule out that possiblysome support might be forthcoming in that area if it was essential.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.48" class="para" id="p3.5.48">3.5.48</a> At further meetings with some of these creditors over the next few days the emphasis was on support.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.49" class="para" id="p3.5.49">3.5.49</a> Mr. Brothers reported to the shipping committee on 16th March.  He said generally all banks were indicating a need for parent supportand that Wayfoong had told him that the HSBC, which had made certain unsecured facilities available to WMI in relation to Marilock,would not agree to the refinancing unless WM was prepared to support WMI.  The HSBC position was further confirmed by telephone on17th March when Mr. Brothers was told the bank wanted to see WM support and would then only support a one-year moratorium subjectto review.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.50" class="para" id="p3.5.50">3.5.50</a> The shipping committee held meetings frequently.  This was not difficult because the membersâ offices were in close proximity. The committee had met earlier on 9th March when Mr. Brothers reported on Pacnorse:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âJebsens had approached Amex with a proposal for Pacnorse to repurchase the vessels it had previously sold to and was now charteringfrom Grand Marine Holdings.  The charterhires, in todays terms, were very high and accordingly it was in Pacnorseâs interests toacquire the vessels.  Pacnorseâs proposal was to purchase at a price equal to the debt due on the vessels by Grand Marine to itsbankers (Amex, Midland Bank and National Bank of North America) by taking over these loans but on the basis that no repayments ofprincipal would be made for three years.  Amex, as the lead banker, had been conducting the negotiations with Jebsens and were provingto be extremely inflexible, so much so that Jebsens had had to advise Amex that unless they took a more realistic approach therewould be no alternative but to put Pacnorse into liquidation as the charters were jeopardising the companyâs continued existence. Amexâs response was now awaited.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.51" class="para" id="p3.5.51">3.5.51</a> Next day, Mr. Brothers in the course of his efforts to secure delivery of Sealock, wrote to BW.  In his telex he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âOur primary intention is and has always been to fulfil our overall contractual commitments.  You must have no doubt on this score. However the market is continuing on such a depressed level that basically we are not able to demonstrate to our bankers at thisparticular moment that we will be able to comply with their loan terms and conditions.  This is not so much a matter of asset valueas the banks appreciate (and so I hope does DSKF) that the present very low values are only a product of the actively depressed marketconditions prevailing but one of cash flow.  We cannot demonstrate today that we have other sources of earnings to meet the estimatedDLR3.5 million shortfall in the first yearâs operation and similarly frightening although hopefully lower amounts in years 2 +3.  This is why it is so critical for DSKF to be prepared in addition to granting a moratorium also to allow the cash so saved tobe released to our bankers.  I had thought I made this clear to [Mr. Edelmann] in my letter of 2nd March.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.52" class="para" id="p3.5.52">3.5.52</a> Later he said a WM guarantee was impossible and that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe crisis caused by the market is much greater than perhaps is generally appreciated and unfortunately the remedies accordinglyhave to be much more drastic.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.53" class="para" id="p3.5.53">3.5.53</a> WMI had contracted for cranes to be installed as extras on Sealock.  For this a loan of Â£1.76 million had been arranged in 1981with MMB.  This was repayable on 17th March 1983.  On 14th March MMB agreed to extend the period to 24th March because WMI had indicatedit could not pay on the due date.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.54" class="para" id="p3.5.54">3.5.54</a> On 18th March, the secured banks were sent a graph and cash flow covering newbuildings and unsecured creditors for the period March1983 to December 1992.  (App. 2/13-14).  It complemented the earlier cash flow of 3rd March.  The new cash flow assumed:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Repayment of unsecured creditors by ten equal semi-annual instalments;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) The Spanish newbuildings could be excluded;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) DSKF would agree a 3Â½ year deferment on principal for Sealock, Annalock and hull 912 and the U.S. dollar lenders would receiveequivalent Danish Kroner deposits;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) The Dalians would be deferred to January 1985;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5) The Manila Faith would be sold and leased back over ten years.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.55" class="para" id="p3.5.55">3.5.55</a> Before interest was applied, a deficit of US$18 million was projected for December 1992.  After providing for interest on the deficitfrom time to time, the deficit at that date would be $57 million, having reached $60 million the year before.  It is this cash flowwhich ADS say was not provided and which, had they seen it, would have materially affected their attitude.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.56" class="para" id="p3.5.56">3.5.56</a> Also on 18 March Mr. Brothers wrote to Mr. Tipper asking him to deal with Manila Faith loan documentation while he was away.  Heconcluded by saying:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âGenerally, subject to what David Shaw may say, I see no reason why we should not enter into this agreement with WWW provided wehave disclosed to them the fact that the Company is in negotiations with its bankers for a re-financing arrangement.  I have disclosedthis fact to them at my meeting in World-Wide Offices and I also make it very clear to all present that we would not be able to signthe agreement with Orient Leasing until the re-financing arrangements had been concluded.  If they advise, as they have done, thatthey still wish to go ahead with the arrangements then we have surely fulfilled our duty.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.57" class="para" id="p3.5.57">3.5.57</a> On 19th March, on the way to London for negotiations over the BW newbuildings, Mr. Brothers saw Mr. Ortiz-Patino in Switzerland. He brought Mr. Ortiz-Patino up-to-date on WMIâs position.  This prompted a startling telex from Mr. Ortiz-Patino a few days later(para. 3.5.68).</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.58" class="para" id="p3.5.58">3.5.58</a> While Mr. Brothers was away, Mr. Tipper corresponded with Mr. Banner about a difficulty being raised by BNP which had two outstandingloans.  One was secured on Fenlock and gave no problem.  The other loan for US$10 million was secured on three vessels, Golden Lotus,Golden Orchid and Regent Pimpernel, which were valued at US$10.4 million on a with-charter basis.  The vessels would, however, comeoff hire between 1984 and 1986.  Their without-charter valuation was only $6.6 million, so if there was a three-year moratorium,the BNP security would not cover the loan.  Mr. Brothers had proposed selling Regent Pimpernel so as to reduce the loan to US$6 million. On 22nd March, Mr. Banner wrote to Mr. Tipper saying:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âOne thing we want to avoid is immediate sales of most of Warblerâs existing fleet since a fundamental part of our proposal isthat Warbler is viable and can trade out of its present difficulties.  With this in mind, I have suggested two slight changes tothe draft letter such that your commitment to sell the vessel is effective some time during the refinancing period.  Since, for success,our proposals depend on a upturn in the shipping market during the refinancing period, to give this undertaking to BNP is not a majorconcession on Warblerâs part.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.59" class="para" id="p3.5.59">3.5.59</a> Mr. Banner suggested, instead, simply agreeing to sell Regent Pimpernel at some time.  He also suggested that any proposal by BNPto cross collateralise Fenlock should be resisted because the equity which still remained in Fenlock might be useful in negotiatingwith the unsecured lenders.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.60" class="para" id="p3.5.60">3.5.60</a> On 23rd March, Mr. Tipper was advised by HSBC that it would agree a three-year moratorium provided WM injected sufficient cash toenable WMI to meet its estimated deficit over the three-year period, that is about US$24 million.  Any surplus over actual requirementswould be used to repay banks.  If the amount injected proved insufficient, WM would be required to continue to support WMI as a goingconcern.  Mr. Tipper reported this to the shipping committee the next day.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.61" class="para" id="p3.5.61">3.5.61</a> On 24th March, Mr. Tipper wrote to Mr. Shaw for advice about Manila Faith which was now to be financed by a temporary loan of US$3.47million from WWW, to be repaid when the sale and lease-back with Orient Leasing was concluded.  Mr. Tipper said he had told WWS thatarrangements for that sale and lease-back had had to be put on hold until rescheduling had been agreed by the bankers.  He askedMr. Shaw to advise, inter alia:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthat WMI/Giant can safely enter into these loan documents notwithstanding that the loan constitutes new credit (albeit that thecommitment dated back to 8th February and orally before) provided that the lender makes the loan with the knowledge of WMIâs circumstances.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.62" class="para" id="p3.5.62">3.5.62</a> Mr. Shaw replied later.  However, on 6th April, Mr. Brothers submitted a memo about Manila Faith to the shipping committee.  He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThis vessel is due for delivery end April.  The documentation for a 10 year lease with Orient Leasing Corporation is presentlybeing prepared.  This is subject to a Letter of Comfort being given by Wheelock Marden which letter although it specifically statesthat it should not be construed as a guarantee does state that it is the intention of Wheelock Marden that Wheelock Maritime shouldcontinue in existence.  There is a WMI performance guarantee to World-Wide of the performance of its subsidiary.</p>        <p class="quote">Some $5 million surplus will be generated by the lease as the vessel is being acquired by OCL for $17 million and a substantial amounthas already been paid under the contract.  Accordingly, although the effect of the delivery will be positive cash-wise, this seemsa very good opportunity to investigate the possibility of keeping the vessel off the balance sheet and thereby avoid initially heavydepreciation charges.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.63" class="para" id="p3.5.63">3.5.63</a> In the interim, on 29th March, a measure of concern was generated at WMI upon receipt of a letter from Grindlays declaring an eventof default upon the admission by WMI in its earlier letter to its bankers, in which it proposed a three-year moratorium, of its inabilityto pay its debts as they matured.  Fortunately, it was withdrawn once it was pointed out to Grindlays that it would trigger off defaultson other loans to the WMI Group.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.64" class="para" id="p3.5.64">3.5.64</a> So many events were now happening so fast it is surprising that anyone was able to keep track.  Mr. Brothers had been moving heavenand earth to solve the Sealock problem (see Part 6).  As a precaution, however, he also asked WMIâs solicitors, Norton Rose, aboutcancellation of the four Spanish and three BW hulls.  In relation to the Spanish ships, he produced a list of defects in relationto Sestao 260 Odinlock as a possible basis for rejection.  These defects struck the solicitors as of a minor nature requiring technicalconsultation to see if they would entitle the buyer to reject.  As to the BW ships, advice from Danish lawyers indicated, unsurprisingly,that BW would be entitled to compensation for all direct expenses.  Additionally, on 30 March Mr. Nicholson asked Mr. Freeland ofNorton Rose for his views on cancellation of these newbuildings.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.65" class="para" id="p3.5.65">3.5.65</a> On 30th March, Mr. Brothers produced for the shipping committee a review of WMIâs current status.  (App. 3/3).  He emphasised theurgency of the situation and the need for WM support which he suggested be a 12 month credit line of US$5m.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.66" class="para" id="p3.5.66">3.5.66</a> On 30th March, Mr. Tipper wrote to Mr. Reynolds of S&amp;C with a draft letter for the secured banks which indicated that the requestfor a moratorium would now be for 12 months.  The draft letter continued</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWheelock Marden &amp; Co. Ltd. have confirmed that they will provide support to enable the WMI Group to meet their anticipatedUS$7 million shortfall to 31st March 1984 as indicated in the âblueâ and âgreenâ cash flow forecasts previously suppliedto you.  This support is conditional upon the WMI Group being able to reach simultaneous agreement with both secured and unsecuredcreditors that the refinancing proposals are acceptable to all parties.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.67" class="para" id="p3.5.67">3.5.67</a> That paragraph was an unwarranted assumption.  Nonetheless, it is an insight into the thinking of someone who was close to the centreof things.  It is âhowâ or âwhenâ rather than âifâ.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.68" class="para" id="p3.5.68">3.5.68</a> At the end of March, Mr. Ortiz-Patino came to Hong Kong where he met and was briefed by Mr. Marden, Mr. Lees and Mr. Leung on WMI. He was concerned about progress and the apparent lack of control being exercised over Mr. Brothers.  On 31st March, Mr. Leung andMr. Lees received a telex from Mr. Ortiz-Patino which set out in strong and forthright terms his concern for the situation and thesteps he thought should be taken (App. 3/5).</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.69" class="para" id="p3.5.69">3.5.69</a> Mr. Brothers responded on 6th April at some length (App. 3/8).

This would assist the Board in considering what request to make to WM for support.  A numberof drafts were prepared.  The final report was submitted on about 8th April.  There is a summary at App. 3/18.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.71" class="para" id="p3.5.71">3.5.71</a> Some passages from the report should be reproduced.  On the basis of the cash flow, the report concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â23.   Whilst the cash flow projections indicate that there is no cash requirement for the next three years on the basis that thelenders support the moratorium on principal loan repayments, the monthly cash balances fall close to nil.  Bearing in mind the difficultyin making projections of this kind, we consider it important for WMI to negotiate a stand-by facility of, say, US$2 million whichcan be called upon in need.  This will not be possible with a commercial bank and accordingly WMI should seek such a facility fromits parent company.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.72" class="para" id="p3.5.72">3.5.72</a> After examining the internal solutions being considered by WMI, the report dealt with the rescheduling proposal and commented:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â27.   There are at present in Hong Kong rescheduling proposals in respect of many companies before banks, some that have been madepublic but many that have not.  In most if not all such cases the controlling shareholders and management do not have the confidenceof the banks, either because of suspected misconduct or mismanagement.  The position of WMI is completely different in that WMI ispart of the Wheelock Marden Group, whose reputation is long-established, and because there is no suggestion of mismanagement.  WMIis clearly seen to be caught in a severe downturn in the shipping cycle of which banks are generally aware.  Nevertheless, howeversympathetic and keen to support a member of the Wheelock Marden Group the banks may be, they are likely to withhold support for reschedulingproposals unless the proposals in some way improve their security.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">28.   The proposals put before lenders call for a three year moratorium of repayments of loan principal.  This is a long period toask for and banks will be reluctant to commit themselves for so long a period.  An alternative is to seek a shorter moratorium (witha minimum of one year) which would be easier to negotiate with the banks but would not be as advantageous to WMI.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.73" class="para" id="p3.5.73">3.5.73</a> Of parent company support the report said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â30. We therefore consider that the banks will not support the rescheduling proposals without parent company support and yet wealso believe that in the absence of such support, particularly in view of the group of companies of which WMI is part, they couldtake no direct action so long as interest is kept current.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">31. This uncertainty is, however, extremely damaging for WMI.  It is difficult to see how it could properly function and continueoperations.  All its borrowings would be not only immediately repayable but also in default.  Its secured lenders would be in a positionto take over all its ships immediately at any time.  Ordinary trade creditors would be reluctant to extend further credit and anynew financing would not be possible.  Depending on the fluctuating values of its ships it would have a negative net worth.  Whetheror not it could continue trading as a going concern is uncertain.  Shareholders would need to be informed and trading in its shareswould have to be suspended.  Consequently we consider that it is essential for WMI to seek immediate parent company support in orderto secure a binding agreement with its lenders for as long a period of time as possible so that it can continue with its normal business.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.74" class="para" id="p3.5.74">3.5.74</a> The report then suggested four ways in which support could be given:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1) Immediate cash injection,</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2) Guarantee of any shortfall on loans,</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>3) A binding letter of comfort to inject sufficient funds to enable WMI to meet its obligations,</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>4) A non-binding letter of comfort.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.75" class="para" id="p3.5.75">3.5.75</a> After examining the merits of each method, the report concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â41.

In the course of discussion</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMr. Patrick Poon queried what the companyâs next move would be if support was not forthcoming and in reply, Mr. Reynolds advisedthat it was important to look at paragraph 34 showing the lenders who expected to get a comfort letter from the parent company. In Mr. Reynoldâs opinion, shipping values were of critical importance and although there was little concern about shipping valuesin aggregate it would be a different matter if shipping values were to fall.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Mr. Reynolds went on to say that if a legally binding comfort letter were not forthcoming from the parent company and there appearedto be no third party available to provide equity funding or support then the only alternative was to approach lenders to advise thatsupport would not be forthcoming because the parent company had the interests of its own shareholders to consider.  He suggestedthat such a statement should be supported by a resolution of the Directors of the parent company to demonstrate that the matter hadbeen duly considered.  Lenders would then be requested to reschedule the loans but it was unlikely, he said, they would agree toreschedule for as long as 3 years.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">General discussions then followed on the chances of the success of such an approach to lenders and it was noted that lenders werecurrently under a lot of pressure from rescheduling proposals and it was unlikely they would be willing to agree to any moratoriumproposals unless there was an opportunity for them to improve their position.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">After general discussion, Mr. W. J. Lees proposed that a formal approach be made to the parent company on the basis of the four conclusionsreached in S&amp;Câs report referring specifically however to the fact that the legally binding comfort letter would refer to deficiency. Mr. Shaw pointed out that the form of the comfort letter to be given by the parent company was important in that it was in the natureof âtop upâ was significant in that lenders would have to exhaust all their other alternatives before calling upon the parentcompany.â  (The sense of this awkward passage is clear)</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMr. Shaw went on to say that the ability of the Group to continue trading depended on there being a reasonable prospect of resolvingthe cash flow problems and being able to meet all its debts and obligations at some time in the future.  The discussions to datehad indicated that some form of agreement could be reached with lenders and accordingly there could be said to be such reasonableprospect.  If however, he said, the company did not get support from whatever source and lenders refused to reschedule the companyâsloans then the Board would have to reconsider the overall position since if there ceased to be such a reasonable prospect the Companywould not be able to incur new credit.  Timing was of the essence.  The market was awaiting the announcement of the Groupâs 1982results and if no agreement were reached with lenders in the immediate future, Directors would be under an obligation to announceto shareholders the extent of the Groupâs problems and the attitude of its lenders.  Such an announcement would, in his opinion,be most damaging to the Group.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">After general discussion, it was agreed that a formal approach be made to the parent company immediately with a view to conveninga further Board Meeting as soon as the parent company has responded, hopefully early the following week.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.87" class="para" id="p3.5.87">3.5.87</a> Mr. Lees then advised the meeting that it was not possible to proceed with the proposed sale and lease of Manila Faith because OrientLeasing required a letter of comfort stating that WMI would be maintained in its present form.  Instead, the possibility of WWW makingfinance available was being explored.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.88" class="para" id="p3.5.88">3.5.88</a> On the same day, a formal letter signed by Mr. Brothers was sent to WM enquiring whether WM was prepared to support WMI in the mannerrecommended by S&amp;C.  The letter emphasised that the letter of comfort would be in the nature of a âtop upâ and concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âYou will note that in the context of paragraph 41(iv), Schroders and Chartered anticipate that âany possible payments (underthe comfort letter) would not be required until 1986â.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">You will readily appreciate that it is imperative that we receive your response to this request as soon as possible and accordinglywe should be grateful if you would advise us of your position as a matter urgency.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.89" class="para" id="p3.5.89">3.5.89</a> Meanwhile, it seems that behind-the-scenes moves to solve WMIâs problems were taking place.  Mr. Marden was contemplating the purchaseof the WMI shares from WM.  This appears rather cryptically in telexes dated 20th April from the managing directors to Mr. Griffiths(which was never sent, Mr. Griffiths was advised by telephone) and to Mr. Ortiz-Patino advising that a proposal to support WMI wouldbe considered at the WM Board meeting the following week.  The telex to Mr. Ortiz-Patino said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â3. Syndicate to purchase 35 percent interest in WMI from WM seems probable but still awaiting final confirmation subject to detailswhich expect to have finalized prior to board meeting.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">4. Schroders and Chartered have advised they willing to act to advise WM on sale of WMI shares to syndicate and state they have noconflict of interest.  Accordingly intend Schroders and Chartered should be so appointed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.90" class="para" id="p3.5.90">3.5.90</a> S&amp;C, who were retained to advise WM on this matter, went to the length of preparing a time-table dated 26th April.  However,events overtook this proposal which was replaced, no doubt after discussion between Mr. Marden and Mr. Cheung, by a proposal thatHKR would invest up to US$12 million in WMI.  Consequently, the WM Board meeting on 27th April, at which WMIâs request was themain item for consideration, was relatively short.  Mr. Marden as Chairman said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe position of Wheelock Maritime was, he said, clearly critical and in the light of this situation a decision as to whether ornot further support should be given was urgently needed.  During the course of discussions over the last 2 days it had, however,emerged, he said, that the Hongkong Realty &amp; Trust Company, Limited Group (âHongkong Realtyâ) might be interested in makingan investment in Wheelock Maritime and committing funds for that purpose.  In those circumstances, it would seem appropriate, theChairman said, to have immediate discussions with Hongkong Realty to see what it might be prepared to do.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.91" class="para" id="p3.5.91">3.5.91</a> Mr. Cheung was present at this meeting as alternate director for Mr. Poon, and Mr. Hsu was also alternate for Mr. Griffiths.  Mr.Griffiths apparently had given instructions that Mr. Hsu should vote against any measure for giving assistance to WMI (see para.3.5.110).</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.92" class="para" id="p3.5.92">3.5.92</a> The Board approved a proposal to initiate such discussions and to appoint Wardley Limited as WMâs advisers in relation to any specificproposals made by HKR.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.93" class="para" id="p3.5.93">3.5.93</a> In the meantime, on 21st April, WWS offered help with Manila Faith by way of a loan from WWW to Giant for the balance of the purchaseprice plus interest, repayable by 12 monthly instalments commencing one month after delivery.  Glamorgan and WMI would be guarantors. The terms and conditions, however, proved unacceptable.  Mr. Brothers telexed WWS on 27th April to confirm WMI would seek alternativearrangements and on 28th April confirmed that Giant would pay the third instalment.  The idea of a sale and lease-back with OrientLeasing was revived.  Following a telephone call by Mr. Cameron on 28th April, following up his letter of 18th April, Mr. Nicholsonof JSM replied on 29th April.  In his letter, Mr. Nicholson said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1) Given the recent discussions concerning Wheelock Maritime International Limited (âWMIâ) and in particular the likely decisionof the WM Board not to support WMI, I cannot see how WM can state that it intends to âmaintain the corporate existence of WMI ....whereby it can conduct its business substantially as now being conductedâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2) Similarly the fact that there is now some prospect that WM may relinquish control of WMI almost certainly precludes it from statingthat it intends âto hold voting control of WMI during the period of the lease transactionâ.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.94" class="para" id="p3.5.94">3.5.94</a> Hardly surprisingly, Mr. Cameron on 3rd May advised the shipping committee he could not process the matter further with Orient Leasing. He said he had spoken to Mr. Nicholson who had emphasised that, apart from misrepresentation, there might be âother more seriousoffences - e.g. fraudulent obtaining of funds etc.â</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.95" class="para" id="p3.5.95">3.5.95</a> On 2nd May, the HKR Board met to consider the possibility of an investment in WMI.  Amongst others, Mr. Marden, Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung,Mr. Cheung, Mr. Poon and Mr. Tipper were present.  A committee of four, including Mr. Tipper and Mr. Cheung, was appointed to dealwith the proposal, conduct any negotiations and make any arrangements necessary.  EAW were appointed as financial advisers.  Theminutes finally recorded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<u>INVESTMENT IN GROUP COMPANY:</u></p>        <p class="quote">It was resolved that there was no objection as a matter of policy to the Company considering or making any investment in another companycontrolled by Wheelock Marden &amp; Company Limited, provided that the investment was appropriate on normal commercial criteria andconsidered to be in the interests of the shareholders of the Company, taken as a whole.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.96" class="para" id="p3.5.96">3.5.96</a> On 6th May, the shipping committee met and approved a formal letter to be sent to HKR about the proposed investment and a letterto be sent to secured lenders seeking agreement in principle to a three-year moratorium.  The letter to lenders was sent out thatday.  It stated that following discussions with HKR</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âan understanding has been reached.  HK Realty is now considering making an equity related cash investment of up to US$12 millionin WMI over a period of three years.  In addition to certain other conditions this investment is subject to the WMI Groupâs lendersagreeing to the rescheduling proposals in a form acceptable to HK Realty whereby no principal would be repayable over the next threeyears.  Since the terms presently being discussed between ourselves and HK Realty may involve the issue of new equity, the proposalswill also need to be conditional on WMI shareholders approving this cash injection at an Extraordinary General Meeting to be convenedonce documentation is finalized.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.97" class="para" id="p3.5.97">3.5.97</a> HKR learnt of this letter and took exception to the wording âan understanding has been reachedâ.  They required WMI to send allrecipients a copy of WMIâs formal letter to HKR which read:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt should be made clear that the above does not represent any legal obligation and that HK Realty and WMI would only become legallybound as and when formal legal documentation is agreed and executed and all necessary approvals are obtained.  It follows thereforethat creditors should not act in reliance on this letter.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.98" class="para" id="p3.5.98">3.5.98</a> On the same day, Mr. Brothers held a further round of meetings with the banks to discuss the letter he had sent them.  He began withBNP.  His note of the meeting records that Miss Tse of BNP</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âsuggested that these arrangements still looked to her very similar to the proposals that Wardley had put to the GMH (Grand MarineHoldings) creditors.  It was unfair to expect all creditors to be treated in the same way.  RJFB responded that whereas it was truethat the plan by Wardley for GMH had failed on this point, if the banks could not reached (sic) agreement then liquidation was inevitableand surely this was also not something that BNP would want to see happen.  He felt that by approaching the banks with a very straight-forwardscheme whereby the banks preserved all their rights and merely assisted the WMI Group over a difficult period, there was the greatestchance of a successful outcome.  If in fact the banks could not agree on this straight-forward approach then clearly a meeting wouldbe necessary.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In all events, RJFB felt that it was most important to try to obtain âagreement in principleâ by the end of next week in orderto avoid the company incurring damaging publicity.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.99" class="para" id="p3.5.99">3.5.99</a> Next, Mr. Brothers met Wayfoong and Grindlays.  At the latter meeting, he learned BNS were still being negative and there was emphasisedto him:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthe importance that the US$12 million be a firm commitment for any of the Banks to be prepared to go along with the proposals.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.100" class="para" id="p3.5.100">3.5.100</a> BOA indicated that they preferred a rescheduling of only 12 months even if it meant a smaller equity injection.  Next day, Orionwere negative about a three-year moratorium because part of their security was in the form of a good charter.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.101" class="para" id="p3.5.101">3.5.101</a> On 9th May, Mr. Brothers wrote to the two unsecured creditors, NBNA and RBS, setting out the position in relation to HKR and thesecured creditors and asking these two banks to term out their existing facilities but with no repayment of principal for 36 months.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.102" class="para" id="p3.5.102">3.5.102</a> On 10th May, at the shipping committee, Mr. Brothers reported on negotiations for the sale of three older vessels to Iran at US$2.4million net each.  In fact, agreements were signed on 16th May.  The sales took place between May and August 1983 and netted US$2.4million per vessel which was applied in reducing Grindlaysâ facilities.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.103" class="para" id="p3.5.103">3.5.103</a> Because of WMIâs problems and the steps being contemplated, it was accepted that a press announcement was necessary.  Followinga shipping committee meeting on 11th May, Mr. Brothers approached the secured banks seeking their approval for saying âbroad agreementin principleâ to a moratorium had been indicated.  BOA would only agree to words âpositive discussionsâ or similar.  Mr. Brothersânote then records that he:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âfelt that the manner in which Bank of America were approaching the issue would inevitably lead to a crisis position.  He citedthe bankâs suggestion of a Trust Fund, the proposal for Creditorsâ Meetings and the insistance for outside money to come intothe Group.  RJFB stated that it may well be that such a course was inevitable but in finding the solution WMI could well be tornto shreds.  Bank of America accepted that this was the case but could see no alternative.  They were in a good position in that theyhad both asset and earnings cover and they did not see why this should be utilised for the benefit of other creditors.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.104" class="para" id="p3.5.104">3.5.104</a> BOA also enquired if WM would give a guarantee for a shorter period of one year.  Mr. Brothers said it was out of the question atwhich BOA</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âremarked on the inequality of being asked to support the Group if the Parent Company itself did not have sufficient confidenceto invest.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.105" class="para" id="p3.5.105">3.5.105</a> Wayfoong indicated it would also prefer âdiscussionsâ.  Grindlays simply advised that BNS, its joint lender, would not considerany rescheduling but in the light of the proposed sale of three ships and the reduction in debt they themselves might pay principalto BNS when due.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.106" class="para" id="p3.5.106">3.5.106</a> On the same day, WWS were asked to approached the Hudong yard and seek to defer delivery for one month while financial arrangementswere made.  The request was refused on 16th May.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.107" class="para" id="p3.5.107">3.5.107</a> The shipping committee met again on 16th May.  It considered a memorandum of agreement of the revised terms for the Dalians whichMr. Brothers had negotiated.  It agreed it would not be possible to sign for the time being.  It also discussed Manila Faith andnoted that the Orient Leasing sale and lease-back could not be finalized until loan rescheduling was complete so that WMI could nottake delivery.  It agreed to make alternative proposals to the Hudong yard.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.108" class="para" id="p3.5.108">3.5.108</a> These proposals were made at a meeting on 18th May between Mr. Brothers, Mr. Lee and a representative of the yard at which Mr. Brothersexplained the Groupâs âilliquid positionâ and that rescheduling could take up to three months.  The proposals were to deferdelivery for up to three months with compensation; or for delivery to take place against temporary financing by the yard which wouldreceive the earnings of the vessel, a first mortgage and a WMI guarantee.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.109" class="para" id="p3.5.109">3.5.109</a> On 19th May, WMI(UK) wrote to Mr. Cameron to remind him that on 13th July US$1.8 million and interest of US$887,000.00 was payableto LBI on the Rangelock loan, a sum which could not be paid by WMI(UK) out of charter-hire.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.110" class="para" id="p3.5.110">3.5.110</a> On the same day, Mr. Lees received a telex from Mr. Griffiths which read:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI refer to my telex to Ray Tipper dated 12th April last.

He reported a net loss for the Group of HK$863,246.00 for1982 compared with a profit of HK$85 million for the previous year.  After including all items there was a profit of HK$15 millionagainst HK$147 million for 1981.  He attributed this to very low charter rates and also high interest rates.  However, there hadbeen a general increase in charter rates of some 20% since the end of 1982.  But although there were some positive indications âacomplete return to profitability will still be some way offâ.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.112" class="para" id="p3.5.112">3.5.112</a> The report said WMI was operating 19 vessels.  Three more were to be delivered in 1983, i.e. Rangelock, Sealock (these had alreadybeen delivered) and Manila Faith.  The Dalians were to be deferred to 1985 while discussions over cancellation of the four Spanishvessels were taking place.  The report also stated that second-hand prices had risen by up to 50% and newbuildings prices had alsorisen.   On Pacnorse, Mr. Brothers reported a loss of US$4.7 million against a profit of US$7 million the previous year.  Steps werebeing taken to protect this investment and improve liquidity.  In particular, Pacnorse would repurchase eight bulk-carriers soldto Grand Marine, which was in liquidation, at prices equal to the outstanding debt totalling US$96 million.  There would be minimalrepayments of principal for two years.  The cancellation of the charters would improve cash flow.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.113" class="para" id="p3.5.113">3.5.113</a> Finally, Mr. Brothers reported that because of the problems an application had been made to WM for â a deficiency guarantee inan amount of US$10 millionâ.  He concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â In the meantime, the Group is maintaining sufficient liquidity to fund its operations although pending completion of its re-schedulingarrangements it has stopped making principal repayments on its outstanding loans.

Sestao 260 would be cancelled, as the latest delivery date of 14th April 1983 had not been met (although accordingto a telex and letter of 4<sup>th</sup> May to AESA, the owner of the Spanish yards, sent by the owner Hillwood and signed by Mr. Brothers, in which Hillwood gave noticeof an intention to reject, the last day for delivery was 3rd May).  It was hoped to cancel Sestao 261.

Following a question from Mr. W. J. Lees, Mr. Brothers advisedthat some $661.6 million of that amount related to the Spanish vessels, $55 million having already been paid on those vessels.  Afterfurther general discussion on the accounts, Mr. W. J. Lees proposed that efforts should also be made to remove the phrase â excessof current liabilities over current assetsâ from the Auditorsâ Report.  In this context, Long Term notes amounting to $169,558,907were scheduled to be sold following discontinuation of the original leasing proposal and could possibly be reclassified as CurrentAssets if necessary to achieve the amendment in the Auditorsâ Report.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">After general discussion on the accounts it was resolved that the Report of the Directors and audited accounts for the year ended31st December 1982 be and are hereby approved.

After reporting the financial results, it read:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â As a result of the severe decline in vesselsâ earnings due to the extremely depressed state of the shipping market, the Grouphas encountered liquidity problems.  The Directors are considering appropriate methods for alleviating these problems.  In this context,discussions have been initiated with Hongkong Realty and Trust Company Limited (â HK Realtyâ) as to a possible commitment byHK Realty of up to US$12,000,000 to the Group over a period of three years.  In addition to certain other conditions, the proposalswould be conditional on certain of the Groupâs lenders agreeing to a deferment of existing loan repayments.  The Company is indiscussion with these lenders regarding such arrangements.

After dealingwith the form of such guarantees Mr. Shaw said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â There remains the question of whether, in current circumstances it is proper for WMI to enter into such guarantees.  As previouslyadvised, WMI may only continue trading if there is a reasonable prospect that it will at some future date be able to meet all itsobligations.  At present, proposals are under consideration, and discussions are taking place with bankers, designed to lead to asituation where WMI will be able to meet its immediate obligations and to put itself in a position where there is a reasonable prospectthat it will be able to meet all obligations at some future date.  It is our understanding that, based on the information availableto the Directors of WMI, there is a reasonable prospect of agreement with bankers and others being reached on the above lines.  Onthat basis, WMI may continue to trade and incur fresh credit.  However, care must be taken in incurring fresh credit, not least becausein the case of substantial new borrowings or other commitments it would be wrong to mislead any lender as to WMI Groupâs currentfinancial position.  In the case of Wayfoong Shipping Services Limited and Marine Midland Bank N.A. we understand that both banksare, as stated above, aware of the WMI groupâs present difficulties but are nevertheless prepared to extend loan facilities.  Accordingly,we do not see how such banks could complain as to the propriety of WMI giving guarantees and generally we consider that it is properfor WMI to enter into such guarantees, provided that the Directors of WMI continue to take the view that there is a reasonable prospectthat it will at some future date be able to meet all its obligations.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.119" class="para" id="p3.5.119">3.5.119</a> This letter was copied to Mr. Poon who had been concerned about the guarantee to HSS (para. 3.5.77).

It was reported that minority shareholders in HKR wereconcerned about using HKRâs cash to help sick affiliates and would be taking the matter up at a general meeting.  The AGM of HKRwas held on 25th May at which minority shareholders did raise their concerns.  The meeting was chaired by Mr. Marden who confirmedthat an EGM would be convened to consider the proposal to invest US$12 million in WMI.  A solicitor for some minorities asked foran assurance that WM Group shares would not be voted and that directors of WM and WMI on the HKR Board would not vote.

The loan would be repayable three months after draw down,WWW having declined a request for six months.  WMI was to guarantee the loan on behalf of Giant upon which legal advice was beingtaken.  As collateral, Glamorganâs dividend for 1982 would when paid be applied to reduce the loan then outstanding.  Deliverywould take place on 31st May.  On the same day as the meeting, WWW advised Mr. Brothers that they had telexed CSTC for confirmationthat US$12.19 million would be payable on delivery.

WMIâs guarantee would require full disclosure which would pose difficulties in view of on-going negotiationswith lenders and the yard.  Further, the agreement for WMI to purchase the shares in Giant from WWW had never been signed althoughthe shares had subsequently been transferred to WMI.  It was agreed to take advice.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.125" class="para" id="p3.5.125">3.5.125</a> Norton Rose gave written advice on 27th May.  They advised that, whether the agreement contained a guarantee or indemnity, it wasprobably enforceable by WWW against WMI in the event of default by Giant of its obligations under the ship-building contract.  Nonetheless,they felt that the proposed arrangement for WMI to give a guarantee for the WWW loan and to assign the Glamorgan dividend was justifiable. They concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA final caveat must however here be raised.  This is that the directors of WMI must be satisfied that in entering into the guaranteeor assigning the (WWW) dividend WMI is not carrying on business with intent to defrand its creditors or for any fraudulent purpose,otherwise they run the risk of being personally liable for the debts of WMI under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s275.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 275</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>.

Later, on 22 June, notice cancelling 261 was given.  However, efforts continued to try and resolve the positionin relation to all the Spanish vessels without any cancellations.  Advice was taken from the brokers Clarksons who had negotiatedbetween WMI and AESA and who on 3rd June advised that, having regard to current newbuilding prices, replacement costs for Sestaoand Sevilla vessels would be US$17 million and 14.5 million respectively, and that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Our opinion of possible cash on delivery resale price for your vessels would be approx USD14.5 and USD12.5 million (44,000/35,000tdw types respectively)</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(Best) price would no doubt be obtained by â quietâ marketing to govt or govt sponsored buyers such as Indian or Iranian.

Advice was obtained on about 14th June.  It was complex but in essenceindicated that the other Sestao vessel could probably be rejected but not the Sevilla vessels.  Counsel suggested the companies purchasingthe Sevilla vessels might be liquidated.  However, Mr. Brothers was putting in a great deal of work behind the scenes and, on thebasis of the valuations obtained, there was a hope that rather than cancellation a substantial reduction in price of all four vesselsmight be negotiated.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.129" class="para" id="p3.5.129">3.5.129</a> Meanwhile, on 31st May, advice was sought from Mr. Shaw about the Dalians and the request for the second instalment.

However, it seems to have become refined into a straightforward retention account whereby for three years each securedlender would receive the earnings of the vessel constituting its security, release operating expenses and, after deducting interestand principal, release any balance to WMI. </p>    <p><a name="p3.5.132" class="para" id="p3.5.132">3.5.132</a> Mr. Reynolds and his team began a round of meetings to discuss the new scheme with secured and unsecured lenders on 9th June.

Mr. Brothers advised that WMI would have difficulty in paying interestdue to LBI on 13th July out of its own resources, the hire payable by Aquaship to WMI (UK) having been returned to WMI for generaluse.  It was agreed to take no action but wait for WM to pay under its guarantee and call on WMI under the counter-guarantee.  Beforeor after this meeting, because the letter was undated, Mr. Graham received from Mr. Thorne of Norton Rose a draft letter to be sentto WM warning it of the problem and suggesting that it would be in everyoneâs interest for WM simply to advance the necessary hireto Aquaship rather than to allow LBI to make a call under the guarantee.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.134" class="para" id="p3.5.134">3.5.134</a> On 20th June, Mr. Cameron wrote to PMM about the 1982 annual accounts.

He concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â.... unless there are very special circumstances, it will be the policy of â WMâ not to pledge continued financial supportfor any subsidiaries.

The letter of comfort required confirmation by WMI â that it is our intentionto ensure payment by the borrower ... â.  Legal advice, however, was that WMI should not give such a letter.  Instead, Mr. Shawapproved a letter containing the wording â it would be our intention insofar as we are able to assist to ensure the payment bythe borrower ...â, which would on conclusion of rescheduling be substituted by the original wording.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.136" class="para" id="p3.5.136">3.5.136</a> On 24th June, S&amp;C followed up their earlier meetings with the secured banks with a letter formally setting out their poolingor retention proposal which they recommended to commence on 1st July.  Those banks which had already been retaining earnings wereasked to return earnings which represented principal payments in order to ensure equality of treatment.  S&amp;C then met the variousbanks on 29th and 30th June.  Wayfoong made clear:  that there must first be an injection of cash by HKR, which should not be repayablewithin three years and only then if WMIâs financial position would not be imperilled; that all banks must join in; and that theremust be no further acquisitions.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.137" class="para" id="p3.5.137">3.5.137</a> BNP, which was well covered, agreed in principle provided that it could retain all earnings and subject to a guarantee by WM to securethe outstanding loan, or an injection of US$12 million as permanent working capital.  Orion appeared to be non-committal.  BOA requiredtangible shareholdersâ support otherwise it would liquidate the vessel.  It was not prepared to return earnings retained so farand thought the scheme should operate from year to year.  Grindlays indicated US$12 million was a necessary condition and even thendoubted if it could agree to a three-year scheme.  Further, BNS would not join the scheme and Grindlays were not prepared to takethem over.  Grindlays would, however, ask BNS to defer the payment due on 7th July and said they would like to see World Rainbowsold soon, meanwhile using excess hire against the loan.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.138" class="para" id="p3.5.138">3.5.138</a> The shipping committee met on 1st July.  Mr. Banner reported on his meetings with the banks.  Mr. Brothers felt that possibly thebanks had not understood the scheme and proposed a simplified version be put to them to regain their goodwill.  He tabled a paper. This seems to have varied what S&amp;C had told the banks about pre-retention account earnings.  Mr. Brothers said these could beretained and applied in reduction of outstanding loans.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.139" class="para" id="p3.5.139">3.5.139</a> Mr. Brothers and Mr. Banner met BNP on 4th July, with some success.  BNP accepted the scheme in principle but emphasised the importanceof WM Group support.  Mr. Brothers reported he had no information on the proposed injection of US$12 million cash.  But on 5th July,BOA confirmed by letter that the proposal contained in the letter of 24th June was unacceptable.  It offered three proposals fora one-year moratorium, the basis of each proposal essentially being the provision of security in the sum of US$4 million.  And ina letter to Mr. Brothers that day Mr. Banner reviewed the position of the banks and concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Although this could be construed as an initial negotiating position derived from the fact that the banks know the balance sheetstrength of Wheelock Marden and Hong Kong Realty, there is no doubt in my mind that we will not obtain the approval of all banksto the restructuring scheme without some shareholder support.

This conclusion, contained in paragraph 41 (iii) of thatreport, stated â we do not believe that support for such a rescheduling proposal from the lenders will be forthcoming without certainsupport from WMIâs parent companyâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.140" class="para" id="p3.5.140">3.5.140</a> On 4th July WMI received a reminder from WMI(UK) that LBI was expecting payment of US$1.88 million on 13th July while Lombardy remindedCSTC that it could not proceed with its Dalian without funds from WMI.

Mardenand David Edwards were appointed to the shipping committee.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.141" class="para" id="p3.5.141">3.5.141</a> Also on 4th July, Rothschilds produced what they termed a discussion paper for WMâs directors.  In their covering letter of 5thJuly, Rothschilds said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The discussion paper is predicated on the basis that no action should be taken by the Board until a proposal has been formulatedby HK Realty and its financial advisers, East Asia Warburg Limited.  If however this proposal proves to be unacceptable, the Boardof Wheelock Marden will have to consider whether to support WMI, at least in the shorter term.  The consequences of Wheelock Mardennot providing support for its financially troubled subsidiary could be very damaging commercially in terms of the withdrawal of creditlines, loss of future contracts and generally more onerous terms and conditions of trade.  The adverse publicity which such a movewould attract should also not be forgotten particularly in view of Wheelock Mardenâs role as general manager of WMI.  Support hasalready been given by Wheelock Marden to WMI in the form of a performance guarantee and it could be argued that Wheelock Marden hasalso accepted publicly the principle of group support as a result of the announcement by its subsidiary, HK Realty, that it was consideringa commitment to WMI.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In our opinion, the only circumstances in which Wheelock Marden could reasonably withhold support for WMI would be where the Boardwere to take the view that the case against a significant recovery in charter rates and the value of the fleet vessels was overwhelmingin terms of the financial impact on the group.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.142" class="para" id="p3.5.142">3.5.142</a> Rothschilds said they would examine support from three viewpoints:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1) S&amp;C rescheduling,</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2) The short-term funding requirement for newbuildings,</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>3) The long term funding requirement.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.143" class="para" id="p3.5.143">3.5.143</a> They went on:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â We believe that Wheelock Marden should consider the provision of short-term support by way of a comfort letter which would ineffect be a committed facility to WMI, but which would be limited both as to amount and as to duration.  This is likely to be theminimum required to permit the rescheduling of WMIâs debts under the S&amp;C proposal and it would also enable any modest short-termfinancing requirements to be met.  The short-term committed facility could take the form of an inter-company current account at acommercial rate of interest, possibly with some kind of equity sweetener.  Such a commitment may be considered to be a small priceto pay for Wheelock Marden protecting its investment in the short-term and might in fact not be a much greater concession than theperformance guarantee given in respect of the Rangelock financing.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">With a short-term committed facility in place, some breathing space could be gained to consider in greater depth and away from publicscrutiny the long-term solutions to the liquidity problems of WMI.  We do not consider a permanent refinancing solution, such asa rights issue of equity or loan stock by WMI, to be appropriate at the present time since substantial cash outflows are not expectedwithin the next two years under the cash flow forecasts presented to us.  It would be far better for Wheelock Marden to determinethe form and size of a funding solution when the long-term financing requirements of WMI can be better ascertained.  The minorityshareholders of WMI would be expected to contribute their share.  Failing this, they would of course see their equity interest diluted. The long-term solution could also be examined by the Board in the context of a possible fundamental restructuring of the WheelockMarden group at that time.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.144" class="para" id="p3.5.144">3.5.144</a> In their discussion paper, Rothschilds reviewed the current situation.  Of the S&amp;C rescheduling proposal they noted:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â At this stage it is uncertain whether the proposal will find favour with all the secured lenders, particularly since no supportor commitment from the Wheelock Marden group has yet materialised.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.145" class="para" id="p3.5.145">3.5.145</a> Rothschilds also noted that the April cash flows used by S&amp;C showed not only an immediate cash shortfall but a shortfall aftertwo years significantly in excess of the amount of US$12 million being considered by HKR.  They said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Even if the rescheduling proposals are adopted, we believe that the amount of US$12 million, which is the potential commitmentfrom HK Realty, is in fact misleading in that the funding requirement varies considerably over the next few years and we have thereforenot attached any significance to this amount.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.146" class="para" id="p3.5.146">3.5.146</a> Rothschilds said that their overriding principle was to find a short-term solution with minimal financial commitment from the WMGroup and to provide a â breathing spaceâ for WMI to find a long-term solution.  They discussed the possibility of a legallybinding letter of comfort or guarantee for secured lenders and remarked:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â We believe that the Board of Wheelock Marden has little option other than to concede the principle of a comfort letter or guarantee,now that precedent has been set by the performance guarantee given by Wheelock Marden in respect of the Rangelock financing.  Wewould however recommend to the Board that the extent and duration of the comfort letter or guarantee be fixed from the outset, tobe superseded eventually by a longer-term funding solution.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.147" class="para" id="p3.5.147">3.5.147</a> In relation to the short-term funding requirement, Rothschilds noted that providing funds from within the Group was â likely tocreate the same difficulties as HKR has experiencedâ.  They therefore disregarded such sources and suggested it should come fromWM.  The paper went on to discuss long-term funding, for example a rights issue, and concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â6. RATIONALE FOR SUPPORT</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>6.1 Finally, it is as well to consider the justification for support of WMI by its parent company, Wheelock Marden.  There may beno legal obligation on the part of the directors of a parent company to provide or arrange financial support for its subsidiary,the directorsâ only responsibility being to take whatever action is in the best interests of the parent company.  But the ramificationsof withholding support for a subsidiary could be far-reaching for a parent company with the damaging effects on its reputation possiblyreflected in withdrawal of credit lines, loss of future contracts, not to mention the adverse publicity which such a move would attract.</p>        <p>6.2   The position of Wheelock Marden and WMI is further complicated by the fact that Wheelock Marden is not only the parent companybut also the general manager of WMI, for which it receives an annual commission.  The onus is therefore on the directors to considercarefully the benefits and drawbacks of withholding support.</p>        <p>6.3   In deciding whether to extend support to WMI the directors of Wheelock Marden are likely to also have regard to the prospectsof recovery in the shipping market.  It is always difficult to predict more than two or three years in advance but this is particularlyso in the case of the dry bulk carrier shipping market where until the beginning of this year charter rates had fallen steeply overa two-year period, reflecting the considerable oversupply of vessels and the downturn in trade.  Some comfort can be gained howeverby the economic upturn in the United States and the signs of an improvement (albeit slow) in freight rates.  Perhaps the recent bidsfor P &amp; O and Straits Steamship may be seen as another pointer to the start of a recovery.</p>        <p>6.4   It may be viewed by some that the principle of parent company support for its subsidiary may have been accepted already by WheelockMarden because of the discussions which are taking place between HK Realty and WMI.  Creditors of WMI are probably continuing tofinance the company on the expectation that the discussions will give rise to a solution to the problems of WMI.  If these discussionsdo not give rise to specific proposals acceptable to all the parties concerned, it would in our view be very damaging for WheelockMarden then to withhold support for WMI.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.148" class="para" id="p3.5.148">3.5.148</a> On 6th July, Mr. Banner wrote to Mr. Brothers in response to a request by Mr. Brothers to consider what security might be given tounsecured lenders in order to obtain their support for the â proposed restructuring schemeâ.  He suggested new charges, possiblyby way of floating charge, but felt much would depend on shareholdersâ support and the form of such support.  A floating chargemight give away too much if there was a substantial cash injection.  He concluded therefore that it was better to keep options openand to tell the two unsecured lenders that until shareholdersâ support was clarified, perhaps by the end of July, it was difficultto determine the nature of suitable security.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.149" class="para" id="p3.5.149">3.5.149</a> The shipping committee met on 6th July.  Mr. Brothers reported on the S&amp;C scheme for secured lenders and said â all lenderswere emphatic that support must be demonstrated to be forthcoming from the WM Groupâ.  He went on to say that it was intended toput the scheme into effect whether or not lenders gave formal agreement.  Then, outstanding trade creditors including WM would bepaid off over six months out of operating expenses.  Trade creditors were estimated to be in the region of US$6 million of whichUS$2 million was due to WM.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.150" class="para" id="p3.5.150">3.5.150</a> The meeting considered a three-year cash flow dated 5th July  (which Rothschilds had referred to in their paper).  This cash flowtook into account the proposed S&amp;C rescheduling, the two BW and Dalian newbuildings, Manila Faith and ship sales.  It forecasta deficit of US$7 million by June 1986.  However, â to establish the real position for the future, a ten-year cash flow would berequiredâ.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.151" class="para" id="p3.5.151">3.5.151</a> Mr. Brothers brought the committee up-to-date on the Spanish vessels.  He said discussions were underway for the prices to be reducedto current market prices and for credit to be given for amounts already paid.  The contract prices for the Sestao vessels were US$27.7million and for the Sevillas US$26 million.  Market prices for immediate delivery were US$14.5 million and US$12.5 million respectively. The bankers, RBS and Wayfoong, were prepared to provide finance on this basis rather than face litigation.  In the meantime, everyeffort would be made to sell the vessels before delivery.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.152" class="para" id="p3.5.152">3.5.152</a> As to the Dalians, Mr. Brothers advised that payment of US$1.5 million per vessel due in 1983 had not been made.  He said if theDalian yard was prepared to accept the situation, a decision could be made later whether or not to proceed.  The minutes of the meetingthen record:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Mr. Lees felt strongly that we should cancel the ships to avoid further commitment and losses on operating them.  Mr. Brothersstated that a cancellation would have far-reaching effects for what was in itself very small amounts of money relative to the Groupas a whole and he hoped that some accommodation could be reached.  Mr. Marden stated that the Chinese in their minds did not differentiatebetween Wheelock Marden &amp; Co.

He pointed out that at the time the performance guaranteehad been given the Board had been assured that plans were in hand to immediately re-finance the vessel.  He enquired why the re-financinghad not taken place.  In reply Mr. Brothers advised that it had subsequently been decided that it would not be feasible to sell twoof WMIâs vessels to the Allied Group as had originally been planned and once that it was obvious that that proposal could not beproceeded with, WMI had been faced with insolvency with the result that it had become unable to take on new credit and had thereforehad to cancel the re-financing of the â Rangelockâ, the lease of the â Sealockâ and also the re-financing of Hudong HullNo. 1126.

The following day, in relation to BW 912, Midland Bank deferred interest of US$852,000.00 from 13th Julyto 13th October and said non-payment on that date would be an event of default.  On the same day, WMI(UK) made a formal demand onWM for non-payment by Aquaship of hire of US$337,500.00 due on 13th June and US$348,750.00 due on 13th July, hire which Aquashiphad said it would be unable to pay.

Mr. Brothers then tabled a memo from Mr. Yuen detailing trade payments due amounting to some US$835,000, Â£23,000 and Yen75 million, and said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â that he would like to have it on record that WMI was in an extremely tight cash position and that the position would clearly deteriorateunless something was done.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.164" class="para" id="p3.5.164">3.5.164</a> Because payments such as these were not incorporated in existing cash flows, which were designed to show trends over longer periodsincorporating average expenses, it was agreed that it was essential to have up-to-date short-term cash requirements and to have fundsto satisfy creditors who might otherwise arrest a vessel.  Mr. Brothers said he was not relying upon US$12 million from within theGroup for short-term commitments for which the best hope was refinancing of World Rainbow.

It then saidthat ten-year projections did not envisage a return to 1980 market levels until 1989, using reasonable assumptions, but</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â What in my view is more likely to happen is that we will experience a much sharper increase in rates than projected - probablyin 1985 - followed by just as sharp an increase in values gradually moving upwards in any event with inflation.  The money in shippingis not in trading but in astute purchases and sales and strategic and well-timed sales in the future will be essential for the long-termsuccess of the Group.  The fleet listed earlier has a market value today of about $150 million.  Three years ago, for vessels ofthat size and relative modernity the value would have been $245 million.

This would reduce the outstanding Allied loan of US$2 million by US$1 million and produce US$2 million cash to help liquidity. Mr. Brothers said that Mr. Reynolds would like to sell Asia Rindo as a package at the same time which would overcome the problemof making a preferred payment to Allied and would not require the agreement of other creditors.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.180" class="para" id="p3.5.180">3.5.180</a> On the same day, by circular, WMI directors resolved to accept the lending banksâ terms of the interest payments on Annalock andBW 912 which were to be deferred to 13 October, and to acknowledge the event of default on Rangelock.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.181" class="para" id="p3.5.181">3.5.181</a> On 27th July, there was a meeting of the shipping committee.  There was considerable discussion about the Spanish vessels.  Mr. Brotherswas able to report a reduced price for all four vessels and would be circulating directors for approval of the arrangements.  Hesaid it was hoped to sell three of these vessels and Manila Faith to Iran in exchange for oil.  The committee noted that attemptswould be made to delay delivery of the three Spanish vessels until the sale was consummated.  Failing such sale, Mr. Brothers saidthe vessels would have to be traded and at US$6,000.00 per day would be virtually self-supporting, although it was later noted thatthere would be a deficit of $1,000 per day.  Mr. Brothers said the cash drain would not be major particularly if a buyer was foundwithin six months.  Mr. Brothers then reminded the committee:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthat the Company was currently in an exceedingly tight liquidity position and whatever might result from the application to theparent company for support, it was going to take time and time was something the Company was rapidly running out of.  The questiontherefore, he said, was how could the Company raise sufficient funds to keep going in the interim.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.182" class="para" id="p3.5.182">3.5.182</a> Apart from refinancing World Rainbow, Mr. Brothers explained that Orion had an outstanding loan of US$5.25 million on Asia Heronwhich had been valued at $8.6 million.  There was a good charter for three years which would enable US$4 million to be repaid sothat Allied would get a useful return and a saleable ship.  At the same time, Allied had loaned WMI US$2 million secured on AsiaRindo worth only US$1.5 million.  Of the proceeds of sale of Asia Heron, US$1 million could be applied to reducing that loan andput it on a sound basis.  The balance of the proceeds of sale after transfer of the outstanding Asia Heron loan to Allied would beUS$2 million which WMI urgently needed.  US$900,000.00 would be used for the Sealock interest payment on 8th August and the balancewould see WMI through until September, when US$12 million support should have been finalized.  Therefore, Mr. Brothers</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â put forward a formal proposal that application be made to the Wheelock Marden &amp; Co. Ltd. Management Committee for the saleof the â Asia Heronâ inter Group to Allied Investors at Clarksonâs valuation of US$8.6 million which would besides releasingmuch needed cash would remove one creditor altogether and regularise the Allied loan.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">HWL noted that there was no doubt even if there were a favourable response to the proposal that for the purposes of the deliberationsthe Shipping Committee would require an up to date cashflow.  He went on to say that such a cashflow should be tabled at each ShippingCommittee Meeting, in order that all of the Members of the Committee might be aware of the Companyâs up to date financial position.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.183" class="para" id="p3.5.183">3.5.183</a> It was then agreed that a three-month cash flow should be prepared, updated every Friday and circulated to the committee.

Reynolds and Shaw agreed that this changein the proposal could not be put to the banks until the Wheelock Marden Board had formally committed themselves to it.  The WheelockMarden groupâs credibility with the banks was already suffering and could not withstand a second change of plan.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">No rights issue prospectus should be issued until all banks and other lenders to WMI had committed themselves to the S&amp;C schemeand formally signed the scheme documentation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.186" class="para" id="p3.5.186">3.5.186</a> And on the same day, Orient Leasing wrote to say Manila Faith was valued at US$11.1 million because operating losses for such vesselswere estimated at US$1.5-2 million per year till 1985 and because similar vessels built in China were now up for sale at about US$9million.  They asked whether WMI would accept a reduction of US$2 million or more from the figure of US$13 million which had beendiscussed.  Also CSSC informed that Dalian hull 270-7 had been launched on 27th July and asked for the third instalment.  The owner,Denny Shipping, replied on 1st August to say it depended entirely on WMI, that a cash injection was expected shortly and expressedthe hope that CSSC would bear with them.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.187" class="para" id="p3.5.187">3.5.187</a> On 29th July, Mr. Brothers circulated WMI directors as to the position in relation to the Spanish vessels.

We have thereforeexcluded from consideration the possibility of a short-term committed facility being provided to Wheelock Maritime by Wheelock Mardenand instead carried out a more detailed review of the implications of debt and/or equity injections into Wheelock Maritime.  Theresults of our review are set out in the following paragraphs.  For the purpose of the review we have assumed the funding requirementto be in the region of US$12 million i.e. the maximum commitment under discussion between HK Realty and Wheelock Maritime.  We havealso assumed that receipt of the full proceeds of any issue of debt or equity would be guaranteed by way of an underwriting commitmentto be given by Wheelock Marden.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.191" class="para" id="p3.5.191">3.5.191</a> They went on to discuss the methods and timing of an issue.  Although there seems to have been a meeting to discuss the paper thereis no record or evidence of the discussion.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.192" class="para" id="p3.5.192">3.5.192</a> The shipping committee met on 3rd August.  They learnt that the management committee had endorsed the sale of Asia Heron to Allied. The price of US$8.6 million based on Clarksonâs valuation was discussed.  It was felt Allied might have difficulty in justifyingthe price on an armâs length basis and that US$8.3 million might be more acceptable.  This would have implications for WMI becauseof the condition that US$1 million of Alliedâs US$2 million loan was to be retired.  It was agreed to ask Mr. Shaw for advice onthis, in addition to the advice already sought, and also on whether the consent of all lenders was necessary.  Mr. Shaw providedadvice by letter next day.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.193" class="para" id="p3.5.193">3.5.193</a> Also discussed at the meeting was refinancing of Manila Faith where a value of US$11.5 million had been agreed with Orient Leasing,with US$10.5 million from Nam Fung as a fallback.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.194" class="para" id="p3.5.194">3.5.194</a> Mr. Brothers reported that LBI had proposed a sale and lease-back of Rangelock instead of rescheduling.  If this proceeded, if theOrion loan was transferred to Allied on sale of Asia Heron and if the Grindlays loan was paid down, only three secured banks wouldbe left to deal with.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.195" class="para" id="p3.5.195">3.5.195</a> Mr. Shawâs advice set out the basis on which the sale was to be made.  He went on:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â We understand that the Directors of your Company would wish to accept this offer, because there is a very urgent need for additionalcash funds within the group to meet outgoings.  The present liquidity problem has arisen because negotiations with bankers, as wellas the negotiations for a possible injection of additional capital by Hongkong Realty, have taken considerably longer than envisagedand, pending resolution of these matters, the banks are not releasing charterhire.  There is therefore an immediate problem whichmust be solved if the group is to meet its outgoings and to continue operating its vessels.  Apart from this urgent requirement,the Directors consider that the price offered is a fair price, i.e. equal to the full amount of valuation and if the vessel wereoffered generally on the market it is likely that it would take some time to effect a sale at a comparable price, and that wouldnot meet the Companyâs immediate requirements for additional cash funds.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.196" class="para" id="p3.5.196">3.5.196</a> Later, Mr. Shaw said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â You have asked us to comment on whether this transaction could be open to attack as a fraudulent preference.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.197" class="para" id="p3.5.197">3.5.197</a> He explained the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s266.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 266</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> and the essence of a fraudulent preference, and said the main factor is motive.

Mr. Brothers said the proposal was for HK$85 million unsecured loan stockunderwritten by WM.  He enclosed a Rothschilds time-table which included</p>    <blockquote>        <p>19th August - EAW advises unofficially it cannot endorse commitment by HKR on acceptable terms.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>22nd August - Secured and unsecured lenders agreed rescheduling.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.204" class="para" id="p3.5.204">3.5.204</a> Mr. Brothers observed that the latter date was impractical.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.205" class="para" id="p3.5.205">3.5.205</a> On 9th August, Mr. Brothers wrote to Mr. Shaw about the advice given on 18th July concerning the possible liability for the Dalians.

They agreedManila Faith and three Spanish vessels be sold to Iran if a good price could be obtained.  Meanwhile, Mr. Brothers advised he waspursuing negotiations with Orient Leasing for the sale and lease-back of Manila Faith.  A sub-committee of Mr. Brothers, Mr. Campbelland a representative of WMC was set up to update cash flow assumptions each month.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.207" class="para" id="p3.5.207">3.5.207</a> Next day, Mr. Brothers wrote to Orient Leasing to keep them informed.  In the letter he said of HKR and the anticipated report fromEAW:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â We do not have as yet any indication of the findings of the study.  However for your private information, should the Hong KongRealty commitment fail to materialise, we do have other proposals in mind to raise the equivalent amount of money for WMI and thesewould be put in hand without delay.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.208" class="para" id="p3.5.208">3.5.208</a> On 15th August, by circular to WMI directors in which Mr. Brothers said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â the Company is in urgent need of funds to enable it to meet its day-to-day financial commitments.  ...â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>directors were asked to agree to the sale of Asia Heron at US$8.6 million.  They did so.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.209" class="para" id="p3.5.209">3.5.209</a> The shipping committee met again on 17th August.  Mr. Brothers reported, inter alia, that although there were a number of possibilitiesfor refinancing Manila Faith, the primary difficulty was that support of US$12 million was not yet finalized.  A recent valuationwas US$11.8 million and as, for example, Grindlays would probably not advance more than 70%, US$2 million would be needed from WMIâsresources which appeared impossible without a cash injection.  It was agreed that Mr. Brothers should actively pursue financing.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.210" class="para" id="p3.5.210">3.5.210</a> On 18th August, LBI wrote to WMI(UK) formally to propose the sale and lease-back of Rangelock, the vessel to be purchased by SevernShipping Limited, a company within the LBI Group, for US$20 million and leased back to WMI(UK).  The proposal was approved by WMIdirectors by circular on 24th August.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.211" class="para" id="p3.5.211">3.5.211</a> On the same day, Mr. Brothers wrote to NBNA about the two Sestao vessels.  He proposed a joint loan by NBNA and Chemical Bank ofUS$12.5 million on each vessel, based on a Clarkson valuation of US$14.5 million and an expectation of selling at that level shortly. He continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â In the meantime we can trade the vessel in excess of USD6,000 per day.  The proposed USD12m commitment from the Wheelock Grouphas not been earmarked for any purpose and the Group thus can be expected to have adequate working capital to meet its commitments.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.212" class="para" id="p3.5.212">3.5.212</a> On 22nd August, Mr. Brothers in a memorandum to the management committee made an alternative proposal for financing Manila Faithin case Orient Leasing should fall through.  In essence, a new company of which Beauforte would own 50% would purchase the vesselfor US$12 million and charter back to WMI.  In setting out the background, Mr. Brothers said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The Contract cost was US$19M.  Finance for US$17M had been arranged through Orient Leasing but this was subject to a WheelockMarden Comfort Letter.  With the liquidity problems for WMI announced earlier this year, it was impractical to request this ComfortLetter and consequently the finance from Orient Leasing was not available.  World-Wide agreed therefore to provide temporary financingof US$10.5M to enable WMI to take delivery.  This financing was to be repaid on August 26th by which time it was expected that thearrangements with regard to shareholder support and consequently the loan rescheduling would have been completed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.213" class="para" id="p3.5.213">3.5.213</a> In fact, on 24th August, Orient Leasing wrote to confirm it would make US$11.5 million available by way of lease facility on conditionthat first, HKR commit US$12 million and second, bankers agreed to rescheduling.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.214" class="para" id="p3.5.214">3.5.214</a> Meanwhile, on 23rd August, S&amp;C produced draft documentation for a rights issue of HK$85 million.  This was prepared at the instigationof Mr. Brothers who, shortly after the Rothschilds discussion paper of 2nd August, had been told by Mr. Leung that support from HKRwas becoming less likely.  If HKR failed to make a commitment there would then be ready an alternative method of support by WM. This documentation was discussed the following day when Mr. Brothers met S&amp;C.  Mr. Brothers explained that HKR was looking negativeand that â WMIâs decision was to go ahead with the alternative of obtaining support from WMâ.  He said negotiation with WMand the banks should be completed by 15th September.  Mr. Reynolds said this would be impossible as negotiation with the banks wouldtake much longer and emphasised that he needed a definite proposal from WM to take to the banks.  He also said Pacnorse would haveto be included in the rescheduling scheme if it was to be assumed the loan would not be called.  Finally, Mr. Brothers asked whethera credit facility or deficiency guarantee could be explored because WMI did not need a lot of money up front.  Mr. Reynolds saidWM had two choices - inject cash or not.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.215" class="para" id="p3.5.215">3.5.215</a> Also on 24th August, the shipping committee met.  Mr. Brothers reported that the Spanish vessels should all be financed within twoweeks and that negotiations were continuing with Iran.  Of more concern was the Pacnorse loan and the need to ensure that there wouldbe no call by Pacnorse.  Mr. Brothers said Pacnorse cash flows showed that it had no need to call for funds and that there was aninformal understanding with Jebsens who were also short of cash.  It was agreed that it was important to get something in writingfrom Pacnorse and Jebsens.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.216" class="para" id="p3.5.216">3.5.216</a> In respect of Manila Faith, it was agreed to approach WWS for agreement to extend the loan for six weeks while a sale to Beaufortewas examined.  Mr. Brothers wrote to WWS next day.  He said WMI had a confirmed commitment from Orient Leasing but</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Such commitment is however subject to the company having completed its rescheduling arrangments with its bankers and a USD12mcommitment from within the Wheelock Marden Group.  These arrangements, although in hand, have been delayed due to the preparationof an independent financial report which is now anticipated within the next 10 days.  Thereafter we expect matters to move swiftlyand the rescheduling and commitment will be finalized within six weeks.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.217" class="para" id="p3.5.217">3.5.217</a> Mr. Brothers requested a reduced facility of US$10.5 million until 15th October.  US$10.6 million was in fact due on 30th August. WWS replied on the same day pointing out:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The reasons for requesting an extension duplicate those given at the time of the loan negotiations and you can really no (sic)say with certainty that the situation will be different in 6 weeksâ time.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>WWS also enquired about charter-hire which they had not received and expressed the hope that it was due to non-payment by the charterer. The WWS position was reserved, but on 31 August they declared an event of default.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.218" class="para" id="p3.5.218">3.5.218</a> Next day, Mr. Brothers instructed Mr. Cameron to pay US$152,000.00 to WWS, being charter-hire and ballast bonus, and said no paymentnow needed to be made on 30th August because â its hire will cover the interest and some principalâ.  But on the same day, WWSwrote formally to WMI rejecting WMIâs proposal and putting WMI on notice that should the loan not be repaid on the due date enforcementby way of arrest of sister ships within the WMI Group might be effected.  This letter was signed by Mr. Lee as director of WWS. There was an exchange of telexes between Mr. Brothers and WWS in which on 31st August WWS again insisted on repayment, and soughtdetails of Manila Faith to enable them to take enforcement action.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.219" class="para" id="p3.5.219">3.5.219</a> Also on 26th August, Mr. Stuart of Rothschilds and Mr. Sun and Mr. Reynolds of S&amp;C met.  The note of this meeting records thatMr. Stuart of Rothschilds:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â reported that he had a meeting with the Wheelock Marden Board yesterday and that they thought a short-term solution was betterthan any structured solution.  The Wheelock Marden Board was basically considering a committed credit facility for a period of 3years and of an amount to be determined based on the revised cash flow.  Stuart said that Wheelock Marden would like to see commitmentfrom the banks to the rescheduling scheme before agreeing to the granting of the facility.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">JRR replied that this would not work and he was certain that we had to go back to the bank with a firm proposal.  However the resolutioncould be subject to the bankâs granting to the rescheduling scheme.  JRR said that the loan should be subordinated to the banksand should be non-interest bearing.  Stuart indicated that there was a reluctance within the Wheelock Marden Board to commit themselvesand he wanted to explore other alternatives whereby Wheelock Mardenâs commitment would not be necessary for the banks to agreeto the scheme.  However, JRR replied that a board resolution was the only alternative.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.220" class="para" id="p3.5.220">3.5.220</a> The next shipping committee meeting was 31st August.  The committee noted a Pacnorse cash flow included interest at 10% on the shareholdersloan but no principal repayments, that there was nothing to report on World Rainbow but Nam Fung was prepared to enter a sale andlease-back with WMI on Manila Faith for US$9 million (on which vessel US$10.5 million was still outstanding to WWW).</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.221" class="para" id="p3.5.221">3.5.221</a> On 1st September, pursuant to an informal retention account, Mr. Brothers asked BNP for US$90,000 as operating expenses for Inverlockin September.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.222" class="para" id="p3.5.222">3.5.222</a> The Pacnorse Board met in Hong Kong on 2nd September.  It noted a cash surplus projected for December 1983 of US$5.6 million decliningto deficits of US$3.5 million and US$1.1 million respectively in November and December 1984 but that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â this projection was based on the fact that there would be no increase in the levels of income during the period and it was agreedthat provided interest on shareholdersâ loans could be paid if necessary in advance of the year end, there would be no requirementduring this period to call back any portion of shareholdersâ loans.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.223" class="para" id="p3.5.223">3.5.223</a> On 5th September, Mr. Brothers in a memo to Mr. Leung and Mr. Lees reported on a meeting he had had with Dr. Helmut Sohmen of WWSabout Manila Faith.  WWW would take no action before the ship arrived in Japan on 11th September and then, against an undertakingfrom WM, would give WMI an extension of another four weeks, effectively the six-week period WMI had been seeking.  Mr. Brothers continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Assuming the decision to commit $12 million to WMI is taken this week, my main concern would be that we can complete the documentationin time, particularly as our commitment cannot be viewed as â firmâ by Orient Leasing in that it is subject to the Banks agreeingto their rescheduling and the timing of their acceptance is beyond our control.  My own preference would be to work on Orient Leasingwhereby at the time we announce the $12 million commitment, in exchange for OLC agreeing an immediate drawdown, ie. before all thedetails are finalised, Wheelock Marden give OLC a Comfort Letter which will be returned once the rescheduling arrangements are completed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.224" class="para" id="p3.5.224">3.5.224</a> On 6th September, Mr. Campbell sent Rothschilds a three-year cash flow which assumed flat spot rates and delivery of the Dalians. By August 1986 the deficit would be US$36 million.  Assuming the Dalians were not delivered and no penalty was payable, the deficitwould be US$26 million.  This was a worst case scenario, however, and did not reflect WMC thinking on charter rates.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.225" class="para" id="p3.5.225">3.5.225</a> On the same day, S&amp;C drafted a letter to WMI bankers on the basis that HKR had rejected WMIâs request for US$12 million butthat WM had agreed to a subordinated credit facility of like amount.  The WM commitment would, however, be subject to bankersâagreement to the S&amp;C proposal for retention accounts.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.226" class="para" id="p3.5.226">3.5.226</a> The shipping committee met again on 7th September.  Mr. Brothers reported developments, in particular his discussions with WWS aboutManila Faith.  The minutes record that Mr. Brothers:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â expressed the opinion that World-Wide were moving to a situation whereby they could justify arresting the vessel on the basisthey had given the Group every opportunity to resolve the matter.  RJFB went on to say that he had undertaken to revert to HelmutSohmen after discussing the matter internally.  He noted that it would be necessary to re-fix the vessel to ensure it continued toearn charter hires but that this would not be possible without World-Wideâs agreement if there were a danger of the vessel beingarrested.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">General discussion then followed on the two remaining avenues for the refinancing of the vessel - a sale and lease-back either withNam Fung or Orient Leasing.  It was noted that Orient Leasingâs terms were more attractive but that the arrangement could not beconcluded unless there was confirmation that the $12 million commitment was forthcoming and unless WMIâs Bankers had agreed theproposed rescheduling scheme.  RJFB suggested that one way around this was to offer OLC the Groupâs standard comfort letter asan â interimâ arrangement on the understanding that this would be returned to Wheelocks once all the other arrangements had beencompleted.  This had the advantage, he said, of removing all deadlines.  WJL and HWL expressed the view that this arrangement wouldbe unacceptable to WM.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.227" class="para" id="p3.5.227">3.5.227</a> It was noted that WMI was in no position to take delivery of the Dalians and â that steps will have to be taken in due course toarrange for their cancellation or otherwiseâ.  It was also noted that WMIâs three-year cash flow was to be updated each month. There was nothing to report on World Rainbow.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.228" class="para" id="p3.5.228">3.5.228</a> On 8th September, Rothschilds wrote to the WM Board to advise on a course of action if WMIâs approach to HKR was unsuccessful. They concluded that WM should consider short-term support by way of a stand-by facility.  They based their opinion on a cash flowof 1st September which, with retention accounts, showed no deficit until May 1986 but a deficit limited to US$3 million by August1986.  A projection of 5th September showed that thereafter the deficit slipped to US$69 million by the end of 1990 but improvedto US$53 million by the end of 1992.  <a>(App. 2/17-18)</a></p>    <p><a name="p3.5.229" class="para" id="p3.5.229">3.5.229</a> Rothschild drew attention to sensitive assumptions which could have a significant impact on the cash flow:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1.

The adverse publicity which such a move would attract should also not be forgotten.  Support has alreadybeen given by Wheelock Marden to WMI in the form of a performance guarantee and it could be argued that Wheelock Marden has alsoaccepted publicly the principle of group support as a result of the announcement by its subsidiary, HK Realty, that it was consideringa commitment to WMI.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In our opinion, the only circumstances in which Wheelock Marden could reasonably withhold support for WMI would be where the Boardwere to take the view that the case against a significant recovery in charter rates and the value of the fleet vessels was overwhelmingin terms of the financial impact on the group.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">We do not believe that the case can be proved as at todayâs date.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.231" class="para" id="p3.5.231">3.5.231</a> Rothschilds then proposed a stand-by facility of US$12 million for three years, limiting drawings to US$4 million per year.  Thisfigure was arrived at as being consistent with the amount sought from HKR and the level required by bankers for rescheduling.  Rothschildsconcluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â On the basis of the cash flow projection, we believe that the extent to which the proposed committed facility by Wheelock Mardento WMI would be utilised in its first year would be minimal if at all.  In addition the annual limits suggested on drawings wouldact as a safeguard in the event that the WMI cash flow deficit exceeds the levels projected.  Thus by the provision of a limitedamount of short-term support Wheelock Marden should be able to protect its significantly larger investment in WMI at least for thenext three years.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It should be noted that this support would be in addition to the performance guarantee given in respect of the Rangelock financing;Wheelock Mardenâs liability in this connection is presently projected to amount to US$4.5 million over the next 27 months.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In conclusion we believe that limited short-term support for WMI should be considered by the Board of Wheelock Marden conditionalupon the rescheduling of WMIâs debts as proposed by WMIâs financial advisers.  By doing so the Board will be seen to have enabledWheelock Marden to fulfil its responsibilities to its subsidiary at limited cost while allowing more time for the highly cyclicalshipping market to improve.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.232" class="para" id="p3.5.232">3.5.232</a> On 12th September, Mr. Brothers sought and obtained from MMB and LBI an extension of 14 days for payment of the instalment due onMarilock.

First, WM received from WMI(UK) a further formal demand on WM for shortfallin charter-hire on Rangelock, this time for US$168,136.00.  Then, Price Waterhouse in respect of WMIâs interim accounts for sixmonths ended June 1983 pointed out that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The carrying value of the investment in Pacnorse includes a fairly substantial amount of â goodwillâ.  The results of Pacnorseare accounted for on the equity basis.  However, in view of the poor results of Pacnorse, consideration should be given to reducingthe â goodwillâ portion of the carrying value of the investment.

The directors approved the letter which was signed by Mr. Lees and sent on the same day (App. 3/22).  It saidthat without support in the order of US$12m over 3 years rescheduling was unlikely and without rescheduling â WMI would not beable to meet its existing commitments as they fall due and therefore would have to cease tradingâ.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.235" class="para" id="p3.5.235">3.5.235</a> On the following day, there were three Board meetings.  HKR met at 3:00 p.m, with Mr. Lees in the chair, and endorsed its Committeeâsdecision that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Having discussed and fully considered EAWâs report, the Committee has decided that the Company should not make a commitmentof up to US$12 million to WMI.

The Board discussed WMIâs letter seeking support.  Mr. Lees proposedthat WM should respond immediately and that a reply had been drafted in conjunction with the companyâs legal advisers.  I havenot seen that draft.  There was also, however, a draft press announcement which after setting out the background concluded</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The Directors have decided to extend parent company support to WMI in the form of a committed stand-by facility amounting to US$12million over a period of 3 years, subject to certain conditions, including acceptable arrangements being agreed by WMI with its lenderson the proposed rescheduling of existing loans.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.238" class="para" id="p3.5.238">3.5.238</a> It is not unreasonable to assume that the draft letter would have given a similar indication.

In the minutes, fourfairly short paragraphs summarize the meeting:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â At the request of Mr. Lees, Mr. D.J. Shaw outlined the legal position as regards the Company continuing to carry on business untilWheelock Marden had given its decision.  Mr. Shaw advised that the Directors could carry on trading provided they were satisfiedthat there was a reasonable prospect of sorting something out which would enable the Companyâs financial problems to be resolved. The fact that the parent company was, he said, carefully considering the Companyâs request for support recognised the urgencyof the matter and he advised that unless any Director did not think there was a reasonable prospect of sorting something out thenit would be reasonable to wait for this answer.</p>        <p class="quote">Mr. Patrick Poon queried the legal position of a Director who was both a Director of the Company and of Wheelock Marden and in replyMr. Shaw said that provided such a Director was of the opinion Wheelock Mardenâs announcement had been made in good faith (andhe had no special knowledge indicating that no such support would be forthcoming) and provided the Director concerned believed therewas a reasonable prospect of sorting something out then the Director concerned could justify the Company continuing to trade until23rd September 1983 when Wheelock Mardenâs decision would be known.</p>        <p class="quote">Mr. Lees then asked each Director of the Company who was also a Director of Wheelock Marden to confirm that he had no special knowledgeto indicate that the aforementioned was not the case.  Messrs. Patrick Poon, R.J.F. Brothers, H.W. Leung and P.C. Lee confirmed thatthey had no such special knowledge.  Mr. Lees confirmed that he himself had no such special knowledge.</p>        <p class="quote">It was resolved that Wheelock Mardenâs letter dated 15th September 1983 be accepted and that the Company continue to trade until23rd September 1983 pending Wheelock Mardenâs formal decision on the Companyâs request for financial support.  In the meantimecare should be taken that only essential debts are paid.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.242" class="para" id="p3.5.242">3.5.242</a> The meeting was, however, tape recorded and a transcript is available.  According to the transcript, which is not in dispute, Mr.Lees after referring to WMâs reply said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â I suppose the first question I would like to ask our legal advisers is whether in fact this letter leaves us enough prospectsto allow us to continue trading until ... at least until Wheelock Marden has had the opportunity of having their Board Meeting toconsider our request fully.  Would you like to comment on it as it stands?â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.243" class="para" id="p3.5.243">3.5.243</a> Mr. Shaw responded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The basic test is, as weâ ve said on previous occasions, is the Directors may carry on trading provided they are satisfied thereis a reasonable prospect of sorting something out which will enable the problems to be resolved and as long as there is a reasonableprospect they are entitled to explore proposals and explore opportunities and to continue other efforts under consideration and clearlythe fact that HK Realty have said that they are not prepared to go ahead means that the Directors have got to look at the positionvery seriously, because as I understand it the US$12 million injection from whatever source is regarded as an essential part of anyrearrangement with bankers and without it, it really is very uncertain whether the bankers would come to any deal with the Companyas regards rescheduling.  The position is that a request has been put to the parent company ... put again to the parent company. The parent company has given a non committal answer but having said that we did ask them to say if the answer is â noâ, to sayâ noâ straight away.  It did not say that.  It has said it is considering it carefully now.  It recognises the urgency and thereforeobviously it is for the Directors to decide that provided you still have the view there is a reasonable prospect and there can beno certainty of this ... provided thereâs a reasonable prospect of it being sorted out then it could possibly continue but youare put on notice that this really is a very delicate situation and clearly the time factor is very important so that we canâ tallow this uncertainty to continue for a very long period.  Now, Wheelock Marden has come back and said â we will endeavour toanswer within a weekâ.  It seems to me that unless any Director does not think thereâs a reasonable prospect of sorting somethingout then it is reasonable to wait for this answer.  If any Director does have that feeling now then he really ought to say it.  Butif no one takes that negative position yet then I think it is reasonable to say that you can continue to wait and see, for that week. But to very much be on notice during that week that you ought to avoid taking up any commitments other than the running of the Companyand the preservation of its assets and that they have it in mind that if at the end of the week the answer is no, then it is verylikely that the decision will have to be to cease trading at that point.  Itâs not certain; weâ ll have to consider that situationwhen it arises but this is a very delicate stage and I think unless any Director does not think ... sorry, wrong negatives ... doesnot think thereâs a reasonable prospect of a solution coming out then it is permissible to wait for a week but thereafter it hasgot to be looked at very carefully ... thatâs my view.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.244" class="para" id="p3.5.244">3.5.244</a> Mr. Poon then inquired about the position of a director who was also a director of WM to which Mr. Shaw replied:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Well, I think if there was a Director of Wheelock Marden and because he was a Director of Wheelock Marden he would have a certainamount of knowledge and if he knew or had reasonable grounds for thinking that the answer was very likely to be â noâ next Friday,he would be in a very, very difficult position, if he had knowledge of it.  Perhaps there wasnâ t a reasonable prospect.  If onthe other hand it was finely balanced or was not known yet, has no reason to think the answer will be â noâ, then he will bein a less difficult position.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.245" class="para" id="p3.5.245">3.5.245</a> There was discussion about paying debts and whether there should be a suspension of the companyâs shares, in the course of whichMr. Reynolds said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â I think so far as a suspension of shares is concerned the situation of the Company I think is in no different a position now asit was a week or two weeksâ ago.  In other words, it was entering into discussions with one company, HK Realty, and now itâsthe parent company, with a view to negotiating funds which are necessary for its survival and unless there was a reason to suppose,as David Shaw was saying that this avenue was less likely to prove successful than the HK Realty avenue, I think the decision ontrading now should be the same as before and I think therefore it would not be necessary to suspend trading.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.246" class="para" id="p3.5.246">3.5.246</a> Mr. Poon then returned to the position of a director who did not think there was a reasonable prospect of sorting things out andwhether he could withdraw to protect his position.  Mr. Shaw said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â I think the difficulty on that is that this is a decision for the Board to take and unless the Directors do have views as to thereasonable prospect, then theyâ ll have to consider ceasing to trade and if one Director intimates that he is in the position,it could possibly put the other Directors in a very difficult position on whether they can take the contrary view.  Now it may bethatâs based on personal feeling or possibly itâs based on some impression as to how the Wheelock Marden Board will decide. I canâ t really tell but I donâ t think that by abstaining or absenting yourself you necessarily can avoid joining in the consequences.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â I think one point I must make is that if Wheelock Marden is not prepared to consider this seriously and has it in mind to turnus down, it would be very irresponsible to put out the announcement.  I think we can take some comfort in the fact that they areprepared to give us this serious consideration.  Theyâ ve written a letter ...â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.247" class="para" id="p3.5.247">3.5.247</a> After further exchanges, this occurred:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â [Mr Poon]:  Well, I would like to go on record that I hold the view that there is no such prospect.</p>        <p class="quote">[Mr Lees]:  You say you believe there is no reasonable prospect.</p>        <p class="quote">[Mr Poon]:  I would like to put that on record.</p>        <p class="quote">[Mr Shaw]:  In other words, what you are saying is that the chances of Wheelock Marden saying â yesâ must be considered very low.

I think that I cannot accept that I can holdthe view that there is little prospect.</p>        <p class="quote">[Mr Reynolds]:  Let me make a point that I think so far as HK Realty is concerned, I think the decision for a company with no shippinginterests and no shareholding interest in Wheelock Maritime and the advice from merchant banks that they would get, could very wellbe very different from the advice that Wheelock Marden will get given Wheelock Mardenâs position as a controlling shareholder alreadyin the shipping market and already with that shareholding interest.</p>        <p class="quote">[Mr Poon]:  Well I donâ t approve the context of that report.  Now let me put it this way.  Well, itâs my personal view that thereis no reasonable prospect for anything to come out in favour of support at the present time for this Company.</p>        <p class="quote">[Mr Shaw]:  Accepting thatâs your personal view, if that reflected the view of other Wheelock Marden Directors would it not be irresponsiblefor them to make an announcement tonight, that the public is going to think that this is a matter on which Wheelock Marden is givingserious consideration and it has not made its mind up but since it is giving itâs serious consideration it certainly is possiblethat it will be providing the support.  Now if that is not the case, the Wheelock Marden Board should not be bringing out that announcement- if that reflects the view of the Board.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.248" class="para" id="p3.5.248">3.5.248</a> Mr. Shaw went on to emphasise that it was what the WM Board would decide, not the view of an individual director, which was importantand continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Now, are you in a position at this point of time really to form any view as to what the future looks likely to be because if youare not then it must be very difficult at this point of time for any one Director to put himself in the shoes of all the other Directors,itâs difficult for you to say thereâs no reasonable prospect or thereâs little reasonable prospect because it is entirely dependenton the views of the other Directors.  I can obviously appreciate that you may have a personal view on it but in this case we areperhaps discussing whether the Wheelock Marden Board as a whole is likely to come to a â yesâ or â noâ answer.  I would havethought, assuming this has been put out in good faith, itâs really very difficult for anyone to say at this point â I donâtthink there is any real chance that they will come up with a yes answerâ.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.249" class="para" id="p3.5.249">3.5.249</a> Eventually, Mr. Poon accepted that WMI could wait for a week and could not be accused of fraudulent trading.  Each director thenconfirmed that he had no special knowledge and that WMâs announcement that it was considering WMIâs request had been made ingood faith.  Mr. Lees commented:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â maybe I could say first of all, from the cashflows that youâ ve all had it would seem that provided we can come forward withsome support in the form of this US$12 million that there should not be a problem for two or three years provided we get support,therefore with that prospect in mind it would be in the shareholdersâ interests to continue trading, if we believe it would bein their best interests to take the support but I think that until weâ ve got a definite â no, there will be no supportâ wewould not be acting in the shareholdersâ interests.  As long as we are legally covered but we are not actually, as you put it,fraudulently trading.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.250" class="para" id="p3.5.250">3.5.250</a> Mr. Lees then inquired whether, if there was no support, the banks would help.  Mr. Reynolds thought it would be difficult becausethe banks would not believe WM would not support its subsidiary.  Mr. Lees summed up by saying:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â I think it would be irresponsible ... put it the other way round, I think it would be irresponsible not to trade for another weekif there is reasonable prospect that the parent company is seriously considering it.  They said they are considering it and I thinkto take precipitous action on our part would be totally wrong in this case.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.251" class="para" id="p3.5.251">3.5.251</a> The meeting went on to discuss the press announcement.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.252" class="para" id="p3.5.252">3.5.252</a> The following day, WMI received a letter from Mr. Shaw with advice on the Dalians, which was that the yard could sue WMI under theletter of intent if the buyers failed to take delivery.  WM also received a letter from two directors, Mr. Tang and Mr. Lo, writtenin consultation with three other directors, Mr. Ying, Mr. Hsu and Irene Cheung, in which they posed questions about WMIâs requestfor support and the Rothschildsâ report of 8th September.  The queries included:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1) Why Rothschilds recommended US$12 million when there was only a US$3 million deficit in the short-term?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2) Whether Rothschilds had tested the sensitive assumptions or consulted experts on predicted charter rates?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>3) What view Rothschilds took of the likelihood of US$12 million being repaid?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>4) Whether Rothschilds had considered the net market value of WMIâs assets?</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.253" class="para" id="p3.5.253">3.5.253</a> These queries were passed to Rothschilds who submitted a further report on 21st September.  After the introduction, they dealt withâ Rationale for Supportâ</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Throughout our assignment one of our prime concerns has been to examine the rationale for support by Wheelock Marden of WMI. In view of the importance of this at the present time we consider it appropriate to reiterate here the various issues of relevancewhich we have identified.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">i) Wheelock Marden must consider the protection of its material financial interest in WMI, a company which has been a valuable memberof the group for a long period of time and which was included in the consolidated accounts at 31st December, 1982 at its book networth of HK$306 million.  This does not take into account Wheelock Mardenâs projected commitment under the Rangelock financingof US$4.5 million over the next 27 months or its current account surplus with WMI of US1.7 million.  The level of support which hasbeen proposed for WMI is also relatively small in the context of the Wheelock Marden consolidated net assets of HK$2.1 billion, particularlygiven the financial resources and credit lines available to the Wheelock Marden group.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ii) There may be no legal obligation on the part of the directors of a parent company to provide or arrange financial support forits subsidiary, the directorsâ only responsibility being to take whatever action is in the best interests of the parent company. However the ramifications of withholding support for a subsidiary could be far-reaching for a parent company with the damaging effectson its reputation possibly reflected in withdrawal of credit lines and loss of future contracts, not to mention the adverse publicitywhich such a move might attract.  In a recent case in England the initial decision of the Board of a public company, Esperanza PLC,not to stand behind one of its subsidiaries created substantial public comment.  Indeed during the legal proceedings Lord Denningsaid: â It only needs half a momentâs thought to realise the enormous damage which would be done to the holding company if itdid not support the individual members of its group.  I should have though that the clear expectation of everybody would be thatEsperanza Ltd. would support these individual comapnies - as, beyond doubt, they ought to do.â  The Board eventually reversed itsinitial decision and supported the subsidiary on the basis that the adverse commercial consequences of not doing so would have beenfar-reaching.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">iii) The US$12 million performance guarantee given by Wheelock Marden in respect of the Rangelock financing in January, 1983 couldbe regarded as a precedent for support being provided to WMI by its parent company.  So far as we are aware the financial standingof WMI has not deteriorated materially since then.  The Board of Wheelock Marden should therefore be prepared to justify withdrawalof support for WMI at this time.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">iv) The position of Wheelock Marden is complicated by the fact that it is not only the parent company but also the general managerof WMI, for which it receives a fee and an annual commission.  Whilst this position does not impose any obligation on the Board ofWheelock Marden to extend support to WMI, criticism particularly from the minority shareholders of WMI may be a possibility if supportis withheld.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It has been our conclusion that the only circumstances in which Wheelock Marden could reasonably withhold support for WMI would bewhere the Board were to take the view that the case against a significant improvement in the trading prospects of WMI was overwhelmingin terms of the financial impact on the group.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In our letter dated 8th September, 1983 we stated that we did not believe that the case could be proved as at that date.  This conclusionwas based on the cash flow projection for WMI dated 1st September, 1983 which showed a maximum cash deficit of US$3 million up to31st August, 1986.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.254" class="para" id="p3.5.254">3.5.254</a> Rothschilds went on to examine the six sensitive assumptions in greater detail and said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1) Local brokers had confirmed that the charter-hire rates were reasonable.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2) Whether WMI could cancel the Dalians at no cost remained to be clarified.  However, WM would have to consider whether for politicaland commercial reasons delivery should be taken.  If the WM Board approved delivery then â the adverse effect on the cash flowof WMI could be materialâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>3) The timing and sale of the Spanish vessels were assumed as reasonable by Mr. Brothers and Mr. A. Marden.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>4) Interest rates had been confirmed as reasonable by Rothschilds currency management office in London.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>5) The explanations and assurances by Mr. Brothers and Mr. Lees satisfied them that the Pacnorse loan would not be called in the nextthree years.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>6) WWW was in a strong position and would not call for shareholdersâ funds.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.255" class="para" id="p3.5.255">3.5.255</a> Rothschilds also confirmed that the cash flow dated 1st September had been prepared with due care and attention on the basis of reasonableassumptions.  They re-affirmed what they had said about support in their earlier report and said a short-term solution should besought with minimal financial commitment from WM â in order to create a breathing space for WMIâ.  They suggested a short-termstand-by credit facility or the purchase of WMIâs shares in WWW.  They repeated their earlier justification for a facility of US$12million but said that on the basis of a three-year cash flow, using the same assumptions save for rescheduling as the cash flow of1st September, which showed a deficit in only one month in the next two years, a facility of US$4 million for two years:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â would therefore enable WMI to remain solvent for the foreseeable future and await the widely expected recovery in the shippingmarket without having recourse to those lending banks which have received the restructuring proposal.  A small number of banks arecurrently deferring agreement to the provision of finance to WMI for both newbuildings and sale and leaseback arrangements untilsome evidence of support from Wheelock Marden is given but we have been advised by Mr. Brothers that a facility of US$4 million limitedto two years is likely to be sufficient to induce these banks to provide the necessary finance.

They remarked:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The three-year facility would offer WMI a greater opportunity to recover from its current financial problems and to resecure creditfacilities, which are currently frozen, but it would also demand a greater commitment from Wheelock Marden.

In his covering note to Mr. Freeland in London, Mr. Shaw said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â As mentioned to you on the telephone, my personal view is that commercially it is a situation where WMI should carry on since,despite its serious financial position, it is possible that accommodation can be reached for its various creditors which would enableWMI to carry on in some form or another.

What we are looking for is advicefrom Counsel which would enable Directors properly to carry on and to give them as much legal â ropeâ as possible.</p>        <p class="quote">Having said that, it should be borne in mind that heavy reliance is being placed on the legal advice in this case and we must ensurethat the advice is comprehensive and cannot subsequently be attacked by Directors.

However, it is known that doubt exists amongst certain of the Directors ofWM as to whether it is prudent for the parent company to inject further funds into shipping, which is currently a very depressedindustry, and it is possible that those Directors of WM who are to make this decision (those Directors of WM who are also Directorsof WMI are disqualified from voting by virtue of their â interestâ) will not feel able to vote in favour of providing the supportrequested by WMI.  This will obviously depend upon their consideration of all relevant factors at the Board Meeting on 23 Septemberand on the advice received from their financial advisers.

In a covering note to Mr. Freeland he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Have had further meeting this morning with Robbie Brothers, Schroders &amp; Chartered and others to discuss the position.  Therewas considerable discussion as to whether, if WM say that the only basis on which they can provide support is by getting a proposalapproved at general meeting, this should be rejected.  It would probably produce the worst of all possible worlds, in that WMI wouldbe faced with a period of further uncertainty which, apart from paralysing efforts to resolve their various problems, would leadto a situation where, if the shareholders turned down the proposal, the result would almost certainly be liquidation.  What we havebeen discussing today is whether it may be possible to come up with proposals whereby, rather than straight financial support, WMIwould either sell its interest in Worldwide Wheelock to WM or would be able to raise bank financing against the security of its shareholdingin Worldwide Wheelock.</p>        <p class="quote">I would be grateful if you could pass the attached Supplemental Memorandum to Counsel.

It was:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1.

Position which seems to concern him is that while WMI (and its subsidiaries) continue trading they are inevitably incurring newcredit e.g. bunkers and other day to day operating expenses.  In order that they may continue to do so without incurring personalliability, they must have reasonable grounds for believing that there is some prospect that the new creditor (and existing creditors)will be paid in full within a reasonable time.  If shareholder support is not forthcoming then Directors must satisfy themselvesthat without such support new creditors will be paid.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.268" class="para" id="p3.5.268">3.5.268</a> The summary continued that if there was no positive indication of shareholders support, major creditors would have to be approachedto see if they would support WMI but</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â unless Schroders and Directors were able to say within 7 days that (taking into account the creditors reappraisal of the situationfollowing the lack of shareholder support) there was a reasonable prospect of an agreement in principle being reached on a schemewhereby the Directors could be satisfied that there was a reasonable prospect etc. of all creditors being paid in full, the Directorswould then have no alternative but to cease trading.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.269" class="para" id="p3.5.269">3.5.269</a> The summary concluded that counsel:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â was not particularly encouraging, but he is obviously prepared to go along with a continuation of trading on the basis describedabove.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.270" class="para" id="p3.5.270">3.5.270</a> The WM Board met on 23rd September at 3:30 p.m.  They considered the Rothschildsâ report of 21st September and WMIâs letter proposingthe sale of the WWW shares.  Mr. Young of Rothschilds said if the market did not improve during the breathing space â further actionwould have to be taken possibly involving the dismantling of the WMI Group in an orderly mannerâ.  Mr. Tang said he and a numberof directors felt US$12 million to be too large but felt US$4 million was feasible.

Mr. Reynolds of S&amp;C was asked what lender reaction might be.  Hisopinion was:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â that the secured lenders would do nothing for the time being, but that they would be prepared to come to an agreement with theCompany.  He advised that the unsecured lenders would present more of a problem, because the US$4 million stand-by credit facilitywould not assist them in any way and in any case they had the power to put the Company into liquidation.  Mr. Reynolds went on tosay that the cashflow showed a deficit of US$3.5 million in December 1985 which took no account of the Dalian newbuildings.  He pointedout that on present projections the Company could not afford to proceed with those newbuildings.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.272" class="para" id="p3.5.272">3.5.272</a> Asked about the legal position:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Mr. Shaw advised that provided the Directors continued to hold the view that taking into account the proposed stand-by facilityand other relevant factors there was a reasonable prospect that the Company would be able to pay off all creditors at a later dateit would be possible for the Company to continue business for the time being.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.273" class="para" id="p3.5.273">3.5.273</a> It was agreed to accept WMâs proposal and that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â with the provision of the stand-by credit facility the Company was an acceptable basis for continuing to trade, but that the positionwould have to be monitored very carefully on a continuing basis.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.274" class="para" id="p3.5.274">3.5.274</a> An announcement was made the same day which indicated that WMI â no longer intends to request a rescheduling of future obligationsunder existing secured loan facilitiesâ over the two-year period.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.275" class="para" id="p3.5.275">3.5.275</a> Next day, Mr. Brothers telexed Orient Leasing with details of the announcement and asked to draw down on the loan on Manila Faithas soon as possible.  He informed WWS of this.  The matter was, however, not so easily resolved.  Notwithstanding the US$4 millionloan facility, Orient Leasing on 27th September asked that HSBC reschedule its loan repayments, that being a reference to Marilock. HSBC, however, felt it could not accept any new commitments.  Mr. Brothers therefore had to write to Orient Leasing on 29th Septemberexplaining the arrangements which WMI had with the bank, i.e. a guarantee of the Sterling lease payments to C&amp;W, the extent ofwhich depended on Marilockâs earnings.

He reported a netloss of HK$14.8 million against a profit of HK$2.6 million the previous year or after adjustments a loss of HK$11.4 million againsta profit of HK$11.6 million.  He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The market continues at abysmal levels not altogether different from those prevalent last year.  The primary cause behind thedrop in profits is the additional losses incurred by Pacific Norse Shipping Co.

This was particularlyso last Spring when there was an appreciable improvement in rates (although from very low levels) and an appreciation in ship values. Advantage was taken of this improvement to fix several of our vessels over the summer months as well as commence the planned tonnagedisposal programme.  This programme is centred on the older vessels and sales were concluded for the â Asia Moralityâ, â AsiaLoyaltyâ, â Asia Flamingoâ and â Asia Fidelityâ.

Projected sales of two particular vessels did not materialise and the Group was faced with a liquidity crisis in March.  These difficultieswere only partially alleviated by the sale of its shares in Wheelock Marden &amp; Stewart.  The only immediate course to retain liquiditywas a suspension of principal repayments to the Companyâs Banks.  This action of course led to a great deal of adverse publicity. An application was also submitted to the Parent Company for support by way of a loan or guarantee.  This request was subsequentlyreferred to Hong Kong Realty whose reply declining to assist was not received until mid-September.  A decision eventually by theParent Company to provide a secured stand-by credit facility for US$4 million for a period of two years has now enabled the Groupto return to more normal trading conditions.  The earlier request to the Companyâs Banks for a rescheduling of existing debt hasbeen temporarily dropped although it is still intended to approach the Banks in due course for a renegotiation of the loan terms. Regrettably the position taken by the Board of the Parent Company over the matter of support has greatly exacerbated the situationin the most public manner and the task of negotiating better terms with the Banks will be a difficult one.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.282" class="para" id="p3.5.282">3.5.282</a> The WMI Board met the same day.

An idea of how this was approachedis given in a memo dated 11th October from Mr. Cameron to Mr. Campbell, who was to be responsible for WMI during Mr. Cameronâsabsence.  Mr. Cameron said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â In these very difficult times it is not possible to give precise instructions, however my recent practice has been to accumulatefunds and only make payments in respect of:</p>        <p class="quote">a)  Interest</p>        <p class="quote">b)  Items to avoid delays in vessels sailings, or other hold ups etc.</p>        <p class="quote">c)  Items for which C.W.

US$5 million of the proposed loan would still be outstanding. Japan Leasing wished to reduce the amount of the loan but this would be resisted.  As to Manila Faith, Mr. Brothers said Showa Leasingwere considering and that an approach might be made to WWS to put the loan on a firmer basis.  He also said he intended going toChina to negotiate price and terms for the Dalians.  A request to Allied to roll over the US$1 million loan until December was notedand, because the loan should be repaid by 31 December, it was agreed to sell Asia Rindo.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.301" class="para" id="p3.5.301">3.5.301</a> On 1 November, a 10 year cash flow incorporating retention accounts was prepared (App. 2/19).

Mr. Brothers reported that Japan Leasing had indicated they might be preparedto go to US$9 million on World Rainbow.  He had said to them he expected at least US$10 million.  Mr. Lees advised that WWS wouldagree a two-month extension of the loan on Manila Faith (an agreement which was formally confirmed next day).  Mr. Brothers alsosaid that there might be a possibility of sale and lease-back for the two BW newbuildings.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.303" class="para" id="p3.5.303">3.5.303</a> On 3rd November, S&amp;C submitted their account for HK$431,500.00 outstanding on their total fee of HK$1.25 million.

Mr. A. Marden informed them that Japan Leasing had not approved the sale and lease-backof World Rainbow.  However, negotiations were continuing.  Mr. A. Marden was authorized to negotiate on a price of US$9.5 milliondown to US$9 million.  The committee noted that a drawing of US$500,000.00 under WMâs facility would be made on 23rd November. Further, because Allied had agreed only to roll over its loan to 30th November, Asia Rindo would have to be sold or refinanced withminimum delay.  The committee also discussed the Dalians, noting that the price was US$30.5 million while the current market valuewas only US$20 million.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.306" class="para" id="p3.5.306">3.5.306</a> On 11th November, WMI(UK) made a further demand on WM under the Rangelock guarantee for US$204,000.00.  On the same day, by circularWMI directors agreed to give notice of intention to draw down US$500,000.00 on 23rd November under the WM facility because the refinancingof World Rainbow and Manila Faith, which had been assumed in WMIâs cash flows, had not taken place.  Also, Grindlays advised thatfollowing the sale of three vessels its US$11 million loan had been reduced to US$4.5 million.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.307" class="para" id="p3.5.307">3.5.307</a> The WM directors met on 16th November and approved the draw-down.

They noted thatUS$1.1 million was due on the Marilock loan in December.  It had been assumed that this would be rolled over as part of a three-yearpackage but HSS had indicated it should be paid.  It was agreed that ways of raising this sum be explored including a third mortgageon World Rainbow. </p>    <p><a name="p3.5.312" class="para" id="p3.5.312">3.5.312</a> On 28th November, Mr. Campbell produced a memo on short-term cash flow forecasts for WMI.  He had set up a shipping account committeewithin his department, which had earlier defined â critical paymentsâ and â urgent overdue paymentsâ.  In his memo, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Initially we should confine payments in the short term cash forecast to those which are classified as critical.</p>        <p class="quote">Once we have prepared a forecast showing only critical payments we can determine whether or not there will be sufficient funds tomeet them.</p>        <p class="quote">Later we may include other payments particularly those which are classified as urgent overdue payments.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">If a forecast projects a deficiency then management must be approached to take some action to make good the deficiency.

They discussed fallback arrangements for World Rainbow in case Japan Leasing did notproceed.  Alternatives were an approach to HSS or the possibility of an increased loan by Grindlays.  It was also agreed that refinancingof Manila Faith by 5th January be given priority.  The committee also heard that Mr. Brothers had reported a proposal that BW acquirehull 912 for US$1.  Subject to a review of the figures, the committee agreed in principle.  The committee noted that the Allied loanwas repayable that day and considered how the vessel might be refinanced.  It was agreed that local banks and RBS be approached. It was also agreed to acquire WMC and WMS from WM at net asset value on 1st January 1984.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.315" class="para" id="p3.5.315">3.5.315</a> Mr. A. Marden followed up on 2nd December by writing to Grindlays about World Rainbow with a three-year cash flow which, inter alia,included liquidation of WWW.  The WMI shareholding was valued at US$17 million.  After a deduction of US$3 million in respect ofWMâs Rangelock guarantee, US$14 million would be injected into the cash flow.  Mr. A. Marden concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â As you can see from the graph, the extra US$14.00M just about does the trick but the sale and lease-back of the â World Rainbowâis an integral part of the managementâs plan to get the Company back on an even keel again.

This was correctedto US$122,800.00 on 5th December to reflect the increase in the loan by US$210,000.00 on 2nd December.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.317" class="para" id="p3.5.317">3.5.317</a> On 5th December, BOA wrote to Mr. Brothers informing him that while he had been away in November Portland Investments Ltd., the ownerof Fenlock, had missed an interest and principal payment on 2nd November, although it was paid on 10th November.  The bank said itfelt it appropriate to take no action â in spirit of our relationshipâ but asked for a strong effort to honour payment obligations.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.318" class="para" id="p3.5.318">3.5.318</a> The shipping committee met 8th December.  There had been no progress on refinancing World Rainbow.  The committee noted that an interestpayment on Manila Faith was not yet paid, that US$50,000.00 would be paid on account, and that US$64,000.00 was due when the vesselwould be redelivered on 11th December from charter to Iran.

It was</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â to summarize the latest position of the Group as regards what has already been settled and what is hoped will be achieved in thefuture.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.320" class="para" id="p3.5.320">3.5.320</a> In the paper, Mr. Brothers said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â <u>General Strategy</u>.  By and large all existing secured creditors are fully secured by their respective charges.  It is imperative that the Group retainsas liquid a position as possible if it is to avoid a repeat of the crisis that developed in the Spring of 1983 when it ran out offunds.  The Group therefore intends to negotiate with all existing secured creditors to agree a loan repayment profile that willreduce principal repayments to a level that can be funded by the earnings of the asset charged whilst at the same time ensuring thatthe bank concerned remains fully secured.  Lloyds Bank International have already agreed to this arrangement with regard to the m.v.Rangelock.  The other banks significantly affected are The Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, Banque Nationale de Parisand Bank of America and discussions to this end will be initiated in the near future.  Special arrangements have to be worked outwith respect to the Unsecured Banks and Pacnorse and this is dealt with later in the paper.</p>        <p class="quote">A cornerstone of managementâs plan is to reduce overall debt exposure and this will be achieved by selling all of the older vesselsas the opportunity arises plus all four of the Spanish built newbuildings.  So far this year, the Group has sold five vessels.</p>        <p class="quote">Liquidity will be retained by the refinancing of one vessel (â World Rainbowâ) and a liquidation or sale of the Groupâs holdingin World-Wide Wheelock.</p>        <p class="quote">No new credits will be negotiated or newbuildings accepted if same would severely strain current liquidity.

Also Mr. Brothers wrote toLBI and Midland Bank asking that interest on the loans relating to Annalock and BW912, due on 13th December, be rolled over for onemonth while negotiations with the Fund continued.  LBI refused next day and asked for payment of US$999,000.00 on 14th December. Midland however agreed.  At the same time there was a similar disagreement over the Marilock loan which was syndicated between LBIand MMB - MMB was prepared to roll over principal due on 14th December but LBI was not.  There was a flurry of telex correspondence. On 14th December, it was agreed LBI would roll over interest due on BW 912 to 21st December but that the payment due on Marilockmust be made.  This was achieved by obtaining from HSS a second loan facility of US$1.13 million repayable on 30th March 1986 againstfourth mortgages on Asia Culture and Asia Hunter, a fourth assignment of earnings on Asia Hunter and a WMI guarantee.  It was alsoagreed that the earlier facility of US$1.16 million should also be repayable on 30th March 1986.  Approval by WMI directors was givento these two matters by circular on 14th December and 20th December. </p>    <p><a name="p3.5.325" class="para" id="p3.5.325">3.5.325</a> The shipping committee also met on 14th December at which Mr. Brothersâ paper was tabled.  Mr. Brothers reported that the chancesof Japan Leasing providing finance for World Rainbow were more remote.  It was therefore agreed â it was of the utmost importanceto pursue other alternativesâ, â that it would not be feasible to get an existing creditor to increase their exposureâ andit â would be given top priority with a view to finalizing matters early in the new yearâ.  As to Manila Faith, Mr. Brotherssaid he had had discussions with Ansbacher about a sale and lease-back but Ansbacher felt another bank should be brought in.  Hesaid he had asked Ansbacher to indicate their willingness to refinance so that he might persuade WWS to extend the WWW loan beyond5th January.  In the meantime, he had asked Mr. Lee about liquidating WWW and Mr. Lee had indicated that Sir Y.K. Pao might be infavour if it solved the Manila Faith loan.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.326" class="para" id="p3.5.326">3.5.326</a> Mr. Brothers also reported on the BW position and Allied loan.  As to the latter, Ansbacher was proposing a sale and lease-back ofAsia Rindo but it would be expensive and Ansbacher doubted if documentation could be completed by 29th December.  Ansbacher was preparedto advance US$1 million against an Allied guarantee.  The meeting discussed whether Mr. Brothers should go to Beijing about the Dalians. If so, he should take a cash flow and advise the Chinese â that as the Group had no funds available it would not be possible toproceed with the purchase ... â.  It would be preferable for the Chinese not to take legal action in view of the legal opinionabout WMIâs obligations.  Finally, Mr. Campbell reported â insufficient funds were availableâ to make payment due to LBI andMidland Bank that day and other arrangements would be made.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.327" class="para" id="p3.5.327">3.5.327</a> On 17th December, Mr. Campbell provided a calculation of WMIâs share upon liquidation of WWW.  This would be approximately US$13.7million but that did not take account of the Manila Faith loan then amounting to US$10.7 million.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.328" class="para" id="p3.5.328">3.5.328</a> On 19th December, Mr. Marden delivered his report as chairman of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association.  He said 1983 had been evenmore difficult than forecast.  Although there had been some activity earlier in the year, it had fallen back by summer.  There was,however, a slight note of optimism for the oil trade.</p>    <p><a name="p3.5.329" class="para" id="p3.5.329">3.5.329</a> On the same day, Wardley produced a report for Mr. Marden and â othersâ.  Apart from Mr. Marden, it was not apparently seen byany other Defendant director.  Its purpose was to examine a possible purchase of WMI by a group of investors, probably headed byMr. Marden, for a nominal consideration.  The investors would when required inject some fresh capital.  Wardleyâs analysis andcomment was based upon information supplied by WMI management.  Wardley took the view, inter alia, that charter rates for 1985 wouldhave to double those projected for 1984 to meet cash outflows, that the over-supply of bulk-carriers in the 40-70,000 tonne rangewould be apparent for many years, and that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â there will be upturns in the market but that these will probably be of short duration and consequently the opportunities for WMIto trade out of its shortfall will be limited.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.330" class="para" id="p3.5.330">3.5.330</a> In relation to Pacnorse, Wardley noted the US$12.5 million loan was repayable on demand and that Pacnorse cash flows projected adeficit beginning in August 1984, so</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The cash flow position of Pacnorse would therefore seem even more urgent than that of WMI and it is dependent upon an uplift inthe market at an earlier stage.  The position of Pacnorse therefore requires detailed examination since its possible insolvency couldalso result in the insolvency of the WMI group of companies.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.331" class="para" id="p3.5.331">3.5.331</a> In considering market reaction, Wardley said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â With regard to the public, it has been well publicised for some time now that WMI is in or faces severe financial difficulties. The public is also fully aware of the attempts made by WMI to obtain support from within the Wheelock Marden group of companiesand of the limited success which protracted efforts has encountered.  Faced with what is at best an unhelpful and at worst an obstructiveparent company, the market would probably view an acquisition as a bona fide positive attempt to tackle the problems of WMI freeof the restrictive attitude of the remainder of the Wheelock Marden group of companies.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.332" class="para" id="p3.5.332">3.5.332</a> Wardley concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(a)  substantial future uplifts in the charter market are necessary if WMI is to meet its liabilities from increased earnings andsales of vessels;</p>        <p class="quote">(b)  the WMI fleet does not show a sufficient degree of diversity and is highly reliant on Panamax vessels which are currently uneconomic;</p>        <p class="quote">(c)  our view of the world shipping markets is not encouraging in that it is unlikely that a sustained uplift will occur in the bulkcarrier market - at best the upturns will be of short duration which will allow a partial trading out by WMI.</p>        <p class="quote">Based on the above, we consider that the risks seemingly inherent in the proposed acquisition outweigh the possible returns and wewould not recommend the acquisition.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.333" class="para" id="p3.5.333">3.5.333</a> The WM Board met next day.  In relation to WMI, Mr. Lees reported that the oil deal was progressing and included the four Spanishnewbuildings and Manila Faith, and he</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â noted that whilst the proposed sale would involve an overall loss, it would mean that the vessels concerned would be out of WMIâsbooks and would considerably ease the situation as far as WMI was concerned.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.5.334" class="para" id="p3.5.334">3.5.334</a> Mr. Lees also said that if WWW was liquidated WM would be given alternative security for the pledge on WWW shares, perhaps a mortgageof a debt-free Manila Faith.

Mr. Brothers alsoreported that there was little doubt agreement would be reached for the sale of seven ships to Iran for US$88 million in exchangefor oil.  The prices, although a little disappointing, were above the market.  The next step would be the sale of the oil which wouldhave to be completed at the same time so that the Group would know where it stood.  Discussion about the sale followed.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.2" class="para" id="p3.6.2">3.6.2</a> The Minutes of the meeting later recorded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â <u>PAYMENTS</u>:   RJFB advised that it had become possible for the Group to secure a certain amount of trade credit because suppliers, etc. werenow somewhat less concerned about the Groupâs financial difficulties. However, with the delay in the re-financing of the â WorldRainbowâ and the employment of certain vessels on Voyage basis requiring larger initial payments, it was temporarily impossibleto generate sufficient funds to support the day-to-day operation of the Groupâs vessels.  This unsatisfactory situation would,he said, shortly be remedied on expected receipts of funds from re-financing and freights.  Whereas we knew that the situation wouldbe remedied, the non-payment of over-due bills would if allowed to continue create an unnecessary lack of outside confidence in theGroup which would only make our position more difficult in the long run.  Moreover there were instances such as had happened duringthe previous week when the â Rangelockâ had almost missed transitting the Suez Canal due to lack of funds.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">RJFB advised that whereas he was most anxious to preserve the US$4 million working capital facility from Wheelock Marden, he believedthat there could be instances whereby it should be used to meet certain unavoidable commitments especially as in the case of bunkers,compensatory freights would be due in the near future thereby enabling repayment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">General discussion then followed on the delays in the re-financing of the â Manila Faithâ and the â World Rainbowâ which hadresulted in the funds assumed in the cashflow not being available for operational purposes.  WJL stated that it was important notto deviate from the cashflow shown to the Wheelock Marden Board.  HWL however felt that provided definite funds were anticipatedand these could be limited to and repaid from earnings of a particular vessel, the Stand-by Facility should be utilized.  It wasfinally agreed that documentation be prepared for an immediate drawn-down of a further amount of approximately US$500,000 under theWheelock Marden secured standby credit facility on the basis that the amount would be repaid upon draw down of the Ansbacher loanagainst the â Asia Rindoâ.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.3" class="para" id="p3.6.3">3.6.3</a> On 6th January, the WMI directors agreed by circular to ask to draw down a further US$500,000.00 because the refinancing of WorldRainbow and Manila Faith was not yet concluded.  Repayment would be made out of the refinancing, expected shortly, of Asia Rindoby Ansbacher.  WMI needed some US$340,000.00 for bunkers and US$170,000.00 for interest on Manila Faith which WWS were insistingshould be paid on 6th January as a condition for an extension of the loan for one month to 6th February.  WM approved the draw-downon 9th January.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.4" class="para" id="p3.6.4">3.6.4</a> Unfortunately for Mr. Brothers and WMI a new problem, designed to throw WMIâs careful cash flows into disarray, now began to emerge. It came from the joint-venture, Pacnorse, and was summarized by Mr. Brothers thus in para 252.4 of his witness statement</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Pacnorseâs problems were twofold.  Firstly, the failure by shippers to ship contractual quantities under the contracts of affreightment. This resulted in a loss of income.  There was not a great deal that Pacnorse could do.  They could not sensibly sue the shippers,who were in breach of the contracts of affreightment, principally because this would be bad for future business and also becausein some cases the shippers were in jurisdictions where this would probably not prove worthwhile.  Secondly, those pool ships whichwere on the spot market were affected by the drop in market rates.  Pacnorseâs problem was a gradual decline to a position whereincome did not cover expenditure caused by the progressive ending of its contracts of affreightment.  The extent of the problem wasunforeseen in 1983.  At that time, the problems had been the Grand Marine charters and the Namura newbuildings.  The first problemhad been overcome in 1983 by Pacnorse repurchasing six of the eight vessels from Grand Marine and taking over the leases of the remainingtwo vessels which were owned by Orient Leasing.  It was thought that the second problem would be overcome by a sale of Namura hull865.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.5" class="para" id="p3.6.5">3.6.5</a> Namura 865 was to be sold to an Egyptian buyer, Misr Edco, financed by the Japanese yard against a letter of credit from an Egyptianbank, Bank Misr.  On 7th January, a telex was received from Mr.  Gabrielsen of Jebsens indicating there were doubts about whetherthe bank would give the letter of credit.  This followed an earlier communication from him in December about Pacnorse generally,in which he queried whether Pacnorse could say it could not take delivery of Namura 865</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Without inferring that the shareholders are unable to come up with sufficient repayments of sharehol[d]er loans as well providecash for bank guarantee-security?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">it would seem difficult for pacnorse to take this position if the company had kept the dlrs 25 mill.  in a decemt bank instead.  theother creditors in pacnorse would obviously have view on acceptability of taking delivery, but we have achieved a substantial defermentof delivery of the other three already.  is therefore our (pacnorses) position defendable?â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.6" class="para" id="p3.6.6">3.6.6</a> Mr. Brothers wrote to Mr. Gabrielsen on 9th January.  He said:  â1984 is to be a critical year for Pacnorseâ and referred toâ the desperate straitsâ of Pacnorse.  He made suggestions for improving operational expenses and then said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â There can be absolutely no question of Pacnorse taking the Namura 865.  The clearer this becomes to Namura, the more likely âJapan Inc.â will find a way to accept the Egyptian risk that is involved and it is vital that this sale should go through.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.7" class="para" id="p3.6.7">3.6.7</a> Mr. Brothers noted Mr. Gabrielsenâs comments about Pacnorse saying it could not take delivery and continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Our total Shareholdersâ Loan is the <u>only</u> cushion available to Pacnorse.  It must be preserved to meet our obligations to our existing Bankers who I believe have to have overallpriority if our resources do not stretch to covering our total commitments.  If this was a year ago, I would have said that Pacnorsemust stand by its total commitments.  However in WMIâs case and in facing a cash situation which made this impossible, we had toadopt priorities which have effectively enabled us to keep faith with our Bankers while achieving very substantial concessions fromthe Yards.  It wasnâ t easy and no doubt our good name has suffered but it was the right course nevertheless.  If you run threeyear projections using todayâs income figures, you will see how important it is to preserve our position which will be doubly illustratedif you then superimpose the acceptance and subsequent trading of 865 let alone the other three newbuildings.  I know that your Organisationis in the direct firing line here but by facing the problem now, we give Pacnorse a good chance of surviving whatever levels themarket may hold in the future.  While hoping for the best, we must plan for the worst which in this case the likelihood is as I haveproposed your projections should be prepared.  (Incidentally, surely our Bankers will not be happy with projections that stop at12/84?  In our own case we provide until end 1986).  If, without a market recovery we cannot see three years ahead <u>with</u> shareholder support but <u>without</u> the Namuras then I would reluctantly query the advisability of either shareholder giving any support although, I quickly stress,I donâ t think this situation yet applies.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.8" class="para" id="p3.6.8">3.6.8</a> Finally, Mr. Brothers said:  â I do not believe that there will be a problem for us in paying interest quarterly and it is clearlynecessaryâ.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.9" class="para" id="p3.6.9">3.6.9</a> Earlier WMI cash flows in February and March 1983 had provided for repayment of the Pacnorse loans by instalments in 1983/84.  However,agreement by Pacnorse to repurchase eight vessels sold to Grand Marine obviated the need to repay.  From the cash flow of 6th April1983 onwards, no provision was made for repayment.  However, a cash flow dated 24th January 1984 was to incorporate quarterly paymentsof interest at 10%.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.10" class="para" id="p3.6.10">3.6.10</a> On 10th January, Ansbacher, which had provided top-up finance for the Sestaos, agreed to defer interest due on 13th January.  OfUS$165,192.00 then due, US$126,000.00 would be paid from a retention account while the balance of US$36,000.00 would be advancedto the borrowers at Libor plus 3Â½% and would be repayable on 31st January.  This letter bears Mr. Brothersâ manuscript note toMr. Campbell:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â We should now make payment of the outstanding interest to avoid the excessive costs.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.11" class="para" id="p3.6.11">3.6.11</a> On 11th January, there was a meeting of the shipping committee at which Mr. Brothers reported, inter alia, that a decision was stillawaited from Chartered Bank about Manila Faith and that Shell had expressed interest in acquiring the Iranian oil.  A paper preparedby Mr. Campbell indicated that the sale of the five WMI vessels for oil would produce a net cash inflow of US$810,000.00.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.12" class="para" id="p3.6.12">3.6.12</a> On 12th January, WMI directors by circular approved refinancing of Asia Rindo. The vessel was sold to and chartered back by Ansbacherfor almost US$1.5 million.  The outstanding Allied loan was paid off leaving nearly US$500,000.00 cash for WMI.  The cash was usedon 17th January to repay a similar sum drawn from the WM facility.  But on that day, WMI gave notice of its need to draw down a furtherUS$900,000.00 because of the failure to refinance World Rainbow and Manila Faith.  WM approved by circular the same day.  WMI certifiedthat US$924,000.00 needed for interest, crewing fees and bunkers could not be paid out of other funds available.  US$900,000.00 wasrepaid on 30th January when Thorlock (one of the Sestao hulls) charter-hire was received.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.13" class="para" id="p3.6.13">3.6.13</a> The shipping committee also met on 17th January.  Mr. Brothers reported that Chartered Bank had declined to refinance World Rainbow. He had contacted Grindlays who were working on a possible refinancing.  He hoped to finalize matter soon.  Mr. Brothers also reportedthat WWS seemed content to allow the situation in respect of the loan on Manila Faith to continue pending the sale to Iran.  Therewas, however, some disappointing news about the oil because Iran was posing difficulties about purchasers of the oil and would notaccept Shell.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.14" class="para" id="p3.6.14">3.6.14</a> Later that day, the WM Board met.  They discussed matters arising from the management committee minutes.  In particular, that thesale of five ships for oil would result in a loss of US$14 million, that is in the profit and loss account, but that there wouldbe a reduced cash drain and some US$800,000.00 would be realized.  The Board also noted that discussions (between Mr. Brothers andSir Y.K. Pao) had taken place concerning the possible liquidation of WWW.  Such liquidation would realize about US$13 million forWMI on current values.  In response to a query by Mr. Ortiz-Patino, it was agreed to prepared a cash flow and balance sheet reflectingthe sale of BW 912 and of the ships for oil.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.15" class="para" id="p3.6.15">3.6.15</a> On 18 January Midland Bank declared an event of default in relation to BW 912 for non-payment of interest on 13 January.  It reservedits rights.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.16" class="para" id="p3.6.16">3.6.16</a> A cash flow was prepared on about 24th January (App. 2/20).  The assumptions included the sale of five ships for oil, the sale ofBW 912, the liquidation of WWW and cancellation of the Dalians without penalty.  It showed a deficit of US$13 million in December1986.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.17" class="para" id="p3.6.17">3.6.17</a> Mr. Campbell produced four balance sheets on 31st January.  With WMI vessels and Pacnorse at book value and cost respectively, netassets were US$36 million.  With Pacnorse at an estimated net asset value, WMIâs net assets would be US$18 million.  With vesselsat market value, net assets would be US$16 million.  A combination of the last two balance sheets produced a net deficiency of US$2million.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.18" class="para" id="p3.6.18">3.6.18</a> The shipping committee met on 25th January.  Mr. Brothers reported there were indications that Grindlays would refinance World Rainbowfor US$9 million.  There was also the possibility of Chartered Bank reviewing its decision and of Ansbacher refinancing.  So it wasagreed that it was in WMIâs interests to raise as much as possible even if it resulted in a small delay.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.19" class="para" id="p3.6.19">3.6.19</a> On the same day, WMI received a telex from Mr. Gabrielsen which said that, because of the problems over Namura 865 and the failureto receive money back on it, Pacnorse would have a cash shortfall in February of US$2 million.  Mr. Gabrielsen enquired whether anadvance interest payment would be a solution, i.e. interest on the shareholdersâ loans.  Mr. Brothers replied on 27th January expressinghope that between WMI and Jebsens they could provide sufficient funds to enable Pacnorse to meet current outstandings with its bankers. He emphasised, however, that Pacnorse could not afford to take on further liability in the form of Namura 865.  He said WMI waslooking into the question of an advance interest payment.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.20" class="para" id="p3.6.20">3.6.20</a> On 1st February, Mr. Brothers received a further telex from Mr. Gabrielsen, the effect of which was that no money could be expectedfrom Misr Edco and âas the situation is now Pacnorse require a minimum of $2 million from the shareholders value February 8th,WMIâs share of this would be $1 millionâ.  This was followed on 7th February by a letter which refers to a telephone call aboutwhich there is no evidence.  Mr. Gabrielsen said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSuggest you inform NatWest of cash - shortfall in Pacnorse and advise them of call on shareholders and due to your own problemsthis only produced DLRS 1mill which is insufficient to pay the amount due to NatWest 10th Feb.  (DLRS. 1,567,000).  We could paythem part of the amount and defer balance.  Next problem would be payments on most vessels (other than NatWest).  These are due 1stMarch.  Difficult to see that NatWest would accept us paying to them without having covered their shortfall.  Would therefore suggestthat you ask them only to defer till 29th Feb.  We may have to talk to all the other creditors of Pacnorse prior to that.  The boardmeeting in Misr Edco is now scheduled for 20th Feb. And it is unlikely that Pacnorse will receive any money from Misr Edco untillast days of March.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.21" class="para" id="p3.6.21">3.6.21</a> The shipping committee met on 8th February.  Mr. Brothers reported that negotiations were still continuing with Grindlays for refinancingManila Faith at around US$9.5 million.  He also reported that the oil deal was going ahead, twelve ships being sold for US$99 millionincluding the four Spanish vessels, Manila Faith, Manila Pride, Manila Enterprise, Asia Rindo and Asia Hunter.  Shell would now purchasethe oil and a loss of US$1.95 million on the sale of the oil would be absorbed pro-rata by each shipowning company.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.22" class="para" id="p3.6.22">3.6.22</a> Turning to Pacnorse, Mr. Brothers explained the problems and said that while Jebsens had indicated that they would pay US$1 million,unless WMI also repaid US$1 million Pacnorse would be unable fully to pay Nat West.  He said it was suggested he meet Nat West asthe loan had been arranged through Hong Kong and ask for a partial roll-over pending a long-term solution.  In the meantime,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âit was agreed that it was important that steps be taken to resolve this problem as a matter of urgency.

It was also agreed to contact Grindlays to see if $217,000.00 due for freight on ManilaEnterprise could be released âto help alleviate the tight cash positionâ.  The application for the draw-down was made to andapproved by WM on 14th February on the basis that World Rainbow and Manila Faith had still not been refinanced.  Urgent paymentsincluded some US$500,000.00 for bunkers, a difficulty attendant upon voyage charters while WMI continued to operate on the spot market.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.24" class="para" id="p3.6.24">3.6.24</a> On 13th February, WMI (UK) made a further formal demand on WM for $140,460.00 under the Rangelock guarantee.  On the same day, Ansbacheradvised it had not received principal and interest due that day on the loans on the 2 Sestaos.

Mr. Brothers reported a prospect of Security Pacific refinancing World Rainbow forUS$10.5 million.  He also reported on the oil deal under which there would be bilateral agreements for the sale of ships and forthe sale of oil by the National Iranian Oil Corporation (NIOC) to Shell.  Then:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe steps in the deal were summarised as follows:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i) Shell would buy the oil and open a Letter of Credit in favour of NIOC for US$100 million drawable on shipment of oil, the firstsuch shipment being for approximately US$65 million;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(ii) NIOC would deliver oil and draw against Shellâs L/C;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(iii) under an irrevocable instruction or agreement NIOC would deposit US$65 million and subsequent oil payments to a special depositaccount under the name of Bank Markazi;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(iv) The âescrow bankâ would open an L/C in favour of WMI for the purchase of the twelve vessels;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(v) WMI would give an irrevocable instruction to the âescrow bankâ to pay L/C funds on the sale of ships to the various mortgageebanks and to pay US$1.95 million to Shell, being the agreed discount on the oil price.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">An outstanding difficulty was in relation to the US$1.95 million discount on the GSP of the oil.  Shell were being asked to sign theâoil agreementâ before the âbilateral agreementâ was concluded and were concerned to ensure they were covered in respectof the US$1.95 million.  They had requested that they be provided with a bank guarantee in that respect.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It was noted that The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation would be approached to provide the necessary guarantee and that WheelockMarden &amp; Co.

WM had advised that any amount it was called upon to pay under its counter-guarantee would be earmarked against the unutilised portionof the US$4 million Stand-by Credit Facility, and that counter guarantee given by them would be conditional upon the âbilateralagreementâ being entered into.  WMI would be required to give their irrevocable instruction to pay US$1.95 million to Shell toenable the Bankâs guarantee and WMâs counter-guarantee to be released and cancelled.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.26" class="para" id="p3.6.26">3.6.26</a> The committee also approved a pro-forma balance sheet as at 31st March which had been required at the previous meeting.  With retainedvessels at book value of US$116 million and Pacnorse at equity value at December 1982 less losses, WMI had net assets of US$19.8million.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.27" class="para" id="p3.6.27">3.6.27</a> Mr. Brothers also reported that Nat West had agreed to roll over the Pacnorse loan for ten days.  Finally, he said on a recent visitto Beijing it was clear that the Dalian yard would not agree to cancellation but might make ten-year finance available.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.28" class="para" id="p3.6.28">3.6.28</a> By circular the same day, in respect of the oil deal the WMI directors agreed in principle the sale of eight WMI vessels for US$70.1million which, although involving a net loss of US$12.4 million, was now estimated to produce $246,000.00 cash after sale expensesand outstanding loans had been paid.  Also, Mr. Brothers wrote to HSBC asking it to guarantee the oil discount.  The following day,HSBC gave a guarantee to Shell, and WM directors by circular agreed to provide the counter-guarantee for $1.95 million which sumwas to be counted within the $4 million facility.  In effect, therefore, the facility was reduced by almost half.  Finally, on 20thFebruary, by circular WMI directors ratified the signing of the bilateral agreements and agreed that the WM counter-guarantee ofthe bank guarantee upon which Shell was insisting should be ear-marked against the facility.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.29" class="para" id="p3.6.29">3.6.29</a> On 16th February, LBI advised WMI (UK) that repayments of principal of US$1 million on the Rangelock loan due on 13th July 1983 and$1 million due on 14th January 1984 were now rolled over to 13th March 1984.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.30" class="para" id="p3.6.30">3.6.30</a> On 22nd February, the shipping committee heard that Security Pacific were unlikely to refinance World Rainbow and that negotiationswith Grindlays had been stepped up.  Discussions were also taking place with Jebsens about Pacnorse.  On the same day, a summaryof trade creditors showed US$4.2 million invoiced but not paid.  Of this US$1.8 million was attributable to âWMCâ.  It is notclear whether this was WMIâs current account with WM or amounts due to WM Chartering.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.31" class="para" id="p3.6.31">3.6.31</a> On 28th February, WMI applied for and WM granted a further draw-down of $150,000.00 for interest on loans because of the failureto refinance World Rainbow and Manila Faith.  WMI proposed repayment out of charter-hire due.  It is perhaps indicative of how theWM Group worked in that Mr. Lees and Mr. Leung signed WMIâs request.  Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung and Mr. Brothers signed the WM circular,and Mr. Brothers signed WMâs letter to WMI approving the draw-down.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.32" class="para" id="p3.6.32">3.6.32</a> The shipping committee met next day.  Mr. Brothers reported that it appeared likely that Grindlays would refinance World Rainbowat $9.5 million and that the repayment schedule would be linked to the shipâs charter-hire and to the earnings of Asia Cultureof which Grindlays had an assignment.  He also reported a delay in the oil deal.  The committee then heard that the management committeehad asked for the balance sheet for 30th June to incorporate the market value of remaining vessels.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.33" class="para" id="p3.6.33">3.6.33</a> Mr. Brothers next reported that the Pacnorse problem was not only the failure of Misr Edco to pay $2.5 million but also the failureof the pool to pay $1.67 million owed to Pacnorse.  It was therefore agreed to be essential to put Pacnorse in a position to ensureminimum calls on shareholders.  Mr. Brothers said he and Mr. Gabrielsen had recently seen the Pacnorse banks in London and askedthem to waive principal payments for two years.  He</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âadvised that Pacnorseâs current cash difficulties had served to focus attention on the loans made to Pacnorse shareholders andon the need to resolve matters for, whatever strategy might be formulated for WMI, this could be adversely affected by the Pacnorsesituation.  For this reason, he said, it was proposed to change the shareholdersâ loans into fixed interest loans repayable over15 years at an interest rate of 6%.  The matter would, he said, be developed further at the Pacnorse Board Meeting to be held inHong Kong on 2nd March 1984.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">He went on to say that Jebsens had now accepted that Pacnorseâs last three Namura newbuildings would have to be cancelled and itwas hoped that Jebsensâ relationship with Namura would enable this to be done without penalty in legal action.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It was noted that Jebsens had repaid US$1 million of their shareholdersâ loan.

Cable &amp; Wireless were prepared to do this once tax clearance for Marilockhad been given but such clearance was still awaited.  Under the proposed arrangements LBI were taking additional exposure and hadasked WMI to put up some âearnest moneyâ from the facility.  Mr. Brothers thought US$1 million would be required.  To allow timefor the committee to consider the various options it was agreed to ask BW to delay delivery until 16th March when there should bea commitment to refinance World Rainbow and the oil deal should have progressed.  It was also noted that some $3-400,000.00 wouldhave to be arranged to finance extras.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.35" class="para" id="p3.6.35">3.6.35</a> Mr. Brothers telexed BW next day asking for delivery of Annalock to be delayed to 16th March.

He pointed out that no provisionhad been made for</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     Diminution in value of Pacnorse;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     Losses on the sale of ships for oil;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     Instalments paid on the Dalians where cancellation had been assumed;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     Investment in BW 912.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.38" class="para" id="p3.6.38">3.6.38</a> The balance sheet showed net assets of HK$574 million and the profit and loss account a net profit of HK$1.2 million, which exchangefluctuations and extraordinary items had rescued from a loss of $125 million.  On 5th March, Mr. Cameron wrote to the shipping committeesuggesting that provision should be made for these items to be consistent with the balance sheet for 31st March 1984 previously providedto the committee.  At a meeting of the shipping committee on 7th March it was agreed that appropriate provision should be made, thecommittee noting, inter alia, âour intention to cancel the Dalian newbuildingsâ.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.39" class="para" id="p3.6.39">3.6.39</a> At the same meeting, the committee learned that Grindlays was still unable to advise when a decision would be taken about World Rainbow.

It noted</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFollowing the repayment by Jebsens of US$1 million of their shareholders loan they had requested WMI to indicate that it wouldbe taking steps to repay a similar amount of US$1 million which would be sufficient to solve the immediate problem, provided theUS$2.5 million was paid on the Namura 865 by MISR Edco.  In view of the fact that Pacnorse had now formally minuted the cash call,it was agreed that it was essential that WMI match Jebsensâ repayment of the shareholders loan.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It was further noted that approaches had been made to all of Pacnorseâs bankers for a re-scheduling of the loans and that a finaldecision from the relevant lenders was awaited.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[Mr. Campbell] reported that because WMI had not repaid US$1 million of their shareholders loan Pacnorse were not providing the necessaryfunds to operate the vessels under WMSâ management and that payments totalling US$180,000 had not been made to the crewing agentsof the 3 Pacnorse vessels, which if paid by WMI would place an additional strain on the cashflow.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.41" class="para" id="p3.6.41">3.6.41</a> It was also reported that it was not possible to proceed with a sale and lease with Cable &amp; Wireless for Annalock.  Alternativearrangements were to be sought.  Finally, it was agreed that WMI would have to draw down the remaining $450,000.00 in the facility. A request was made next day, WMI again citing failure to refinance World Rainbow and Manila Faith and explaining that crewing feesand bunkers amounting to $448,000.00 required urgent payment.  Approval was given by WM on the same day.  Next day, WMI repaid outof Sealock hire $950,000.00 which had been drawn down on 14th February.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.42" class="para" id="p3.6.42">3.6.42</a> Following the Pacnorse Board meeting, Mr. Brothers had drafted a proposal for its creditors under which</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Principal and interest would be paid up to 31st March 1984 but thereafter, for two years, interest only;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) The shareholdersâ loans would be termed out over fifteen years by a series of notes guaranteed by the shareholders, payablequarterly.

He also provided a Pacnorse cash flow that assumed</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) No cash from Misr Edco but no further payments to Namura;</p>        <p>(2) Each partner would contribute $1.78 million in 1984 to cover any deficit.</p>        <p>Mr. Campbell noted that WMI had assumed each partner would only pay interest amounting to $1.25 million so an extra $534,000.00 wasenvisaged.  To date, WMI had paid only $180,000.00 by way of operating expenses for Pacnorse vessels.</p>        <p>(3) Cash in hand at 1st January was $3.8 million.  However, the balance sheet at 31st December 1983 showed a cash balance of only$2 million.

They deferred discussion of the Pacnorse proposal to the next meeting.  They learned thatGrindlays were unlikely to refinance World Rainbow but Mr. Brothers would approach Ansbacher; that documentation of the oil dealhad been completed on 9th March; and that the Cable &amp; Wireless sale and lease-back for Annalock was proceeding again, deliverybeing now scheduled for 20th March.  The committee also noted it would be necessary again to draw down US$950,000.00 under the facility.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.46" class="para" id="p3.6.46">3.6.46</a> That draw-down was made the same day, World Rainbow and Manila Faith still remaining unfinanced, and used to pay crewing fees, interestand other operating expenses.  A short-term cash flow provided by Mr. Campbell on 14th March showed trade creditors of $5.1 million,although a further summary 2 days later reduced this amount to $4.8 million.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.47" class="para" id="p3.6.47">3.6.47</a> On 15th March, Mr. Campbell provided the managing directors with a balance sheet for 30th June.  He said he assumed, inter alia,repayment to Pacnorse of $1.78 million but the receipt of $13.75 million from the liquidation of WWW of which:  $5.9 million wouldbe used to repay WM for the facility and payments under the Aquaship guarantee; $6.7 million would be provided as security to LBIfor Aquaship; and $1 million would be paid to the Fund against deferred Annalock instalments.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.48" class="para" id="p3.6.48">3.6.48</a> A further assumption was for the receipt of $9.5 million from the refinancing of World Rainbow of which $2.44 million would be contributedto the general funds of WMI.  Mr. Campbell also said that the balance sheet showed that the Fundâs loans exceeded the Danish Kronerdeposits by US$25 million.  However, if neither loans nor deposits were disturbed, the deposits would service all but US$9 millionof the loans.  There was therefore a potential asset of approximately $16 million.  Taking the remaining WMI vessels at book valueof US$168 million, the balance sheet showed that WMI would have net assets of $39 million.  At a market value for the vessels of$123 million, however, there would be a deficiency of about $6 million.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.49" class="para" id="p3.6.49">3.6.49</a> The management committee met on 20th March.  It noted that World Rainbow was still not refinanced, possibly because WMI was tryingto borrow too much and because of a fear by some banks about the value of the existing charter.  It also learned in relation to Pacnorsethat the Egyptian purchasers of Namura 865 would not complete; that rescheduling was already being discussed with the banks; andthat WMI would probably have to repay $1 million to Pacnorse if agreement on rescheduling was to be reached.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.50" class="para" id="p3.6.50">3.6.50</a> The shipping committee met on 21st March.  World Rainbow remained unfinanced with Ansbacher being pursued.  It was agreed that WMIwould have to repay $1 million to Pacnorse by the end of March.  $370,000.00 had already been paid for operating expenses and thebalance would have to come from refinancing World Rainbow, the proceeds of the oil deal or a second mortgage.  As to Annalock, negotiationsfor a Cable &amp; Wireless sale and lease-back had broken down so it would have to be delivered to another WMI subsidiary.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.51" class="para" id="p3.6.51">3.6.51</a> On the same day, by circular, WMI directors approved the arrangements for Annalock by which the building contract was novated toa U.K. subsidiary, Mastship.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.52" class="para" id="p3.6.52">3.6.52</a> On 22 March, Annalock was delivered.  Also, Mr. Cameron asked Mr. Campbell to tie up WMIâs accounts for 1983.  The draft accountsshowed WMI had extraordinary losses of $56 million and the Group $112 million.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.53" class="para" id="p3.6.53">3.6.53</a> On 26th March, Mr. Brothers wrote to LBI Hong Kong about arrangements he had made in relation to Rangelock while in London.  WMIâstax advisers were going to look into the possibility of deriving benefits from changes to capital allowance and corporation taxesin U.K.  In the meantime, the proposed sale and lease-back to Severn was to be held in abeyance.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.54" class="para" id="p3.6.54">3.6.54</a> The shipping committee also met on 26th March.  They discussed the 1983 accounts and agreed nothing should be written off the Daliansbecause it was planned to finance them and take delivery.  The committee noted that Namura had agreed to cancel all four Pacnorsehulls without further payment although amounts already paid would be forfeited.  This would increase Pacnorseâs 1983 losses.  Thecommittee then noted that Grindlays might be prepared to increase their loan on World Rainbow to $7 million while Ansbacher wereconsidering a top-up loan of $3 million</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.55" class="para" id="p3.6.55">3.6.55</a> The management committee met next day.  In discussing WMI it noted that there was no progress on rescheduling with the Pacnorse bankersand that ârepayment of a total of US$6 million by the shareholders had been mentioned as a pre-condition necessary to influencethe banksâ.  Mr. Lees advised âthat it appears certain WMI would have to take delivery of the two Dalian newbuildingsâ.  Hesaid, however, that negotiations were proceeding for long-term finance from China and a sale and lease-back with Ansbacher.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.56" class="para" id="p3.6.56">3.6.56</a> The management committee met again on 3rd April.  In discussion about WMI it noted progress with Ansbacher and Grindlays on refinancingManila Faith and that some $3.5 million cash flow would be generated if the two loans were finalized.  It also noted WMIâs cashflow was critical with bills totalling $720,000.00 to be met immediately.  As the facility was fully drawn down with the earmarkingof $1.95m for the Shell guarantee, it proposed that WMI should seek an additional loan of $720,000.00 from WM against an irrevocablecommitment by WMI to repay in full out of the proceeds of sale of Manila Faith.  The committee also recommended that WM should lendthat sum.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.57" class="para" id="p3.6.57">3.6.57</a> After the meeting, it was thought that as further security WMI should undertake to repay out of the sale of Manila Faith or the financingof World Rainbow whichever was the sooner.  The request was made by WMI the same day because WMI âhas insufficient funds to meetthe extremely urgent payments detailed in the attached schedule which are extremely necessary to ensure the continued operation ofthe Groupâs fleetâ due to failure to refinance World Rainbow and Manila Faith.  The payments included $380,000.00 for bunkersand $125,000.00 for crewing fees and other operational expenses.  Only $58,000.00 was required for interest.  WM approved by circularthe same day, the circular being signed amongst others by Irene Cheung and Patrick Poon.  Interest was charged at the same rate ason the $4 million facility.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.58" class="para" id="p3.6.58">3.6.58</a> The shipping committee met on 5th April.  They appeared resigned to taking delivery of the Dalians but on the basis of finance fromthe Chinese at a modest interest rate which would enable WMI to service the loans by the purchase of bonds by way of smaller loanswhich would in turn be serviced out of earnings.   The committee agreed that âin view of WMIâs urgent cash requirementsâ theAnsbacher offer of financing be accepted.  Funds would be forthcoming once the two Sestaos, Odinlock and Thorlock, were deliveredon 16th April as part of the oil deal.  Meanwhile, a decision by Grindlays was hoped for in the next week.  The committee also acceptedthat the balance of $1 million which WMI had undertaken to repay to Pacnorse by 8th April would have to be delayed pending finalizationof the oil deal.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.59" class="para" id="p3.6.59">3.6.59</a> Next day, Grindlays made a firm offer of a Yen loan worth US$7 million on World Rainbow.  The management committee on 10th Aprilhoped the refinancing by Grindlays and Ansbacher totalling US$10m could be completed by Easter.  The committee also noted that Shellhad lifted US$70 million of oil and payment was anticipated in 60 days.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.60" class="para" id="p3.6.60">3.6.60</a> On 11th April, Mr. Brothers produced the general managerâs report for 1983 in which he said there had been a net operating lossof HK$16 million compared with a loss of HK$863,246.00 for 1982.  The overall net loss was HK$227 million compared with a profitof HK$15 million in 1982, the loss being largely attributable to provision for Pacnorse losses.  He said the year had been extremelydifficult, although rates had improved towards the end of the year, and difficult decisions had had to be made.  As to the Dalians,Mr. Brothers reported that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthe vessels are due to be completed in the summer of this year.

The Board consideredthe general managerâs report.  Mr. Hussey queried how the Pacnorse purchase of four Namuras had been authorized.  Mr. Brothersexplained it had been authorized by the Pacnorse Board with the WMI Board being kept advised.  Then</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAfter further general discussion on the Pacnorse fleet and on current losses Mr. W. J.

He reported that following the sale of thefour Namura contracts Pacnorse exposure was considerably reduced and the earnings would be very sensitive to any improvement in charterhire rates.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.63" class="para" id="p3.6.63">3.6.63</a> Finally, the report and accounts were approved.

It learned the terms of the Grindlays loan for World Rainbow were not attractive andtherefore it might be better to leave the existing loan of $5.5 million in place and increase the Ansbacher loan to $4.5 million. Ansbacher were preparing documentation.  Mr. Leung emphasised the importance of concluding arrangements quickly and said it wasimperative that refinancing be concluded even if the terms were less attractive than had been hoped.  There was discussion aboutselling World Rainbow, which Mr. Brothers said was currently worth US$10 million, and Mr. Leung commented that it should be the intentionto sell the vessel when a suitable opportunity arose.  Mr. Brothers confirmed that this was the plan.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.67" class="para" id="p3.6.67">3.6.67</a> As to Pacnorse, Mr. Leung was concerned that it was the weakest link in the WMI recovery programme.  Mr. Brothers said WMI had sufficientresources from back charter-hire to pay the amount requested by Pacnorse.  The committee were also informed that the oil deal, despitevarious problems particularly over the letter of credit, was close to fruition.  Mr. Brothers also agreed to supply a memo outliningplans for the Dalians.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.68" class="para" id="p3.6.68">3.6.68</a> On 18th April, Grindlays advised that principal of $525,570.00 and interest were due on 23rd April.

Mr. Brothers explained the proposed financing for the Dalians.  There wouldbe soft loans of $10.25 million and $2.75 million from Bank of China and CSTC respectively.  WMI would purchase bonds for $9.5 millionwhich would fully service the BOC loan.  Each vessel would be sold and leased back for $15 million, $9.5 million being used to purchasebonds.  The balance and top-up loan from Ansbacher would be used to purchase sterling bonds to match the lease payments.  It wasaccepted that the sale and lease-back would constrain sale of the vessels.  Mr. Leung thought consideration should be given to sellingthe vessels unless earnings would cover operating expenses and service the loans.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.70" class="para" id="p3.6.70">3.6.70</a> In relation to World Rainbow, Mr. Brothers explained there were two alternatives, being loans from Grindlays of $7 million and fromAnsbacher of $3 million, or a loan from Ansbacher of $4.5 million.  He said that notwithstanding the management committeeâs opinionto move quickly a proper comparison of the alternatives should be made.  He thought Grindlays might release $564,000.00 from charter-hireretention between then and July.  Mr. Brothers also reported that there were still problems with the oil deal but believed they wouldbe overcome.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.71" class="para" id="p3.6.71">3.6.71</a> Turning to Pacnorse, it was reported that WMI still could not pay $450,000.00 to bring its contribution to $1 million to match Jebsens. The short-term cash flow would be examined to see when a payment could be made.  Meanwhile, Mr. Brothers said NBNA, a key bank,had suggested shareholders each repay $3 million to Pacnorse and he</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âcommented that although it would be difficult for WMI to find a contribution of US$3 Million per annum, there may be no alternativesince it would not be possible to contemplate raising general funds from the shareholders of WMI unless the obligations of the Groupwere crystalized.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.72" class="para" id="p3.6.72">3.6.72</a> Nat West was also an unsecured creditor of WMI for $5 million.  It had proposed that WMI should pay $60,000.00 per month in 1984and $80,000.00 per month in 1985 provided that principal was reduced to $4 million by December 1984.

He outlinedthe disposal of various vessels and the write-off of Pacnorse goodwill.  He pointed out that of the net loss US$1.9 million was attributableto WMI but US$5.8 million to Pacnorse.  He said it was hoped to put together an attractive financial package for the Dalians andthat WMI was seeking ways to improve its financial situation.  He concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFollowing completion of these measures, the Group will hold an unique position with six modern third generation Panamax sized vesselsplus two 27,000 dwt modern bulkcarriers.

Although our planning must still be based on the contingencyof a long-term depressed condition, the market does look somewhat more encouraging and we can only hope that this trend will continueas the worldwide economies in general continue to improve.

Mr. Lees</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âadvised that although the Group had no alternative to taking delivery eventually of the two ships as legal opinion had been soughtand the advice received was that WMI itself (in addition to the contracted subsidiary companies which will own the vessels) had acommitment to the yard, it was for consideration that stalling tactics be adopted rather than crystalise arrangements now.

Latest cashflows showed thatwhereas additional funds were required to take the Group through the next two years on the assumption that the market remained atnear to current level, such funding was at much lower levels than previously projected.

DJS stressed however, that once the reply had beenreceived from WM in the negative, WMI would have to make an approach to its lenders without further delay and request them for theirforebearance in the short term to enable WMI to explore and investigate other possibilities for raising funds to meet its short termcash deficiency.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">General discussion then followed on the possible attitude of the banks and RJFB advised that there was a big difference between WMIâsposition today and that of a year ago because the number of lenders and the number of vessels had been significantly reduced, intereston the loans was being kept current and repayments of principal were being made on time.  After further discussion it was noted thatif the banks were not prepared to give WMI any assistance then they would presumably have to exercise their rights and take overthe shares of the respective owning Company of each vessel and continue to operate such vessels themselves so that interest and principalrepayments under the loans could be met.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.150" class="para" id="p3.6.150">3.6.150</a> Discussion then turned to the requirement to pay US$1.7 million to Pacnorse.  If it was not paid, Mr. Brothers pointed out that WMIwould have an equally serious problem with Pacnorse.  There was also a problem with WMIâs own vessels of which six were tradingon the spot market and seven were on medium bare-boat charter.  Some accommodation was needed from WMIâs banks to meet expenseson time-charter vessels until âadditional finance could be raised from shareholdersâ.  Mr. Brothers</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthen referred one specific problem, that was the imminent delivery of the 2 Dalian newbuildings.  He reminded that good financehad been arranged on these vessels and that on the leasing arrangements currently envisaged there would be zero cash requirementfrom WMI.  He enquired whether on that basis it would be within the powers of WMI to take delivery of those vessels and by so doingincur new credit.  In reply DJS advised that a criteria to be followed is that the Board should do what is reasonable and responsiblein the circumstances it would be incorrect, he said, for the Directors just to throw in the towel.  He went on to say, it would bea matter for the full Board to decide whether or not WMI should take delivery of the two Dalian newbuildings.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">General discussion then followed on the steps that might be taken by WMI if WM were unwilling to allow WMI to have the whole of theWWW dividend, and, it was noted that in the absence of any alternative funding or any forebearance of the banks it would not be possiblefor the Directors of WMI to incur any new credit if they knew that WMI had no means of meeting those debts when they fell due.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.151" class="para" id="p3.6.151">3.6.151</a> The shipping committee met on 15th August.  Mr. Brothers said there was interest in leasing the Dalians but there were queries âoneof which was the method by which [WMI] could fund its possible deficit in March 1985â.  He also reported problems with Amex overthe new shareholder loan arrangement.  The committee also noted that the WWW dividend had been paid and was being held in a WM suspenseaccount, pending a decision by WM to allow WMI to retain it.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.152" class="para" id="p3.6.152">3.6.152</a> In the meantime, there had been talks with Jardine Fleming who on 17th August produced a report.  In his covering letter, Mr. Bruceof Jardine Fleming explained the paper was âan outline of strategy rather than a firm proposalâ and said that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âwe do not believe that it would be possible to embark on a fund raising exercise without a firm commitment being obtained fromWheelock Marden and Company Limited, both in terms of funding and underwriting.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.153" class="para" id="p3.6.153">3.6.153</a> The Jardine Fleming paper was entitled âCapital Reorganisation/ Fundingâ.  It referred to WMI as âCutlassâ and WM as âSabreâ. It stated âwhile Sabre is understood to be unwilling to commit further funds to Cutlass, we do not believe that the future ofCutlass can be secured without some commitment on Sabreâs partâ.  Concerning WMIâs balance sheet, Jardine Fleming said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFollowing the continued rationalisation of the Group, the latest published balance sheet (as at 31st December, 1983) bears littleresemblance to the present position.  Long term debt is understood to be in the region of US$136.5 million (US$130 million securedand US$6.5 million unsecured) while net asset value, at current market prices, has been tentatively estimated at HK$0.50 per âAâShare.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.154" class="para" id="p3.6.154">3.6.154</a> On that basis, Jardine Fleming thought shareholders funds would be HK$30 million.  As to capital reorganisation, Jardine Flemingsaid:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSince shareholders are being asked to provide new funds for the Group, it would be desirable for them to be presented with up-to-dateinformation regarding the financial position of the Group.  This would involve, inter alia, a revaluation of the Groupâs fleet. Assuming that such a revaluation was taken into the books, resulting in a substantial revaluation deficit, it would be desirableto write this deficit off against share capital so that Cutlassâ ability to pay dividends in the future is improved.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.155" class="para" id="p3.6.155">3.6.155</a> To raise funds, Jardine Fleming suggested the issue of HK$78 million/US$10 million convertible cumulative preference shares of HK$1each paying 14% per annum, wholly underwritten by WM.  They concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe consider that the proposals outlined above are advantageous to the Company and give shareholders a strong incentive to takeup their preference share entitlements.  The following points should be noted:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i) The issue of equity rather than debt will strengthen Cutlassâ balance sheet.  Cutlass will not have to service the preferencedividend until such time as it has returned to profitability (cf. a debt issue).</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(ii) Preference shareholders will be the first to participate in any return to profitability and the conversion rights will enablethem to participate in any future earnings growth and share price appreciation.  Shareholders who do not take up their rights willbe most unlikely to receive any return on their existing investment for a long time to come (i.e. not until Cutlass has generatedenough profit to pay arrears of preference dividend and is in a position to pay ordinary dividends) and will be heavily diluted inequity and voting terms.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">If shareholders (including Sabre) do not provide further equity (or some other form of funding) it appears probable that they willlose their investment in Cutlass since the assets will be taken over by the lenders.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.156" class="para" id="p3.6.156">3.6.156</a> On 18th August, LBI declared a further event of default in relation to Rangelock by non-payment of $1 million on 13th July.  It advisedit had applied some $3 million from the earnings account to settle all interest and towards outstanding principal.  This notice wasaccepted and agreed by WMI directors on 29th August.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.157" class="para" id="p3.6.157">3.6.157</a> On 20th August, Jebsens and WMI signed the agreement terming out the Pacnorse shareholder loans of which $10.5 million was outstanding.

There was a flurry of meetings.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.158" class="para" id="p3.6.158">3.6.158</a> The WM Board met on 21st August.  They considered WMIâs request for the WWW dividend to be used in reduction of drawings underthe facility.  Mr. Brothers said if the dividend was used to satisfy the amount paid by WM on the Rangelock guarantee âthere wouldbe no opportunity for [WM] to make further secured advances to WMI due to the existence of the second pledge over [the shares] infavour of [ADS]â.  Then</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMr. Petrus Tang cautioned the Board on whether in the event of WMI being subsequently liquidated the Company could justify applyingthe WWW dividend against the Facility which would have the effect of diminishing the value of the remaining security of the WWW sharesto the detriment of the other secured lender, DSKF, and unsecured lenders who might have a claim against WMI.  He went on to saythat the Companyâs position in this respect would be particularly difficult because of its role as General Managers of WMI andthe Company would in the event of WMI going into liquidation be accountable to DSKF for depriving them of their security.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.159" class="para" id="p3.6.159">3.6.159</a> It was agreed Mr. Shaw should be asked for advice on the matter and that the dividend remain in the suspense account pending a recommendationfrom the management committee.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.160" class="para" id="p3.6.160">3.6.160</a> The shipping committee met on 22nd August when Mr. Brothers reported that RBS had declined to act as lessor in relation to the Daliansâprobably because a request, that (WM) guarantee the Royal Bankâs unsecured loan to WMI, had been declinedâ.

He continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthat following telephone discussions with Jebsens an understanding had been reached that if Pacnorse did not have the full supportof all its lenders, it could not continue.  He advised that the present thinking was that a Pacnorse creditors meeting be held beforethe end of next week to place the problem before creditors to ascertain what they were prepared to do.  It was noted that this wouldresult in the Pacnorse creditors becoming unsecured creditors of WMI to the extent of the outstanding balance of the loan advancedby Pacnorse to WMI.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Until this matter was resolved and WMI had a solution to its own funding problems, it would not be feasible to make any further paymentsto Pacnorse.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.162" class="para" id="p3.6.162">3.6.162</a> The management committee met on 23rd August and had the documents which the shipping committee at its meeting on 8th August had askedto be prepared.  A short-term cash flow to 31st March 1985 showed a deficit of US$2.5 million.  There was a reconciliation betweenthe cash surplus of $4.9 million, predicted in October 1983 for September 1984, and the current prediction, i.e. $1.1 million whichnow included the $4 million facility.  The major contributors to this change were Pacnorse, amounting to $3.3 million, and a shortfallof $5.3 million on the sale of seven ships for oil.  A long-term cash flow incorporating a $10 million injection in March 1985 showeda cash shortfall in December 1992 of $12.5 million while a balance sheet of the same date showed net assets of $38 million.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.163" class="para" id="p3.6.163">3.6.163</a> At the meeting, Mr. Brothers</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âemphasised that the cash flow circulated to Members should only be regarded as indicating the trend over the next ten years.  Moreimportantly the cash flow position over the next one to two years was a far more definitive guide.  If the proposed equity issueby WMI was to be successful, the participation of WM was essential and RJFB expressed the view that in these circumstances it wasreasonable for WM to provide its share of a little over US$5 million to enable WMI to continue operating.  For the avoidance of anydoubt RJFB stated that the cash flow as prepared, assumed full repayment of the US$4 million Secured Standby Facility in additionto all amounts drawn under the âRangelockâ guarantee.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.164" class="para" id="p3.6.164">3.6.164</a> However, Mr. Poon indicated that he, Mr. Ying and Mr. Hsu could not agree to the dividend being used to repay drawings under thefacility.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.165" class="para" id="p3.6.165">3.6.165</a> On 24th August, WMI (UK) advised WMI that ADS was seeking certain financial information and had queried the projected liquidationof WWW.  On the same day, Mr. Brothers drafted a note, which was apparently to be used (but never was) as the basis of an approachto HSBC for a loan.  The note began:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhilst not wishing to provide financial support to WMI, it is believed that [WM] might be prepared to waive repayment of the US$4million facility in return for a buyer taking over its shares in WMI and injecting fresh equity capital.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.166" class="para" id="p3.6.166">3.6.166</a> Mr. Shaw provided his advice in a letter of 28th August.  He reviewed the documentation and said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTherefore, the key question is whether WMI or Glamorgan have, in fact, failed to observe or perform any obligations under the SecondPledge or whether WMI has defaulted in performing any of its obligations under the ADS Guarantees.  If the answer is that there hasbeen no such failure or default at the time of the dividend payment, then ADS would not be entitled to receive the dividend, andaccordingly a waiver by WMC [i.e. WM] would enable the amount of dividend waived to be received by Glamorgan/WMI.  Having reviewedthe terms of the Second Pledge, there are to be a limited number of obligations to be observed and performed by WMI and Glamorgan- attention is, however, drawn to the comments in 8 below.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.167" class="para" id="p3.6.167">3.6.167</a> Mr Shaw went on to repeat the advice he had given previously about fraudulent preference and the need to show a dominant intentionto secure funds rather than prefer a creditor, ie WM.  Paragraph 8 of Mr. Shawâs letter then drew attention to the fact that thesecond pledge in favour of ADS described WMI as beneficial owner and Glamorgan as registered owner of the WWW shares, whereas Mr.Shaw understood that Glamorgan was both beneficial and registered owner.  Mr. Shaw said that, if correct, there was a breach of representationand warranty which might constitute a default.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.168" class="para" id="p3.6.168">3.6.168</a> The WMI Board met the same day.  Mr. Brothers explained there was a requirement for funding in September due mainly to the delayin disposing of WWW and the lower than expected proceeds of sales and that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt had, therefore, become necessary, he said, to consider a formal approach to the parent Company, Wheelock Marden &amp; Co., Ltd.(âWMâ) for assistance in meeting the Groupâs short-term cash requirements and also to seek an indication from WM whether ornot they would in principle subscribe pro-rata to their portion of a contemplated US$10 million new capital issue to be called fromshareholders early in 1985.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><u>FORMAL APPROACH TO WM</u>:    Mr. Brothers advised that there were two issues which required to be referred to WM.  The first was, he said, the Companyâsshort-term cash requirement.  He reminded the Board the Group had been operating under considerable cash restraints during the past12 months with a large number of ships being sold.  Those that remained were, he said, either covered by long-term bareboat chartersor could be considered as valuable and easily tradable assets with the potential for considerable appreciation following a returnto more normal conditions.  He went on to say that the sales and cancellations of vessels had improved the long term position ofthe Group, but had exacerbated the short-term difficulties.  In view of the fact that sales of vessels had been made on the fallingmarket, this had resulted in a greater than expected demand on short-term cash facilities.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.169" class="para" id="p3.6.169">3.6.169</a> Mr. Brothers then dealt with WWW and said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthat it might, subject to legal advice, be possible to secure agreement from WM that the entirety of the WWW dividend be utilisedto reduce drawings under the US$4 million Secured Stand-by Credit Facility, which could then be redrawn up to a total of US$4 million.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.170" class="para" id="p3.6.170">3.6.170</a> Mr. Shawâs letter of advice was considered.  Mr. Poon queried whether using the dividend to reduce drawings would constitute anadditional advance under the facility and whether it would diminish the pledge to ADS.  The Board felt the remaining value of thesecurity in the shares would be reduced but the ADS pledge would only take effect in a default situation when ADS would have a claimagainst any dividend paid.  Mr. Brothers advised the remaining value of the security would be at least $1.9 million.  However, anadditional $2.8 million under the facility would provide sufficient funds for WMI until it could formulate a plan for future fundingby a $10 million capital issue.  Mr. Brothers said Jardine Fleming had indicated raising $10 million in the market to be feasible. Then</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMr. Brothers referred to the attached three year cash flow graph which was tabled at the meeting and drew the Boardâs attentionto the assumptions used in the preparation of that graph as detailed in Attachment D to the letter to WM.  He referred to the proposedfinancial and leasing arrangements for the two Dalian Newbuildings and noted that whilst no cash injection was required by the Groupit would not be possible to proceed with those arrangements until the long-term future of the Group was assured.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">He went on to say that the cash flow graph assumed full repayments of principal and interests as and when due.  He advised that ifWM agreed to take up its share of the contemplated US$10 million new capital issue it should be feasible to approach the Groupâsmain lenders with a request that they forego principal repayments on certain loans for a period of two years.  This would, he said,result in the cash flow graph remaining positive after 1986.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Mr. Brothers advised that cash flow graph had been prepared up to 1986 only because it was felt that 1986 was as far as the Groupcould reasonably look ahead.  He went on to say, that if the cash flow graph were to be projected beyond 1986 without a reschedulingof the loans then the graph went lower and did not turn until the end of the decade.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.171" class="para" id="p3.6.171">3.6.171</a> After Mr. Brothers had explained plans for further sales of older ships coming off charter</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMr. W. J. Lees queried what could be done if WM declined the Companyâs formal request for support.  In reply Mr. Brothers advisedthat if they did decline it would be extremely unlikely that the Company would be able to secure alternative outside support in thelimited time available.  In the circumstances it would therefore be unable to take delivery of the two Dalian newbuildings and theDirectors would have to give serious consideration to whether or not it would be possible for the Company to continue trading.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In answer to a question on Directorsâ Liability, Mr. D. J. Shaw advised that the same test would apply as previously advised tothe Board.  That  was, he said, if the Directors were unable to look forward to see how the Company could meet new credit when itfell due then it would not be possible to incur any new credit whether bank, trade or otherwise.  In the event of WM declining theCompanyâs request then the Directors would, he said, have to look at the situation again very carefully.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Mr. Brothers advised in conclusion that the overall position was complicated by Pacific Norse Shipping Limited (âPacnorseâ). He went on to say that the cash flow included repayments of the shareholders loans made by Pacnorse at a rate which would enablePacnorse to meet payments of interest as they fell due.  He advised that discussions between Pacnorse and its own lenders on a proposedrescheduling of its loans had reached a difficult stage and that an ultimatum would be given to those lenders that unless they agreedto a rescheduling the shareholders of Pacnorse would cease to make any repayments of their loans.  It was noted that the matter ofPacnorse would have to be resolved before any new capital issue was made.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">After general discussion Mr. Patrick Poon queried what the Company would do if WM Directorsâ asked what the position would be beyond1986 and in reply, Mr. Brothers advised that a 10 year cash flow was available but that the situation beyond 1986 was subject toso many imponderables that it could only be considered to represent a best indication of the likely trend.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.172" class="para" id="p3.6.172">3.6.172</a> Finally, the Board approved a form of letter to be sent to WM seeking support.  It was sent the same day and asked for the WWW dividendto be used to reduce drawings under the facility.  Attached was a copy of Mr. Shawâs advice which had been provided that day. WMI also said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAs part of the strategy for the future funding of this Company a US$10 million new capital issue is contemplated to be called fromshareholders in early 1985.

Thereafter the medium termcash flow projections show, assuming no new equity, a continuing deficit of up to US$10 million until the end of 1986 which thensteadily increases, as loan repayments are made, to a maximum deficit of around US$40 million in 1990.

S&amp;Ccontinued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe consider that the long term viability of Wheelock Maritime will only be assured if the following take place:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i) there is a substantial injection of new equity;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(ii) the Companyâs bankers agree to reschedule their debts; and</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(iii) there is a recovery in the world shipping market.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">We consider that if new equity can be raised then there is a good prospect of the banks agreeing to reschedule their debts, in anyevent the injection of new equity into the Company would only be made conditionally on the banks rescheduling.

However, at this stage, we can say that we do not believe that institutionalinvestors would be prepared to provide new equity for the Company.  There are in our view only two potential sources of new equitywhich are either Wheelock Marden, which is already considering the matter, or a special investor, almost certainly involved in shipping,who is prepared to make an investment and take a view that the world shipping market will recover.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><u>Continuation of business</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In the light of all the above information, very careful consideration needs to be given by the Directors as to whether the Companyshould continue to carry on its business in the normal way and in particular incur new liabilities.

However as alreadymentioned, the cash flow projections, under either set of circumstances, show the Company to run into a substantial cash deficitafter that date.  In our view the viability of the Company is dependent on the raising of new equity and doing so in the foreseeablefuture.  At this stage, we do not know of any potentially interested outside parties; that is not to say that such a party does notexist.  The Directors must form a judgement as to whether such an investor does exist and if there is a reasonable prospect of theCompany being able to raise new equity.  If they believe that there is a reasonable prospect and the immediate short term cash deficitcan be overcome by one or other of the methods described above this may form a basis on which the Directors can form a reasonableexpectation of the Company being able to meet new credit incurred.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.202" class="para" id="p3.6.202">3.6.202</a> On 26th September, Rothschilds produced their report for WM.

Rothschilds went on</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAs the fleet has contracted, the problem now facing WMI is less complex.  Total debt has been reduced from US$310 million to US$249million during the six months to 30th June 1984.

The surplus of facilities over borrowings predicted in October 1983 for the 30th September 1984 of US$4.9 millionbefore taking into account the US$4 million stand-by facility was revised on 25th September, 1984 to a surplus of approximately US$0.8million after taking into account the US$4 million drawings available under the Facility.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.203" class="para" id="p3.6.203">3.6.203</a> Rothschilds then referred to a cash flow for the period 12th September 1984 to 29th March 1985 and said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFrom the short term cash flow it can be seen that WMI requires facilities of approximately US$3.5 million in order that it cancontinue trading to the end of March 1985.

The amounts of US$1.77million and US$1.1 million are in respect of interest and principal payments due on the Marilock and Annalock respectively.  Apartfrom these payments, we have been advised that WMI has, to date, met all their other loan payment schedules.  Certain of the bankloans contain earnings cover covenants and consequently, as these have not been met, the loans can technically be declared in defaultby the respective banks which would of course force WMI into liquidation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.204" class="para" id="p3.6.204">3.6.204</a> Rothschilds referred, however, to the possibility of the sale and lease of Rangelock, Sealock and Annalock to take advantage of capitalallowances in U.K. which would improve further the financial position of WMI.  In relation to WMIâs request to be allowed use ofthe WWW dividend, Rothschilds said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âObviously a refusal by Wheelock Marden to this request will result in WMI being unable to meet its obligations by March 1985 andconsequently lead to liquidation unless other facilities can be arranged in a very short period of time.  In addition to this shortterm problem, WMI has requested that Wheelock Marden participate in a US$10 million issue of fresh capital in early 1985, pro-ratato its holding, which will involve a cash outlay of approximately US$5 million.  These two factors will, according to the cash flowsforecasts, enable WMI to meet its financial obligations up to the end of 1986.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.205" class="para" id="p3.6.205">3.6.205</a> Rothschilds then examined various cash flows it had had prepared.  As to the short-term cash flow referred to above, they said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe deferral of the two repayments in September 1984 totalling US$2.87 million enables the company to trade within its existingfacilities until the middle of February 1985, though there are some days before this date when, in theory, WMI has a cash deficit. However the position after this date deteriorates rapidly, culminating in an anticipated cash deficit of approximately US$3.5 millionat 29th March, 1985.  WMI has, to date, been very adept in its cash management and has managed to survive on a day to day basis inrecent months.

Assuming a $10 million funding and agreement with bankersto defer payment of principal amounting to $13 million between September 1985 and May 1986, then</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe deferral of such amounts obviously has a significant beneficial impact on the cash flow projections of WMI.

Based on their review, Rothschilds said WM had four alternatives:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âa) to withdraw any support and allow its subsidiary WMI, in the absence of obtaining outside support, to go into liquidation;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">b) to give limited support within an agreed short term time frame whilst seeking ways to dispose of its interest in WMI;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">c) to give further limited support, so as to allow WMI to continue trading for a period of 12-24 months; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">d) to give sufficient support to ensure WMIâs future existence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.211" class="para" id="p3.6.211">3.6.211</a> As to (a) Rothschilds said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThis would be a drastic step to take as we believe, following discussions with officers of Wheelock Marden, that WMI may be forcedinto liquidation within a very short period of time unless it can arrange further facilities to cover its expected cash deficit. If external support cannot be obtained, the directors of WMI would be put in a difficult position as they could become personallyliable to legal action by creditors in respect of fraudulent trading.  Obviously such a step would mean Wheelock Mardenâs significantinvestment in WMI would have to be written off and we have estimated that this could total some US$25 million.  In addition WheelockMarden would be liable, under the Rangelock performance guarantee, to make up any shortfall on charter rates for a further 16 months. There may be a possibility that the vessel cannot be chartered and we have been advised that the total liability that would be incurredby Wheelock Marden in accordance with the Rangelock performance guarantee would amount to an additional US$5.55 million, making atotal paid and payable under that guarantee of approximately US$8.15 million.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">There are two remaining contracts with the Dalian yard and the inability of WMI to take delivery of those newbuildings would giverise to acute political embarrassment and adverse commercial consequences.  We have been advised by Wheelock Marden that the purchaseof these two ships will not have any adverse cash flow effect on WMI.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In general, there are no legal obligations on the directors of a parent company to provide or arrange financial support for its subsidiary,the directorsâ only responsibility being to take whatever action is in the best interests of the parent company.  As we have previouslystated in our report dated September, 1983, the ramifications of withholding support for a subsidiary could be far-reaching for aparent company with damaging effects on its reputation.  This could be reflected in withdrawal of credit lines and loss of futurecontracts, not to mention the adverse publicity which such a move might attract as occurred in the case involving Esperanza PLC,a public company in England.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The position of Wheelock Marden is further complicated by the fact that it is not only the parent company but also the General Managerof WMI, for which it receives a fee and an annual commission.  Whilst we are advised that this position does not in itself imposeany legal obligation on the Board of Wheelock Marden to extend support to WMI, we believe that criticism, particularly from the minorityshareholders and creditors of WMI, may be a possibility if support is withheld.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.212" class="para" id="p3.6.212">3.6.212</a> As to alternative (b) limited support, Rothschilds said WMI would require about $3.5 million to continue trading to March 1985. They said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThis support would be given on the understanding that no further support will be made available and that WMI will have to seeka more permanent solution to its problems including a formal agreement with its bankers for a moratorium of debts and/or a reconstructionof the company.  It could also be made clear that Wheelock Marden will consider ways of reducing its investment in WMI by seekinga third party to take over its shareholding for a nominal consideration and ultimately the management of the company.  US$2.26 millionof the US$3.5 million of short term funds required under this option could be provided by Wheelock Marden waiving its right to thefull amount of the WWW dividend that it is entitled to receive under the First Charge.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.213" class="para" id="p3.6.213">3.6.213</a> As to (c) support to ensure survival for 12-24 months, Rothschilds referred to their reports of September 1983 and said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn arriving at the decision to support WMI, in October 1983, the Board of Wheelock Marden agreed to support WMI for a period oftwo years to provide a breathing space within which to assess whether the market was likely to to improve sufficiently.  The shippingmarket has shown signs of improvement in 1984 and Wallems has expressed the opinion that âit is not unreasonable to anticipatethe 1981 time charter rate levels to be reached again in about 1988 ....â (refer Appendix C).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Given the Boardâs decision twelve months ago, it would be quite logical to consider giving WMI further support to continue tradingfor 12-24 months so as to give time for the shipping cycle to improve.  Based on the information available, we confirm that a furthercash injection, possibly in the form of a capital issue, of approximately US$10 million should enable WMI to carry on trading untilDecember 1986.  As the deterioration in the financial position of WMI is predicted to continue and the company is unlikely to beable to generate a return on this investment unless there is a sharp improvement in the shipping industry, the Board of WheelockMarden will have to consider whether further support of this amount is justifiable.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.214" class="para" id="p3.6.214">3.6.214</a> Finally, on (d) support to ensure WMIâs continued existence, Rothschilds said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAs stated previously, the provision of US$10 million in March 1985 should enable WMI to continue trading until December 1986. However we believe that US$10 million will not be sufficient to ensure, with any degree of certainty, the continued survival of WMIafter that date.  As we would have to review forecasts covering a period many years hence, it is not practical to investigate indetail the total amount of equity financing that would be required to ensure the future viability of WMI.  However, following conversationswith officers of Wheelock Marden and a brief review of WMIâs future requirements, we believe that WMI would need approximatelyUS$25 million - US$30 million over a period of up to 5 years to ensure its continued survival in the foreseeable future.  WheelockMardenâs proportional contribution of this amount would, of course, be approximately US$12.5 million to US$15 million.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">After reviewing the future prospects of WMI, we do not believe that Wheelock Marden should agree to provide further financial supportother than that required to keep the company solvent in the immediate future.  A further significant investment in WMI is unlikelyto provide an adequate return on the basis of currently available information.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.215" class="para" id="p3.6.215">3.6.215</a> In conclusion, after reminding WM of âpossible commercial damage of not supporting WMIâ, Rothschilds said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf Wheelock Marden is not prepared to support WMI further, the company would be likely to go into liquidation almost immediatelyunless it reach an accommodation with its bankers.  To give WMI sufficient breathing space to negotiate a rescheduling of debt withits bankers and to avoid the serious consequences of allowing a subsidiary to go into liquidation, we recommend that Wheelock Mardenconsider permitting WMI to retain in full the balance of the dividend totalling US$2.26 million paid by WWW which is presently heldin a suspense account.  As shown in paragraph 11(b) above, the release of this dividend will still give Wheelock Marden a measureof security on its existing commitments.  Consideration should also be given to providing a further US$1.24 million but only on thebasis that WMI had reached agreement in principle with its bankers.  We also recommend that Wheelock Marden should inform the Boardof WMI that no further support would be made available and that Wheelock Marden would be willing to dispose of its shareholding inWMI as part of a reorganisation of the company for a minimal consideration.  Wheelock Marden would be in no worse position financiallyby following this recommendation than if it permitted WMI to go into liquidation, but it would have the significant commercial benefitof avoiding the stigma of allowing its subsidiary to follow that route.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.216" class="para" id="p3.6.216">3.6.216</a> The WM Board resumed its meeting on 26th September.

It is a regrettable fact that current market conditions are such that revenue from operationssimply do not cover the current commitments of the Group as a whole and if this dividend had not gone to WMI in its entirety theGroup would have been insolvent and would have ceased trading.  This we are sure would have been to no oneâs benefit and we sincerelybelieve that we have at all times complied in all respects with âthe spirit of the negotiations leading to the Funds agreementto leave outstanding the deferred instalmentsâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>3) We concur with your understanding that should surplus funds become available from the operations of the vessels or from any othersource that had not been pledged in any way to other creditors they will be channelled towards prepaying or providing additionalsecurity for the payments of the Fundâs deferred instalments.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.239" class="para" id="p3.6.239">3.6.239</a> As far as information on WMI was concerned, Mr. Brothers wrote:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTo the best of our knowledge you have been receiving exactly the same information as all our other creditors.

We regretif you feel that they have been sometimes late in coming and we will certainly try to improve on this in future.  Nevertheless youmay be assured that there has been a tremendous amount of work and effort during the past year in improving the position of the Group(and therefore its creditors) and if we have any excuse to make at this time it is because of the pressure of work resulting fromthese measures.  As stated earlier there is no reason why we did not inform you of the dividend being paid by World-Wide Wheelock,simply that it has not been our practice in the past nor did we anticipate a need in this particular instance.

Even if there was insufficient to clear the first mortgage, the reduction in debt wouldenhance the value of the Fundâs mortgage.  WMI expected nothing from the proceeds.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.241" class="para" id="p3.6.241">3.6.241</a> Mr. Lyngsie followed up, although his telex is not available.

It is easier for us to maintain regulardialogue with the creditors either in HK or London than in Copenhagen although during past nine months we have had several meetingswith Mr. Schroeder from B+W at which time we have always brought him fully up-to-date with our current position.  The picture isan ever changing one and what was applicable one month is not necessary the case in the next.  (The current plan for reorganisationis a good example.)

Although this price was less than forecast, Mr. Brothers felt it was good in the present marketand WMIâs share of some $5.2 million would be used to pay off outstanding debt to WM.  Mr. Brothers also advised that there mightbe a proposal from P&amp;O for long-term charters for the Dalians.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.245" class="para" id="p3.6.245">3.6.245</a> Mr. Brothers then reported that discussion between Pacnorse and its creditors was continuing and that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âOn the positive side earnings were well up on earlier results and it now appeared that all creditors had accepted the principleof a moratorium on principal for at least the next twelve months.

Nevertheless, there was still a cash shortfall and RJFB had informed Jebsens thatfrom the end of the current year, WMI would no longer be able to contribute any further funds into the operation until it had beenable to rearrange its own financial affairs.  Jebsens had accepted this position and had indicated that for a limited period fundscould either be advanced from the Pool or from Jebsens.  It had been agreed that there was little point selling any vessels at thistime.  Instead it was intended to examine closely the proposal to restructure Pacnorse whereby the value of its vessels would bewritten down to their current market value and if possible agree with creditors that a portion of their debt be converted into someform of preference shares.  This would hopefully bring Pacnorse back to a position from which it could trade profitably with thedebt reduced to a realistic level.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.6.246" class="para" id="p3.6.246">3.6.246</a> Mr. Brothers reported that LBI had agreed to release charter-hire for expenses in relation to vessels other than those mortgagedto LBI.

He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe book value of the three vessels concerned was Â£64 million and an upper estimate of the value of the free depreciation wasÂ£22 million although it was RJFBâs belief that a figure substantially lower than this is more likely.

Mr. Brothers said Mr. Cheunghad told him that if Mr. Marden liked WMI so much he should take it over.  To assist, Mr. Cheung told Mr. Brothers he would agreeto WM making US$5 or $7 million available.  After discussion with Mr. Lees and Mr. Leung, Mr. Marden and Mr. A. Marden, it was agreedthat Mr. Brothers should prepare a discussion paper which he produced in late November.  The paper reviewed the current positionexplaining that the proceeds of sale of the two remaining WWW ships would enable WMI to pay off both the facility and Rangelock paymentsbut</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthe Cash Flow Projections for the Wheelock Maritime Group show that it will be unable to meet its ongoing trading and loan commitmentsfrom the end of February next year and clearly a decision must be taken within the next month as to the future of the Group.

The paper said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThus the first alternative would be to lend US$5 million to WMI on terms to be agreed but that would rank ahead of the equity holders.

Negotiations with creditors would be facilitated because they were until then resentful that WM had given no meaningfulsupport.  Against this proposal was the possibility of doubts about WMIâs ability to repay its loan obligations and the possibilityof continuing liabilities.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.251" class="para" id="p3.6.251">3.6.251</a> The next option was the sale of the WMI Group coupled with a loan of $5 million.  The paper said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âDue to its existing long-term loan liabilities and the current pessimism surrounding the Shipping Industry, it is not consideredthat it will be feasible to sell Wheelock Mardenâs stake in Wheelock Maritime to an unconnected party even for a nominal amountunless there are strings attached.

It would ensure fullrepayment of WM, remove a substantial commitment of management and obviate the need for further provision.  Conversely, WM wouldhave no chance of benefiting from a recovery in the market and might be open to criticism for selling on too favourable terms.  Approvalof creditors for sale would be required and might prove difficult.</p>    <p><a name="p3.6.253" class="para" id="p3.6.253">3.6.253</a> Finally, there was liquidation because</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWMI is unable to raise new money in its own name and its sources of finance are thus limited either to its shareholders or existingcreditors.  The possibility of raising money from existing creditors must be considered to be remote.

Plan A was a WM loan to allowWMI to continue trading until profitable conditions returned.

Clearly however WM as majority shareholderand General Managers of the Company were in a position whereby it would have to be sure that any purchases of this nature were suchthat they would be beyond reproach.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.4" class="para" id="p3.7.4">3.7.4</a> Mr. Shaw voiced concern that the unsecured creditors would oppose the plan, although they would eventually agree because to takeaction would only jeopardize their position.  Mr. Shaw said it was important to get the agreement of all creditors and that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âit was vital to be able to prove that the sale of assets was in the best interest of WMI.  If the sale was at market price only,it might be questioned and there should be therefore an element of a premium in the price to the extent that no liquidator of WMIwould have turned down the same offer.  He appreciated that the paying of a premium made the investment decision more difficult forWM to justify.  Nevertheless, provided such premium was not unduly large, this could probably be justified as it could not be inthe best interests of WM to let its subsidiary go into liquidation or the very least, WM would wish to ensure that such liquidationresulted in the minimum amount of damage to the Group.  The WMI Board should have no difficulty in agreeing to the sale of theseassets provided it was convinced that unless such sale was concluded, the overall future of the Company would be jeopardised.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The key to the success or otherwise of Plan B would clearly be the Unsecured Creditors in particularly Pacnorse.  WMI was in a slightlyunfortunate position in so far as the Secured Creditors were concerned in that by and large, the secured creditors had adequate coverand thus would be less inclined to cooperated in any moratorium arrangements lest it could be shown clearly to be in their best interests.

He said shareholderapproval, which might not be forthcoming, would be required for selling assets to a new company.  He suggested, therefore, that initiallythe new company be a subsidiary of WMI.  Shares in the new company could be offered to all WMI shareholders.  Assuming reasonablesupport, a listing might be possible.  Sale of shares would need to be underwritten by WM who, Mr. Banner understood, were preparedto subscribe US$5 million by way of new equity in the new company.

Thought should begiven to converting their debt to preferential stock because then âthe chance of WMI being liquidated was minimalâ.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.11" class="para" id="p3.7.11">3.7.11</a> The management committee met on 8th January when, in relation to Pacnorse, Mr. Brothers advised that subject to the views of theshipping committee, WMI would have to cease all repayments to unsecured creditors in 1985 as the cash flow indicated these couldnot be met.  He said with careful management WMI would still be able to meet its predictions of being able to continue operatingwithout financial assistance until March.  Mr. Brothers made a similar report to the shipping committee next day but there seemsto have been no discussion or decision.  Mr. Lees said there had been a meeting with Mr. Shaw last week âat which WMIâs positionwas reviewed to ensure the directors were still justified in allowing WMI to continue to operate in its present circumstancesâ. Mr. Brothers advised that LBI had given formal approval to the U.K. reorganisation and the Fundâs approval was expected shortly. Mr. Lees reported that WWS had confirmed that WWW would be liquidated.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.12" class="para" id="p3.7.12">3.7.12</a> Also on 8th January, Mr. Brothers wrote to the Dalian yard to explain WMIâs latest thinking.  He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âVery regrettably, Owners are continuing to experience the financial problems.  Market trading conditions have not improved andthere at present does not appear to be any prospect of an additional capital injection from shareholders.

He concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt will be appreciated that it can only be achieved by taking advantage of the U.K. Tax leasing benefits which will only be availableuntil the end of March 1985.

RBS was concerned asto whether its position as unsecured lender would be improved.  Mr. Brothers wrote to RBS next day to clarify the position afterformation of the company and the assets likely to be available to provide security.  In his letter, Mr. Brothers emphasised thatâit is absolutely critical for the ongoing viability of WMI that the current reorganisation plans in London are followed throughsuccessfully over the next two monthsâ.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.16" class="para" id="p3.7.16">3.7.16</a> On 10th January, Jebsens, representing Pacnorse, met Amex to discuss Pacnorse.  According to a report of the meeting in New York,Mr. Jebsen said:  â1985 should see a continued freight market improvement and therefore for a variety of reasons we had probablyseen the bottom of the ship building pricesâ.  Amex responded by saying they were prepared to help and take a long-term view. The chairman of Amex said he âappreciated the very frank and open way we had dealt with them that they were not about to pull therug out from under us and that because of their financial strength they were prepared to find a way to work this out even if it tookas long as ten yearsâ.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.17" class="para" id="p3.7.17">3.7.17</a> On 11th January, LBI advised WMI(UK) that it was renewing the Rangelock loan from 14th January to 14th February and that US$3.45million principal would be overdue on 14th January.  Meanwhile, interest of US$563,175.00 due on 14th January had been debited tothe retention account.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.18" class="para" id="p3.7.18">3.7.18</a> On about 11th January, a cash flow was prepared for the three years from January 1985 to December 1987 to illustrate the effectsof the reorganisation of WMI in which: the new company, Wheelock Shipping, would take over eight WMI vessels; Rangelock, Sealockand Annalock would be sold off; and WMI would be left with remaining assets such as Pacnorse.  For Wheelock Shipping, it was assumedthere would be an equity injection of US$5 million and that there would be some deferment of payments on Marilock, Inverlock andFenlock.  Then, assuming US$13 million from sale of three vessels and charter-hire to increase at 15% per annum over three years,there would be a surplus of $10 million at December 1987.  However, if the proceeds of sale were only $8.1 million, and there wasno increase in charter-hire rates, then the cash flow would break even.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.19" class="para" id="p3.7.19">3.7.19</a> For WMI, it was assumed that Rangelock, Sealock and Annalock and their debt would effectively be self-contained and that WMI wouldreceive a loan of US$7.6 million from WWW which would be used to repay the WM facility and part of WMâs payments under the Rangelockcounter-guarantee, and that no interest or principal would be paid to Pacnorse.  On the basis of realistic charter-hire rate therewould be a deficit of US$2 million in December 1987.  By incorporating payments to Pacnorse, the deficit would be $17.4 million.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.20" class="para" id="p3.7.20">3.7.20</a> There was a WM Board meeting on 15th January when Mr. Lees said Mr. Brothers was in London trying to finalize reorganisation therewhich âwas of major importance because it would release âfree depreciationâ in respect of the three U.K. shipowning companieswhich had been valued by Morgan Grenfell at some Â£13 millionâ.  According to the minutes, Mr. Lees then</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âreported on the up-to-date position of WMI.

In bringing directors up-to-date</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMr. Brothers reminded Directors that at the last Meeting, Schroders Asia Limited had expressed the view that the long term viabilityof the Company could only be assured if one or more of the following took place:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i) there was an injection of new equity</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(ii) the Companyâs bankers agreed to reschedule their debts, and</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(iii) there was a recovery in the world shipping market.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Mr. Brothers advised that there had not been a recovery in the shipping market and if anything the market was slightly weaker.  Assetvalues had also fallen due to a number of factors including forced creditor sales and the weakness of the Japanese Yen.  As far asbankers agreeing to a reschedule their debts, Mr. Brothers advised that a plan had been initiated to achieve this taking into accountthe fact that not all bankers were in the same security position.  In particular the unsecured creditors namely, National WestminsterBank of U.S.A., Royal Bank of Scotland, Pacific Norse Shipping Limited and to some extent Wheelock Marden &amp; Co. Ltd. (âWheelockMardenâ) were in a different position to the secured lenders who by and large had adequate cover for these loans.  He went on tosay that as a first step, all the unsecured lenders had been advised that the Company would discontinue principal and interest repaymentas from the 1st January 1985.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Mr. Brothers went on to say that this left the remaining Schrodersâ recommendation that there should be an injection of new equity.

He did not foresee any problem about transferringassets but thought unsecured creditors might need to be offered a portion of the proceeds of sale to secure their agreement to theplan.  Asked where an investment of US$5 million might come from, Mr. Brothers said he âbelieved that it would be possible to puta case to shareholders that there was sufficient justification for their making such an investmentâ.  Mr. Brothers, in reply toMr. Leung, also said the break-even point would effectively be set by unsecured creditors.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.23" class="para" id="p3.7.23">3.7.23</a> Mr. Banner then commented that there was little likelihood of support from any investor other than WM and âtherefore WM might haveto be prepared to put up the fundsâ.  He said confirmation of the transaction by shareholders at a general meeting might be necessaryand the agreement of all creditors would be needed, of whom Pacnorse would be most difficult because of its own cash shortage andcreditors.  Assuming approval, Mr. Banner thought the necessary documentation would take about ten weeks but it might be three monthsbefore the arrangements were fully implemented.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.24" class="para" id="p3.7.24">3.7.24</a> It was agreed that the S&amp;Câs report be referred to the shipping committee for it to make a recommendation to the Board.

In his letter, Mr. Banner said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe are also concerned, in the light of recent developments, whether dealings in WMI shares on the stock exchanges should be allowedto continue.  Since we were last closely involved in discussions with you in September a number of developments have taken place. At that time Mr. Rodrey Wright was commissioned to explore the possibility of finding potential investors in WMI; we understandthat he has to date been unable to find any interested investors.  You have informed us that with effect from 1st January, 1985 youhave told the major unsecured creditors of WMI that they will receive no further payments of principal or interest at least untila successful reorganisation can be implemented.  Also you have recently supplied us with a pro-forma balance sheet of WMI at 31stDecember, 1984 which shows, when vessels are included at their current market values that WMI has a substantial deficit of liabilitiesover assets.  Finally, whilst the reorganisation proposals being discussed may enable Wheelock Shipping Limited, the new shippingcompany, to have a viable future we believe that the shares of WMI after such reorganisation are likely to be of very little value;indeed there is a real risk that WMI may be wound up following the reorganisation.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Although infrequent, dealings do still take place in the shares of WMI and in the light of all the above factors, we believe thatthere are now strong grounds for suspending trading in the shares.  It is possible that a suspension of WMI shares would cause creditorsto take action against the Company.  However, we understand that all major creditors are appraised of the Companyâs situation andaccordingly this may not happen.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.26" class="para" id="p3.7.26">3.7.26</a> The report outlined the proposal thus</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â2.1 It is proposed that a new company, WSL, would be formed, initially as a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMI.  WMI would transfereight vessels, together with associated liabilities, to WSL.  Shares in WSL would then be offered for sale by way of rights to shareholdersin WMI.  The offer for sale would be underwritten by WM.  If a sufficient spread of shareholders in WSL were achieved, a listingwould be sought for the shares of WSL on the stock exchanges.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2.2   Following the offer for sale, WMI would own three vessels (Rangelock, Annalock and Sealock) and would retain the four majorunsecured creditors.  It is proposed that these unsecured creditors would accept a moratorium of all payments of both interest andprincipal until such time as surplus net revenue was generated by the three vessels.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.27" class="para" id="p3.7.27">3.7.27</a> The three vessels, of course, were to be sold and leased back.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.28" class="para" id="p3.7.28">3.7.28</a> S&amp;C expressed the view that shareholder agreement in a general meeting, as well as agreement by creditors, would be required. They continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAs a minimum for all unsecured creditors, it would be necessary to reach agreement for a complete moratorium of payment of interestand principal until such time as WMI could generate sufficient cash to recommence payments.  We would stress that whatever agreementis reached with creditors it would have to be sufficient to ensure the continuing viability of WMI for a reasonable period.  In particularif a winding-up order were made against WMI within 6 months of the offer for sale, then the liquidator would be duty bound to examinethe sale of WSL by WMI and would have the power to set the transaction aside in certain circumstances.  We do not consider that thereorganisation could proceed if there was a significant risk of this happening.  We would advise WMI to consult its legal advisersin relation to this matter.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2.7   In the light of the substantial remaining deficit of liabilities over assets and the continuing negative cash flows in WMI,a simple moratorium of creditors may not be sufficient to enable WMI to survive for any length of time.  Unsecured creditors mayhave to be willing to write off virtually the whole of the amounts they are owed in exchange for a small cash payment and/or an issueof equity.  The existing share capital of WMI on this basis could only have nominal value.  We have not been a party to the discussionswhich have taken place with WMIâs creditors over the last few months and therefore cannot judge at this stage what they might bewilling to accept.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.29" class="para" id="p3.7.29">3.7.29</a> The report then dealt with documentation and concluded that the expense of implementation would be about HK$4 million and that followingall necessary agreements, the documentation alone would take about ten weeks to prepare.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.30" class="para" id="p3.7.30">3.7.30</a> The shipping committee met on 23rd January.  In view of the cost of a public flotation, they asked S&amp;C to submit a plan to raisenew equity without a flotation. On 25th January, Mr. Banner wrote to Mr. Brothers giving his views on a modified proposal involvingthe formation of an independent company capitalized at US$5 million, the funds assumed to be coming from WM.  This company wouldacquire eight vessels from WMI.  Mr. Banner saw the financial effect on WMI as identical to the original proposal but that as therewould be no need to prepare a prospectus, the costs would only be HK$1.8 million.  He pointed out that an up-to-date valuation ofvessels would be required, as well as shareholder agreement, but that shareholders would not have an opportunity to participate inthe new company.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.31" class="para" id="p3.7.31">3.7.31</a> Mr. Banner then suggested:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthat the Board of WMI should give consideration to a simpler scheme whereby the funds of US$5 million which are assumed to be availableare injected into the existing WMI and a reconstruction and rescheduling of WMIâs debts was agreed at the same time.  As statedin our previous report, if the disposal route were followed it would be essential to ensure that not only the new company but alsothe remainder of WMI were both financially viable.  This effectively means that WMI would need to reach agreement with its creditors,particularly its unsecured creditors, to a restructuring and reorganisation of their debts in any event.  We believe that such agreementcould be made more difficult and complicated by superimposing the disposal of the eight vessels.  Accordingly, therefore, seriousconsideration should be given to leaving WMI as an entity and attempting to reach agreement with creditors in return for an injectionof new funds.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Several variations exist but we believe that unsecured creditors would need to be persuaded to convert a substantial proportion oftheir debts to equity.  One possibility would be for unsecured creditors to be offered a small cash payment now of say 10 cents inthe dollar, for the balance of their debt to be converted to preference capital and perhaps for them to be offered options over someof WMâs shares in WMI.  Clearly this would be a radical restructuring of the unsecured creditors debts and we cannot judge at thisstage whether it would succeed.  However, by removing the disposal of the eight vessels from the proposals, it would simplify thereorganisation and we believe increase its chances of success with creditors.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.32" class="para" id="p3.7.32">3.7.32</a> The shipping committee, on 23rd January, also heard from Mr. Brothers</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthat a meeting had been held with the Amex Syndicate during his recent visit to London.  He advised that the Midland Bank one ofthe members of that Syndicate were going through an extremely difficult time and for that reason were keen to dispose of any potentialproblem loans by selling the four vessels in the Amex Syndicate.  However they had not been supported by the other Syndicate membersand the situation therefore was presently one of impasse.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">RJFB went on to say that he had taken the opportunity of advising those present at the meeting that WMI would not be in a positionto make any further payments of interest or principal to Pacnorse until the market conditions improved.  He went on to say that undersuch circumstances Jebsen had initially indicated to him that they wished to reduce their payments proportionately although theyhad advised certain Pacnorseâs creditor banks that they would continue to make payments to Pacnorse at the agreed level for 1985amounting to US$2.5 million.  RJFB noted that if Jebsens did indeed do so, then Pacnorse should continue to be supported by the creditorbanks as they would be receiving approximately 90% interest on loans in amount far larger than the current sale value of their security.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.33" class="para" id="p3.7.33">3.7.33</a> Mr. Brothers explained his London visit had been primarily to discuss the reorganisation with creditors.  He said he thought Jebsenswould accept the position if WMI put US$1 million into Pacnorse in 1985, that NBNA would probably accept it provided they receivedinterest for 1985, while RBS had indicated they were prepared to approve if their debt was reduced to US$1 million.  MMB would accepthiving off, but LBI were more concerned to get stage 1 of the U.K. reorganisation finalized first and were not prepared for LloydsLeasing to purchase the shipowning companies.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.34" class="para" id="p3.7.34">3.7.34</a> The committee also noted that Mr. Graham had written to Mr. Shaw on 18th January seeking advice about the distribution of WWW fundsand whether ADSâ consent was required under its second mortgage.  Mr. Brothers said ADS had in fact consented in 1984.  On 24thJanuary, Mr. Shaw clarified that ADS had in fact signed a side letter to their mortgage giving consent to liquidation of WWW providedtheir interests applied to the proceeds.  He said, however, he felt it necessary to raise the proposal with, and explain it to, ADSin view of the discussions going on about the U.K. reorganisation.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.35" class="para" id="p3.7.35">3.7.35</a> At a management committee meeting on 29th January, Mr. Brothers expressed disappointment with S&amp;Câs January report âwhichhe believed had failed to take into account sufficiently the Groupâs circumstances and WMâs stance regarding WMIâ.  In viewof the substantial expenses, he said the proposal would have to be disregarded in view of âprohibitive costsâ, i.e. HK$4 million. He submitted a âsynopsisâ which incorporated parts of the report amended so as to produce a scheme with a better chance.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.36" class="para" id="p3.7.36">3.7.36</a> It must be said that this passage is difficult to understand because by then Mr. Brothers would have received Mr. Bannerâs letterof 25th January with the modified and cheaper proposal.  In any event, Mr. Brothers went on to say that there was no longer any pressingreason why the new company should not be in the WMI Group.  Any loan by WM should be to the new owner of the subsidiary rather thanthe subsidiary itself.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.37" class="para" id="p3.7.37">3.7.37</a> On 6th February, the shipping committee noted that there had been discussion with Mr. Jebsen and Mr. Gabrielsen in Hong Kong concerninghiving off WMI assets, Pacnorse being an unsecured creditor.  As it might be necessary for Pacnorse to refer to its creditors, therecould be considerable delay.  Meanwhile, Pacnorse had remitted US$150,000.00 of the promised US$350,000.00 to WMS and Pacnorse wouldbe asked for funds to meet ongoing expenses of Pacnorse vessels managed by WMS.  The discussions with Mr. Jebsen and Mr. Gabrielsenresulted in proposed amendments to the Pacnorse shareholder agreement.  The amendments included bringing all debt interest currentto 1st January 1985, to be achieved by payment of US$1 million each by the shareholders in reduction of shareholder debt.  WMIâs$1 million was to be by way of qualified loan from WM as part of its own restructuring arrangements.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.38" class="para" id="p3.7.38">3.7.38</a> The committee also noted that the first stage of the U.K. reorganisation was to take place that day and that, as the second stage,Morgan Grenfell and Ansbacher would be asked to market the three companies for sale.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.39" class="para" id="p3.7.39">3.7.39</a> The first stage was completed that day so that each of the three vessels became owned by a U.K. company, each being a subsidiaryof another subsidiary of WMI.

Mr. Brothers said it was hoped to have advice about the scheme from Rothschildsand Mr. Freshwater shortly.  Mr. Poon asked Mr. Brothers âto emphasise to [Mr. Freshwater] the Directorsâ concern regarding fraudulenttrading particularly in relation to [WMâs] position as General Managers of WMIâ.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.41" class="para" id="p3.7.41">3.7.41</a> On the same day, WMI(UK) made a further demand on WM for US$119,322.00 in respect of Rangelock.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.42" class="para" id="p3.7.42">3.7.42</a> On 13th February, the shipping committee learned that almost US$11 million of WWW funds was on deposit and that the proceeds of saleof Golden Daisy were about to be received.

TSK was to make a general offer for the remaining WM shares, the idea apparentlybeing to take out Mr. Cheung.  Mr. Marden would buy back some shares, continue as chairman of WM, and continue to run WMI.  Mr. Brothers,Mr. Lees and Mr. Leung were made privy to this news before a WM Board meeting on 14th February, convened to consider an announcementthat day by Rothschilds who had been retained by Falwyn Company Limited, TSKâs investment vehicle.  The announcement disclosedthe acquisition of Mr. Mardenâs shareholding and made a general offer for all other A and B shares.

The Board agreed that EAW be appointedfinancial advisers to WM in relation to the offer, while Rothschildsâ appointment as advisers be terminated in view of their conflictof interest.  It was also agreed that advisers, possibly EAW, be approached about an injection of new equity into WMI which âwasof vital importance to its future viabilityâ.

Mr. Brothers said WMIâs âreorganisation plans had reached an advanced stageâ but a possibletake-over meant WM could not yet make any decision about the plans.  He then</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âadvised that due to the Companyâs fragile financial position, it had been necessary to formulate a holding plan to enable theCompany to continue to trade until the outcome of the take-overs was known.  He reported that the holding plan was on a basis whichwould avoid any suggestion of fraudulent trading by the WMI Group.  It was proposed, he said, that each shipowning company in theGroup approach its respective bankers to establish a retention account into which all charterhire payments would be paid on the understandingthat all the operating costs for the vessel concerned would be met from that retention account.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">He noted that as all the charterhire earnings would effectively be tied up in future, it would be necessary to approach Wheelock Mardento request it to advance sufficient funds to enable the Company to meet the fees payable to its legal and financial advisers, toits auditors etc.  He went on to say that he had discussed the proposal with East Asia Warburg Ltd., the advisers to Wheelock Mardenwho had indicated that they would be prepared to put forward such a proposal to Wheelock Marden.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.47" class="para" id="p3.7.47">3.7.47</a> Mr. Elliott of S&amp;C agreed that retention accounts were the best method of seeing WMI through the present position, it being essentialto establish a mechanism to allow trading to continue while WM remained subject to take-over offers.  Then Mr. Shaw</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ânoted that the Board had allowed the Company to continue to trade on the basis that there was a reasonable prospect of meetingcredit when it became due.  However, the Company had, he said, entered a new phase because it was not known whether the proposedreorganisation would be approved by Wheelock Marden and for this reason the Directors and the Groupâs operating Executives hadto be sure that they could meet trade new credit when it became due.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.48" class="para" id="p3.7.48">3.7.48</a> Mr. Leung raised three queries.  First, as to the directorsâ position pending a WM decision; second, how routine operating expenseswere to be met when WMI had no funds; and third, the position as to unsecured creditor banks.  In answer, Mr. Shaw said it was desirableto get an answer from WM as soon as possible.  Mr. Brothers said operating expenses were up to the banks concerned, while unsecuredbanks had been told in January not to expect to receive anything for the time being.  After more discussion, Mr. Shaw</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âadvised that it was most important not to incur any new credit unless there was a reasonable prospect of meeting that credit whenit fell due.

The bank required payment of $3.99million plus interest within three weeks or it would petition to wind up WMI.  Mr. Brothers responded by pointing out that he wouldhave to disclose this notice to WM when it met on 6th March to consider WMIâs request for assistance.

The banksaid it believed it was still worthwhile investigating certain possibilities because a loan default would be serious for the bankand other creditors and that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSome of these creditors may question whether indeed the takeover offer for WM can be considered to have such significant importancethat it is reasonable for the directors of WMI and its subsidiaries to change their management direction so dramatically.

Pao wrote to Mr. Marden following a meeting that day.  He asked for himself and another to be appointedto the WM Board.  He expressed concern that in a depressed market â[WM] and its non-shipping subsidiaries should not increase theirinvestment in or exposure to shippingâ.  The WM Board met at 10:30 a.m. on 6th March.  It decided not to accede to Sir Y.K. Paoâsrequest for nomination to the Board because the Securities Commission was unlikely to allow it, and to leave the bid committee todeal with the other point after a decision had been reached on WMIâs request for assistance.  Mr. Boyce of EAW said that factorsto be considered in relation to WMIâs request were:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) WMIâs liquidation might affect the take-over situation in that shareholders might be more willing to sell.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) Although WMIâs current account of HK$56 million would probably have to be written off, the bidders might have proposals forimproving WMâs chances of recovery.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) WMâs fees as general managers should not be waived but rolled up.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) Any agreement by WM to provide support should be subject to:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(i) an assurance in writing from WMI to the effect that the sum of US$250,000 would cover all moneys required by WMI up to 30th April,1985.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(ii) confirmation being received from all interested banks (including unsecured creditor banks) of their agreement to the proposalthat each ship-owning company operate on a distinct âretention accountâ basis.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(iii) (at the suggestion of Mr. Poon) confirmation being received from WMI that no new credit would be incurred.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(5)  The announcement WMI wished to make about WMâs decision could lead to an offer being withdrawn.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6)  Directors were under some moral obligation to deliver the WM Group to the successful bidder in substantially the same conditionas when the bid was made.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(7)  WMI only required a modest amount of money.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.58" class="para" id="p3.7.58">3.7.58</a> Mr. Boyce said âit was EAWâs advice that [WM] should provide the support required by WMI provided the conditions set out [asfactor (4)] were metâ.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.59" class="para" id="p3.7.59">3.7.59</a> There was then discussion.  Mr. Poon was concerned about directorsâ personal liability for advancing money.  Mr. Tang queried whetherit would be prudent to make a commitment until the attitude of creditors and of the Commissioner for Securities had been ascertained. In any event, he said, the Board had previously resolved not to give any further financial support to WMI and there had been nochange of circumstances such as to justify it now.  He felt support was a matter of principle, not of the modesty of the amount involved,and WM should not act hastily.  Then Mr. Boyce advised that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthe interests of the Companyâs shareholders would not be best served if the market price of the Companyâs shares declined becauseeither WMI went into liquidation or due to uncertainties surrounding WMIâs future.  He advised that it was a matter of very finejudgement to decide whether or not to agree to WMIâs request but that the balance of such judgement was that it would be more inthe shareholdersâ interest to make a modest amount of US$250,000 available as requested.  Not to do so would probably result inWMI having to go into liquidation which would mean that the Company would have to write off the whole of the Wheelock Marden Groupâscurrent account balance with WMI amounting to some HK$56 million.  The requested advance would, he said, maintain the status-quo.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.60" class="para" id="p3.7.60">3.7.60</a> There was further discussion from which it became clear that Mr. Tang, Mr. Ying and Mr. Lo were against giving support while Mr.Lees, Mr. Leung and Mr. Marden felt the legal and financial advice that had been given should be followed. A vote by directors whowere not also directors of WMI was against support by six votes to two.  A short letter was despatched to the directors of WMI advisingthem simply that WM âwas not prepared to accede to your requestâ.  The WMI Board met at 3:30 p.m. to consider WMIâs position. It was agreed that a public announcement should be made and all lenders advised of WMâs decision.  There was discussion aboutthe nature of the winding-up in the event of liquidation.  Mr. Shaw advised that under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, if directors were of the view that their company could not continue to trade, they were empowered to appoint a liquidator, but headvised that putting WMI</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âinto liquidation was not a step to be taken lightly and the Directors were justified in seeking the advice of independent accountantsto decide whether or not this was necessary.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.61" class="para" id="p3.7.61">3.7.61</a> The meeting adjourned to the following day.  In the meantime, the then firm of Ernst &amp; Whinney was appointed to advise whetherany alternatives other than liquidation were open to WMI.  WMI and WM made public announcements.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.62" class="para" id="p3.7.62">3.7.62</a> Next day, Mr. Timso of EW advised the Board that the WMI Group had two alternatives (not surprisingly) - to continue to trade orto be placed in liquidation.  He</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âreported if the Group continued to trade this would involve having available sufficient cash, both at the parent Company leveland at the subsidiary level where new credit would have to be incurred.  The procedure would, he said, be for each shipowning subsidiaryto contact its bank lenders with a request that cash/accommodation be provided by the lender in order that the shipowning subsidiarymight continue to trade and incur new credit.  At the parent Company level, it would be necessary, he said to investigate methodsof raising sufficient cash to meet any new credit when it fell due.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.63" class="para" id="p3.7.63">3.7.63</a> Mr. Timso said his view was that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthe Directors were justified in allowing the company and its subsidiaries to continue to trade in order to achieve the followingobjectives:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">1.   to secure time to allow the future owner of the parent Company, WM to decide what to do with the WMI Group,</p>            <p class="quote">2.   to allow time for discussions with the major creditors of the Company and its subsidiaries to establish whether the Companyâsshell could be preserved,</p>            <p class="quote">3.   to allow sufficient time to investigate the feasibility of a âhive-offâ of subsidiaries or assets to a new holding company. Such a âhive-offâ might be complicated and costly because of the existence of negative pledges and the well secured positionof most of the lenders to the shipowning subsidiaries.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The Chairman queried the potential liabilities of the Directors if the Group were to be allowed to continue to trade.  In reply, Mr.Timso said that it would be necessary to get confirmation from all the lenders to the shipowning subsidiaries that they were preparedto make the required cash/accommodation available.  He noted that at the parent companyâs level the creation of new credit wasnot considered to be a problem as it merely involved fees for professional services and general expenses.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Mr. Elliott noted that the one material development over the past 24 hours which had changed the attitude of the Groupâs lenderswas the announcement by WM that it would not provide any further assistance to the Group.  He went on to say that up until that momentGroup and its lenders had always had in mind that WM would give assistance.  Their negotiating position had therefore been that theywould be helpful and would await clarification of WMâs own position before making any final decision.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.64" class="para" id="p3.7.64">3.7.64</a> Mr. Elliott added that a meeting of secured lenders should be called immediately to see if they would accommodate the shipowningsubsidiaries without WM funding.  Mr. Brothers then reported a successful arbitration claim which should provide some US$100,000.00for WMI, and the possibility of a dividend of HK$350,000.00 from another WMI subsidiary.  On this basis, WMI would have sufficientfunds to meet any new credit over the coming weeks.  Finally, Mr. Timso agreed it was reasonable for the Board to explore all avenueswith creditors rather than take the irrevocable step of liquidation.  The committee of the Board was then empowered to deal withEW and allied matters.  The committee met later in the day and approved a press announcement about the appointment of EW.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.65" class="para" id="p3.7.65">3.7.65</a> On 7th March, the Amex Syndicate issued a further writ in London, this time against Pacnorse, Jebsens and WMI claiming that the agreementreached between Jebsens and WMI on 20th August 1984 was in breach of the agreement between the Syndicate and Pacnorse.  It was markedânot for service out of the jurisdictionâ and Mr. Shaw thought it was âa try-onâ.</p>    <p><a name="p3.7.66" class="para" id="p3.7.66">3.7.66</a> On 8th March, Mr. Shaw advised Mr. Freeland of the position and concluded by saying:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAlthough the odds must still be on liquidation, it remains a possibility that some solution could be found which would enable WMIto continue in being without liquidation.  Although the WM decision was a bodyblow, it has had the effect of crystallising the situationand enabling a third party to become involved so that creditors now have a clear choice as to whether they are prepared to co-operateor whether they wish to see WMI liquidated - until now, with WM in the background they have never really accepted that they haveneeded to make that choice.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.67" class="para" id="p3.7.67">3.7.67</a> On 9th March,  BOA wrote to Mr. Brothers saying that, although it had that day again made formal demands for repayment, it was stillprepared to discuss an overall solution.

The WM Groupâs exposure to WM amounted to HK$55 million and US$7.2 million securedagainst WWW shares.  Mr. Brothers said banks would be unwilling to call contingent liabilities but if they did, WMI would probablyhave to cease trading.  Further, BOA had not agreed to a retention account for Fenlock, was treating the request for retention asa default and might arrest the vessel.  If that happened, cross-default provisions could collapse WMI.  It was agreed to advise WMIthat WM would, without prejudice, waive non-payment of amounts due to it if WMI agreed WM as general manager could give immediatenotice of resignation rather than the six months as their general manager agreement provided.  WM would then be in a position toresign immediately if necessary.  It was also agreed EAW should monitor WMIâs position daily.  Finally, Sir Y.K.

Secured creditors,however, had asked for clarification by Sir Y.K. Pao on important issues which had been set out in a letter dated 21st March fromMr. Hussey to Sir Y.K.

The reply did not come until28th March.  Of the three issues, Sir Y.K. Pao said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(i)   As announced to the press on 6th March, WM will provide no further <u>financial</u> assistance to WMI.  This policy was re-affirmed by the WM Board after my appointment as Chairman.  This should be clearly understood.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Furthermore, operating costs relating to services provided by the WM Group - such as agency fees and disbursements, insurance andtravel - should not be regarded as management services but should be paid for on an armâs length basis as part of the operatingcosts of the vessels.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Nevertheless, in order to enable the search for a solution to WMIâs problems to continue, I would be prepared to recommend to WMthat it continues to provided such secretarial and administrative assistance (including modest out of pocket expenses) as may berequired to enable WMI to function while discussions among the creditors continue, provided (a) that the discussions are completedwithin a reasonable period and (b) that any company in the WMI group which does not have a reasonable prospect of paying debts whichit incurs immediately ceases trading.  A fee for these services would be accrued but would not be payable until either a solutionis found to WMIâs problems or it ceases trading.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The services referred to above should be provided under a new arrangement.  The existing General Managers Agreement will be terminatedat once.  This is because only WMI can make the day-to-day judgment that it is able to carry on trading; WM is not in a positionto make this judgment and therefore cannot accept a management, as opposed to a purely administrative, role.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(ii)    WM is prepared in principle to transfer its shares in WMI.  The terms and conditions of such a transfer would have to be discussed,but the transfer should be part of an arrangement with creditors which meets the requirements of (i) above and (iii) below.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(iii)   The unsecured indebtedness owed by the WMI group to the WM group falls into two categories, the trade debt (arising from agencyfees and disbursements, insurance, etc.) on the one hand and intercompany balances and the excess of secured debt over the valueof the security on the other.  So, far as the trade debt is concerned, WM must be treated as any other trade creditor - these amountsare part of the operating costs of the vessels.  So far as the other amounts are concerned, I do not think that WM should be preparedto waive the indebtedness; however, it would, I feel sure, view constructively any proposal put to it along with the other unsecuredcreditors of WMI.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3.7.78" class="para" id="p3.7.78">3.7.78</a> On 26th March, EAW wrote to WM saying:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âwe understand that the financial condition of Wheelock Maritime is now so bad that we do not believe it is in the interests ofWheelock Marden and all its shareholders to put additional funds into Wheelock Maritime.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It seems to us that Wheelock Maritime is so close to final collapse that there is every likelihood of a liquidation in the not toodistant future and in these circumstances an additional investment now could well be virtually wholly irrecoverable.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Nevertheless, as you know, Wheelock Marden currently provides Wheelock Maritime with management and secretarial services in accordancewith the management agreement between the two companies.

In our view, though we would expect Slaughter and May to confirm this, Wheelock Marden itself would not be a partyto fraudulent trading merely because it continued to provide Wheelock Maritime with the services it had previously provided, evenin the expectation that its costs would not be recovered, as long as there was reasonable expectation of other new creditors beingpaid, because it would be considered only reasonable that Wheelock Marden itself should not be seen to precipitate a collapse.

NotwithstandingMr. Brothersâ evidence, there can be no doubt that from the beginning the advice concerned fraud and that the directors were concernedabout fraud.  It is difficult to accept Mr. Brothersâ evidence that the advice, at least as far as it related to fraudulent trading,was somehow gratuitous and that he was not concerned about it.</p>    <p><a name="p4.3.2" class="para" id="p4.3.2">4.3.2</a> The real concern raised is whether the directors acted properly in the light of the advice or simply gambled that something wouldturn up.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="4.4">4.4    Cash flows</a></p>    <p><a name="p4.4.1" class="para" id="p4.4.1">4.4.1</a> A cash flow is simply a management tool which will give an indication of trends in a companyâs cash situation on a âwhat ifâbasis, i.e. it will be based on a number of assumptions.

It was, therefore, impermissible for Mr. Brothers or any other director to rely on or hope for any increases in rates other thanthose already assumed.

The depreciationis not, however, an allowable deduction in the calculation of a companyâs taxable profits.  Instead, there may be an entitlementto claim capital allowances which are in effect a substitute for the depreciation when corporation tax is being computed.  Capitalallowances are available in respect of expenditure on, inter alia, plant and machinery, a category which includes ships.  At therelevant time in the early 1980âs, capital allowances were available in two forms:  first-year allowances and writing-down allowances. It is with the former allowance that I am concerned.</p>    <p><a name="p4.5.2" class="para" id="p4.5.2">4.5.2</a> First-year allowances were introduced in 1970 at a rate of 60% which increased to 100% for expenditure after 21st March 1972.  Theallowance continued at that rate until 30th March 1984 when the rate decreased to 75% then to 50% a year later and the allowancedisappeared after March 1986.  The object of such an allowance was to provide an incentive to invest in new capital assets.  Theelimination of the allowance was accompanied by a decrease in corporation tax from 45% in 1984 to 35% by March 1986.  The 100% first-yearallowance remained available, however, for expenditure incurred after March 1984 and before April 1987 in respect of a contract enteredinto before 14th March 1984.</p>    <p><a name="p4.5.3" class="para" id="p4.5.3">4.5.3</a> There were special rules for new ships.  The allowance could be carried over in whole or in part from the accounting period in whichthe expenditure was incurred.  This became known as âfree depreciationâ.  The allowance could, at the companyâs choice, becarried forward for use in a subsequent year or years to relieve profits earned in those years or to relieve profits of other companiesin the group to which the company belonged.</p>    <p><a name="p4.5.4" class="para" id="p4.5.4">4.5.4</a> Under the U.K. tax system, although each company within a group is taxed on its own profits, the legislation allows the losses ofone company within the group to be set off against the profits of another so that the latterâs tax liability is reduced.  Thisrelief is available where one company is the 75% subsidiary of the other or both are 75% subsidiaries of a third company.  Wheresuch a relationship exists, the tax relief available by way of free depreciation can be surrendered from one such company to another. The advantage to the ship-owning company surrendering its free depreciation is that it was paid at a discount to the amount of taxsaved by the profit-making company, a discount which ranged from 10% to 30% depending upon the perceived likelihood of the InlandRevenue accepting the losses and granting the appropriate allowance. </p>    <p><a name="p4.5.5" class="para" id="p4.5.5">4.5.5</a> By the time WMI became interested in free depreciation, the law in relation to ships had become understandably restrictive.  Legislationrequired that the ship be owned by a U.K. tax-paying ship operator.  Case law had evolved to the effect that any transaction in aseries of transactions which had no purpose other than to avoid liability to tax would be disregarded for fiscal purposes.  Initially,as I understand it, WMI intended simply to make use of WMI (UK) and its subsidiaries in order to take advantage of free depreciationon its newbuildings against profits anticipated to be generated from the operation of these vessels.  Then it became looked at asa possible method of finance to reduce overall financing costs.  After discussion between Mr. Brothers and Mr. Freeland, it was decidedto adopt a U.K. leasing scheme whereby the vessel would be sold direct from the yard to a third party U.K. company which would charter-backto a member of the WMI Group.  It was intended to use this scheme in relation to Marilock, Rangelock, Sealock and Annalock.  In theevent, such a scheme was only put into place in respect of Marilock which was purchased by C&amp;W who then chartered the vesselto WMI (UK).  WMI (UK)âs obligations were guaranteed by WMI and the HSBC.  From the transaction, C&amp;W, by utilising the fullamount of the free depreciation in the accounting period in which the vessel was acquired, would obtain a large cashflow benefitfrom the tax saving.  Some of that benefit would be passed to WMI (UK) by way of reduced rentals under the lease of the vessel. It is estimated the benefit to WMI (UK) would have been something in the region of a 3% or 4% per annum reduction in the overallcost of financing which over eight or ten years would have a significant effect on WMI (UK)âs cash requirements. </p>    <p><a name="p4.5.6" class="para" id="p4.5.6">4.5.6</a> The proposed leasing schemes for the other vessels failed to materialise, at least in part as far as Rangelock was concerned, becauseof the amount of time taken and difficulties encountered by C&amp;W in persuading the Inland Revenue that the arrangement, underwhich it acquired and leased Marilock, was genuine.  It was not, I believe, until 1986 that C&amp;W successfully persuaded the InlandRevenue to accept the allowance.</p>    <p><a name="p4.5.7" class="para" id="p4.5.7">4.5.7</a> The free depreciation in respect of Rangelock, Sealock and Annalock remained with WMI (UK) or its subsidiaries but could not, ofcourse, be used because these companies had no profits against which to offset the free depreciation.  The availability of this freedepreciation was not forgotten and, following advice from Norton Rose and Price Waterhouse, WMI embarked upon the re-structuringof WMI (UK) to enable the ship-owning subsidiaries to be sold off to buyers who could make use of the free depreciation.  In orderto avoid the stigma of pure tax avoidance, it was necessary to carry out the scheme in two stages.  First, there was the re-structuringwhich, as I have already set out, was completed on 6th February 1985.  Second, after a suitable interval which would be measuredin months, there would be the sale of the ship-owning companies.  It was thought that approximately Â£13 million or US$15 millionat then rates of exchange might be generated for WMI.</p>    <p><a name="p4.5.8" class="para" id="p4.5.8">4.5.8</a> The viability of such a scheme generated expertsâ reports on each side.  Much to my relief it became unnecessary to consider thereports or to call the experts because agreement was reached between the parties in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1. The Plaintiff accepts:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(i) that the Rangelock, Sealock and Annalock had been acquired by WMI (UK), or English subsidiaries of WMI (UK), in order to leaveopen the possibility of benefiting from capital allowances under UK tax law;</p>            <p>(ii) that the Defendants were advised in November 1984 that the re-structuring of WMI (UK) Ltd and its subsidiaries subsequently effectedon the 6th February 1985 created the possibility of a subsequent sale of the shares in Adleship Ltd, Mastship Ltd and Hardyship Ltdreflecting the value of the benefit of unused free depreciation and other capital allowances available in respect of the vesselsowned by those companies, and the Defendants <u>reasonably acted</u> on that advice.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2. The Plaintiff accepts Paragraph 379.4 of the Witness Statement of R Brothers.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>3. The Plaintiff and the 1st and 5th Defendants agree that any such sales could only be achieved if:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(i) A bank guarantee or other security in favour of the lessors had been obtained in respect of the obligations of the lessees underthe leases of the vessels;</p>            <p>(ii) The consent of the Plaintiff had been obtained to any such sale (as second mortgagees of each vessel and as second pledgees ofthe issued shares in each company).</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>The other Defendants were not aware of the details of or the requirements which may have been necessary to implement the scheme.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>4. As between the Plaintiff and the First Defendant the only issues are as to the prospects of 3(i) and (ii) being obtained, and inthe case of 3(ii) the likely terms on which such consent would be given.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4.5.9" class="para" id="p4.5.9">4.5.9</a> In the course of cross-examination, Mr. Brothers also accepted that the only issues are as set out in paras. 3(i) and (ii).  A furtherdispute as to whether WM and Mr. Brothers relied upon the prospect of the fruits of free depreciation for continuing to trade untilNovember 1984 was nipped in the bud by a supplemental agreement as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âSince 1982 - when the Marilock was put into WMI (UK) - it was honestly believed there were prospects of taking advantage of theprovisions of the UK tax legislation relating to capital allowances so as to obtain financial benefits for WMI which would improveits long-term position.  This possibility was not relied upon before the delivery of the Annalock as a factor in deciding whetherto continue or to cease trading or to take credit from the Fund.  However, as stated at the WM Board meeting on 21 September 1984(C27-71), Mr. Brothers had recently explored in negotiations in London the potential for utilising the available capital allowances(referred to in the minutes in terms of potential tax credits).  That potential had helped in enlisting the support of LBI, MMB andHSS for assistance with WMIâs short-term funding requirement over the following few months.  This bank support was a factor injustifying the assurance given by WMI to WM that there was no danger of WMI trading fraudulently in the period while WM was consideringWMIâs request for further support.  After Price Waterhouse advised on 2 November 1984, as stated in the agreement between the Plaintiffand WM on capital allowances, the Defendants reasonably acted on that advice.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4.5.10" class="para" id="p4.5.10">4.5.10</a> These issues, in my judgment, really stand or fall together.  The banks involved - HSBC, MMB and LBI, together with ADS - faced whatthey clearly regarded as an increasingly precarious position in view of WMIâs financial health or lack of it.  Assuming thereforethat any benefit at all was to be derived from the scheme, the banks and ADS would have to support each other.</p>    <p><a name="p4.5.11" class="para" id="p4.5.11">4.5.11</a> As far as the banks were concerned, their part would undoubtedly have been to provide a guarantee of the lesseesâ obligations ifthe scheme went forward whereby new owners would acquire the three vessels and lease them back to the WMI (UK) Group.  The new ownerswould require such a guarantee and it was unlikely in the extreme that any other guarantors could be found.  The advantage to thebanks would be that the existing loan arrangements would be taken over by the new owners whom the banks would be able to vet forfinancial stability.  Alternatively, the new owners would provide their own financing thus enabling the banks to be paid off.  ADSwould equally benefit from having a more substantial owner responsible for existing commitments.  If the banksâ loans were in factpaid off, ADSâ security in the form of the second mortgage over the vessels would become more valuable.</p>    <p><a name="p4.5.12" class="para" id="p4.5.12">4.5.12</a> The correspondence showing the course of negotiation between WMI, the banks and ADS in relation to the re-structuring of WMI (UK)demonstrates that the banks and ADS were proceeding with great caution and, at least on the part of ADS, some reluctance.  The factremains, however, that stage one of the scheme was set in place.  It seems to me, therefore, improbable in the extreme that, absentthe takeover and consequences thereof, the banks and ADS would not have gone on to the second stage assuming suitable purchasersfor the vessels could be found.  No one has suggested what conditions ADS might have required but I have no doubt that, having comethis far with WMI, ADS would not have insisted on conditions which would have destroyed the scheme.</p>    <p><a name="p4.5.13" class="para" id="p4.5.13">4.5.13</a> There was a suggestion that the banks might require a WM counter-guarantee for their guarantees.  Clearly, WM would not have accommodatedthem.  At the end of the day, however, I am satisfied that the banks would not have insisted on such a counter-guarantee.  Theirpositions, as I have suggested, would have been improved by the implementation of this scheme.  Their contingent liabilities undertheir guarantees would not be so onerous as might otherwise have been the case because of the reduced rental that would be chargedto the lessees in return for the acquisition by the new owners of the free depreciation.</p>    <p><a name="p4.5.14" class="para" id="p4.5.14">4.5.14</a> I am satisfied, therefore, that the Defendants were entitled to take some comfort from what was a not unreasonable anticipation ofreal benefits flowing from this scheme.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b><a name="5">5.

On this point, the parties are in headlong collision.</p>    <p><a name="p5.1.3" class="para" id="p5.1.3">5.1.3</a> On the first issue, Mr. Terence Cullen Q.C. for ADS put it thus in opening:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThere are two stages: firstly, was WMIâs business being carried on dishonestly, that is answered objectively for two reasons. Firstly, as we have looked at, the section envisages two stages - the business is being carried on with intent to defraud.  Thatenvisages someone carrying on business.  That is an unknown person is carrying on business and that is a matter that has to be decidedobjectively, because you do not know who the person is.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Then the second stage is deciding if a defendant was knowingly party to it.  Of course, in simple cases, my Lord, with only one director,the two stages are rolled into one - one finds simple cases where the two issues are not looked at, but the second reason for anobjective case is this, and it is an evidential one: in order to test a defendantâs state of mind, his belief that there was areasonable prospect, his evidence can be weighed against what an honest and reasonable director would have believed.  Each defendantis looked at subjectively and that is in our skeleton argument - we set out the two stages.  One: Was it being carried on dishonestly- answered objectively; two, the defendants knowingly prior to this understood - answered subjectively in relation to each defendant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.1.4" class="para" id="p5.1.4">5.1.4</a> As I understand it, the task I would have to perform would be to draw from established facts the inference that someone must havebeen carrying on WMIâs business in fraud of its creditors.  I have some difficulty in accepting that for the same reasons as givenby Mr. David Johnson Q.C. for W.M. in opening:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe agree it is a two-part inquiry.  The first part: what the Court should consider is whether the individuals actually carryingon the business in question did so with intent to defraud.  Such fraudulent intent, obviously, requires mens rea, a fraudulent intent,possessed by those individuals actually carrying on the business.  This talk of unknown persons carrying on, with respect, is absolutenonsense, because you are dealing with a particular situation.  Your Lordship has to decide who was carrying on the business andthen decide in relation to those people whether they had this dishonest state of mind and this dishonest intention.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.1.5" class="para" id="p5.1.5">5.1.5</a> Depending upon whom I find to have been carrying on the business, the submission ran, there may be an overlap with some or all ofthe Defendants; for example, if I find WM and Mr. Brothers to have been carrying on the business fraudulently it would not be necessaryfor me to go on and consider them again as part of stage 2.  It would only be necessary to consider whether any other Defendantswere parties to what was going on and dishonest in their participation.</p>    <p><a name="p5.1.6" class="para" id="p5.1.6">5.1.6</a> It is trite that a company has no mind or intent of its own.  Intent must be found in the minds of those responsible for carryingon its affairs.  It is also trite that, as far as the criminal law is concerned, a person intends to commit an offence only if hehas the aim or purpose to bring about the elements of that offence.  Intent is not necessarily to be inferred by reason of the factthat the result is the natural and probable consequence of that personâs actions but to be derived from a consideration of allthe facts and circumstances.

To obtain goods on credit with the intentionof not paying for them is dishonest; to obtain goods on credit when it is known that there is no chance of paying for them may amountto much the same thing; in either case the unpaid creditors could be said to have been intentionally defrauded.  It is differenthowever if no such intention can be imputed to the buyer or if he does intend to pay for goods but in the event fails to do so. In such a case the degree of fault depends upon the buyerâs estimate of the probability or improbability of payment at the timewhen the goods were purchased, but even if the chances of payment of all creditors in full were so remote that it belonged to therealms of hope rather than belief, it seems to me that the fault, grievous though it may be, falls short of fraud unless it is coupledwith something else, such as misrepresentation of the position or an intention to use goods purchased on credit for the purposesof dishonest gain, which gives it a fraudulent character.â</p>    <p><a name="p5.1.12" class="para" id="p5.1.12">5.1.12</a> Mr. Cullen accepted that in a simple case such as <i><u>Hardie v.

At p.77, the judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIn my opinion I must hold with regard to the meaning of the phrase carrying on business âwith intent to defraud creditorsâthat, if a company continued to carry on business and to incur debts at a time when there is to the knowledge of the directors noreasonable prospect of the creditors ever receiving payment of those debts, it is, in general, a proper inference that the companyis carrying on business with intent to defraud.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.1.14" class="para" id="p5.1.14">5.1.14</a> My own view is that, upon a careful reading of <i><u>Hardie</u></i>, the High Court was not in fact departing from that general proposition but simply saying that each case has to be looked at in thelight of its own facts and on the facts of their case something more would have been needed to establish the necessary fraudulentintent.  The correct law I find to be that laid down in <i><u>Grantham</u></i> (para. <a>5.1.</a>20).  It would be an extraordinary proposition that it would be unsafe ever to infer fraud on the part of a person taking credit ata time when he knew that his company would never be able to repay the creditor.</p>    <p><a name="p5.1.15" class="para" id="p5.1.15">5.1.15</a> Lightman J. gave a clearer indication <i><u>In re Leyland DAF Ltd.</u></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%204%20All%20ER%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 4 All ER 300</a> where of fraudulent trading he said at p. 311:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âUnder s 213 of the 1986 Act, if in the course of the winding up of a company it appears that the business of the company has beencarried on with intent to defraud the creditors of the company, the court may on the application of the liquidator declare that anypersons who were knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business in such manner are liable to make such contribution (if any)to the companyâs assets as the court thinks proper.  The required intent to defraud is subjective, and not objective, and accordinglyit is necessary to show that there was either an intent to defraud or a reckless indifference whether or not the creditors were defrauded(see <i>R v Lockwood</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20Crim%20LR%20244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] Crim LR 244).â</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.1.16" class="para" id="p5.1.16">5.1.16</a> It is quite clear that the thread running through all the cases is one of subjectivity.  There is, in my view, no warrant for importingan objective threshold as the basis for establishing that the business of the company concerned was being carried on in fraud ofcreditors.  Fraudulent intent must be established subjectively after a careful examination of all the evidence.  Even in what appearto be water-tight cases, fraud may not be found - simply an unjustified albeit honest âchasing of the rainbowâ.  If circumstancesfrom which an inference of fraud might otherwise be drawn do not give rise to such a finding, it would be wrong to put a directorin jeopardy as party to that âfraudâ.</p>    <p><a name="p5.1.17" class="para" id="p5.1.17">5.1.17</a> Perhaps Hoffmann J. put it most clearly <i><u>In re Augustus Barnett &amp; Son Ltd.</u></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20BCLC%20170" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] BCLC 170.</a>  This involved an application to strike out a claim brought under section 332(1) of the Companies Act 1948, the equivalent of section275(1) as amended.  At p. 173, the judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is a necessary condition of the courtâs power to make an order under this section that it appears that âany business ofthe company has been carried on with intent to defraudâ.  Transferring the passive to the active voice, this in my judgement involvesa finding that someone has done an act which can be described as carrying on some business of the company and that in doing so hehad an intent to defraud.  Equally, the words âany business of the company has been carried on ... for any fraudulent purposeâmust mean that someone carrying on the business had a fraudulent purpose in doing so.  Once this condition has been satisfied, thecourt may impose personal liability on any persons who were knowingly âparties toâ carrying on of the business âin manner aforesaidâ. The words âpersons ... parties toâ may be wide enough to cover outsiders who could not be said to have carried on or even assistedthe carrying on of the companyâs business but who nevertheless in some way participated in the fraudulent acts.  For an example,see <i>Re Gerald Cooper Chemicals Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%202%20All%20ER%2049" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 2 All ER 49</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20Ch%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] Ch 262.</a>  But I cannot see how the requirements of the section can be satisfied if no fraudulent intent is alleged against any person whoactually carries on the business.  In such a case, there are no fraudulent acts to which the outsider can have been a party and hisown state of mind seems to me for present purposes irrelevant.  It may give rise to liability in deceit or some other cause of actionbut not under s 332 of the 1948 Act.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.1.18" class="para" id="p5.1.18">5.1.18</a> It seems to me that authority is against ADS.  Should any doubt remain, it must, I think, be laid to rest by a passage which appearsin a judgment of Jones J. given on 15th December 1989 upon an application by the defendants to strike out fraudulent trading.  Atp. 8, the judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn respect of the submissions made by counsel for the defendants on the claim based upon fraudulent trading, Mr Cullen for theplaintiff agreed with the following propositions:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">1.

A manintends to defraud a creditor either if he intends that the creditor shall never be paid or alternatively if he intends to obtaincredit or carry on obtaining credit when the rights and interests of the creditor are being prejudiced in a way which the defendanthimself knows is generally regarded as dishonest. . . . Some fraudulent traders intend from the outset never to pay or never to paymore than a fraction of the debt.  If that is true in your view in this case then the intent to defraud would be made out but a tradercan intend to defraud if he obtains credit when there is a substantial risk of the creditor not getting his money or not gettingthe whole of his money and the defendant knows that that is the position and knows he is stepping beyond the bounds of what ordinarydecent people engaged in business would regard as honest.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMembers of the jury, if a man honestly believes when he obtains credit that although funds are not immediately available he willbe able to pay them when the debt becomes due or within a short time thereafter, no doubt you would say that is not dishonest andthere is no intent to defraud but if he obtains or helps to obtain credit or further credit when he knows there is no good reasonfor thinking funds will become available to pay the debt when it becomes due or shortly thereafter then, though it is entirely amatter for you this question of dishonesty, you might well think that is dishonest and there is an intent to defraud.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.1.21" class="para" id="p5.1.21">5.1.21</a> It is important, however, to distinguish an alleged fraudsterâs motive from his intention.

There is really no dispute about the law.  The further a person departs from objective standards of honesty, the more likely itbecomes that he is dishonest.

TheDefendantsâ point is that under s.275 ADS is entitled to no more than a declaration.  Any award which the court may make must bein favour of the liquidators for them to distribute pari passu amongst the general body of creditors.</p>    <p><a name="p5.2.2" class="para" id="p5.2.2">5.2.2</a> An application under s.275 is usually made by a liquidator so that no question arises about the destination of any award made.

In that case, the Commissioners of Customs and Excise made an application under s.332 of the CompaniesAct 1948 which is in all respects similar to s.275.  Before the application was heard, the director at whom it was aimed made paymentto the Commissioners.  The liquidator then sought a declaration that the sum received by the Commissioners was held by them on trustfor the creditors generally.  After reading s.332, Lord Denning M.R. said at p. 902:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn my judgment, that section is deliberately framed in wide terms so as to enable the court to bring fraudulent persons to book. If a man has carried on the business of a company fraudulently, the court can make an order against him for the payment of a fixedsum:  see <i>In re William C. Leitch Bros. Ltd.</i>  An order can be made either at the suit of the liquidator, etc., or of <i>a</i> <i>creditor</i>.  The sum may be compensatory.  Or it may be punitive.  The court has full power to direct its destination.  The words are quitegeneral:  âall or any of the debts or other liabilities of the company as the court shall direct.â  By virtue of these wordsthe court can order the sum to go in discharge of the debt of any particular creditor; or that it shall go to a particular classof creditors; or to the liquidator so as to go into the general assets of the company, so long as it does not exceed the total ofthe debts or liabilities.  Of course, when an application is made by a liquidator, the court will usually order the sum to go intothe general assets, as Eve J. did in <i>In re William C. Leitch Bros. Ltd.</i> (No. 2), but I do not think it is bound to do so.  Certainly when an application is made by a creditor who has been defrauded, thecourt has power, I think, to order the sum to be paid to that creditor.  In short, I think the words of the section are to be giventheir full width.  When a creditor applies, as the commissioners did here, he applies on his own account.  He does not apply as beingunder a trust for the other creditors or for anyone else.  He is the master of his own application.  He can discontinue his application,if he likes, without getting the sanction of the liquidator.  But no doubt the liquidator should always be made a party to the proceedings,so that the interests of the other creditors can be safeguarded.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.2.3" class="para" id="p5.2.3">5.2.3</a> Danckwerts L.J. agreed, saying that âthe creditor should be entitled to his rewardâ and âthe court would appear to have a widediscretion under the sectionâ.</p>    <p><a name="p5.2.4" class="para" id="p5.2.4">5.2.4</a> Russell L.J. disagreed.  At page 906, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is observed that section 332 does not envisage as essential to its working more than a simple declaration of personal responsibilityfor Â£x, being all or part of the debts or other liabilities of the company:  no order that the person shall pay the sum to anyonein particular is required or in terms envisaged.  This is certainly consistent with the contention that the section never envisagesany outcome of its operation other than the conferring upon the liquidator as such a right to enforce the personal responsibilityas an addition to the assets of the company in his hands.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In the two <i>Leitch</i> cases, before Maugham J. and Eve J. respectively, it is, I think, apparent that nobody concerned thought that there could be anybut two constructions of this section:  one, that any declaration must swell the general assets of the company in liquidation; theother, that any declaration must benefit as a class and be apportioned among only those creditors of the company who have been defrauded: see <i>Leitch</i> (No. 1), and <i>Leitch</i> (No. 2).  The sum of Â£6,000 was ordered to be paid to the liquidator, and which of those two constructions of the section was correctwas left to be dealt with on an ordinary summons in the winding-up (not under the then equivalent of section 332), and was so dealtwith by Eve J. in <i>Leitch</i> (No. 2)  It is true that Eve J. refers to an argument on the effect of the <i>order</i> made by Maugham J., but, as I understand it, his decision was on the question which of those two constructions of the <i>section</i> was correct.

The present significance of those two cases is that it did not occur to anyone that therewas a discretion in the court to decide who was to benefit from the declaration and in what proportions.  The most powerful argumentin favour of the contention that such a discretion exists lies in the use of the phrase âpersonally responsible ... for all orany of the debts or other liabilities of the company as the court may direct,â instead of a provision empowering the court in therelevant circumstances to order the person to contribute to the assets of the company a sum equivalent to all or any of the debts,etc. etc.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">But there are, it seems to me, several objections to the suggested construction.  The liquidator must get on with distribution ofthe assets among creditors in accordance with their admitted proofs.  A declaration in favour of a defrauded creditor might be madeany time, and the enforcement by him of the declaration might bear fruit at some uncertain point of time, or in driblets, or notat all:  and all outside the purview of the liquidator.  How is such a system to be fitted into the scheme of liquidation?  Further,if declarations may be made in favour of particular creditors, perhaps on different applications, how are priorities as among themto be solved?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I have already referred to the fact that an order to pay to any particular person is not envisaged as an essential part of the schemeof the section.  And it seems to me that personal responsibility for a sum stated, measured by reference to all or any of the debtsof the company, is a perfectly appropriate description of responsibility <i>to the company</i> which has incurred the debts without it being in any way necessary to extend it to embrace also responsibility direct to particularcreditors.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I would hesitate to construe the section in a manner which never occurred to Maugham J. and Eve J. as a possibility.  But in any eventI am of opinion that it is not the true construction, but that section 332 can result only in an accretion to the assets of the companyfor distribution in due course of winding-up.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.2.5" class="para" id="p5.2.5">5.2.5</a> The point arose again in <i><u>Re Esal (Commodities) Ltd., London and Overseas (Sugar) Co.

A compromise in full and final settlement of all disputes was reached and approved by the committeeof inspection and the liquidators.  One shareholder, however, disagreed with the compromise and commenced his own proceedings unders.332.  At first instance, Lindsay J. held that any recovery under that section had to be in favour of a liquidator and not an individualshareholder.  He carried out a close analysis of the law and, in particular, <i><u>Cyona</u></i>.  He agreed with the view of Russell L.J.  At page 880, he added:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf, for any reason, the liquidator (who, as <i>Cyona</i> itself shows, should always be a party) cannot or chooses not to pursue a s 332 application which a creditor is willing to pursue,that liquidator is at liberty (no doubt after obtaining the sanction of the court or of the committee) to agree terms with the creditoras to some distribution other than pari passu of whatever those proceedings might yield by way of judgment in the liquidatorâsfavour.  Danckwerts LJ was plainly influenced by the need for a scheme under which âcreditor should be entitled to his rewardâ: see  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%201%20All%20ER%20281" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 1 All ER 281</a> at 285,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%20Ch%20889" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] Ch 889</a> at 904.

Ralph Gibson L.J. said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFor my part, I think that the court would have such power, although the circumstances in which it could be properly exercised would,no doubt, be unusual.

I am equally satisfied, however, that where proper arrangements have been made between a creditor and liquidator, and those arrangementshave been approved by the committee of inspection and the court, the court has jurisdiction to make an award directly in favour ofthe creditor.

There was apparently no objection from any of the other members of the committee of inspection. On 5th January 1989, an order was made by consent that the date of dissolution of WMI be deferred until the final hearing of ADSâapplication in these proceedings or any appeal therefrom.</p>    <p><a name="p5.2.13" class="para" id="p5.2.13">5.2.13</a> It is true that there is no tidy formal agreement between ADS and the liquidators approved by the committee of inspection.

Those proceedings apart, the winding-up of WMI was effectively over.

They help, however, to explain 2 things.  First, why ADS chose to takeon the very heavy burden of proving fraud against the Defendants.  A combination of the crippling debt, substantial deficits shownin the long-term cash flows, the continuing depressed market conditions and the apparent reluctance on the part of WM to help WMIleaves no room, according to ADS, for a genuine belief on the part of the Defendants that WM would support and thereby save WMI.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.4" class="para" id="p5.4.4">5.4.4</a> Second, the facts show the inherent implausibility of the Defendants being dishonest or, not to put too fine a point on it, swindlers. If fraudsters or swindlers they were then the Defendants indulged in what must be one of the most transparent frauds ever recorded. For fraud is not normally meticulously recorded nor carried out under the advice and scrutiny of legal and financial advisers.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.5" class="para" id="p5.4.5">5.4.5</a> ADS' case is pleaded thus</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â<u>Fraudulent trading</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2.5 The said loans were made and the said indebtedness was incurred and/or allowed to continue at a time when, unknown to the Plaintiff,but known to all the Defendants (or which ought to have been known or in respect of which the Defendants acted with reckless disregardtherefor) WMI was insolvent and unable to pay its debts as they fell due.  Further and/or alternatively the said indebtedness wasincurred and/or allowed to continue at a time when the Defendants knew or ought to have known that there was no reasonable prospectthat the loans would ever be repaid or that the shortfall guarantees which supported them (see below) would be honoured or at a timewhen they had reckless disregard as to whether such prospects were reasonable.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.4.6" class="para" id="p5.4.6">5.4.6</a> It is not contended that the mere fact of trading while insolvent is sufficient to constitute fraudulent trading.  It is simply afact (now admitted) upon which ADS relies to help prove its primary case that the Defendants knew that there was no reasonable prospectof the credit taken from ADS ever being repaid, whether by the shipowning companies or by WMI under its guarantees.  The key to thisissue was parental support - not the provision of actual support but the Defendantsâ perception of whether it would be forthcoming. And the issue crystallised as whether each Defendant had an honest belief that WM would support WMI.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.7" class="para" id="p5.4.7">5.4.7</a> In relation to the period leading up to delivery of Sealock in April 1983, ADS, after setting out all the ills affecting WMI, pleaded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â5.15 The cash flow projection referred to in Paragraph 4.1.4 above showed WMIâs prospects on <u>two bases, one of which was that all WMIâs lenders consented to the proposed re-financing</u>.  This was not realistic because it was known that the rescheduling of all WMIâs loans would probably be dependent on the substantialinjection of additional cash from the shareholders.  It was not realistic to expect that such an injection would be achieved.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>5.16 WMI was, therefore, entirely dependent on third party support for an injection of cash to avoid not just an immediate cash flowcrisis but also a decline into a serious asset deficiency within the next two or three years.  It was not realistic to assume thatsuch support would be given, either by the First Defendant or by a third party.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>5.17 However, the First Defendant was not committed to or intending to support WMI through its financial difficulties and was notprepared to provide the essential financial support to ensure its survival.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and after reviewing the S&amp;C report,</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â5.18 No further significant improvement was achieved to WMIâs position prior to 8th April 1983.  In particular, the Defendantsknew by 8th April 1983 that not all the remedial action on which the cash flow projections had been based would be achieved.  Inparticular, agreements to sell the M.V. âFenlockâ and M.V. âInverlockâ had not been achieved, and no loans had been rescheduled. Further, no commitment of further cash from  WMIâs shareholders had been or was likely to be forthcoming.  Therefore, in the lightof the above, it was plain, or should have been, that WMI could not meet its debts as they fell due and was wholly dependent on ThirdParty support.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>5.19 WMI was insolvent, it had a deficiency of assets over liabilities on a net realisable asset basis, and was doomed to be placedin insolvent liquidation.  In any event it was or ought to have been obvious that no new credit should have been incurred by WMI. All the aforesaid was apparent or should have been apparent to the Defendants and the Plaintiff will contend that upon a properanalysis of WMIâs position, it should have been put into liquidation on or around this date.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.4.8" class="para" id="p5.4.8">5.4.8</a> In relation to Annalock, ADS pleaded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â16.2 To the extent that there was any chance at all of WMI surviving such was at best a remote and certainly not a reasonable chancebut even this depended (and this was or should have been plain to the Defendants) on the First Defendant, in its capacity as theparent Company of WMI providing total commitment to WMI.  Until after Discovery and/or Interrogatories, the Plaintiff contends thatsuch total commitment could not have been reasonably expected at this or any later stage given the state of the market and the parlousstate of WMI when compared with the financial position of the First Defendant and its interests.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.4.9" class="para" id="p5.4.9">5.4.9</a> ADS then referred to the failure by HKR to offer support and went on:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â16.11 In the circumstances, it was clear that WMIâs survival was <u>dependent</u> on the commitment of the First Defendant.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>16.12 It was also the case, however, that the First Defendant would not make such total commitment and would not provide the supportthat Schroders and Chartered had advised was necessary.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.4.10" class="para" id="p5.4.10">5.4.10</a> Again, there was a catalogue of WMIâs problems and WMâs reactions, on the basis of which ADS asserted:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â16.20 The First Defendant was not committed to or intending to support WMI through its financial difficulties and was not preparedto provide the essential financial support to ensure its survival.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>16.21 By the 22nd March 1984 WMI was (irrespective of its earlier insolvency) demonstrably doomed to be put into insolvent liquidation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.4.11" class="para" id="p5.4.11">5.4.11</a> After delivery of Annalock, ADS recited the further lack of progress by WMI and concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â25.15 No new finance was, as must have been or could and should have been expected, received from the First Defendant and thatno further funds could be provided was expressly stated on 6th March 1985 (and confirmed by letter dated 28th March 1985).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.4.12" class="para" id="p5.4.12">5.4.12</a> In their original defences, the Defendants denied that WMI was entirely dependent on third party support but asserted that, in thelight of support that was given, it was reasonable to expect it to continue and that it did.  On 29th August 1995, however, the defenceswere amended two weeks before trial began.  In para. 58, which denied paragraphs 5.15-16 of the claim, there were introduced twonew sub-paragraphs:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â<u>(1)</u> <u>It had been the 1st Defendantâs policy of long standing that each of its subsidiaries should strive to be profitable out of itsown resources and resolve any temporary difficulties it might encounter, but if, having taken reasonable steps to resolve them, itwas unable to do so without support, the 1st Defendant would provide support.</u></p>        <p><u>(3)</u> <u>In a series of meetings held in late November 1982 between key directors of the 1st Defendant, namely the 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 6th Defendants(who were also directors of WMI), Jaime Ortiz-Patino and Peter Griffiths, it was agreed that the 1st Defendant should support WMIin the terms the first page of a memorandum by the 5th Defendant to the 3rd and 6th Defendants dated 8th December 1982 recordingthe consensus reached.</u>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.4.13" class="para" id="p5.4.13">5.4.13</a> The memorandum there referred to is the December memorandum (App. 3/1).</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.14" class="para" id="p5.4.14">5.4.14</a> It having been accepted by the Defendants that WMI depended for survival on WM support, the plea in sub-paragraph (3) became a major,if not the most important factor, on which the Defendants relied for their confidence that support would be forthcoming.  Becauseof its importance, a significant amount of time was spent understandably in cross-examination of Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung, Mr. Brothersand Mr. Ortiz-Patino in trying to establish the true nature of what took place in November.  After a great deal of twisting and turning,the picture as presented by these witnesses was of a commitment by the two major shareholders of WM, Mr. Marden and Mr. Cheung, tosupport WMI once it had carried out the strategy set out in the December memorandum.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.15" class="para" id="p5.4.15">5.4.15</a> ADSâ case is that there was no more than an informal and unofficial understanding or âgame planâ between four WMI and two WMdirectors to the effect that, if certain plans were implemented, there would be a once-and-for-all fund-raising exercise to keepWMI afloat.  Whatever the value of this understanding may have been, ADS contends that that value evaporated two months later inJanuary 1983 when first, the Rangelock guarantee was given contrary to para. (iv) on the first page of the December memorandum; andsecond, the WM Board on 26th January 1983 made an unequivocal affirmation of its policy on support (see para. 3.5.11).</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.16" class="para" id="p5.4.16">5.4.16</a> I should mention that the Defendants argued that ADS was here alleging a change of intention, a matter not pleaded.  I disagree. ADS, in my view, was simply saying that any legitimate expectation of support was dashed in January 1983.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.17" class="para" id="p5.4.17">5.4.17</a> The difficulty with the second contention is that plainly the WM Board was not considering the question of its policy on supportgenerally but its more limited policy as to the giving of indemnities and guarantees.  It was the evidence of 4 directors, Mr Lees,Mr Lee, Mr Brothers and Mr Leung, which I accept, that the debate and resolution arose out of Mr. Cheungâs anger that the Rangelockguarantee had been provided without formal Board approval.  Whatever the nature of the November consensus was, it was not, I am satisfied,in any way undermined by the Board resolution.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.18" class="para" id="p5.4.18">5.4.18</a> It is equally plain that the December memorandum does not set out a detailed plan from which there could be no deviation if WMI wereto get support.  There would have to be flexibility, as the 4 directors said, to meet market conditions and the failure of any stepstaken while WMI pursued its recovery efforts.  Further, an important component of the plan was missing.  Inherent was the need, beforeâonce-and-for-allâ support could be given, to quantify the amount of support required.  This first surfaced in the telex fromMr. Ortiz-Patino (App. 3/5) and was accepted as axiomatic by the directors.  It is inconceivable, however much Mr. Marden would haveliked it, that WM would have been prepared to give WMI a blank cheque which would in effect have obviated the need for WMI to doanything at all and would certainly have provided no incentive for the banks to help by way of a moratorium or otherwise.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.19" class="para" id="p5.4.19">5.4.19</a> It also seems to me inconceivable, again whatever Mr. Marden may have wanted, that WM would provide the support ultimately foundto be necessary if the amount required was out of proportion to WMâs resources or indicative of an incurable malaise on the partof WMI.  Put another way, WM would not support a subsidiary which could not be demonstrated to have the potential to return to profitability. And that would be consistent with WMâs policy on support which was pleaded in new sub-paragraph (1).  To that plea, therefore,must be added the essential ingredient that support would be provided if it was thought that the subsidiary would probably returnto profitability.  Such an ingredient, of course, is no more than good business sense.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.20" class="para" id="p5.4.20">5.4.20</a> Mr. Marden was too ill to give evidence.  His witness statement went in by way of hearsay notice and so was not tested by cross-examination. He seems to me, however, to have set out the position in relation to WMâs policy on support as it related to WMI from 1982 onwardswith admirable clarity and, I am convinced, accuracy.  After referring to the different interests of himself and Mr. Cheung, Mr.Marden said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â10. Quite apart from the ordinary disciplines of a public company, these diverse interests meant that it was simply not possiblefor one arm of the Group, such as WMI, to be continually supported by Wheelock Marden &amp; Co. Ltd., regardless of the cost (evenif one had wanted to).  Accordingly, each company in the Group was responsible for raising finance for itself on its own and didnot raise finance on the strength of Wheelock Marden &amp; Co. Ltd.âs guarantee.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">11. Whilst this was the general policy of the Group, it was also true that all interests in the Wheelock Group saw the need to supportany particular member of the Group which might be experiencing difficulties so as to protect the value of the investment in thatailing member and to preserve the sound reputation of the Group as a whole.  This kind of support was given on an ad hoc basis andcould be called the âdrip feedâ approach.  This kind of support was particularly important in 1982/83 when general business confidencein Hong Kong was low and well known companies, such as Carrian, Eda, Hang Lung Bank and various finance companies collapsed or werein the process of collapsing.  Rumours abounded about many of the more established Hong Kong companies.  For example, Hong Kong Landwent through a very difficult phase during this period.  Shipping companies in Hong Kong went through a very difficult time and justabout the only major Hong Kong shipping company to weather the storm was the World-Wide Shipping Group.  Those who were not in HongKong at the time tend to forget this or to under-estimate its seriousness.  Particularly in the light of the economic climate, Ithink everyone on the board of directors of Wheelock Marden &amp; Co. Ltd. saw the need to avoid speculation about the stabilityof any member of the Group and therefore understood the need to assist an ailing member so as to ensure the survival of the Group. Reports prepared by Schroders and Rothschilds at this time highlight this point.  Group support could nevertheless only be givenso long as there was a realistic prospect of survival in the longer term.  Any such support could only be on a case-by-case basisand could not be an âopen endedâ commitment.  No one would have agreed to support a company which had no prospect of surviving,even at that difficult time.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.4.21" class="para" id="p5.4.21">5.4.21</a> Whatever label may be put on the November consensus, I am satisfied and find that it was in substance an endorsement by the majorshareholders of WM, i.e. by Mr. Marden in person and by Mr. Cheung through Mr. Griffiths, of the general strategy WMI had alreadyadopted to try and retrieve its difficult position, and an affirmation that WMâs policy on support would apply to WMI.  In otherwords, WMI was effectively being told âcarry on along the lines you are already following, taking into account our own suggestions(as set out in the December memorandum).  When you have done all you reasonably can and can tell us how much you need then, providedthe figure is not outrageous and we are not throwing more money down the drain, we will helpâ.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.22" class="para" id="p5.4.22">5.4.22</a> Hence it was left to Mr. Brothers to record, which he did with no great alacrity, what were no more than guidelines.  It is unlikelythat a true commitment would have been the subject of such a casual approach.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.23" class="para" id="p5.4.23">5.4.23</a> Once that is appreciated, various anomalies, inconsistencies and contradictions disappear.  There is an explanation for there beingno further reference to what took place in November although echoes rang from time to time, for example, in the telex from Mr. Ortiz-Patino. Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung and Mr. Brothers were taxed at length about this.  Why, they were asked, did they not mention or remind WM ofthe November consensus when they were in the midst of their troubles and WM was not responding as they hoped?  Their explanationstaxed my credulity.  But in truth there was nothing to explain.  There was no reason to remind WM or its shareholders of a well-understoodpolicy.  That WM were less than sympathetic was no more than a manifestation of its requirement that WMI first do all it could tosurvive on its own and, in particular, of Mr. Cheungâs well-known attitude of negotiating hard and giving as little as possible.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.24" class="para" id="p5.4.24">5.4.24</a> It can also be understood why WMI received âdrip-feedâ support rather than a once-and-for-all injection.  WM was willing to helpto a limited extent while Mr. Brothers strove to stabilise WMI and quantify the amount of injection required.  That would be consistentwith a parent taking all reasonable steps not to let a subsidiary fail.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.25" class="para" id="p5.4.25">5.4.25</a> The criticism that the legal and financial advisers, who were said to have been told of the November âagreementâ or âcommitmentâ,made no reference to it falls away.  Mr. Shaw, Mr. Elliott and Mr. Reynolds clearly knew of the overall plan or strategy to be followedand assumed, as did ADSâ own witnesses, that WM as parent would support its subsidiary.  There was no commitment or agreement tosupport, unofficial or otherwise, about which they might have been informed.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.26" class="para" id="p5.4.26">5.4.26</a> Equally the criticism, that the advice repeatedly taken about fraudulent trading was a charade or pointless if there was an underlyingcommitment to support, falls away once it is appreciated that there was no such commitment.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.27" class="para" id="p5.4.27">5.4.27</a> All this misdirected evidence arose because, in my view, the plea in respect of the November consensus, which was introduced late,was sought to be invested with a character which was unjustified.  It is impossible to accept that it would not have formed partof the defence from the beginning if it had really had the character and importance which the Defendants attached to it.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.28" class="para" id="p5.4.28">5.4.28</a> Although Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung and Mr. Brothers sought comfort from the November consensus on a wholly misplaced basis, paradoxicallya degree of comfort was available.  It is my judgment that, unless and until WM gave a clear signal that it had turned its back onWMI, WMIâs directors were entitled to believe they would get support if they were able to go to WM with a request for a not unreasonablesum and at the same time demonstrate that this would probably lead to a return to profitability.  WMI had to show that WMâs investmentwould survive because WM could not, as a public limited company, simply throw its funds down the drain.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.29" class="para" id="p5.4.29">5.4.29</a> In my judgment, no such signal was given until 8th October 1984 at the earliest when WM advised WMI that in addition to waiving theWWW dividend, it was prepared to sell its shareholding in WMI for a nominal sum âas part of any reconstruction or reschedulingscheme although any proposal made should not require the provision of further finance by [WM]â (see paras. <a>3.6.222/223</a>).  That letter was signed by Mr. Lees.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.30" class="para" id="p5.4.30">5.4.30</a> ADS attempted to undermine the comfort derived by the Defendants from the November consensus in a number of ways.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.31" class="para" id="p5.4.31">5.4.31</a> Whatever the nature of the November consensus (which I have found to be no more than an observance of existing policy), it dependedupon the continuing intention of the two major shareholders, Mr. Marden and Mr. Cheung.  There can be no doubt about Mr. Marden. He was a shipping man, the Group carried his name and he was grooming his son, Mr. A. Marden, to take over WMI.  He was anxiousfor WMI to survive and, according to Mr. Ortiz-Patino whose evidence I accept, was prepared to use his own fortune to buy out WMâsinvestment.  During 1983 and 1984 he began moves on three or four occasions to make such an investment.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.32" class="para" id="p5.4.32">5.4.32</a> Mr. Cheung, however, was another matter.  He and Mr. Marden were uneasy and unlikely partners.  Their relationship suffered as aresult of the Rangelock guarantee.  It was worsened in 1983 and 1984 after Mr. Marden transferred his WM shareholding into a trustbut did not give, or was unable to obtain from the trustees, an undertaking to observe the shareholdersâ agreement between himand Mr. Cheung to vote their shareholdings together.  But the unhappiness was not apparently all one way.  Correspondence that cameto light, while Mr. Ortiz-Patino was giving evidence, indicates that Mr. Marden was concerned about Mr. Cheungâs intentions towardsthe Group, being suspicious that Mr. Cheung wanted to break it up and leave Hong Kong taking with him the money from the better-offsubsidiaries.  (See para. 5.11.11)</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.33" class="para" id="p5.4.33">5.4.33</a> So WM was not exactly a happy family.  It is not difficult to see why ADS maintains that Mr. Cheungâs intentions towards WMI couldnot be relied upon.  Inter alia, ADS pointed out that in his telex of 12th April 1983 (App. 3/20) Mr. Griffiths, who representedMr. Cheung, quite clearly regarded the November consensus as dead and was against support.  ADS thought this not surprising giventhe tenor of Mr. Ortiz-Patinoâs telex of 31st March 1983 (App. 3/5).</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.34" class="para" id="p5.4.34">5.4.34</a> For my part, I readily accept the explanations by Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung, Mr. Brothers and Mr. Ortiz-Patino himself about Mr. Ortiz-Patinoâstelex.  Mr. Ortiz-Patino was angry that WMI, through Mr. Brothers, had not moved faster in carrying out the survival plan and wasendeavouring to stir Mr. Brothers and the two managing directors into quicker action.  I have no difficulty in interpreting the telexin that way.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.35" class="para" id="p5.4.35">5.4.35</a> In passing, it must be said that the idea which emerges from the December memorandum that Mr. Brothers could have effectively putthe various steps in place by Christmas 1982 or soon after was quite unrealistic.  WMI could, I suppose, have cancelled all its newbuilding contracts unilaterally but with calamitous results.  There would undoubtedly have been claims by the shipyards for substantialdamages while the news of such action by WMI could only have put it under greater pressure by existing creditors and brought aboutits demise much earlier.  If WMI was going to make a success of its survival plan or strategy, I have no doubt that the more careful,negotiated approach adopted by Mr. Brothers and WMI was required.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.36" class="para" id="p5.4.36">5.4.36</a> As far as Mr. Griffithsâ telex is concerned, I reject the suggestions by, for example, Mr. Brothers that Mr. Griffiths had forgottenthe November consensus and the explanation by Mr. Ortiz-Patino that Mr. Griffiths was a sick man.  For my part, I see the telex asa rebuttal of any idea Mr. Brothers might have harboured that WMI could fall back on WM if its expansion plans went wrong.  Mr. Griffithsgoes on, however, to recognise that things have gone wrong and that it is more important to see what, if anything, can be done torectify the situation rather than argue about who is to blame.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.37" class="para" id="p5.4.37">5.4.37</a> I accept, of course, that in his telex Mr. Griffiths gave no firm commitment of support.  I accept also that Mr. Griffiths apparentlyreinforced his uncompromising view in his later telex of 19th May 1983 (para. <a>3.5.110</a>).  Some light, however, was shed on this in a letter written by Mr. Griffiths to Mr. Marden in November 1983 in which Mr. Griffithssaid:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âI have heard little from Hongkong except that J.C. did tell me that as a result of Rothschilds opinion limited support of US$ 4million was going to be made available for WMI.  I hope that matters in the shipping spectrum will improve and that as a result ofthis support WMI will be enabled to survive.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>I regret that there differences of opinion between us concerning the 12 million support that was previously being considered but youare well aware that my only consideration was to protect the Directors and I still remain of the same opinion that on the ad[v]icesgiven it would have been a most dangerous move to have committed as then requested.  Anyhow I hope as I have said that things willimprove on the shipping side.  I think you were terribly let down firstly by Robbies folie de grandeur and secondly by John and Henrynot having exercised the control which it was their duty to exert.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>As you know in the event of anything going wrong it is you who has to take the can and I was extremely exercised at the time thata bad decision would be made which would have made a bad situation worse.  I fully believe that this was also the motivation of JCat the time.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.4.38" class="para" id="p5.4.38">5.4.38</a> It seems to me to be clear that Mr. Griffiths was not set against support as such but was concerned to protect the WM directors.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.39" class="para" id="p5.4.39">5.4.39</a> Mr. Griffithsâ telexes, of course, straddled the decision by WM on 27th April 1983 to adjourn WMIâs request for support pendinga decision by HKR whether to invest US$12 million in WMI.  It is not clear how HKRâs involvement came about.  There is evidence(para. <a>3.5.89</a>) that a syndicate, actually Mr. Marden, was considering acquiring a stake in WMI.  On this and on other occasions Mr. Ortiz-Patinosaid, and I accept, that he tried to dissuade Mr. Marden from investing his own money until WM, whose responsibility Mr. Ortiz-Patinofelt it was, declined to support WMI.  Whether Mr. Cheung simply wished to put a spoke in Mr. Mardenâs wheel or whether Mr. Mardendiscussed WMI with Mr. Cheung, what is clear is that Mr. Cheung agreed that HKR would at least consider investing in WMI.  Unless,of course, the whole exercise was no more than a piece of window-dressing, and there is no evidence to support that, it is difficultto see how it can be maintained that, at least until September 1983, Mr. Cheung and therefore WM had no intention of supporting WMI.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.40" class="para" id="p5.4.40">5.4.40</a> The report by EAW on the suitability of WMI as an investment is not available.  Mr. Lees and Mr. Leung, who were directors of HKR,said they did not receive copies of the report although a letter of 15th September 1983 from Mr. Tipper to HKRâs directors, inwhich Mr. Tipper advised them of the HKR committeeâs decision, indicates copies had been sent to all directors.  It may be, however,that Mr. Tipper intended handing copies to the managing directors directly but did not get round to it.  At all events, Mr. Leesand Mr. Leung, in evidence, said they saw copies just before or at the HKR Board meeting.  Mr. Lees remembered that there were anumber of conclusions of which three were:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) EAW were more pessimistic about the future of the shipping market than WMI;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) It would be some years before a return on investment could be realised;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) The investment was outside HKRâs normal field.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.4.41" class="para" id="p5.4.41">5.4.41</a> Mr. Leung remembered that such an investment was not HKRâs main business and that for HKR there would not appear to be a satisfactoryreturn. </p>    <p><a name="p5.4.42" class="para" id="p5.4.42">5.4.42</a> ADS viewed with considerable suspicion the fact that no copy of the EAW report can be found.  The implication is that it has beenburied because it contained material and conclusions that substantially condemned WMIâs position as hopeless.  I am unable to acceptthat.  While it is strange that no copy is available the conclusions recalled by Mr. Lees and Mr. Leung are not untenable.  Nor arethey inconsistent with the evidence of Mr. Reynolds who thought EAW could very well have given HKR advice different from the financialadvice given to WM because of the different positions of HKR and WMI.  The conclusions remembered by Mr. Lees and Mr. Leung, coupledwith the adverse publicity and minority shareholdersâ sentiment, would clearly have been sufficient grounds for HKR to declineto proceed.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.43" class="para" id="p5.4.43">5.4.43</a> There is then put into perspective the awkward position in which Mr. Poon thought he found himself at the WMI Board meeting on 15thSeptember 1983 (para. <a>3.5.241</a> and 246/247) when it was understood that HKR had declined to invest US$12 million and WM was again considering what to do.  Plainly,Mr. Poon was aware that the WM directors were concerned about their position.  Equally, I am satisfied he must have been aware ofa measure of goodwill on the part of WM otherwise, being the fussy and worried solicitor that he was, it is unlikely he would havebeen persuaded to vote to carry on.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.44" class="para" id="p5.4.44">5.4.44</a> In the meantime, pending a final package, support for WMI on a âdrip feedâ basis became necessary.  Such support, albeit on aniggardly basis, was forthcoming.  That it was parsimonious reflected Mr. Cheungâs attitude - press hard, pay little.  Thus, theUS$4 million facility albeit secured; WMâs counter-guarantee in relation to the ships for oil deal, offset against the facility;the further advance of US$720,000.00 against an undertaking to repay; and the waiving of the WWW dividend.  This, as the workingdirectors agreed, made life very hard for WMI.  They, particularly Mr. Brothers, continued their efforts to some effect.  No onefrom WM disillusioned them or suggested they were wasting their time and efforts.</p>    <p><a name="p5.4.45" class="para" id="p5.4.45">5.4.45</a> The question then which, in my view, needs to be answered is whether, until 8th October 1984 at the earliest, WMI directors couldjustifiably be confident that they would be able to go to WM with a package that WM would find palatable.  If not, they could hardlyhave had an honest belief that WM would support WMI.  The answer lies in an examination of the financial position of WMI as shownin the cash flows, the steps already taken pursuant to the November consensus and the steps contemplated in order to see whether,as Mr. Brothers put it, there was any light at the end of the tunnel.  At the same time account must be taken of WMâs reactionsto the developing situation.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="5.5">5.5    SEALOCK POSITION</a></p>    <p><a name="p5.5.1" class="para" id="p5.5.1">5.5.1</a> By the time WMI drew down the Sealock loan, it had made little progress in implementing any of the measures contemplated in November1982.  One ship, Manila Spirit, had been sold in March.  WMIâs insurance arm, WM&amp;S, had been sold, albeit within the Group. The price was less than hoped for but not one, I am satisfied, that could be classified as an under-value.  One Spanish new buildingwas to be cancelled and there was a prospect of cancellation of another.  It had not proved possible to cancel any other newbuildings,at least not without the probability of large claims for damages that would undoubtedly be terminal for WMI.  The Dalians, however,would not be delivered until January 1985.</p>    <p><a name="p5.5.2" class="para" id="p5.5.2">5.5.2</a> The proposed sale of Fenlock and Inverlock within the Group to Beauforte had been killed off by Mr. Griffiths.  Refinancing of Rangelock,Sealock and Manila Faith had failed and failed, as I find, not because of difficulties about the proposed lessorsâ year ends butbecause WMI was unable to obtain from WM the necessary letters of comfort as to WMIâs continued existence.</p>    <p><a name="p5.5.3" class="para" id="p5.5.3">5.5.3</a> S&amp;C had been appointed on 9th February.  On the basis of the then latest cash flows of 7th February, S&amp;C advised that existingcreditors would have to be approached for a moratorium and that these creditors would require WM support.  The banks did requiresuch support.  Such support was not forthcoming so that no moratorium had been obtained by the time Sealock was delivered.</p>    <p><a name="p5.5.4" class="para" id="p5.5.4">5.5.4</a> By 23rd February, S&amp;C were writing that the newbuildings were of fundamental importance.  The true importance was revealed bythe newbuildingsâ cash flow of 18th March which, in spite of remedial measures assumed to take place, showed a deficit of US$60million by December 1991.  It was undoubtedly this cash flow which for the first time fully revealed the enormity of WMIâs problemsand helped to prompt Mr. Ortiz-Patinoâs telex of 31st March.  That telex, later echoed by Mr. Griffiths on 10th April, called forcancellation of all vessels except Sealock.  Such wholesale cancellation, as Mr. Brothers indicated in his reply, was impracticablegiven the costs involved of between US$40-50 million.</p>    <p><a name="p5.5.5" class="para" id="p5.5.5">5.5.5</a> I note in passing that I do not regard Mr. Ortiz-Patinoâs complaint as being that Mr. Brothers or anyone had withheld informationfrom him.  Rather, he was appalled at the scale of the problem that had emerged on the latest cash flow.</p>    <p><a name="p5.5.6" class="para" id="p5.5.6">5.5.6</a> In the meantime, advice had been given by Mr. Shaw at the meeting on or about 17th February attended by Mr. Griffiths, Mr. Marden,Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung, Mr. Brothers and Mr. Poon.  That advice was to the effect that it was legitimate to carry on trading and takecredit provided that there was a reasonable prospect that debts or credit would be repaid.  It is agreed that that is the propertest, although on this occasion only Mr. Shaw added the gloss that new credit should not be taken unless it was essential to preserveassets.  The basic test was repeated from time to time not only by Mr. Shaw but also by S&amp;C.</p>    <p><a name="p5.5.7" class="para" id="p5.5.7">5.5.7</a> Finally, the S&amp;C report of 6th April sounded a caution about newbuildings; produced a 10-year cash flow for WMI as a whole whichwith a moratorium showed a deficit of US$56 million in January 1990 and without a moratorium a deficit of US$105 million in August1989; and drew up a balance sheet adjusted for market values and the effect of newbuildings showing net assets of just HK$39 million It recommended support from WM to ensure a 3-year moratorium and a stand-by facility of US$2 million in case the cash flow predictionthat there would be no deficit for 3 years, given a moratorium, proved inaccurate.</p>    <p><a name="p5.5.8" class="para" id="p5.5.8">5.5.8</a> It might be thought that WMI should have looked long and hard before drawing down US$25 million by way of loan for Sealock.  Insteadof a board meeting to consider this step, however, it was handled in a relatively informal way by the working directors, leavingthe Board formally to ratify later.  It must not be forgotten, however, that until the financial arrangements were revised to meetthe banksâ requirements, the loan would have been completely covered by the Danish Kroner deposits.  As it was, the release ofdeposits to the banks resulted in the loan becoming unsecured to the extent of US$8.8 million only.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="5.6">5.6    ANNALOCK POSITION</a></p>    <p><a name="p5.6.1" class="para" id="p5.6.1">5.6.1</a> On 20th April, WMI made a formal request to WM for support.  Whatever the reason, that developed into consideration by HKR of a US$12million investment in WMI.  That was a sum which would not only have kept creditors happy and produced a moratorium but also wouldprobably have gone a very long way to keeping WMI afloat.  The disappointment when HKR decided not to proceed was tempered only bythe provision by WM of the secured US$4 million facility.</p>    <p><a name="p5.6.2" class="para" id="p5.6.2">5.6.2</a> Meanwhile, implementation of the November consensus improved substantially, motivated not least by the strictures of Mr. Ortiz-Patinoand Mr. Griffiths and the fact that successive cash flows showed deficits.  Between May and December 1983, six older ships were sold,and agreement was reached for the sale of the four Spanish newbuildings, Manila Faith and one other vessel in the oil deal which,although not consummated until April 1984, represented a very big reduction in WMIâs prospective debt.</p>    <p><a name="p5.6.3" class="para" id="p5.6.3">5.6.3</a> Discussions were also started with WWS with a view to realising surplus equity in WWW.  If successful, although not providing actualcash for WMI, it would have freed up the US$4 million facility giving WMI access to those funds once again.</p>    <p><a name="p5.6.4" class="para" id="p5.6.4">5.6.4</a> Refinancing of World Rainbow still remained incomplete.  Failure to achieve the cash inflow from this aspect of the plan was compoundedby the unexpected call for cash by Pacnorse in January 1984, all cash flows to that date having assumed payment of interest onlyto Pacnorse on the shareholders loan.  Yet, even without these two unexpected factors, the last cash flow (dated 24th January 1984)before delivery of Annalock showed WMI going into deficit in March 1986 with a deficit of US$13.2 million by the end of that year.</p>    <p><a name="p5.6.5" class="para" id="p5.6.5">5.6.5</a> Contributing significantly to this state of affairs was WM which, when asked for support in April 1983, had failed to respond withthe urgency WMI requested.  It did not produce even the US$2 million stand-by recommended by S&amp;C.  When the question of supportwas referred back to WM by HKR, WM did not provide US$12 million recommended by Rothschilds as providing greater opportunity forrecovery but rather US$4 million which meant WMI had to abandon negotiations for a moratorium.  And this, like all other significantsupport from WM, was given against security.</p>    <p><a name="p5.6.6" class="para" id="p5.6.6">5.6.6</a> Rothschilds also explained that the latter amount put emphasis on an early recovery in the shipping market.  There is a tension here. The cash flows contained, as I have mentioned, what are agreed to have been reasonable assumptions.  Unless there was a genuinebelief on the part of WMIâs directors that the market would recover earlier and more sharply than assumed in the cash flows, inwhich case the cash flows could have been adjusted accordingly, it was improper to rely on such recovery.  To the extent of any suchreliance, ADS complained, in my view rightly, that WMI was gambling and taking a risk which it was neither legitimate nor honestto take.</p>    <p><a name="p5.6.7" class="para" id="p5.6.7">5.6.7</a> Having examined the objective positions when WMI took the two loans, it is necessary to consider the position of each remaining individualdefendant.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="5.7">5.7    MR. BROTHERS</a></p>    <p><a name="p5.7.1" class="para" id="p5.7.1">5.7.1</a> The decision to modernise WMIâs fleet and operations was a corporate one.  That decision was largely implemented by Mr. Brotherswho was known in WM circles as the shipping director, he having primary responsibility for WMIâs activities.  Assisted by Mr. Lloyd,he sought out suitable vessels or newbuildings and put together the often complex financial arrangements for their purchase.  OnceWMI was caught out by the falling shipping market, it was Mr. Brothers who almost exclusively carried out the necessary salvage operations. He worked indefatigably.  He devoted an immense amount of time and effort to WMIâs problems.  There is no dispute about that. He would not, he said, have done that if he thought WMI was doomed or he had any doubt about WM support.  As to that, there is amajor dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.2" class="para" id="p5.7.2">5.7.2</a> Throughout his evidence, Mr. Brothers emphasised the November consensus as well as the more general principle that a parent willsupport its subsidiary.  Relying upon these two matters, he was never in doubt that support would be forthcoming and that WMI wouldbe able to pay off its creditors.  He was therefore always confident, he said, that WMI would survive and was always comfortableabout taking on new credit, particularly the two loans in question.  He genuinely believed all would come right.  He said he wasnot a fraudster.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.3" class="para" id="p5.7.3">5.7.3</a> Mr. Brothersâ evidence suffered from a number of drawbacks.  First, Mr. Brothers insisted that until Mr. Marden sold his sharesin early 1985 he believed that what he called the November âagreementâ remained in existence and that he could rely on it forthe necessary support.  It is striking, however, that this âagreementâ which was of such fundamental importance was of a whollyuncertain nature.  It was described in Mr. Brothersâ witness statement as a âWM viewâ and in para. 52.8</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIt was clear that WM would provide support for WMI.  That much was agreed between the WM Directors.  The questions were the amountof the support to be provided and timing.  My own views on the subject of timing were set out in the second page of the memorandum.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>So far as I can now recall, there was no formal subsequent meeting after this memorandum had been circulated.  I proceeded to implementthe policy set out in the memorandum.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.4" class="para" id="p5.7.4">5.7.4</a> In cross-examination, Mr. Brothers described what took place as a commitment by the shareholders whom he identified in re-examinationas Mr. Marden and Mr. Cheung.  After clarifying that he had not asked for a commitment, he said in cross-examination (day 91/26):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  Did you agree that it was necessary to get a commitment?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I did feel that if we were to keep WMI in its form that we planned for it, we would need to have an injection of cash, yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  That, in effect, meant a commitment from WM?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It was a commitment from WM, yes, my Lord.  May I perhaps say it was a commitment at that time more of the shareholders of WMrather than the company.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  As far as that commitment is concerned, is it the position then that there was no commitment from WM?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  There was a commitment of the shareholders.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  A commitment of the shareholders' position in November 1982?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  That is correct, my Lord.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Yes.  That had no binding effect on WM, did it?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It had no binding effect on WM, no.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  And you were aware, of course, that they could change their minds?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  The shareholders could change their minds, yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  The commitment, as you call it, was no more than a statement of intention in November 1982?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It was a very firm commitment by the shareholders that, subject to certain steps being taken, money would be injected into WheelockMaritime.  I took it as being a total commitment, on my part.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  It was a conditional commitment, put it that way?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It was not even conditional in the way the memorandum was written, but I think those concerned wanted to see  steps that weretaken and, subject to those steps being taken, money would be advanced.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  We will look at it, of course, in detail, but while we are dealing with it at this stage, just to make sure I understand the position,it was a conditional commitment by the shareholders which could have been changed at any time and was not binding on the Board ofWM?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It was a commitment, my Lord, by the shareholders. Naturally the shareholders could come back and tell us at any time that theyhad changed their mind.  The fact of the matter is that they did not.  So until that came, we worked in the knowledge that that commitmentremained.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Just to make sure that I have it, if you could deal with all the points, please, it was a conditional commitment by the shareholderswhich could be changed at any time, and was not binding on the Board of WM?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I do not accept that it was really conditional.  As I said a moment ago, the shareholders certainly expected certain steps tobe taken, but it was not couched in terms that it was conditional.  The shareholders could, indeed, change their minds, and it wasnot binding on the Board of Wheelock Marden.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.5" class="para" id="p5.7.5">5.7.5</a> Because it was a commitment by shareholders and not by WM through its Board, Mr. Brothers said that this explained why it was neverexplicitly raised at any board meeting or indeed informally in his discussions with Mr. Lees and Mr. Leung.  It would not have beenproper to do so, he said.  I have to say I find it difficult to accept that after November 1982, if there was a commitment, no oneever referred to a commitment whether by shareholders, directors or anyone else.  The answer of course is because there was no suchcommitment - only a plan under which support <u>was conditional</u> upon WMI being able to show that there was hope for it.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.6" class="para" id="p5.7.6">5.7.6</a> What is plain is that even if there was a commitment, as Mr. Brothers asserted there was, that commitment must have been nullifiedonce WMIâs true financial position emerged in March 1983.  If the sympathetic Mr. Ortiz-Patino was sufficiently moved to send thetelex in the terms he did, it must have been plain that thereafter there would be a harder and more critical approach to WMIâsproblems.  What Mr. Brothers could legitimately rely on and, in my view, what he actually relied on was not some special agreementamong shareholders or directors of WM but the more general proposition that a parent will not normally let a subsidiary fail.  Thatview, I feel, is borne out by the impression given by Mr. Brothers and others to ADS that they were dealing with the WM Group asa whole.  In legal terms, that meant nothing.  But it was clearly intended that ADS should take comfort from it, as indeed it did.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.7" class="para" id="p5.7.7">5.7.7</a> Mr. Brothers attempted to identify in the documents what he characterised as references to the November âagreementâ.  He suggestedthere were five such references.  For example, he referred to a passage in Mr. Shawâs instructions to counsel which read:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âUntil now, the Directors have taken the view that, taking into account the discussions with bank creditors and the prospect ofan additional commitment or facilities of up to US$12,000,000 becoming available, there is a reasonable prospect of achieving a situationwhere any amounts due over the next three years can be met from cash flow and thereafter debt can be paid off over a period.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.8" class="para" id="p5.7.8">5.7.8</a> Mr. Brothers said that the words âadditional commitmentâ were a direct reference to the shareholdersâ commitment because itâwas the only additional commitment we hadâ.  That passage was in the context of WMIâs request for support following HKRâsdecision not to proceed.  The only legitimate interpretation, in my judgment, which can be put on âadditional commitmentâ isthat Mr. Shaw used it synonymously with âfacilitiesâ.  Mr. Shaw himself in cross-examination described this passage as a summaryof views which had been expressed to him which he was passing on to counsel.  It is inconceivable that Mr. Shaw would not have expresslymentioned a commitment by shareholders to support if he had been told of that, it being of such crucial importance.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.9" class="para" id="p5.7.9">5.7.9</a> The other references specified by Mr. Brothers are no more convincing.  In my judgment, Mr. Brothers was simply indulging in a futileeffort to support what was plainly unsupportable.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.10" class="para" id="p5.7.10">5.7.10</a> From February 1983 onward, WMI had the benefit of both legal and financial advice.  Legal advice, given principally by Mr. Shaw,dealt with both fraudulent preference and fraudulent trading.  Mr. Brothers was, however, anxious that there should be no misunderstandingof his position, namely that he was not concerned about the possibility of liquidation or fraudulent trading.  Consequently, he wasat pains to emphasise that Mr. Shaw was never asked to advise about fraudulent trading as such but rather about trading while insolvent. He said he and the other directors needed advice while WMI was unable to pay its debts as they fell due to ensure that the directorsdid not cross the line from what was permissible to that which was impermissible.  Mr. Leungâs recollection was that at the WMIboard meeting of 20th April 1983, Mr. Shaw was asked to advise on fraudulent trading.  Whether or not that was the case, Mr. Brothersearly on recognised Mr. Shawâs advice for what it was, namely on fraudulent trading.  Hence, in his witness statement at para.130 he referred to Mr. Shawâs advice on âfraudulent tradingâ on 20th April 1983 and at para. 141.2 he said of Norton Roseâsadvice on 27th May in respect of Manila Faith that âthis advice on fraudulent trading was no different from David Shawâs previousadviceâ.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.11" class="para" id="p5.7.11">5.7.11</a> So from early 1983 the whiff of fraud was in the air.  I regard Mr. Brothersâ attempts to characterise Mr. Shawâs well-roundedadvice as âgratuitousâ to be the merest quibble.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.12" class="para" id="p5.7.12">5.7.12</a> That advice was obtained on fraudulent trading is also consistent with para. 62 of the amended defences in which the Defendants pleadtaking advice, including advice on fraudulent trading.  The advice given by Mr. Shaw on or about 17th February 1983 is relied onas evidence of this.  Yet, of this advice, Mr. Brothers said in cross-examination (day 93/72):</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âThis is Mr Shaw giving advice.  There is nothing surprising that when one has a meeting lawyers would give advice.  But I thinkthere is a world of difference from us coming out and asking for the advice and it being gratuitously provided by Mr Shaw.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.13" class="para" id="p5.7.13">5.7.13</a> What emerges from all this, of course, is that Mr. Brothers like all the other directors was seriously concerned about insolvencyand fraud.  That is hardly surprising in the circumstances.  It is consistent with an appreciation that heroic efforts would be neededto improve WMIâs position <u>if</u> WM support was to be forthcoming.  It is not consistent with knowledge of an unconditional commitment by WM shareholders to supportWMI.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.14" class="para" id="p5.7.14">5.7.14</a> In an attempt to deflect the apparently uncomprising tenor of some of the documents which I have reviewed, Mr. Brothers maintainedthat a number of them were badly worded or even incorrect.  Thus in the minutes of the WM board meeting of 7th July 1983 when Mr.Griffiths asked why Rangelock had not been refinanced Mr. Brothers apparently said that following failure to sell Fenlock and InverlockâWMI had been faced with insolvency with the result that it had become unable to take on new credit and had therefore had to cancelthe refinancing of the âRangelockâ, the lease of the âSealockâ and also the refinancing of Hudong hull No. 1126â (para.<a>3.5.156</a>).  In para. 166.5 of his witness statement which sets out this passage, Mr. Brothers said Mr. Griffiths âwas quite correct thatwe had intended to look for a new financier for Rangelock.  Unfortunately, this had not proved possible for the reason given at themeetingâ.  No doubt was thrown on the text.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.15" class="para" id="p5.7.15">5.7.15</a> In cross-examination, however, Mr. Brothers sought to put a different light on the passage.  At day 89/98 he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  Do you accept as accurate what is recorded as being in that paragraph?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  My Lord, I do not accept it as accurate.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  You do not accept it?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  What is wrong with it?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I can only surmise, my Lord, that at that time I was rather hot under the collar and spoke inadvisably, or the minute, itself,is wrong, because clearly the problem or the lack of the sale of the two WMI vessels to Allied did not stop WMI from being unableto take on new credit, because we had taken on new credit.  It may have interrupted any plans I had to refinance the Rangelock, butit certainly had not affected my actions, as regards the lease of the Sealock, nor had it prevented me from continuing to work onthe refinancing of the Hudong hull, number 1126, so it is just not a correct statement of affairs of the company at that time.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  What about the phrase "WMI had been faced with insolvency"?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I am not quite clear what that means, my Lord.  If we had come close to not being able to pay our debts when they were due, thatis probably right.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  I see.  Do you think this is a mistake?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I think the reference to being unable to take on new credit, the lease of the Sealock and the refinancing of the Hudong hull 1126is all inaccurate.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  I see.  How could that have happened?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  As I said, it could only have been either ill-advised words from myself, if it was correct, or a badly worded minute.  I tendto think it was a badly worded minute, my Lord.  It was a complicated subject and possibly whoever drafted these minutes did notget it right, but it is certainly incorrect, as one can see from what was going on at that time.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  So, presumably, you would have corrected the minutes after you had read them?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I would normally have corrected the minutes, if I noticed there was a mistake of this nature.  I cannot say at this time why Idid not correct them in this instance.  I do not see that I necessarily signed this particular minute, but I may well have done.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.16" class="para" id="p5.7.16">5.7.16</a> At day 92/48, Mr. Brothers was brought back to this passage and said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âMy Lord, when we discussed it earlier, I said that either the minute was wrong or that I had, perhaps, used -- if it was not wrong,that I perhaps over-described the situation to Mr Griffiths because I was somewhat irritated that he should have raised the matterof refinancing the Rangelock when we had been given so much trouble as a result of the failure to go ahead with the two -- with thesale of the Inverlock and the Fenlock to the Allied Group.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>I also said that I did not agree with what was stated here because patently what we had actually been doing was different to whatis in the minute.  I went on to say that it was not correct that as a result of the failure to do the Inverlock and the Fenlock,WMI had been unable to take on new credit because we had taken on new credit.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>It was correct that we had discontinued, or I had discontinued, any search for a refinancing of the Rangelock.  We had cancelled thelease of the Sealock; we had abandoned the lease of the Sealock, but I certainly had in mind that this would be resurrected in thefuture and, of course, we were continuing to arrange the refinancing, as I describe it there, of the Hudong hull number 1126.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>I also had gone on to say that once matters had been satisfactorily rearranged and in that regard I had in mind the $12 million fromHongKong Realty the question of the refinancing of the Rangelock would be reactivated, and certainly that is what my intention wouldhave been.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.17" class="para" id="p5.7.17">5.7.17</a> Mr. Brothers could not recall whether the minute was overstated or just wrong.  Mr. Grossman pursued the point at p. 52:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  I suggest to you that the explanation you gave to Mr Griffiths here, which was apparently heard by anyone else, and no-onedemurred from it was accurate?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  My Lord, it plainly is not accurate.  The facts speak for themselves.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  What was plainly accurate was that WMI faced insolvency as a result of the failure to sell the Inverlock and the Fenlock?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.

Insolvency, although in existence,was not a factor that entered into his consideration at that time.  I accept that WMIâs financial affairs were complex, often onlyfully comprehended by Mr. Brothers, and that the minutes are but the briefest summary of often detailed debate.  But it is clearfrom the documents, as I have already found (para. <a>5.5.2</a>), that refinancing of Rangelock, Sealock and Manila Faith fell through because WMIâs financial circumstances were such it couldnot have provided the necessary guarantees or other security.  The discrepancy between the minutes, which appear to me substantiallycorrect, and Mr. Brothersâ explanation is such that I am unable to accept Mr. Brothersâ evidence. </p>    <p><a name="p5.7.23" class="para" id="p5.7.23">5.7.23</a> On 14th September 1983, Mr. Lees on behalf of WMI wrote to WM seeking support of US$12 million (App. 3/22).  Without it, he indicatedin the second paragraph, WMI would have to cease trading.  Of this in cross-examination, Mr. Brothers said at day 100/39:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.  I think it was unlikely that we would have got the rescheduling that we were looking for now unless we had the $12 million. As regards the final sentence in that paragraph, I do not think that was the position, but I can understand why Mr Lees put thatin there.  It is necessary to make it very clear, I think, to parent company, by extension of the shareholders, that they shouldcome up with some support at this time for Wheelock Maritime and that they should not consider the fact that Wheelock Maritime hadbeen continuing without support as indicative that it could continue after the HongKong Realty support had been declined.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">.....</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">MR GROSSMAN:  Mr Brothers, was it not the position at that time that you believed, as did apparently Mr Lees, that if you did notget the $12 million that would eventuate in a situation where you would have had to cease trading?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, my Lord, that was not the position at that time.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Do you find it extraordinary that Mr Lees should write to the Board of Wheelock Marden making a statement which was apparentlynot true?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  The only piece of the letter, my Lord, is the sentence -- the last sentence of the second paragraph. I think, as I said beforethe break, it is important that for reasons of the credibility and for the rescheduling, that Wheelock Marden should not revert backto the position we were in in April, whereby, essentially, they were not really very interested or particularly keen to provide short-termsupport.  This is what we were going to the parent company for, and Mr Lees put this particular sentence in to emphasize that theyshould now come up with the support that had been requested.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I think that was essentially the reason for this particular sentence being included.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  It is a plain statement, Mr Brothers.  It could not have been read by anyone who did not have a knowledge of the situation ofWMI as being other than what it meant, could it?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I think somebody who did not have a knowledge of what the position was would read it literally.  Those who did have a knowledgewould understand the background to that.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Mr Brothers, can you tell me this: what was the point of giving this grim foreboding of what might happen if the directors ofWheelock Marden were aware of the November agreement?  The November agreement precluded the possibility of ceasing trading?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I think that is the point, my Lord, with respect.  The November agreement, the rationalisation programme, or whatever, envisageda once-and-for-all support.  We were now going back to Wheelock Marden, essentially, for the short-term support.  We were back, ifyou like, to April that year, when the matter was still under consideration.  If you recall, I had asked for $5 million in April.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The company did not need cash at the time.  It could, with difficulty, continue as it was, but since April we had had the HongKongRealty announcement and, therefore, a much greater expectation on the behalf of the secured creditors than they had previously.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">There was a matter generally, I think, of the credibility of WMI.  The Board felt at this time that Wheelock Marden should not, ifyou like, go back to the previous position where it allowed the company to sort things out, but they must come up with a clear statementnow regarding -- with support.      </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It was important, I think, for the Board members of Wheelock Maritime that that was the case.  I think everybody felt that quite stronglynow.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  What was the point of making this empty threat, that WMI may have to cease trading, when it was implicit in the November agreementthat such a situation would never be reached?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  The concern was that the company -- that WM would not come up with the short-term support and would wait for the long-term once-and-for-allinjection of cash.  That was the concern.  Mr Lees, in emphasizing it this way, was basically putting everybody on notice that supportis now required.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  The possibility existed that you would not get the short-term support, I think you said that yesterday?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  The possibility did exist that we would not get the short-term support.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Which would have meant, as a consequence, that you would not have survived long enough to put yourself in a position to ask forthe long-term support?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  That, I think, was what we felt the parent company -- the stand the parent company would take.  The parent company might havetaken the stand that we could last without short-term support.  This is what the Board were very anxious to try and deflect themaway from.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  If they adhered to that view, then you may well have gone into liquidation?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, I do not think we would have gone into liquidation, because we had sufficient resources to continue, but it would have madeit extremely difficult to work with one's creditors, et cetera.  I do not think the Board felt that that was the right way to goforward.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.24" class="para" id="p5.7.24">5.7.24</a> Apart from the obvious back-tracking once again by Mr. Brothers, that passage seems to me to put in perspective the obvious nonsenseabout the November consensus being some form of commitment.  Mr. Brothers was quite right about the need for short-term or drip feedsupport while WMI worked its way to a position when it could make a request for a final quantified sum.  It affords, however, a poorexplanation for the extreme terms of Mr. Leesâ letter at a time when WMI, not to put too fine a point on it, was on its beam endsand needed support to survive.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.25" class="para" id="p5.7.25">5.7.25</a> At the WMI Board meeting on 28th August 1984, Mr. Brothers said if WM did not support âdirectors would have to give serious considerationto whether or not it would be possible for [WMI] to continue tradingâ (para. <a>3.6.171</a>).  Asked whether he meant what he said, Mr. Brothers replied at day 105/84</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.  No, my Lord, I did not mean it.  Again, this is a form of rather dramatic wording being used to drive the point home that nowwas the time for the support to be given to WMI.  I would not want there to be any misunderstanding on that.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Who were you trying to fool?  Who were you negotiating with?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  We were not trying to fool anyone, my Lord, nor were we negotiating.  The directors were saying clearly, we are saying clearlywe had been operating the company on a shoestring, we had now taken the steps that needed to be taken and now is the time to comeup with the long-term support.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Where do you see that?  That is not there anywhere.  If that was there I would understand what you are saying, but it is not?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.

No, it was not true, but it was true in the terms of in the limited time available.  We would probably have to, under those circumstances,act arbitrarily with our bankers and, in the question of a negotiation, which is what I had in mind with one's secured creditors,there was not sufficient time to achieve that.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.

Does that mean that if WM did decline the company's formal request for support, could youhave got alternative support?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  We would have gone to the bankers.  We had discussed this already with Mr Shaw.  This is how we were going -- we were consideringthe matter.

First, Mr. Shaw was again asked to advise about directorsâ liabilities, i.e. fraudulenttrading.  Then, Mr. Brothers himself mentioned Pacnorse so that âit was noted that the matter of Pacnorse would have to be resolvedbefore any new capital issue was madeâ.  It does not appear to me that Mr. Brothers was correct in saying in cross-examinationthat âwe had now taken the steps that needed to be taken and now is the time to come up with the long-term supportâ.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.27" class="para" id="p5.7.27">5.7.27</a> On the same day, Mr. Brothers wrote to WM asking for WM to indicate whether it would subscribe to a capital issue (para. <a>3.6.172</a>) and stressing the possibility of being unable to continue in business in the short-term (para. <a>3.6.173</a>).  The WM Board meeting on the same day was adjourned by Mr. Marden so that directors âbe given adequate time to study WMIâsformal request for support and to see if there were any other ways of saving WMIâ.  That was in the context of a rights or capitalissue.  âSaving WMIâ certainly suggests its survival was at least of concern.  Yet, in cross-examination on day 105/89, Mr. Brotherssaid:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âHowever, if you like, I had raised the stake somewhat in the wording of the letter to WM.  It may well have been regarded by someof the directors of Wheelock Marden as a matter of life and death, I am not sure.  I am not sure those are words I would have usedunder the circumstances.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.28" class="para" id="p5.7.28">5.7.28</a> Mr. Brothers went on to distinguish between short-term support, which was the concern at that moment, and the long-term support whichWM would ultimately supply and which assisted WMIâs directors in deciding if they could continue trading.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.29" class="para" id="p5.7.29">5.7.29</a> Mr. Brothers also got into difficulties over refinancing of Manila Faith which, by February 1983, had been agreed with Orient Leasingsubject to a letter of comfort from WM to the effect that it would maintain the corporate existence of WMI (para. <a>3.5.39</a>).  On 24th March, Mr. Tipper asked Mr. Shaw for advice (para. <a>3.5.61</a>).  In cross-examination, Mr. Brothers said he disagreed with and could not understand Mr. Tipperâs statement that the refinancingcould not be completed until rescheduling had been agreed by WMIâs bankers.  He could see no reason why the sale and lease-backcould not be completed anyway and thought Mr. Tipper must have been confused.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.30" class="para" id="p5.7.30">5.7.30</a> As to Mr. Tipperâs request for advice about taking new credit, Mr. Brothers said at day 92/18:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.  Again, I did not ask Mr Tipper to do this letter.  I do not know why he did it.  He may have done it off his own bat, but Ifind that also really an unnecessary statement from Mr Tipper to Mr Shaw.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Can you conceive of him doing it without the instructions of Mr Lees and Mr Leung, or at least without the knowledge of them?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I think it would be very likely that they would have known, and, as you say, probably with their instructions, and it may wellbe that they had asked him to write to Mr Shaw to check up before we made this temporary arrangement with World-Wide Wheelock thatwe covered all contingencies, Mr Tipper just got on with it.  It is difficult for me to understand because, again, like the firstpage, I do not think it really relates to the circumstances at the time.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.31" class="para" id="p5.7.31">5.7.31</a> Plainly, Mr. Brothers had forgotten his own memorandum of 18th March to Mr. Tipper which deals with both passages (para. <a>3.5.56</a>).  However, when it was drawn to his attention at day 107/86 he could only say:  âUnfortunately, it does not make it any clearerto me now as to why this was the caseâ.  He made reference, however, to the WMI Board meeting of 20th April at which Mr. Lees saidthe sale and lease-back could not proceed because Orient Leasing required a letter of comfort from WM.  Mr. Brothers said the letterof comfort was not given and Orient Leasing went off because of the introduction of HKR.  When it was pointed out that that had onlyoccurred about two days before the meeting, Mr. Brothers said there was also Mr. Mardenâs earlier interest in buying WMI aboutwhich Mr. Lees but not Mr. Brothers had been aware.  All this, however, occurred in April whereas Mr. Brothersâ memo to Mr. Tipperwas on 18th March.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.32" class="para" id="p5.7.32">5.7.32</a> Mr. Tipper, it appears, was prone to mistakes because in the minutes of the shipping committee meeting of 2nd March 1983, he recordedMr. Brothers as saying that the Sealock sale and lease-back to Orion/RBC had to be abandoned because the necessary assurance of WMIâsexistence could not be given until the banks had responded to the moratorium proposals (para. <a>3.5.41</a>).  In cross-examination at day 92/33, there occurred</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  There you see an echo here of what Mr Tipper said on 24th March?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Thank you, my Lord.  I can only refer back to the earlier correspondence in February -- at the end of February where it is quiteclear why we called off the negotiations.  As I said, it was to do with the provision of a parent company guarantee.  It was nothing-- it was not as is stated here, that we were concerned about the assurances regarding the refinancing.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Mr Brothers, this is not someone else speaking and making a mistake, this is you.  These are minutes which presumably you wouldhave seen and corrected if they were wrong.  Furthermore, they are almost identical in terms to what Mr Tipper said on 24th March,in a different context?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It is probably why Mr Tipper, or possibly why Mr Tipper made this mistake, he was the draughtsman of these minutes.  As I cansay, my Lord -- I can only refer you to the actual events.  That is very clear from the correspondence that went on at the end ofFebruary, that a guarantee was proposed or required in order to give the satisfaction to the lessors.  I do not think there wereany circumstances at this time where Wheelock Marden would have been prepared to give that guarantee.                  That is whythe discussions were halted.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Well, nobody appears to have corrected these minutes; they were signed by you; you have signed them?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  So did Mr Lees and Mr Leung?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I think the main fact of this minute is that the discussions had been discontinued.  I do not think it was really very importantwhat went after that.  But, as I said, the reason -- and the only reason -- was this requirement for the guarantee.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  It says here not that the lease arrangements were discontinued, but "abandoned", that is the word used?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It is true, they were abandoned.  The lessors went off and made separate arrangements.  It was not, say, we were abandoning theconcept of a sale and leaseback.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Mr Brothers, the simple fact of the matter is that you were having to approach the banks about refinancing and if that approachwas unsuccessful then the future of the company was in doubt?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, my Lord.  I think it is clear from the advice we got from our advisors that the future of the company would not be in doubt,even if we had not been successful in our rescheduling arrangements with the banks.  As it was said repeatedly, the reason why wediscontinued these discussions with Orion and their lessors was because of the year-end and the difficulty and the impossibilityof giving a guarantee at the time.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It had nothing to do with bankers, rescheduling, or otherwise.  As I mentioned before, there was a lot of confusion going on at thattime.  No doubt, Mr Tipper was confused.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.33" class="para" id="p5.7.33">5.7.33</a> If Mr.Tipper was confused, so no doubt was WM.  It is perhaps not surprising that WM was slow to come up with any commitment or support. There followed a torturous examination of documents in cross-examination.  In his witness statement at para. 78.2, Mr. Brotherssaid:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe falling through of the proposed sale and leaseback occurred because WMI was unable to meet all the requirements of the proposedlessors before their year end.  One of these requirements was a categorical assurance WMI would remain in the business of shippingfor the foreseeable future and be able to meet its commitments and indemnities.  I did not believe that the proposed arrangementsfell through simply because of this requirement.  Had this been the only requirement, I believe that it could have been satisfied. I telexed Orion on 25th February 1983 to inform them of our decision.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.34" class="para" id="p5.7.34">5.7.34</a> The relevant part of that telex is at para. <a>3.5.38</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.35" class="para" id="p5.7.35">5.7.35</a> Mr. Brothers received on 24th February a telex dated 23rd February from RBC which drew attention to the lessorsâ March year endsand to the need to give a categorical assurance that WMI would remain in the business of shipping for the foreseeable future andbe able to meet its commitments.  RBC suggested a WM guarantee of WMIâs obligations.  Mr. Brothers knew a WM guarantee was impossibleso he abandoned this proposed sale and lease-back.  The reason given in his telex to RBC was of course mere colour.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.36" class="para" id="p5.7.36">5.7.36</a> Asked about his telex of 25th February to RBC and whether the first sentence was true, Mr. Brothers said at day 92/37:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.  It is perfectly true, my Lord.  There is nothing that is not true in that.  We did not -- I did not feel that we should continuenegotiations with the lessors.  I had discussed it at length with the Orion Merchant Bank, and I felt that although we may well havebeen able to put everything together prior to the end of March, it would not have been fair on the lessors to continue those discussionson that basis, and the alternative suggestion made by Orion of a parent company guarantee was also not an option.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Therefore, we did abandon the lease, so --</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  The abandonment was to do with your inability to get parental support?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Our inability to get parental support, as far as an unconditional guarantee, yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  That was the reason for it?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  That was the reason, yes.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.37" class="para" id="p5.7.37">5.7.37</a> Mr. Brothers was then referred to his statement and asked why the sale and lease-back fell through.  He said at day 92/40:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.  It fell through because I did not feel, in consciousness, that we could have continued our negotiations with the proposed lessorsany longer, because I was concerned in case anything happened that would have prevented us going through with the lease.  As I said,there was a certain amount of confusion.  Nobody knew quite what the clear position was at that time.  I was -- I felt it would beunfair to the lessors to continue.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and at day 92/43</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â ... I was taking into account a whole lot of various factors that existed at that time.  One such factor was the November agreementanother such factor was the very categorical statement that Mr Griffiths had made.  There were discussions going on with the banksat that time.  It was not something that we easily called off because it was, certainly beneficial, the arrangements were beneficial. It did cause us a lot of subsequent problems because we had to move very fast with DSKF to come up with the alternative arrangements. But, nevertheless, those were the circumstances and that is why the deal was called off at that time.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.38" class="para" id="p5.7.38">5.7.38</a> Finally, at day 92/44</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  ... The reason why you discontinued it, the reason why you abandoned the discussions is because you could not get the parentalsupport which was required for it?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No.  That was not the reason.  The reason was because, as I have said already, we would not have been able to put in place theguarantee which was an unlimited guarantee from Wheelock Marden that the lessors would have needed -- or to provide them with thecomfort to continue until the end of March.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Mr Brothers, you said unequivocally that the reason why you abandoned it was because there was a year-end problem as far as thelessors were concerned, the fact of the matter was that you were not going to get the agreement of the parent to provide the comfortletter that was required, and you knew that?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, I did not, my Lord.

He then took a directorial decision to abandon thenegotiations at that stage.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">MR GROSSMAN:  Is that correct?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  That is exactly so, my Lord, yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">HIS LORDSHIP:  He has said on at least two occasions, that is to say Mr Brothers has said this morning on two occasions:  "I believedthat if the negotiations had continued, if there had been no time constraint, ultimately we would have got a letter of comfort fromWM."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Whether that belief is justified is another matter and you will, no doubt, be addressing me on it at length later.  That is the story,as I understand it this morning; am I correct, Mr Brothers?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  You are, my Lord, thank you.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.39" class="para" id="p5.7.39">5.7.39</a> In my judgment, it is clear that the sale and lease-back of Sealock fell through because WMI could not get support from WM.  A guaranteewas a non-starter.  An appropriate letter of comfort depended upon WM taking a view on WMIâs future which in turn depended on theattitude of the banks to a moratorium.  These factors were all inter-connected.  It was disingenuous, to say the least, of Mr. Brothersto try and suggest that some other factor or factors influenced his decision to call off the negotiations.  In any event, he is whollyunable to explain his explicit memorandum of 18th March to Mr. Tipper.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.40" class="para" id="p5.7.40">5.7.40</a> There are other places which appear in my review of the facts and documents where there are plain statements of why these sales andlease-backs fell through.  At the meeting of the shipping committee on 16th May 1983 (para. <a>3.5.107</a>) it was noted that it could not be finalised until loan rescheduling was complete.  And at the shipping committee meeting on 24thAugust 1983, Mr. Brothers reported on various possibilities for refinancing Manila Faith including</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(b)  Sale and lease-back with Orient Leasing - Orient Leasing had confirmed they would provide US$11.5 million to WMI but on thebasis of no drawdown being made until WMIâs re-scheduling proposals with its bankers and WM Group support of US$12 million werefinalised.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.41" class="para" id="p5.7.41">5.7.41</a> In their letter dated 5th July 1983 with which they submitted their discussion paper, Rothschilds said that if any HKR proposal wasunacceptable then WM âwill have to consider whether to support WMI at least in the shorter termâ (para. 3.5.141).  The discussionpaper itself at para. 6.3 reads:  âIn deciding whether to extend support to WMI ... â (para. <a>3.5.147</a>).  It would appear Rothschilds regarded support as being an open question.  Mr. Brothers would not accept that.  In cross-examinationat day 99/13</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âA.  I am sure it was not open, my Lord.</p>        <p>Q.  Why do you think they said that?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>A.  It is difficult to see in the context of that one sentence why they should have imposed the words "whether to support", especiallyin the context of what they say in the next few sentences, my Lord.  I am sure they had no thought at all that there would not besupport, either in the shorter or the longer term.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Q.  What do you say, they mis-stated the position?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>A.  It is clear, I think, my Lord, that in the subsequent sentences they have absolutely no thought whatever that Wheelock Mardenwould not support Wheelock Maritime.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.42" class="para" id="p5.7.42">5.7.42</a> I find it difficult to understand what Mr. Brothers had in mind.  The passages from Rothschildsâ letter and paper to which I havereferred reek of justification for support which would hardly have been necessary if it was not an issue.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.43" class="para" id="p5.7.43">5.7.43</a> Similarly, in their report of 21st September 1983, which was after HKRâs decision, Rothschilds state that that decision âplacedthe onus on [WM] to consider whether to provide support for its subsidiary company and, if so, what form that support will takeâ. They went on to spell out the rationale for support (para. <a>3.5.253</a>).  Mr. Brothers again would not accept that the question of support was still open.  In cross-examination at day 101/3</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  Do you think that the position in September then was, or perhaps as early as Rothschilds were first appointed, that the decisionwhether to give support was still an open one?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  When Rothschilds were first appointed, my Lord, I think they were briefed at that time.  They had to give their report in thecontext of their terms of reference and advice to Wheelock Marden.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Was the question of whether there should be support an open one; something that still had to be determined or not?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I do not believe Rothschilds felt that, no.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  In fact, was it an open situation?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I think it was not, no.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  If it was not open, what was the point of getting that advice?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  The point was that Wheelock Marden as a public company in providing support to a subsidiary would need advice from financial advisors,such as Rothschilds.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  That part of the advice which dealt with whether there was to be support was just a charade, was it?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I do not think it was a charade, but they were asked to look at the position.  They would have been briefed, perhaps, on the background-- I think they were briefed on the background, but I do not know that for sure.  They would still look at it as independent advisorsto Wheelock Marden.  I am sure that they would have looked at all sides of the matter, even they had not been briefed -- I shouldsay despite their briefing.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.44" class="para" id="p5.7.44">5.7.44</a> The last answer is also at odds with Mr. Brothersâ witness statement para. 160.10 in which he recalled meeting Rothschilds soonafter their appointment and providing them with information about WMIâs difficulties âand the policy decision made in November1982â.  In cross-examination about that paragraph at day 99/24 he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.  ...  That meeting may well have served to provide them with that information, but it was not a specific reference by me tothem of what had been agreed in November 1982.  I do not recall discussing that with Rothschilds.  I do recall giving them informationon Wheelock Maritime.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Are we to read this as excluding the statement by you that you provided them with information on the policy decision in November1982?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  The meeting itself might have served to provide them with information, but not specifically on the policy decision made in 1982.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.45" class="para" id="p5.7.45">5.7.45</a> It is right to acknowledge that Rothschildsâ original terms of appointment were termed âlow keyâ and were designed to obtainan independent view of what might be done if HKR decided not to invest.  That does not detract, however, from Mr. Brothers againadjusting his evidence to meet problems as they arose.</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.46" class="para" id="p5.7.46">5.7.46</a> Having examined some, by no means all, of the examples of Mr. Brothers evidence, it is not difficult, I think, to see why I am ofthe view on the totality of the evidence that Mr. Brothersâ credibility was considerably damaged.  Set against the background ofWMIâs fragile finances and hand-to-mouth existence for over 2 years, it establishes a powerful case against him.  But not powerfulenough for me to be persuaded that he had no honest belief in WM eventually supporting WMI.  In coming to that conclusion, I havetaken into account 7 factors:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Until WMâs letter of 8th October 1984 no clear and unequivocal signal was given by WM that there would be no more support. I do not accept, as Mr. Brothers suggested, that that letter (paras. <a>3.6.222/223</a>) left scope for WMI to renew its request for support if it could not succeed in surviving in accordance with WMâs suggestions.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) The provision of drip feed from time to time, with the approval of Mr. Cheungâs nominees on the WM Board, rather indicated thatWM remained committed to the principle of support.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) From February 1983 onwards, WMI and its directors were receiving financial and legal advice.  It is inherently unlikely that Mr.Brothers or any other director would have embarked on a course of fraud with the advisers looking over their shoulders.  The situationwas very different from the more common âcooking the booksâ and hoping not to be found out later on.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) While there were obviously low moments in WMIâs board-room, the minutes and documents I have reviewed generally indicate anexpectation that there would be a future.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5) It is axiomatic that a parent should support a subsidiary.  Rothschilds emphasised this.  Mr. Brothers and the other directorswere entitled to derive comfort from this, particularly in the light of Mr. Mardenâs interest in shipping and WMâs position asa hong and as general managers of WMI.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6) Notwithstanding his evidence about the legal advice relating to fraudulent trading, Mr Brothers was plainly under no illusionsabout the very fine line he and his fellow directors were treading.  He stood to gain no material benefit from keeping WMI going,other than the satisfaction of a job well done.  The loss of face involved in being connected with a collapsed company might wellbe a powerful inducement for many people to hold on as long as possible in the hope that something might turn up.  I do not, however,find that such a consideration motivated Mr Brothers.  The inference therefore is that it was genuine belief in WMIâs future, afuture assisted by WM, that fuelled Mr Brothersâ unstinting efforts to keep WMI afloat.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(7) Last, but by no means least significant, I had the opportunity to observe Mr. Brothers in the witness box for over four weeks. Despite the obvious difficulties he encountered, he never became flustered or embarrassed.  My very carefully considered appraisalis that he was for the most part a sincere and honest witness.  I reach that conclusion notwithstanding my finding in relation tofraudulent misrepresentation.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.47" class="para" id="p5.7.47">5.7.47</a> After 8th October 1984, neither Mr. Brothers nor anyone else in WMIâs boardroom can have been under any illusions about WMâsfeelings towards WMI.  Something more was required to sustain Mr. Brothersâ faith that WMI would survive.  In my judgment, thatsomething was provided by the plans centred on the scheme to extract the tax benefits dormant in Rangelock, Sealock and Annalock. It is true that the consummation of that scheme was not a foregone conclusion, as the continuing saga of Marilock demonstrated. The idea had, however, been examined and given the green light by accountants; had found someone who was prepared to try and findpurchasers for the vessels; and had passed the first stage with the help of the banks and ADS (see <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32#p4.5" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4.5).</a></p>    <p><a name="p5.7.48" class="para" id="p5.7.48">5.7.48</a> That scheme and a restructuring of WMI eventually came to nothing, but only after the Wharf take-over and the appointment of EW on5th March 1985.  ADS do not complain of the Defendantsâ conduct after that date.  Until that date, I am satisfied that sufficientinterest and support was shown by creditors to justify Mr. Brothers continuing his efforts.  After all, as late as 8th August 1984,Mr. Shaw was saying that âthe Board should do what is reasonable and responsible in the circumstances it would be incorrect ...for the Directors just to throw in the towel.â  (para. <a>3.6.150</a>).</p>    <p><a name="p5.7.49" class="para" id="p5.7.49">5.7.49</a> In <i><u>Hardie v. Hanson</u></i> Kitto J. said at p.463:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âBut the onus lay on the respondent to prove affirmatively that the carrying on of the companyâs business during the relevantfifteen months was characterized by an intent - which in the circumstances means an intent on the part of the appellant - to defraudcreditors of the company.  An actual purpose, consciously pursued, of swindling creditors out of their money had to be establishedagainst the appellant before a declaration under the section could be made.  It was not enough for the respondent to prove that theappellant acted with blameworthy irresponsibility, knowing that he was gambling (in effect) with his creditorsâ money as well ashis own, and with much more of their money than of his.  ...</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The circumstance that he did draw out more than he paid in demonstrates the unfairness, not to say the utter wrongness, of the coursehe pursued; but with what intent he pursued it is the question; and in my opinion the only answer which can be given on the materialadduced is that although he was clearly unjustified in his chasing of the rainbow, he is not shown to have had any more sinisterintent than an intent to try, however despairingly, to carry the business through its difficulties to a success which, if it hadbeen reached, would have benefited the creditors as well as himself.  In whatever terms his conduct may be condemned, his intentis not, I think, to be described as an intent to defraud the creditors.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.7.50" class="para" id="p5.7.50">5.7.50</a> In my view, that passage is apt to sum up Mr. Brothers.  I find therefore that, although Mr. Brothers was carrying on the businessof WMI, he did not do so dishonestly with intent to defraud creditors.  The main case on fraudulent trading against Mr. Brothersmust be dismissed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="5.8">5.8    MR. LEES</a></p>    <p><a name="p5.8.1" class="para" id="p5.8.1">5.8.1</a> Mr. Lees was one of the two managing directors of WM and principally responsible for WMI and the activities of Mr. Brothers.  Hiswas a supervisory as opposed to an active role.  It was for him, or in his absence Mr. Leung, to approve or authorise what Mr. Brotherswas doing.  He too was carrying on WMIâs business.</p>    <p><a name="p5.8.2" class="para" id="p5.8.2">5.8.2</a> Mr. Lees accepted, and like the other individual defendants he really had no alternative in view of the documents and auditorsâreports, that from September 1982 WMI depended on WM support for survival.  Like the other defendants, his confidence that WM wouldsupport derived principally from the November consensus.  Mr. Lees was not, however, entirely consistent about its nature nor washe consistent about its duration.  Ultimately, he was effectively espousing the formulation I set out earlier (para. <a>5.4.21</a>).  The two elements, a probable return to profitability and the amount of support required would be taken into account.</p>    <p><a name="p5.8.3" class="para" id="p5.8.3">5.8.3</a> In his witness statement at para. 28.2, Mr. Lees said that following informal meetings of WM directors in November 1982 âPeterGriffiths and Jaime Ortiz-Patino outlined the strategy which had been agreed between the major shareholders and which was based onthe proposals put forward by Henry Leung and myselfâ.   That seems to indicate first, that the agreement was one between Mr. Mardenand Mr. Cheung and second, was an endorsement of steps already devised by WMI to meet its problems.  Further, the word âstrategyâsuggests a broad approach, leaving the tactics to WMI.  Successful implementation of the strategy would then produce the supportrequired.  In other words, support was not unconditional.</p>    <p><a name="p5.8.4" class="para" id="p5.8.4">5.8.4</a> That the agreement was one involving shareholders rather than directors is emphasised by the next paragraph in his statement whereMr. Lees deals with âthe major shareholdersâ attitude to WMIâ and why he felt they would support.</p>    <p><a name="p5.8.5" class="para" id="p5.8.5">5.8.5</a> Later, in para. 166.6 where Mr. Lees was dealing with the S&amp;C report dated 21st September 1984, he said:  âIn the November1982 policy decisions, the senior directors of WMI had decided once WMIâs cash flow problems were resolved WM would provide long-termfundingâ.  Apart from attributing the âdecisionsâ to directors, that passage seems to me to contain a clear indication thatsupport depended on solving WMIâs cash problems, i.e. that there was no commitment to support regardless of the circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p5.8.6" class="para" id="p5.8.6">5.8.6</a> In cross-examination, Mr. Lees was asked why the November consensus was not recorded in any minutes and replied at day 65/38:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.  Well, it was not a matter of me wanting it in there; it was a question that the major shareholders would require steps to betaken with Wheelock Maritime before they quantified the amount of support they would give.  In my mind there was never any doubtthat they would give the support, but that is a different thing from having it recorded at the meeting.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.8.7" class="para" id="p5.8.7">5.8.7</a> But a few minutes later, he said at p. 40:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âWhat I have said all along is that this was a meeting of directors of Wheelock Marden about what should happen with Wheelock Maritime,and that was a strategy to be followed and it was a step-by-step strategy, to arrive at the parent company support.  It was somethingwhich we could not quantify and get into the minutes.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.8.8" class="para" id="p5.8.8">5.8.8</a> Then, on day 67/40 when referred to the November consensus Mr. Lees said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âA.  That was a strategy of the directors.</p>        <p>Q.  It was an agreement, you have said, to support?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>A.  Yes, all right, it was an agreement amongst the directors.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Q.  To support?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>A.  To support.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.8.9" class="para" id="p5.8.9">5.8.9</a> Plainly, if you are unclear in your own mind about who precisely agreed or committed to provide support, it is difficult to sustaina case for such an agreement or commitment.  I have already found the case to be unsustainable.</p>    <p><a name="p5.8.10" class="para" id="p5.8.10">5.8.10</a> In any event, whatever had or had not been agreed in November1982, it had by September 1983 become something of a movable feast. It was put to Mr. Lees that once WM had provided drip feed in the form of the US$4 million facility, the November consensus hadgone.  After some disagreement over the question and Mr. Leesâ answer, I sought to clarify at day 68/90:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âHIS LORDSHIP:  I will put this matter to rest, because it is something I had marked to raise with Mr Lees, anyway.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  From your last answer, Mr Lees, I understood you to say that the November agreement was no longer in existence in the sense thatit had been varied because some of the steps which were anticipated had not been taken, or were going to be impossible, or as thecase may be?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  That is correct, my Lord.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  I did not understand you to say that the essence of the agreement -- namely, that support would be forthcoming -- had vanished?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, my Lord, I did not mean -- if I implied that, I am sorry -- I withdraw that.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">MR GROSSMAN:   Well, Mr Lees, if we could just follow that.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The reason I put it to you, and let me put it to you unequivocally -- that the November agreement was now dead, the whole of the agreementwas dead; it no longer existed?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Not in those precise terms.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  The reason I put it to you is this:  because it was the essence of the November agreement that certain steps be taken and then,once quantification took place, there would then be a once-and-for-all support?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  In that case, yes, my Lord, you are correct, but it does not mean to say the whole agreement as such had varied.  The principle,the policy of supporting it remained in place, but not in those precise terms of the November agreement.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  What we are looking at now, of course, is, as you have said, using my words, a drip feed approach giving money as and when requireduntil a long-term solution could be come up with after quantification?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  That is correct, yes, I accept that.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  That is the opposite to what was contemplated in the November agreement?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes, my Lord, it had been taken over by events, but the principles behind it were still that parent company support in some formwould be made available in the future.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Yes, some time in the future on a one-off basis?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No -- in that respect, my Lord, it was dead because we could not quantify the one-off amount as such.  It would have to come inthe form of staged payments, if I may put it that way.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  By September 1983, almost none of the steps had been completed?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes -- you may be right.  I mean, offhand, I cannot be sure.  Some steps had been taken.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Some steps?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  The once-and-for-all approach had to be abandoned?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes, I accept that.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  So, whatever agreement there was in November 1983 had been overtaken by events?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes, except the principle of parent company support, that had not gone out of the window, as you said.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and at p. 93:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMR GROSSMAN:  Q.   I must put it to you so that there is no misunderstanding that, by the beginning of 1983, the November agreementwas dead; it had disappeared from people's minds?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, my Lord, I do not accept that -- by the beginning of 1983, no.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Well, then, by at least, at the latest, September 1983, was dead and buried?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.

In cross-examination about paragraphs10 and 11 of Mr. Mardenâs witness statement (para. <a>5.4.20</a>) Mr. Lees was asked if he agreed and said at day 65/50:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.  In general, yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.

He does not refer to it specifically, but he mentioned a lot of it that is in there.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Sorry?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  He has mentioned most of the steps indicated, the steps in this statement.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  But what he indicates --</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  The policy of actually trying to get the subsidiary to sort out its own problems, on its own, without keep referring back -- thatwas a policy arrangement in November/December 1982 -- and then drip feeding, which we had to do subsequently, and then you had tostudy the long-term viability of the company, and I think we always did that.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Insofar as WMI was concerned, and that is what he is talking about here, he seems to indicate that you first had to decide ifit had a long-term future?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Correct.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  The question did not arise, therefore, of:  "It will never go into liquidation because we will support it".  The point that heseems to be making here is that there is not a question of WMI inevitably being supported, but what we would look at first is tosee if it would survive in the long-term?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes, that is true -- you had to look at the long-term, but on the other hand you would not allow a company to go into liquidationin the shorter term pending solving the longer term problems, and as in my view this was only a matter of time, because the chartermarkets were in such a poor state, we thought that the charter market would improve -- shipping values would recover, therefore,it was not a finite calculation, because there were so many variables, but at the end of it, you would see how much you needed andwhether you could achieve it.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  But, as far as WMI was concerned, the question of its long-term survival, you tell us, was never in doubt?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It was not, in my mind, ever in doubt.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  That is because you intended to support it?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Sorry?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  That is because you intended to support it?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes, indeed.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  So, this was not a question of whether it would survive in the long-term first; this was a case where you did not have to worryabout the long-term because you knew it would survive?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, that is not what I said.  What I meant to say:  You had to look at the steps you would have to take towards the long-termto see whether you could survive the long-term.

Well, that, my Lord, is not necessarily true, either, because at that point, as you go through, you could take ships and separateit out.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Taking all this into account, I understand your point perfectly that the money that is being paid out by WMI over the next threeor four years is substantially going on paying back banks and other lenders so that you are beginning to revive the equity in yourvessels, which will give you the opportunity, three or four years down the line, to raise fresh funds on the security of the equityin those vessels.  I have that point on board, and what Mr Grossman is seeking to get you to agree with -- whether or not you agree,of course, is entirely a matter for you -- that taking all this into account, a figure might be quantified which, possibly, you andthe other directors would say: It is still too much; we are not prepared to do it?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.

He began to have misgivings when the management committeewas set up in July 1983.  He felt Mr. Cheung was using the question of support for his own objectives - to gain greater control ofthe WM Group.  That was why Mr. Cheung made the uncommercial decision to refer to HKR the request for support in April 1983.  Mr.Lees would have preferred WM to give support of US$12 million at that stage which would have prevented WMIâs position from deteriorating.</p>    <p><a name="p5.8.20" class="para" id="p5.8.20">5.8.20</a> When HKR declined to invest, Mr. Lees wrote to WM on 14th September 1983 seeking support (App. 3/22).  He said WMI needed US$12 millionto obtain a moratorium and without a moratorium WMI would have to cease trading.

That was clear, was it not?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  That was clear -- that is the point that I wanted to make to Mr Ying.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  But that was the true position, was it not?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, that is the point that I wished to make to Mr Ying.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Sorry, are you saying that was not the true position?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, that was not the true position.  That was the point I wanted to get across to Mr Ying as a representative of Mr Cheung.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Did Mr Ying not know the position?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I wished to make that point to him.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Why was it necessary to emphasise it in that way if it was not true?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I have been through this before.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It was not necessary -- it was not necessary for WMI to survive; WMI could have survived, my Lord, without it.  This is the pointI am trying to make to Mr Ying, and he would, of course, report to Mr Cheung.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  I may not have followed that.  I am sure it is my fault, but what is specifically stated here: if the request for the dividendis turned down, is rejected, then it appears that WMI cannot survive long enough to seek an injection of funds in March 1985.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Forgive me if you have answered it, but I am not sure that I have followed it.  Was this true or not?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  There are two points.  Maybe I have not made it clear.  If we did not get the dividend, then WMI would not have a long enoughperiod in order to prepare a document for a capital injection in March, as was forecast.  That is what that said.  But it did notsay that WMI could not survive without the dividend.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  But the point you were trying to make to Mr Ying is that it would not survive -- it probably would not survive?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It could not survive long enough to get the dividend; in other words, to retain the structure as it was, therefore, you wouldhave to approach it from a different angle altogether.  You would then have to go to the creditors, you would have to get a reschedulingand you would probably have to have a restructuring.  The point is, I emphasise, to survive in its present form.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  It does not say that.  It says the complete opposite?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, it says:  "It would not survive long enough to seek an injection of funds by way of a new issue from shareholders".  Thatmade it quite clear, my Lord.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  It is clear, Mr Lees, and what is clear is that you are saying:  unless we get the dividend, we are not going to survive longenough to get the injection by March 1985?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  The company, as I said before, could survive.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  I wonder why you said that to Mr Ying?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, my Lord, I made the point to emphasise it to Mr Ying.  He had asked the question and that was my response, so that, quitefirmly, he would take it back to Mr Cheung.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Maybe I have not understood it.  Let me ask you this:  are you satisfied that the statement is true and it is properly expressed,the statement as is recorded on page 7?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Let me put it again.  Sorry.  What I said was, he asked the question, I do not really know what the question was -- I cannot recallwhat the question was -- but what I gave in response was that, if we did not get the dividend, we would not have sufficient timeto put together a new issue proposal.  That did not mean that the company could not survive, my Lord.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">HIS LORDSHIP:   What you did not say was:  we will have to look for an alternative form of support; we will have to go to the creditorsif they will agree to a restructuring?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Or any other step that you could possibly think of?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, I did not say that at this time, because, as I said earlier, this was to emphasise the point to Mr Ying, who would relay itto Mr Cheung.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Your purpose being to get Mr Cheung to make up his mind?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  That is correct, my Lord.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  And to take some action, sooner rather than later?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  That is correct, my Lord.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">MR GROSSMAN:  Q.   I do not understand if what you are saying is that the paragraph on page 7 does not fully or properly reflect whatyou said, or that it does properly reflect what you said, but you did not mention at all the question of alternative funding?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, these minutes, as often, are not always as precise as they should be, but the point -- I think I have explored it with you. The question, I do not know -- I do not recall how he put the question.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">HIS LORDSHIP:   If it helps, I understand your answer.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Sorry?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  If it helps, I understand your answer, which, as I said a few minutes ago, is to the effect that you made this statement, whichis true, to emphasise the position to Mr Ying, who would in turn carry the message to Mr Cheung.  You did not state, or it remainsunspoken, that the alternative would be to seek support from the creditors in one form or another?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  That is correct, my Lord.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">MR GROSSMAN:   Thank you, my Lord.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.

It appears from my review of the documents.  It was not something actively pursued until the end of September 1984 whenthe possibility of UK tax benefits began to crystallise.  Until then, it would have required among other things the co-operationof all creditors including ADS.  Doubtless, Mr. Lees and Mr. Brothers were realistic enough to appreciate that, given WMIâs circumstancesand their own failure to obtain significant support from WM, they would get short shrift from creditors.</p>    <p><a name="p5.8.28" class="para" id="p5.8.28">5.8.28</a> In my judgment, the idea of restructuring is not a factor which until then had or could have had influence on the directorsâ perceptionof whether WMI could survive.  It is not something which has any bearing on the crucial issue, namely whether they honestly believedWM would support WMI.  Indeed, it is a factor which would have militated against such a belief because it would arise only if WMwas <u>not</u> going to support.  And, of course, on 8th October 1984 WM gave its first unequivocal indication that there would be no further support(para. 3.6.223).</p>    <p><a name="p5.8.29" class="para" id="p5.8.29">5.8.29</a> Mr. Lees also had to deal with Mr. Shawâs letter of 4th August 1983 (para. <a>3.5.197</a>) about the proposed sale of Asia Heron to Allied in which Mr. Shaw gave advice on fraudulent preference, and with para. 90.2 of hiswitness statement.  At day 67/90:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.   ...  in 90.2 you say this:       </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I was still on holiday at this time.  I was, however, aware of this proposed sale, as this had been discussed before I left.  TheWMI directors considered the price offered to be a fair price, but decided at the shipping committee meeting on 3rd August to referthe matter to David Shaw.  The concern, which I shared, was that the transaction could be seen as preferring a WM Group creditorto other creditors and we wanted to ensure that we could not be criticised if we proceeded with the proposal.  Norton Rose was asked,probably by Robbie Brothers, to advise whether the transaction could be open to attack as a fraudulent preference."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">This was a concern that you shared?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.

What is the concern to which you refer in paragraph 90.2?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  My main concern was because this was a transaction, my Lord, between two companies in the group.  I mean, it is very importantto try and establish something like this at arm's length; therefore, every point had to be considered.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  The concern to which you refer is that the transaction could be seen as preferring a WM Group creditor to other creditors?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I had in mind the fact that we were, shall we say, securing or getting $1 million of the debt from Allied paid back.  That, itseemed to me, might be a fraudulent preference, because it is taking security out of the hands of the general body of Wheelock Maritime.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Mr Lees, this transaction and the concern about it could only be relevant in the context of liquidation, is that not right?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.

No, what I meant was, and I still mean, was that I thought we were taking secured assets of Wheelock Maritime into Allied.

No, I am not withdrawing from it, no, but I am explaining to you what I meant and what I understood.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  I put it to you that paragraph 90 can only be read in one way and that is the directors, including yourself, were concerned aboutfraudulent preference and you knew perfectly well that that only related to the possibility of liquidation?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.

It is plain that that confidencehad a somewhat shaky basis.  For reasons similar to those I have mentioned in relation to Mr. Brothers, however, I am unable to saythat Mr. Lees has been proved to have been dishonest.

Mr. Leung saw his functionand duty to be to implement WM board policy.  He had risen through the WM ranks from the position of accounts clerk in 1948.  Atthe time of these events, he had been well over 30 years with WM.  When he gave evidence in February 1996, he was almost 70, a diabeticand in 1995 had had cataracts removed from both eyes and a tumour from his tongue.

He too struggled to extract from the November consensus more certainty than itreally contained.  Yet, even his witness statement gave an indication of its true nature.

In para. 34.02, he continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe discussions centred upon what should be done with WMI given the prevailing market conditions which were beginning to look worsethan had been anticipated and in particular the support which WM should give its subsidiary.

He wanteda solution to be worked out sooner rather than later, as indeed did the rest of us.  At the meeting on 29th November, Peter Griffithsand then Mr. Ortiz-Patino set out for Robbie Brothers what we had all agreed upon as the strategy for dealing with the WMI Groupcashflow problems and the support WM would give to WMI.  There was no suggestion from any of those present that WMI should be liquidatedor otherwise disposed of.

No, that was a belief.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  No, no.  Mr Poon and Mr Lees make it quite clear that the question is still open and to be decided still?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I believe what he actually meant --</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  No, no, this is what he said.  I can ask Mr Lees himself what he meant -- I have done -- but this is what he said and what MrPoon --</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes, if that is what he said, that is what he said.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  What Mr Poon said, that is perfectly clear at this stage that there was no commitment, there was no agreement to support?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  There was no commitment, correct.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  If there ever had been a commitment, that had now disappeared?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, I do not agree.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Well, there was no commitment, so it had disappeared -- it is simple?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I believe the words "no commitment" refer to the request for help after the turndown of HKR for the investment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  That is absolutely right, HKR had turned it down, and there was no commitment by WM to ensure that WMI survived?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  The commitment was subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions, yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  No --</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  But --</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  That is not what it says?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  My Lord, I agree there was no commitment at this stage of WM.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.9.7" class="para" id="p5.9.7">5.9.7</a> Subsequently, when cross-examined about the WMI board meeting on the same day, Mr. Leung clarified what he meant about commitment. Mr. Grossman pointed out that Mr. Shaw had made no reference to any commitment, and continued at day 81/69:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  There was no need for it, because there was no commitment any more, was there?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, there was no commitment at that point, or, shall we say, we did not know if and how much at that point.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  The big question was:  you did not know if Wheelock Marden would support?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I would not think so.  I still believed that WM would give support.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Mr Leung, we have just been through the previous minutes where you agreed with me that there was no commitment?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No commitment at that point did not mean there was not going to be any support.  All I understand about the word "commitment"is they did not definitely answer at that stage how much, or if at all, support would be coming, but it does not mean there was completelyno support.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  No, no, I understand you are not saying it had been definitely decided that there was no support -- you are not saying that?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">HIS LORDSHIP:   Mr Leung is saying, as he must, in view of the documents and what he said a moment ago that support was not a foregoneconclusion, but he, nonetheless, still had the belief, at the end of the day, that Wheelock Marden would provide the necessary support.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.9.8" class="para" id="p5.9.8">5.9.8</a> Unfortunately, Mr. Leung immediately resiled from that position at p. 70:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  Mr Leung, the reason why I am asking you this is because the position seems to be different now.  You had always been underthe impression, or believed, that ultimate support from WM was a foregone conclusion.  Now, that position no longer existed, thatis, because there had been an agreement with Mr Cheung, but that position no longer existed; is that not correct?  Do I understandyour position to be that?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  That was not correct.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Can you explain then what you are saying the position was, now, in September after Warburgs had given a negative recommendation?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  My recommendation, my Lord, was that HKR had turned down the recommendation.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Yes?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  WMI had approached originally WM, or had wanted to approach WM.  The approach was interrupted by this idea of HKR to invest, sothe thing was held in suspense -- the approach by WMI to WM.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">HKR said "No" and WMI was told or had to reapproach WM.  WM said, "Let me think about it." It did not say "Yes" or "No", because itwas not sure that it would itself give the support.  It might well be that Mr Cheung, or the major shareholders, or even the boardof WM, might think of other companies in the Group that might have the idea, or interest, in investing in WMI.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">So, you talk about commitment at that moment.  As I said, I agree there was no commitment, because the whole thing was still underconsideration and that is why I said at that moment there was no commitment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  At that moment, there was also the possibility that there may not be any support at all?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Anything can happen, my Lord.  There was no uncertainty as such, I think, in everything.  You can only say you believe, or youcan perhaps say, "I am fairly certain," but there is no such thing as a sure certainty, I would say, if I can put it that way now. I believe things can change, however certain we believe the position was.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Yes, the position had always been like that, had it not?  There was a hope that Mr Cheung might agree to support, but it was alwaysuncertain?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It was not a "hope", my Lord, it was a belief.  The belief could be upset by events that took place -- sorry, by events that takeplace without his expecting it, or, in fact, arising from a complete unexpectation such as act of God, war, anything -- earthquakes,so nobody, if I may say so, can -- at least I am sure I can say it for myself, I cannot say it for everybody -- can say that thiswas a certainty and it must happen.  There is no such thing, my Lord.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  We are not talking about a certainty in that sense.  What we have been discussing in this case is an agreement, or a commitment,by Mr Cheung to ensure that WMI survived.  What I am saying to you is that agreement, or commitment, or undertaking never existed?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, my Lord, not only had it always existed, the question I was asked or that was just put to me is "no commitment by Mr Cheungto ensure" -- is that right?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  My answer to this, my Lord, was that there was no adverse decision relayed either to myself directly by Mr Cheung, or throughhis representative, like this, because this was reflected by Mr Poon's remarks at that meeting.  He did not say that there was nocommitment.  He probably only said -- as a lawyer, he had to be careful and, therefore, he wanted to be sure of the wording thatone does not make it too definite.  Such is the case also when HongKong Realty, or HKR, made that announcement.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Mr Leung, all I am pointing out to you is that every indication during 1983 was to the effect that, at most, Mr Cheung would beprepared to think about the matter.  There was never any indication at all that he was committed to saving WMI, and, indeed, Mr Griffiths'telegram or fax that we saw yesterday for the first time indicates very strongly that there was not any commitment?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  As I said earlier on, or a few days ago, there was such an arrangement.  It was from Mr Griffiths in November 1982.  As far asI was aware, there was nothing that had been either written or told to me by Mr Griffiths that the agreement that we had arrivedat in November is now no longer valid.  There was no such information or message passed to me.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Mr Leung, the reason why no message was passed to you was because of the November agreement was out of everybody's mind by earlyJanuary.  It had been overtaken by events?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It was not.  It might be affected to a certain extent by things happening every now and again, such as the HKR proposal or idea,but the fact -- the ultimate decision, as far as I can see, is WM would come to the rescue.  It was only a matter of perhaps whoeverthought about this, say, Mr Cheung -- was that we, as executives, have to try our best to solve this, not just go back too easilyto your parent and ask for money.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.9.9" class="para" id="p5.9.9">5.9.9</a> So the essence of the November consensus, according to Mr. Leung, was a decision by major shareholders, one of whom at least recognisedthere would be financial constraints, which at some stage would be expected to be translated into approved policy by the WM Board. Yet, it never was, and indeed, as Mr. Leung accepted, it was never mentioned although he suggested there were âechoesâ.</p>    <p><a name="p5.9.10" class="para" id="p5.9.10">5.9.10</a> Apart from the November agreement, Mr. Leung had other difficulties in cross-examination.  Thus dealing with the advice Mr. Shawgave at the meeting on about 17th February 1983 (para. <a>3.5.28</a>), he said he regarded the test as there being a reasonable prospect of debts being met.  That, I think, was not unreasonable giventhat it seems to be accepted that the advice about preservation of assets was something of a gloss.  However, at day 78/21 he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.  Mr Shaw said this in February before we took delivery of the Sealock and there was no doubt that the position of WMI at thetime of this meeting in February -- 17th February -- was doubtlessly serious, but this, I recall, had been taken over by events after17th February, perhaps before the date of the delivery of the Sealock.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Well, Mr Leung, we will go through it together and perhaps you will be able to show us how the position had improved, but I amgoing to suggest to you that the position had got much worse, in fact, by April?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  We will have to see, my Lord.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.9.11" class="para" id="p5.9.11">5.9.11</a> Cross-examination proceeded to examine the events occurring between that meeting and delivery of Sealock.  Then at day 79/37:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  So, let me summarise then, briefly, the position at the end of March.  The cash position of WMI was critical; you had beentold not to incur new credit unless it was absolutely essential; you needed a moratorium; you were not going to get a moratorium,you had been told, without parental support; you had not asked for parental support and you did not know what would happen if youdid ask for parental support.  These things were all open, were they not?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I do not agree with the last bit of it.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  What do you not agree with?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It was true that we did not -- "we" meaning WMI -- am I right in saying that, my Lord?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  I am sorry, I do not follow that.  I will put the question to you again.  In summary, therefore, what you knew at the end of Marchwas that the cash position of WMI was critical?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Correct.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  You had been told not to incur new credit unless it was absolutely essential to preserve assets?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  You needed a moratorium on repayments to the bankers?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I do not agree with the word "needed", because we would like a moratorium, but there would be other approaches.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  This is the advice you had got from Schroders &amp; Chartered, and this is what Mr Brothers was saying?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes, that was the suggestion.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  You were not going to get such a moratorium without parental support -- that is the advice given to you by Schroders &amp; Chartered?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  That was the advice given by Schroders &amp; Chartered, yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  You had not asked for parental support?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  We had not asked for that.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  And, if you did ask for it, you did not know what response you would get?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I believe if it asked for that, we would get support.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  I thought you just agreed with me that you did not know?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I did not know the outcome, naturally, but that was my belief then, that it would be, but we had not approached; so what I meantto say was at that very moment I did not know, but that was my belief -- that, had we approached, we would get it.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  And, Mr Leung, every indication in 1983 thus far had been against support for WMI?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I think the idea was or the policy was that WMI should use its own efforts and resources to sort out its problems, so that waswhat we were doing, but if everything that we had done had performed and we did not get the -- and we were not able to solve theproblem, then I believe the parent company will or would give its support.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  But, Mr Leung, every indication had been -- not only from the Cheung camp, but also from Mr Ortiz-Patino at that stage -- thatsupport would not be forthcoming?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I do not agree.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Do you agree with me that the position was very uncertain?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It was critical.  I would not want to use the word "uncertain", because I had the belief that eventually WM would give its support.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Mr Leung, I have set out the background extensively and I think you have agreed with me about it this morning.  Do you not acceptthat it was quite wrong to take credit from my client at the beginning of April, given the background of events in early 1983?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I do not agree, my Lord.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  I must put it to you -- and you know perfectly well, Mr Leung, that I am correct -- that there was no reasonable prospect of gettingsupport for WMI and there was no reasonable prospect, therefore, of my client being repaid?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I deny this allegation.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Mr Leung, all you had was a belief that there should be support and a hope that there would be support -- that is all you had?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It was not a hope, my Lord; it was a belief -- a firm belief on reasonable grounds.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Well, Mr Leung, I must put it to you that you have not given us a single reasonable ground for this belief.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  The ground I had was the basis that I mentioned earlier on.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  I must put it to you that that is simply not true.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I do not accept that.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Let me ask you this.  Mr Shaw had advised on 17th February that you should only take new credit if it was absolutely essentialto preserve the assets.  You said to me, when I asked you about this, that the position had improved after February and that is whyyou could ignore that advice at the beginning of April.  Tell me, Mr Leung, having gone through the various events of February andMarch, how the position had improved.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.

Mr Leung, what events had happened after 17th February which enabled you to ignore that part of Mr Shaw's advice?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.

Well, we know, Mr Leung, that you did ignore or you did not follow Mr Shaw's advice that you should not take credit unless absolutelyessential to preserve the assets.  We know that, because you took credit from my client.  What I am saying to you is:  why did youignore that advice?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Because I believed parent company support would come.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  What event had happened between 17th February and the end of March to lead you to that conclusion or that belief?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I believed that if the need did become very necessary for WM to seek help or assistance from the parent -- for WMI to seek fromthe parent company support or help, then we would get -- WMI would get it.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Mr Leung, when I first asked you about this matter, you said that you had not needed or had not followed Mr Shaw's advice, becauseit had been overtaken by events?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  That was what I am stating now -- it had been overtaken, but at that moment, naturally, I would not have known what took place,but I had this belief that we would get it, in one form or another.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Mr Leung, I am only going to ask you this once more, simply because we have to move on, but I will repeat the question and I willrepeat it as clearly as I can.  If you do not follow it, please ask me and I will try and re-explain it.  On 17th February, Mr Shawhad given you certain advice.  One piece of advice was that you should not obtain new credit unless it was absolutely essential topreserve the assets.  You had said to us that that advice was not followed because it had been overtaken by events.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Now, we have examined in detail all the events between 17th February and Easter just before the delivery of the Sealock.

Mr. Leungâs earlier answer plainlycarried the implication that things had improved or changed for the better or become brighter.  That was wholly unjustified.  Inthe later passage, Mr. Leung indicated that he was relying simply on his belief that support would be forthcoming.</p>    <p><a name="p5.9.14" class="para" id="p5.9.14">5.9.14</a> Mr. Leung quite understandably had difficulty in recalling events of over 10 years ago.  Like Mr. Lees he was a little coy aboutthe missing EAW report.  In his witness statement, he said at para. 105.02:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI do not recall that I ever read the EAW report.  I understand that I acknowledged receipt of a copy of the report with a letterdated 13th September 1983 from EAW.  I cannot be certain when I received this letter.  It may be that it was shown to me just beforethe HKR Board meeting on 15th September.  In any event, if I did read the report, it certainly did not make a great impression onme and, therefore, I assume it was uncontroversial.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.9.15" class="para" id="p5.9.15">5.9.15</a> In cross-examination, Mr. Leung said about the report at day 81/57</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.

He replaced SirY.K. Pao on the WM Board where he was to monitor to some extent the WWW joint venture.  He was also indirectly connected with theDalians.

He was not aware of the Novemberconsensus although he knew meetings had taken place.  He realised a plan had been formulated involving the reduction of debt, salesand the cancellation of newbuildings which was similar to the policy which had been adopted by WWS.  He was not worried about WMIbecause, as he said in his witness statement at para. 32.03:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âThroughout the time I was a WMI Director, I believed support would be forthcoming for WMI to trade out of its difficulties untilthe market improved.  In relation to the âtestsâ raised by David Shaw, I had no special knowledge that support would not be forthcomingand I certainly believed there was a reasonable prospect of sorting something out.  Rothschilds and Schroders had both recommendedthat WMI be supported and for compelling commercial reasons.  My belief was confirmed by Rothschildsâ and Schrodersâ views. I could not envisage WM ignoring such professional advice and not providing support.  I appreciated of course that John Cheung andhis associates would have to agree to any decision to assist WMI, but I believed that at the end of the day support would be forthcoming. My reasons were principally as follows and they remained the same at all times until WMâs takeover by the Hong Kong and KowloonWharf and Godown Company Limited (âWharfâ) in March 1985, referred to later in this Statement:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) Although the shipping market was severely depressed when delivery was taken of the âSealockâ in April 1983 and the âAnnalockâin March 1984, I was aware from my experience with WWS that the market can be extremely volatile and, on occasions, can improve veryquickly.  I had no doubt whatsoever it was only a matter of time before the market improved substantially and WMI would again beprofitable.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b) WMI was part of WM which was a long-established and leading Hong Kong company.  WMI had the âWheelockâ name and was a majorWM subsidiary and investment.  In my view, WMI was WMâs âbabyâ and would be supported.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c) I was aware that John Marden as WMâs Chairman, for historical and other reasons, was staunch in his support of shipping.  Ihad no doubt he and other WM Directors, if not necessarily always for the same reasons, would support WMI where necessary.  I consideredit was in the WM Groupâs interests to support WMI, although the amount of such support should be limited to what was necessarybefore the market improved.  I was confident John Marden would act in the best interests of WM and WMI.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>It was also well known within the WM Group that Anton Marden, as John Mardenâs only son, was being âgroomedâ for a role withinWMI and WM, in particular in attending WM and WMI Board and Committee meetings, although not a Director.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d) So far as John Cheung and his associates was concerned, I had no reason to believe they would disregard the Chinese belief thata parent company does not âcut offâ a member of its family, or allow a subsidiary to go into liquidation.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Further, although John Cheungâs associates were not enthusiastic about shipping, it was clear to me and I believe the other WM Directors,that in the interests of the Group as a whole, John Cheungâs associates considered WMI should be supported until the market improvedand not put into liquidation.  They wished to limit such support to what was necessary in the circumstances.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(e) No one within the WM Group wanted WMI to go into liquidation or believed liquidation was necessary.  So far as I am aware, allWMIâs Directors including myself, believed that a solution in one form or another, should and would be found for WMIâs financialdifficulties.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(f) My views on parent company support were reinforced by the independent financial and legal advice received from time to time byWMI and WM, particularly from Schroders and Norton Rose in the case of WMI and Rothschilds and Slaughter &amp; May in the case ofWM.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(g) Liquidation would be extremely damaging both to the reputation and creditworthiness of WM and the WM Group as a whole and to WMâsshare price.  I was firmly of the belief that John Marden and John Cheung as WMâs two major shareholders would be keen to avoidthis.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(h) The numerous instances when WM proposed or provided support directly or indirectly.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.10.5" class="para" id="p5.10.5">5.10.5</a> There was, of course, a flaw in Mr. Leeâs reasoning.

Mr. Leeâs expertise was infinance so, while he relied on Mr. Brothers for these projections, he cannot have been under any illusions that market improvementswere going to save the day.

In my view,Mr. Lee can legitimately be accused of over reliance on the working directors and paying too little attention to what was reallyat issue in taking delivery of the newbuildings and drawing down the loans.  I am doubtful whether he properly discharged the functionsof a director of a public limited company.  I am not persuaded, however, that he was dishonest and party to a fraud on ADS.  Forthis and reasons already given, the primary case in relation to fraudulent trading must be dismissed against Mr. Lee.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="5.11">5.11    MR. MARDEN</a></p>    <p><a name="p5.11.1" class="para" id="p5.11.1">5.11.1</a> The eponymous Mr. Mardenâs position in the WM Group is tolerably clear by now.  He was the shipping man.  He had other shippinginterests outside the WM Group.  After his father, he had been installed on the WM throne but, by the time these events took place,he had had to make space for Mr. Cheung and was in danger of being pushed off.  The struggle with Mr. Cheung plainly undermined Mr.Mardenâs ability to approach WMIâs problems in the direct manner he would no doubt have preferred.</p>    <p><a name="p5.11.2" class="para" id="p5.11.2">5.11.2</a> The absence through ill health of Mr. Marden from the witness box raised considerable difficulties.  Mr. Mardenâs witness statementis a masterpiece of commercial reason and common sense.  It contains, however, two substantial contradictions of other evidence:not only is there no reference to the November consensus but there is no reference to any such meetings (para. 5.4.20).  Second,there is no suggestion that Mr. Marden was prepared to help WMI out of his private resources.</p>    <p><a name="p5.11.3" class="para" id="p5.11.3">5.11.3</a> Somewhat surprisingly Mr. Marden also said of the S&amp;C report of April 1983 that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI think it highly unlikely that I would have discussed the report with John Cheung as I had little direct contact with him aboutany of the Groupâs business.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.11.4" class="para" id="p5.11.4">5.11.4</a> In para. 22 of his witness statement, Mr. Marden dealt with HKR</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe records show that, on 30th April 1983, WMIâs directors resolved to approach Hong Kong Realty for assistance.  I was not presentat the meeting.  I do not recall discussing this with John Cheung but John Cheung must have agreed in principle to provide this supportas he ran Hong Kong realty.  Otherwise, the letter dated 6th May 1983 from WMI to Hong Kong Realty would not have been written inthe terms that it was.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.11.5" class="para" id="p5.11.5">5.11.5</a> That too is in sharp contrast to the clear indication from all the evidence that Mr. Marden had been putting together a syndicateto deal with if not take over WMI.  It is inconceivable that Mr. Cheung and HKR would have stepped in without discussion betweenthe two principals even if it was conducted through intermediaries.</p>    <p><a name="p5.11.6" class="para" id="p5.11.6">5.11.6</a> Mr. Marden also made clear that from January 1983 onwards WMI obtained continuous legal advice about fraudulent preference and fraudulenttrading, âmatters which were in the directorsâ minds from this time onwardâ.  Mr. Marden, as he believed did all the otherWMI directors, relied heavily on this advice, would not have acted against it and would have expected Norton Rose to react to anyproposals which caused them disquiet.</p>    <p><a name="p5.11.7" class="para" id="p5.11.7">5.11.7</a> As far as support was concerned, at para. 24 of his witness statement, Mr. Marden said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â24. In mid July 1983, I received a letter from Schroders stating that the secured banks were unwilling to proceed with a moratoriumunless parental support was forthcoming.  This was something N.M. Rothschild &amp; Sons Hong Kong Ltd. were instructed to adviseupon.  My position remained that every effort should be made to find support for WMI and I had every confidence that it would beforthcoming, which it ultimately was.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.11.8" class="para" id="p5.11.8">5.11.8</a> That paragraph seems to have accepted, as is now acknowledged to be the case, that WMI was dependent on support for survival.  Inpara. 30, Mr. Marden also seems to have acknowledged that support would have to come from WM</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â30. I did not and do not think that WMIâs expectation that Wheelock Marden &amp; Co. Ltd. would come to its assistance was misplaced. Indeed, if it had been misplaced, one would have expected Wheelock Marden &amp; Co. Ltd. to have sent a clear signal to WMI to haveresigned as general manager and to have ceased consulting professional advisers about supporting WMI.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.11.9" class="para" id="p5.11.9">5.11.9</a> So, once again could Mr. Marden have genuinely expected that support from WM?  The fact that Mr. Marden did not in the end make aprivate investment in WMI is not to the point.  What is important is that his intention to do so was an indication of his determinationto see WMI through its problems.  Although, as I have said, Mr. Marden himself makes no mention of a private investment, there isno doubt on the evidence that on at least two occasions he was seriously contemplating such a course.  Initially, there was the syndicateto acquire an interest in WMI in April 1983.  That project was no doubt abandoned once HKR became involved.  Next, Mr. Marden commissionedWardleys to report after the disappointment of HKR and the US$4 million facility.  That report was hardly encouraging and Mr. Mardendid not invest.  But by then, December 1983, an air of optimism had crept into WM and WMI.  Hence, at the WM board meeting on 20thDecember 1983, Mr. Lees reported progress and Mr. Marden âcongratulated all those who had been concerned with resolving WMIâsdifficultiesâ.  I can perhaps comment here, and it is a comment which applies to all the minutes and other documents, that thisminute was not prepared with litigation in mind or, at least, not litigation of the nature and magnitude of the current proceedingsin which the question of an honest belief is crucial.</p>    <p><a name="p5.11.10" class="para" id="p5.11.10">5.11.10</a> By August 1984 when WMI was again beset by problems, Mr. Marden was considering an acquisition of an interest in WMI, a course whichhad the support of Mr. Cheung.  This turned into a search for an outside investor to acquire WM which would allow Mr. Marden to keepthe Group together and support WMI.  Had it not been for the intervention of Wharf, the last plan may have succeeded.</p>    <p><a name="p5.11.11" class="para" id="p5.11.11">5.11.11</a> Mr. Mardenâs championship of WMI was spoken of in the strongest terms by Mr. Ortiz-Patino, whom I deal with in the next section. Mr. Ortiz-Patino identified part of a letter written by Mr. Marden to, as I understood it, Mr. Ortiz-Patino himself in August 1984(App. 3/25).  This letter seems to me to throw contemporary light on Mr. Mardenâs attitude to WM and WMI.  It shows Mr. Mardenat least had doubts about Mr. Cheungâs good faith and his commitment to WMI.  It shows that Mr. Marden was fully behind WMI andone way or another was determined to support it through WM.  According to Mr. Ortiz-Patino, Mr. Marden had the personal means toachieve this.</p>    <p><a name="p5.11.12" class="para" id="p5.11.12">5.11.12</a> Despite the lack of any mention by Mr. Marden in his witness statement of his personal allegiance to WMI, on the totality of theevidence there is no doubt that he intended to ensure support by WM for WMI with or without Mr. Cheungâs assistance.  It is difficult,in the circumstances, to see how dishonesty can with the necessary degree of probability be ascribed to him.  But for the unexpectedtake-over by Wharf, Mr. Mardenâs plans and intentions should have proved well-founded.  If Mr. Marden was confident in WMIâsfuture, his fellow directors and defendants were entitled to derive some comfort from that confidence, a confidence at the highestlevel.  It is important to recognise, as ADS pointed out, that it is not part of the pleaded case that survival of WMI was assuredon the basis that Mr. Marden would have stepped in to save WMI.  That does not, however, affect my finding that the other defendantscould legitimately derive confidence from Mr. Marden.  The source of Mr. Mardenâs confidence was irrelevant.  In any event, itseems clear at least to me that it was Mr. Mardenâs intention to solve WMIâs problems not so much by a private take-over as byplacing WM in a position to be able to maintain WMI as a going concern.</p>    <p><a name="p5.11.13" class="para" id="p5.11.13">5.11.13</a> Accordingly, I dismiss the primary fraudulent trading claim against Mr. Marden.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="5.12">5.12    MR. ORTIZ-PATINO</a></p>    <p><a name="p5.12.1" class="para" id="p5.12.1">5.12.1</a> Mr. Ortiz-Patino was and is an experienced businessman with international interests and connections.  His commitments are such thatonly with many monthsâ notice could he make himself available to give evidence.  He gave the unfortunate impression that he wassomewhat exasperated at being troubled with what he regarded as a rather trivial episode which he had long consigned to limbo.</p>    <p><a name="p5.12.2" class="para" id="p5.12.2">5.12.2</a> Mr. Ortiz-Patino was involved in the November 1982 meetings of which he said:  âThe upshot was that a broad strategy was agreedas recorded in [the December memorandum]â.  In para. 8.02 of his witness statement, after noting the presence of Mr. Griffiths,he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMy understanding was that John Cheungâs position was that WM would provide financial assistance to WMI provided WMI had takenall reasonable steps to increase its liquidity, in particular by reducing or rescheduling its debts and selling assets, so that WMIâsactual cash needs could be quantified.  He was against simply pouring money into WMI.  So was I, and in fact John Cheungâs viewson this matter were similar to my own.  To my mind, the agreed strategy recorded in Robbie Brothersâ memorandum of 8th December1982 reflected this approach.  Parent company assistance was to come last, in the form of a âonce-for-all fund-raising exerciseâ,and not in the form of guarantees.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.12.3" class="para" id="p5.12.3">5.12.3</a> That evidence is rather more consistent with a plan than a commitment.  When giving oral evidence in chief, Mr. Ortiz-Patino addedthe element of quantification, a step which would be necessary before a rights issue or other form of support.  In cross-examination,however, he too characterised the November consensus as a commitment by the two major shareholders.  He was pressed about the amountwhich might have been quantified.  After saying he had a figure of US$20-30 million in mind, cross-examination proceeded on day 118/102</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  There was no agreement on a figure?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Of course, if it turned out to be considerably higher, what would you have done?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  As I mentioned before, we wanted to be quantified.  That was the whole purpose of this whole exercise: we wanted it quantified. I am not going to make suppositions of what is going to happen.  All I can say is that Wheelock Marden is a very wealthy company,a rich company and can cope with a figure of $20 or $30 million; it is nothing for them.  You have their annual report here, youcan confirm it to yourself. .</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  It is easy enough to see what they were worth, it is a question of how much they were prepared to --</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I am sorry, I could not hear.  I do not know how much they were prepared, my Lord, to put up.  We would only have decided thatwhen we knew what the figure was.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Once you had the figure, then depending on its enormity, the Board may or may not agree to give that support?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.

So I do not accept, as I have already indicated, that until November 1984 that there wasan unfettered ongoing commitment to save WMI.  And as with other witnesses who tried to cloak the November consensus with an ill-fittinggarment, Mr. Ortiz-Patinoâs credibility necessarily suffered.</p>    <p><a name="p5.12.5" class="para" id="p5.12.5">5.12.5</a> Mr. Ortiz-Patino met and became friendly with the Marden family in about 1962.  He was appointed a director of WM in 1966 out offriendship with Mr. Marden after Mr. Mardenâs father died.  He became a very close friend of Mr. Marden and stayed with him whenin Hong Kong.  He was uniquely placed to speak about Mr. Mardenâs interest in and deep commitment to shipping and to WMI whichrepresented the majority of the WM Groupâs shipping activities.  In para. 14.01 of his witness statement, Mr. Ortiz-Patino said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI always believed that, if necessary, John Marden would use his own personal fortune to secure the future of WMI despite the adversemarket conditions.  In my mind such a proposal would be used as a last resort.  However, John Marden did not discuss this proposalwith me.  He already knew that my concern at this time and later was that he would allow his enthusiasm for the shipping businessand his desire to support WMI to lead him to provide the necessary support personally before it had been clearly demonstrated thatthere was no alternative to securing WMIâs future.  I recall I had voiced this concern to John Marden during one of my recent visitsto Hong Kong.  As stated in paragraph 3.03 above, I used to stay with the Marden family in Shek-O on my visits to Hong Kong and travelwith John Marden by car to the office.  I am sure that I took the opportunity on one such drive to try to dissuade him from investingin WMI unless and until it was clear that this was the only way of saving WMI.  I also advised him that he should ascertain the extentof the investment which would be needed to secure WMIâs future and obtain independent financial advice on the viability of theinvestment.  I should add, however, that even if John Marden had obtained independent financial advice which was not in favour ofhim investing in WMI, I was well aware that he would have proceeded with the investment in any event.  This was because of his loveof the shipping business and desire to hand it over to his son in due course.  I just wanted him to be made aware of the risks hewould be taking in making such an investment.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.12.6" class="para" id="p5.12.6">5.12.6</a> I accept that Mr. Marden himself has provided no evidence of his great commitment to WMI.  Indeed, his witness statement is consistentwith the evidence of Mr. Brothers.  For example, Mr. Brothers said Mr. Marden had a âhard nosed approach to what was in the interestsof WM and his familyâ and âwould have behaved rationally as would any vendorâ - although ultimately Mr. Brothers felt thatMr. Marden would invest.  Again, Mr. Brothers said that in November 1984, he discussed with Mr. Marden the possibility of Mr. Mardentaking over shares of WMI:  âThe result of that was basically inconclusive but certainly not in any way positiveâ.</p>    <p><a name="p5.12.7" class="para" id="p5.12.7">5.12.7</a> In his witness statement, however, before this point might have been perceived as relevant, Mr. Ortiz-Patino described Mr. Mardenas âan intensely private man who did not communicate wellâ.</p>    <p><a name="p5.12.8" class="para" id="p5.12.8">5.12.8</a> I accept, therefore, Mr. Ortiz-Patinoâs analysis of Mr. Mardenâs attitude to WMI.  Despite the point about the November consensus,I am satisfied that, whatever his personal feelings, Mr. Ortiz-Patino came to help the court and to recount events and personalitiesas honestly and accurately as he could.  He certainly pulled no punches about Mr. Cheung.  He said he was concerned about him allalong particularly because of the enormous number of votes he had obtained through acquiring cheap B shares and said:  âI wouldnot have trusted him implicitlyâ.  Mr. Ortiz-Patino added that Mr. Cheung had always been polite and that in the course of discussionshe had had with Mr. Cheung during this period (day 118/77)</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.   ... he never said he was going to support the shipping.  He never said that.  He always said: "John wants me to support theshipping, I want to know what it is going to cost."  That is all he said.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  You got this from John Cheung?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  John Cheung, yes.  I went to see him quite often in his office down below.  He would always say to me -- there never was at anystage, anywhere, where he said he was not going to support the shipping any more.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Did you discuss with him the question of whether or not he would support.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, but he knew -- I probably did.  I discussed many things with him.  I discussed splitting the company, I discussed him sellinghis shares, I discussed the shipping.  He was annoyed at the shipping and annoyed that John had given the guarantee without his knowledge. He was annoyed that these reports were going around.  He was not pleased, but he did want to -- he even went as far, at one stage,as having HongKong Realty say they will take it up.  He discussed shipping with John Marden and he discussed shipping with me.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5.12.9" class="para" id="p5.12.9">5.12.9</a> I conclude, therefore, that Mr. Ortiz-Patino was supportive not only of the view that Mr. Marden was committed to WMI but that therewere real grounds for believing that Mr. Cheung, once every drop of blood had been wrung from creditors, would also stand by WMI. Mr. Ortiz-Patino at least remained confident WM would support.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="5.13">5.13    ADVICE</a></p>    <p><a name="p5.13.1" class="para" id="p5.13.1">5.13.1</a> The legal and financial advisers gave evidence.

There were not,as far as I am aware, any material deviations from that advice or those views in their evidence.  The effect of their evidence may,I think, be summarised in three parts:</p>    <p>(1)  <u>November Consensus</u></p>    <p><a name="p5.13.3" class="para" id="p5.13.3">5.13.3</a> None of them were aware of any formal November plan.

All of themassumed WM would support and were not aware of any commitment.  As Mr. Reynolds put it âto the extent the problems were beyond[WMI, it] would then have to negotiate some form of support with its parentâ. </p>    <p>(2)  <u>Propriety of Advice</u></p>    <p><a name="p5.13.4" class="para" id="p5.13.4">5.13.4</a> The advisers agreed that, given WMIâs difficulties, it was right for the directors to have sought advice particularly as a publiccompany was involved.

Was it your recollection that WM not supporting was equated with WMI going into liquidation?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I think it rather depends on the point of time, but in the earlier stages, I think Schroders &amp; Chartered were reasonably firmlyof the view that unless WM gave some support, then it would be difficult to persuade the banks to agree to any moratorium or rescheduling,and certainly in that phase, it was an important element of getting something together which would put the company on a long-termfooting.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.

David Mace of Messrs. Ernst &amp; Youngwas retained by ADS, and Roderick Chalmers of Messrs. Coopers &amp; Lybrand by the defendants.  Both Mr. Mace and Mr. Chalmers preparedlengthy reports and replies to each otherâs reports.  Each covered the ground in considerable detail.  They were initially dividedon a number of issues.  As the trial developed, however, the only issue of any significance which survived between them was, in myview, what was called the Danish Kroner funding adjustment.</p>    <p><a name="p5.14.2" class="para" id="p5.14.2">5.14.2</a> ADS also called Mrs. Jean Richards, an expert in the shipping market and ship valuation.  She too provided a lengthy report whichto her chagrin was reduced very considerably on the grounds of admissibility (I repeat, however, that I found the unexpurgated report,which I had read earlier, of immense interest and a tribute to a very considerable expert).  In the event, the defendants largelyaccepted Mrs. Richardsâ evidence and did not find it necessary to call their own experts in this field.  As a result of this evidence,it became possible to agree that the assumptions in relation to the shipping market contained in the WMI cash flows were reasonable.</p>    <p><u>Equity build up</u></p>    <p><a name="p5.14.3" class="para" id="p5.14.3">5.14.3</a> It also became possible for Mr. Chalmers to recalculate the equity build-up in WMIâs fleet based on what became known as âMrs.Richardsâ formulaâ.  In essence, the formula consisted of the estimated value of existing vessels based on predictions of whatthe shipping market would do; <u>in general</u> the value of existing vessels not exceeding the cost of newbuildings; and the value of a vessel having to be kept at scrap valuein the last 2 years of its working life of 20 years.</p>    <p><a name="p5.14.4" class="para" id="p5.14.4">5.14.4</a> This calculation transformed the WMI cash flows by showing the effect of refinancing 80% of the increasing equity available to WMIin vessels on which debt had been paid down.  The S&amp;C cash flow of April 1983 with a moratorium had shown a maximum deficit ofUS$53 in 1989.  Mr. Mace in his report had based his assessment of WMIâs position upon the then market values prevailing.  Mr.Chalmers had used net book-value.  After making an adjustment for equity build-up on the basis of 1983 market values, the maximumdeficit would be US$22 million in 1987; using book-values there would be a deficit of US$15 million in 1988.  Mrs. Richardsâ formula,however, produced a deficit of only US$6.8 million in 1987 and by 1992 there would be a surplus of US$86 million.</p>    <p><a name="p5.14.5" class="para" id="p5.14.5">5.14.5</a> The position became even more marked if an injection of US$12 million was introduced.

The former produced a maximum deficit of US$16 million in 1988; the latter one of US$10.7million in 1990.</p>    <p><a name="p5.14.8" class="para" id="p5.14.8">5.14.8</a> It was Mr. Maceâs view that WMI was wholly dependent on WMI support for survival.  That was the linchpin of ADSâ case.  Mr. Chalmerswas of the same view.  Where they differed was on timing.  Mr. Mace said it should have been in place before the loans were drawndown and that the failure to have it in place undermined any reasonable belief that support would be forthcoming.  Mr. Chalmers didnot insist on support at that stage.  Of course, it would have been desirable for WM to have provided support in 1983.  Had it doneso, in all probability it would not have been necessary for me to write this judgment.  That support of US$12 million was not thenprovided has raised the question which I have to answer - whether there was an honest belief support would be forthcoming.</p>    <p><a name="p5.14.9" class="para" id="p5.14.9">5.14.9</a> Mr. Mace agreed, however, that an injection of US$12 million in 1983, if not eliminating a future deficit entirely, would have reducedit to an amount over which it would have been reasonable to expect WM to help out.  The calculations I have outlined lend considerablecredence to that position.</p>    <p><a name="p5.14.10" class="para" id="p5.14.10">5.14.10</a> These calculations were, however, academic.  They would no doubt have provided great comfort to WMI and WM in 1983 and 1984.  Effectively,they were the quantification that WM was seeking.  The picture would have been encouraging.  The calculations were unfortunatelynot carried out.  Further, although equity build-up was mentioned by Mr. Lees and Mr. Brothers, it was not a factor they relied upon.</p>    <p><a name="p5.14.11" class="para" id="p5.14.11">5.14.11</a> There is also something of a catch 22 situation.  The equity build-up assumes debt being paid down in the intervening period, orbridging the gap as Mr. Chalmers put it.  To pay down that debt, WMI had to acquire funds from somewhere - which could only havebeen from WM.  Without those funds, the debt would remain and the only equity available would be that arising from any increase invessel values.</p>    <p><a name="p5.14.12" class="para" id="p5.14.12">5.14.12</a> Mr. Mace was criticised for not taking equity build-up into account in his report.  He explained that his approach was to take asnapshot view of WMI at the relevant times, a view based amongst other things on market values.  That view led him to conclude supportwas necessary but which, as time went by, became less and less likely on an objective basis.  That was the real issue.  On his approachthe question of equity build-up did not arise.</p>    <p><u>Danish kroner adjustment</u></p>    <p><a name="p5.14.13" class="para" id="p5.14.13">5.14.13</a> Also academic, in my view, was the issue of the Danish Kroner adjustment.  The argument for the defendants was that the liability(the loans) and the corresponding assets (the Danish Kroner deposits) were in imbalance because the smaller deposits would pay offthe larger loans.  Net assets were thus reduced.  Although that was correct accounting treatment, WMIâs balance sheet should beadjusted to reflect the beneficial effect of the arrangement and thus improve WMIâs asset position.  Indeed, S&amp;C carried outthe adjustment in their balance sheet of April 1983. </p>    <p><a name="p5.14.14" class="para" id="p5.14.14">5.14.14</a> Mr. Mace was prepared to accept this in relation to Marilock and Rangelock.  He would not, however, accept any adjustment for thethree later vessels because the revised arrangements meant that the deposits no longer liquidated the loans and interest.  Mr. Chalmerswas of the opinion that an adjustment should still be made for that part of the loans still covered by the remaining deposits.</p>    <p><a name="p5.14.15" class="para" id="p5.14.15">5.14.15</a> Even accepting Mr. Chalmersâ contention, however, it seems to me the effects are cosmetic rather than real.  Mr. Chalmers disagreedwith Mr. Maceâs valuation of WMI on a market rather than book value basis.  He said that this was not in accordance with a goingconcern basis.  He pointed out that WMIâs accounts had not been qualified by its auditors.  He said, and Mr. Mace agreed, thatthere was as yet no permanent diminution in the value of WMIâs assets which required them to be written down.</p>    <p><a name="p5.14.16" class="para" id="p5.14.16">5.14.16</a> Mr. Chalmers had,however, been to considerable trouble to explain to me his approach to a company which finds cash flow problemsand which may be commercially insolvent.  He said it is then necessary to look to the companyâs balance sheet to see what assetsare or will be available at the relevant time and which can be refinanced or disposed of in order to provide any funds which maybe required.  He acknowledged, however, that a banker or other person being asked to provide such finance is likely to give any asseta realistic appraisal rather than simply accept its book-value..(Although not an accounting expert, that is effectively what Mr Shawtold Mr Brothers and others on 9th August 1984 - para. <a>3.6.148</a>).</p>    <p><a name="p5.14.17" class="para" id="p5.14.17">5.14.17</a> In practice therefore Mr. Chalmers would adopt the same approach as Mr. Mace in deciding on the health or otherwise of a company. Applying that approach to wmi and the Danish Kroner, the deposits themselves were not going to provide any relief.  They were alreadyaccounted for.  Mr Chalmers accepted that no finance could be borrowed against them.  WMIâs other principal assets were its vesselsor the owning subsidiaries.  The amount of debt and available equity, if any, was readily ascertainable in respect of each individualvessel.  This would be reflected in the equity build-up calculation.  The only other sources of finance were any residue of the WWWshares and the excess over 80% of any available equity, 80% being the likely maximum up to which a bank would lend.  The excess mighthave provided, according to Mr. Chalmers, security sufficient for WM to lend further support. </p>    <p><a name="p5.14.18" class="para" id="p5.14.18">5.14.18</a> I accept that there were substantial differences between the ADS loans and the funds earmarked for discharge of those loans.  Accordingto Mr. Chalmersâ calculations, the adjustment in April 1983 should have been HK$238 million, in September 1983 HK$234 million andin March 1984, after hull 912 had been sold, HK$156 million  For the reasons given, I do not believe the adjustment had any practicaleffect on WMIâs overall financial position. </p>    <p class="heading"><u>Conclusion</u></p>    <p><a name="p5.14.19" class="para" id="p5.14.19">5.14.19</a> In spite of the immense amount of information provided, I am unable to derive any further assistance from the evidence of Mr. Maceand Mr. Chalmers.  Both are experts in the insolvency field.  They helped me patiently with various financial documents and problemsassociated with them.  I am indebted to them for that help.  But as I have already indicated, apart from the Danish Kroner adjustmentthere was very little between them.  WMIâs financial precariousness spoke for itself.  Any businessman would have been rightlyalarmed at the situation.  So, in my view, it came simply to a question of whether, in spite of that cause for alarm, the defendantscould legitimately allow WMI to continue trading on the basis of an honest belief in support being forthcoming from WM.  It was nota question which turned upon difficult financial analysis or the resolution of divergent views upon accounting principles.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="5.15">5.15    FRAUDULENT TRADING - THE ALTERNATIVE CASE</a></p>    <p><a name="p5.15.1" class="para" id="p5.15.1">5.15.1</a> Should its primary case on fraudulent trading fail, ADS pleaded an alternative in paragraphs 29 and 30 ASOC</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â29.

To have relied on either of these two factors would have been an impermissiblegamble on the part of the directors of a public company.</p>    <p><a name="p5.15.21" class="para" id="p5.15.21">5.15.21</a> The evidence of the accounting experts effectively coincided on this point, as does the thrust of the Rothschildsâ report of 21stSeptember 1983. </p>    <p><a name="p5.15.22" class="para" id="p5.15.22">5.15.22</a> To continue trading at a loss so that WMIâs already diminished value would be diminished further was plainly not in the interestof creditors.  ADS argued that liquidation would, however, damage WMâs interest by effectively writing off its investment and damagingits reputation, particularly in China, if the Dalians were not delivered.  It is the latter consideration, claimed ADS, which motivatedWMI in leaving the Dalian position to drift in the hope that something, for example, an uncovenanted recovery in the market, wouldturn up.  In spite of Mr. Brothersâ efforts, no viable or cash neutral plan for the Dalians had yet been achieved.  Cancellation,however, would have injured WM.</p>    <p><a name="p5.15.23" class="para" id="p5.15.23">5.15.23</a> It was ADSâ case that WMâs interests took precedence over those of WMI and its creditors and that the directors pursued thoseinterests to the detriment of creditors.</p>    <p><a name="p5.15.24" class="para" id="p5.15.24">5.15.24</a> For the purpose of the primary case of fraudulent trading, it is not necessary to establish a motive or purpose.  The motive willoften, however, be self-evident - personal enrichment - which may well assist in establishing a fraudulent intent.

Two difficulties emerge.  First, neitherdirectly nor, in my view, inferentially, is there any evidence to show that the directors were serving WMâs interests per se asopposed to interests which were by convention identical (para. <a>7.2.8</a>).  Second, I see very little difference between the reasons, purpose or motive in taking credit from ADS and those for keeping WMIgoing when it was otherwise headed for liquidation.  If no intent to defraud can be inferred in relation to the former, it is difficultto see how fraud is to be attributed to the latter.  Further, I do not see how, if it was not fraudulent to take credit from ADSwhen there was no honest belief WM would support, it might be said to be fraudulent to have carried on trading in the same circumstances. The mischief appears to me to be indistinguishable.</p>    <p><a name="p5.15.26" class="para" id="p5.15.26">5.15.26</a> I would therefore have dismissed the alternative claim against the defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p5.15.27" class="para" id="p5.15.27">5.15.27</a> In addition, ADS alleged that Mr. Brothers was also protecting his status and position.

Butwhen the learned Lord Justice speaks of a statement made recklessly or without care whether it is true or false, <i>that is</i> without any reasonable ground for believing it to be true, I find myself, with all respect, unable to agree that these are convertibleexpressions.  To make a statement careless whether it be true or false, and therefore without any real belief in its truth, appearsto me to be an essentially different thing from making, through want of care, a false statement, which is nevertheless honestly believedto be true.  And it is surely conceivable that a man may believe that what he states is the fact, though he has been so wanting incare that the Court may think that there were no sufficient grounds to warrant his belief.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.2.4" class="para" id="p6.2.4">6.2.4</a> And at p. 374, after stating the elements of deceit Lord Herschell said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI think these propositions embrace all that can be supported by decided cases from the time of <i>Pasley v. Freeman</i> down to <i>Western Bank of Scotland v. Addie</i> in 1867, when the first suggestion is to be found that belief in the truth of what he has stated will not suffice to absolve thedefendant if his belief be based on no reasonable grounds.  I have shewn that this view was at once dissented from by Lord Cranworth,so that there was at the outset as much authority against it as for it.  And I have met with no further assertion of Lord Chelmsfordâsview until the case of <i>Weir v. Bell</i>, where it seems to be involved in Lord Justice Cottonâs enunciation of the law of deceit.  But no reason is there given in supportof the view, it is treated as established law.  The dictum of the late Master of the Rolls, that a false statement made through carelessness,which the person making it ought to have known to be untrue, would sustain an action of deceit, carried the matter still further. But that such an action could be maintained notwithstanding an honest belief that the statement made was true, if there were noreasonable grounds for the belief, was, I think, for the first time decided in the case now under appeal.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In my opinion making a false statement through want of care falls far short of, and is a very different thing from, fraud, and thesame may be said of a false representation honestly believed though on insufficient grounds.  Indeed Cotton L.J. himself indicated,in the words I have already quoted, that he should not call it fraud.  But the whole current of authorities, with which I have solong detained your Lordships, shews to my mind conclusively that fraud is essential to found an action of deceit, and that it cannotbe maintained where the acts proved cannot properly be so termed. ...</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">At the same time I desire to say distinctly that when a false statement has been made the questions whether there were reasonablegrounds for believing it, and what were the means of knowledge in the possession of the person making it, are most weighty mattersfor consideration.  The ground upon which an alleged belief was founded is a most important test of its reality.  I can conceivemany cases where the fact that an alleged belief was destitute of all reasonable foundation would suffice of itself to convince theCourt that it was not really entertained, and that the representation was a fraudulent one.  So, too, although means of knowledgeare, as was pointed out by Lord Blackburn in <i>Brownlie v. Campbell</i>, a very different thing from knowledge, if I thought that a person making a false statement had shut his eyes to the facts, or purposelyabstained from inquiring into them, I should hold that honest belief was absent, and that he was just as fraudulent as if he hadknowingly stated that which was false.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.2.5" class="para" id="p6.2.5">6.2.5</a> More recently, in <i><u>Akerhielm</u></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1959%5d%20AC%20789" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1959] AC 789</a>, Lord Jenkins, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, said at p. 805:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe question is not whether the defendant in any given case honestly believed the representation to be true in the sense assignedto it by the court on an objective consideration of its truth or falsity, but whether he honestly believed the representation tobe true in the sense in which he understood it albeit erroneously when it was made.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.2.6" class="para" id="p6.2.6">6.2.6</a> The test therefore is plainly a subjective one.

Of that Act, both <i><u>Chitty on Contracts</u></i> 25th Edition para. 421 and <i><u>Spencer Bower on Actionable Misrepresentation</u></i> 3rd Edition p. 178 were of the view that, in the absence of authority, an agent was probably liable for negligent misrepresentation. Subsequent editions of <i><u>Chitty</u></i>, however, reflect the decision of Mustill J. in <i><u>Resolute Maritime Inc. v. Nippon Kaiji Kyokai</u></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20WLR%20857" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 WLR 857</a> that an agent who makes a misrepresentation is not personally liable under the Act.  At p. 860 in that case, the judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIt is sensible to approach the problem by looking at the words of section 2(1) in isolation to see whether they point so clearlytowards one conclusion that there is no need for consideration of the Act as a whole, or of the purpose which it was intended toachieve.  Mr. Pollock, for the plaintiffs, says that they do.  The draftsman has, he points out, chosen the word âpartyâ to describethe representeeâ - (this must be an error for representor) - âin the opening words of the subsection, and has then chosen âpersonâto describe the representor in the remainder of the subsection.  This shift in language demonstrates, so it is contended, that theperson intended to be liable is not the obligor under the contract, but the individual who actually makes the representation.  Tothis, Mr. Buckley, for the thirteenth defendants, replies that the alteration in language was for the purpose of euphony.  One couldnot speak of âanother person thereto.â  This argument itself prompts the response that if the intention had been to make theobligor liable to the exclusion of the agent, the draftsman would have continued to use âpartyâ throughout the remainder of thesubsection, instead of reverting to the word âperson.â  Finally, the defendants can reply by pointing out that since an agentwho incurs no personal liability under a contract is not âa party thereto,â the agent can only be brought within the descriptionof the representor if the words âby another party theretoâ are read as meaning âby or on behalf of another party theretoââ which is not what they say.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>In my judgement, none of these arguments is sufficiently clinching to provide an immediate answer to the problem, and one must lookelsewhere for a solution.  The key is, in my view, to be found by looking at the position of the principal, in a case where he hasauthorised his agent to make the representation, and had no reasonable grounds to believe that the representation was true.  Commonsense suggests that if anyone is liable under a statute concerned with representations inducing a contract, it ought to be a principalas party to the contract.  That this is, indeed, the case is shown by section 2(3), which contemplates that credit will be givenas between the recoveries under subsections (1) and (2): and these relate to liabilities of the same person, as witness the wordsâheâ and âhis.â  The liabilities under section 2(2) must attach to the principal, for they are conferred as an alternativeto rescission, a remedy which is available only against a party to the contract.  It follows, therefore, that the word âpersonâin section 2(1) must be read as including the principal.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>It may, however, be objected that even if this is so, there is still room to read section 2(1) as creating an additional liabilityin the agent.  I do not agree.  The Act is concerned with representations made in the particular context of a contract, and it seemsto me that it was aimed at the position of the parties to the contract.  It was therefore natural that there should be created undersubsections (1) and (2) rights which are prima facie absolute, and independent of any general duty of care, a concept which playsno part in the law of contract.  The purpose of the Act was to fill a gap which existed, or was believed to exist, in the remediesof one contracting party for an innocent representation by the other.  But there was no such gap in the case of the agent; he wasalready subject to the ordinary liabilities in fraud and negligence, the doctrine of <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Heller &amp; Partners Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] A.C. 465</a> having been recognised before the Act was passed.  What purpose would there be in creating an entirely new absolute liability, independentof proof that the representee fell within the scope of a duty of care, simply because the representor happened to be an agent, concernedin the making of a contract, but not himself a party to it?  I can see none; and, since, as I have suggested, the words of section2(1) must be read as extending to the principal, I consider that their operation should be confined to him alone.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>In arriving at this conclusion, I recognised that the opposite view has been expressed in the current editions of <i>Chitty on Contracts,</i> 25th ed. (1983), para. 379, and <i>Spencer Bower &amp; Turner, Actionable MisrepresentaÂ­tions,</i> 3rd ed. (1974), p. 178.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.3.4" class="para" id="p6.3.4">6.3.4</a> ADS accepts the first part of the judgeâs reasoning, that the Act includes the principal, but rejects the argument about the gapto be filled.  Mr. Cullen submitted that the judge was considering the position of brokers, i.e. persons independent of the contractingparties on whose behalf they act, where the question of vicarious liability arises.  However, where the person making a negligentmisrepresentation is a servant or officer of a company, his principal, i.e. the company, has been held liable under the <i><u>Hedley Byrne</u></i> principle : see for example <i><u>Esso Petroleum Co. Ltd. v. Mardon</u></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%201%20QB%20801" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 1 Q.B. 801</a> and also <i><u>Spencer Bower</u></i> para. 156B.</p>    <p><a name="p6.3.5" class="para" id="p6.3.5">6.3.5</a> Mr. Cullen contended that the ârights which are prima facie absoluteâ are not absolute in the sense of being fault-free becauseit is a good defence to show a reasonable belief in the truth of the facts represented.  Liability only attaches, therefore, if therepresentor made the representation fraudulently <u>and</u> if he had no reasonable belief in its truth.  That filled the gap which then existed in relation to innocent misrepresentation forwhich one party to a contract could not get damages against the representor.  However, Mustill J. went on to say that there was nogap in respect of an agent because he was already liable in fraud and for negligent misrepresentation under <i><u>Hedley Byrne</u></i>.  But the principal, argued Mr. Cullen, was already liable in such circumstances.  Therefore, the Act was nothing to do with closingany gap in liability attaching to principal and agent for negligent misrepresentation under <i><u>Hedley Byrne</u></i>.  The question which fell to be answered was whether liability for a negligent misrepresentation under the Act should apply onlyto the principal or also to the person making the representation and whose reasonable belief is the relevant factor in any defence. According to Mr. Cullen there was no reason why it should not.  He said the need to establish a duty of care was a burdensome obligation. The legislature, therefore, decided to extend liability for negligent misrepresentation without the need to establish a duty ofcare.  There were no apparent reasons why that liability should apply only to the principal and not to the person actually makingthe negligent misrepresentation.</p>    <p><a name="p6.3.6" class="para" id="p6.3.6">6.3.6</a> Further, Mr. Cullen said the decision should be confined to cases involving independent agents such as brokers.  That decision shouldnot apply to a director who may, depending on the circumstances, be an agent and therefore liable according to <i><u>Hedley Byrne</u></i> or be the company itself.  If the director is identified as the company, although he would be liable, for example for deceit, itwould seem he would not be personally liable for negligent misrepresentation under <i><u>Hedley Byrne</u></i> : see <i><u>Trevor Ivory Ltd. v. Anderson</u></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20NZLR%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 NZLR 517.</a></p>    <p><a name="p6.3.7" class="para" id="p6.3.7">6.3.7</a> Therefore, submitted Mr. Cullen, in the case of directors, at least, there was a gap to fill in relation to agents and the reasoningof Mustill J. was wrong.</p>    <p><a name="p6.3.8" class="para" id="p6.3.8">6.3.8</a> Mr. Johnson submitted that section 3(1) is inapplicable for two reasons.  First, the alleged misrepresentations were not made âbyanother party theretoâ which would be WMI or its subsidiaries but were made on behalf of them by or on behalf of WM, i.e. by anagent not by a party.  Second, even if it covers misrepresentation by an agent, liability is imposed only on the contracting partyand not on his agent.</p>    <p><a name="p6.3.9" class="para" id="p6.3.9">6.3.9</a> Mr. Johnson said that Mr. Cullen wrongly identified the gap that Mustill J. sought to fill in <i><u>Resolute Maritime</u></i>.  He argued that before the 1967 Act, a party to a contract could rescind in equity even for innocent misrepresentation but couldnot recover damages at common law unless the misrepresentation was fraudulent.  The Act filled that gap on a non-fault basis.  Onthe other hand, an agent was already liable in a fault-based cause of action for an untrue statement.  It would have made no sensefor the no-fault liability of a contracting party to be extended to an agent simply because that non-contracting party was actingas agent for the contracting party.</p>    <p><a name="p6.3.10" class="para" id="p6.3.10">6.3.10</a> Mr. Johnson said that the point made by Mr. Cullen about brokers was misconceived.  Either the person making the representation isan agent so that that representation is binding upon the contracting party, or he is not, in which case the representation cannotbe brought home to the contracting party and the Act then has no application.</p>    <p><a name="p6.3.11" class="para" id="p6.3.11">6.3.11</a> There are two authorities against Mr. Johnsonâs first point:  <i><u>Pepsi Cola International Ltd. v.

One of the strands in his reasoning was that the Act does not need to be interpreted as having this effect, becausethere was no gap here which required to be filled.  In such a case the representee can sue the agent at common law, in accordancewith <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. Ltd. v.

The vendorsought, inter alia, an indemnity from its solicitors pursuant to section 1(1) of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978.  Atp. 207, Morritt J. said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn these circumstances the plaintiffsâ alternative claim does not arise, but in any event in my judgment it would fail.

It may be that in some cases there are circumstances giving rise to a special relationship between the vendorâs solicitorand the purchaser from which a common law duty of care arises, but this was a perfectly normal conveyancing transaction in whichthe vendorâs solicitors answered inquiries before contract raised by the purchaserâs solicitors.

With the greatest respect, however, Iam constrained to disagree.  It seems to me that, for the reasons advanced by Mr. Cullen, there has been unnecessary complicationof what I perceive to be a very simple exercise.  That was an exercise on the part of the legislature to simplify and make fairerthe law in relation to negligent misrepresentation inducing contract.  The need to establish a tortious duty of care was done awaywith.  In those circumstances, I can see no reason why there should not be, to quote a phrase from another part of this judgment,a level playing field for both principal and agent.

In the 1970âs, it was a large conglomerate controlled by one Jan Bonde Nielsen.  One of itsdivisions, as they were called, contained its shipbuilding activities.  By 1979, however, when WMI was investigating the purchaseof Panamax vessels, BW was in deep financial trouble.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.2" class="para" id="p6.5.2">6.5.2</a> It is the irony of this case that what began as concern, shared by WMI, for the financial health of BW, concluded with a like concernfor WMI.  Both BW and WMI became insolvent.  Only the BW shipbuilding yard, which was in July 1980 set up as an independent publiccompany, survived.  That survival was only because of massive government or government sponsored support through the Danish CentralBank, EKR and the Fund.  And it is because of this support that the Defendants assert that, assuming any misrepresentations weremade, those misrepresentations had no influence on the decisions that enabled WMI to take delivery of the two vessels, because thosedecisions were politically motivated by a desire to keep the yard, and the employment opportunities it represented, going.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.3" class="para" id="p6.5.3">6.5.3</a> Following negotiations between Mr. Brothers and BW in 1979, on 14th June heads of agreements were signed between WMI and BW for theconstruction of six Panamax vessels which would be owned by companies established by BW but bare-boat chartered to WMI subsidiaries. That agreement was subject to various conditions.  It was entirely superseded on 11th August 1979 by a letter from WMI to BW confirmingthe purchase by WMI or its nominees of four Panamax vessels (two of which were subject to reconfirmation) for delivery in 1980 and1981.  Three vessels were priced at Dkr 166 million and one at Dkr 175 million subject to variation for extras.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.4" class="para" id="p6.5.4">6.5.4</a> In accordance with procedural protocol, on 20th August BW, on behalf of WMI, applied to the Fund for loans of 90% of the contractprice on delivery of the vessels, the loans to be paid in ten years at 7% interest from the date of delivery but with a grace periodof two years.  Those terms being outside standard OECD terms, a copy letter was included as evidence of a matching situation.  Onthe same day, BW wrote to EKR advising it of this order and also of a further order for one ship from a Norwegian owner, and explainingthat a building programme could be set up.  In this connection, Mr. Gideon thought that a minimum number of orders was necessaryto get government backing to continue.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.5" class="para" id="p6.5.5">6.5.5</a> In its letter, BW continued that a âdecisive and necessary elementâ was EKRâs assistance with financing arrangements and saidthat loans amounting to approximately Dkr 230 million would be needed in 1980 and 195 million in 1981.  The letter concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf B&amp;W Shipyard should continue to exist, it is of primary importance to secure these shipbuilding contracts now.  At the momentB&amp;W Shipyard has work only until the end of 1979, but the above export orders will ensure employment until the end of 1981, andB&amp;W Machinery plant, as well as many Danish suppliers, will benefit from these new contracts.  With these orders the shipyardwill be able to overcome two very difficult years in a reasonable and justifiable way.  B&amp;W Shipyard is one of the worldâsleading shipbuilding companies for the production of Panamax bulk-carriers and since this market seems to be developing again, thereshould be good opportunities to uphold the shipyard and thereby important export opportunities in the future.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">On this basis, we would appreciate a prompt and favourable handling of the attached applications and apply for preliminary approvalof the necessary guarantees and approval of the requisite guarantee framework for the preparation-phase loan.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.5.6" class="para" id="p6.5.6">6.5.6</a> Mr. Gideon threw light on this.  The yard had practically stopped work and therefore had cash flow problems.  However, the yard seriouslyunder-estimated the cost and difficulties of starting up again and this led to serious problems later.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.7" class="para" id="p6.5.7">6.5.7</a> The Fund worked quickly and on 31st August the administration, through Mr. Lyngsie, prepared a recommendation for its Board.

There was a meeting of the FundâsBoard on 12th September, at which Mr. Fogh, who represented Danish shipowners, said he would not give his consent to the loans becausethe favourable terms given by the Brazilian shipyard, which gave rise to the matching situation, were explicable by a full orderbook and longer delivery dates.  As a result, no decision was taken on the applications from BW.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.9" class="para" id="p6.5.9">6.5.9</a> Mr. Gideon accepted that it is always difficult to assess if there is a true matching situation because an owner can shop aroundthe world until he finds a yard with full order books and obtains good terms.  Mr. Nielsen of the Fund was of a similar view andsaid that there might be all sorts of hidden aspects of a matching situation, not least government assistance.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.10" class="para" id="p6.5.10">6.5.10</a> Because of the amount involved, EKR referred the matter to the Ministry for a decision.  When EKR learnt from the Ministry that theproposed arrangements were legal, it eventually wrote to BW on 4th October confirming it would provide export credit guarantees AB/Kand a counter-guarantee for the Fundâs loans to WMI.  (EKR denoted its guarantees as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>A = commercial risks</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>B = political risks</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>K = during the construction period</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>DA = counter-guarantee after delivery</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>DO = guarantee for a pre-delivery loan to the Yard)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.5.11" class="para" id="p6.5.11">6.5.11</a> There seems no doubt that the delay between 20th August and 4th October did prejudice WMIâs orders.  Mr. Per Schroeder of BW, whowas in Hong Kong looking after BWâs interests, telexed Mr. Sverdrup at the yard on 23rd September to the effect that he had spokento Mr. Marden who was pessimistic about the deal and who produced details of better offers from other yards.  The telex continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFurthermore, it was mentioned that the shipowning company finds it incomprehensible that political manoeuvres should ruin a businessdeal which would bring to Denmark in one single transaction 500 million worth of Danish Crowns in foreign currency and simultaneouslyensure the employment of 1200 workers directly, plus a comparable number indirectly.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">By the end of next week, on September 30, all contracts will become null and void, and I am convinced that the shipowner here in HongKong does not wish to extend the contracts unless a fully positive decision from the Danish Government and the Export Credit Councilis received on Thursday 27 September at the latest.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.5.12" class="para" id="p6.5.12">6.5.12</a> The political dimension was echoed in a number of contemporary Danish newspapers which noted that politics was keeping BW waitingfor export credit guarantees, a wait which might lose them the WMI orders.  It appeared, and Mr. Gideon confirmed, that the thencoalition government of liberals and social democrats was fighting about the guarantees, the liberals (known as Venstre) having someanimosity towards BW, an animosity which appears to have been generated by Mr. J.B. Nielsen.  The papers were critical of Venstreâsposition which might lead to the yard closing and the loss of thousands of jobs.  Then, on about 28th or 29th September, the governmentresigned.  The care-taker government seems to have acted swiftly and given its approval to the guarantees.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.13" class="para" id="p6.5.13">6.5.13</a> On 20th November, the Fundâs Board met again.  Again, Mr. Fogh would not agree and his view received the support of the Fundâsgeneral manager, Mr. Engell-Jensen.  It was decided to recognize that a purely political decision had been made by the governmentto accept a matching situation, in contrast to the Fundâs responsibility for assessing the security basis of any loan.  Subjectto a caveat about matching, the Board approved the loans.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.14" class="para" id="p6.5.14">6.5.14</a> In the end, as Mr. Gideon agreed, the relaxed terms for these loans were the result of a political decision.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.15" class="para" id="p6.5.15">6.5.15</a> On the same day, the Fund wrote to WMI that the two loans were offered by way of bonds and were subject to the securities mentionedbefore.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.16" class="para" id="p6.5.16">6.5.16</a> There was, however, still uncertainty as to the final position.  WMI wrote to BW on 1st December that it understood that, althoughcontracts for two Panamax vessels had been signed with two of its subsidiaries, WMI had four weeks to satisfy themselves that BWhad sufficient support to perform these contracts.  On 5th December, WMI asked its solicitors in London to carry out an investigation. Enquiries seem to have confirmed that there was a tight but not a disastrous financial situation at BW.  On 20th February 1980,the solicitors advised Mr. Brothers of an EGM of BW, that the situation was very bad, but that it was probable the vessels wouldbe delivered.  On 12th March 1980, Mr. Brothers agreed with BW to an assignment of part of the second instalment for the purchaseof steel.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.17" class="para" id="p6.5.17">6.5.17</a> The difficulties of BW, however, could not be contained.  On 8th July, Mr. Sverdrup advised Mr. Brothers that the shipyard had beenestablished as a separate company with effect from 1st July.  He also advised that an agreement had been reached with the yardâssteel supplier to postpone a payment of Dkr 70 million until 1982 so that this sum became effectively, as Mr. Gideon explained, subordinatedcapital.  EKR was providing a guarantee for construction finance of up to Dkr 225 million subject to Ministry approval.  To helpin obtaining that approval, the yard asked WMI to pay the 10% due on delivery on the anticipated delivery dates even if deliveryof the two hulls, 881 and 884, was delayed.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.18" class="para" id="p6.5.18">6.5.18</a> On 10th July, BW asked the Ministry to request EKR to provide guarantees of Dkr 225 million for the Yard.  Their letter said EKR,as well as the steel supplier and other creditors, would be fully repaid after five ships were built.  The shares in the yard werepledged to EKR.  The yard would report periodically to EKR on its programme and keep EKR informed of any circumstances which mightincrease EKRâs risk.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.19" class="para" id="p6.5.19">6.5.19</a> On 21st July, the Ministry wrote to both BW and the Fund.  It asked the Fund to disburse loans to finance building in instalmentsof one-eighth each.  In the event, one-sixth instalments were advanced, which assisted the yardâs cash flow.  The Ministry alsoadvised BW it had asked EKR to give a Dkr 225 million comprehensive guarantee to finance construction.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.20" class="para" id="p6.5.20">6.5.20</a> In November 1980, BW went bankrupt.  However, a report by Hamlet Shipping to Mr. Schroeder recorded inter alia:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe shipyard, a separately run company whose shares are owned by Burmeister &amp; Wain a/s but effectively controlled by the DanishGovernment, will continue to operate independently.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In exchange for export credit for the shipyard, the voting power of the shares was handed over to the government.  This agreementwill last for the duration of the credit, probably until 1983.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The shipyard is therefore protected from a general disposal programme following the parent companyâs bankruptcy.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">But it is probable that the government will want the shipyardâs ownership sorted out sooner rather than later, and would not standin the way if a suitable buyer or buyers can be found.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.5.21" class="para" id="p6.5.21">6.5.21</a> Mr. Gideon agreed that that was a fair statement.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.22" class="para" id="p6.5.22">6.5.22</a> BW seems to have turned the corner.  WMIâs first vessel, 881 Danelock, was delivered in December 1980, an occasion which receivedconsiderable attention in the February 1981 Edition of âThe Motor Shipâ which remarked upon the efficient hull design and neweconomic low-speed diesel engine.  This publication noted that nine similar vessels were then on order.  It also noted that the yardhad successfully established the governmentâs faith in it as one of Copenhagenâs major employers.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.23" class="para" id="p6.5.23">6.5.23</a> WMI were pleased anyway.  It decided to order four more Panamax vessels and, through the yard, applied for loans from the Fund. On 3rd February 1981, Mr. Faergemann prepared a recommendation for the Fundâs Board for four loans based on prices of Dkr 236 million,242 million, 250 million and 258 million and OECD terms.  The paper noted an independent valuation of Dkr 175 million per ship. The proposal was approved by the Board on 19th February.  Building contracts were signed on 24th February.  On 6th March, the yardapplied to EKR for AB/K, DA and DO guarantees.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.24" class="para" id="p6.5.24">6.5.24</a> On 9th March, the Fund advised that the loan was approved subject to EKRâs counter-guarantee.  EKR were, in the meantime, consideringWMIâs request that its own guarantee be substituted for that of a bank for any shortfall between the deposits and the loan.  TheFund indicated it wanted a bank guarantee but that if EKR found a WMI guarantee to be satisfactory the matter would be referred tothe Board.  The Fund followed that letter up on 13th April when it telexed EKR that WMI was enquiring about the counter-guaranteeand whether its own guarantee would be accepted.  Mr. Gideon was unable to explain the delay but thought it might be because of theguarantee framework given to the yard.  He recalled that in the spring of 1981, the maximum had to be raised from Dkr 225 millionto 275 million before being reduced to 255 million.  The proposal for the increase had been put before the Ministry by EKR and theMinistry could have been considering it.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.25" class="para" id="p6.5.25">6.5.25</a> On the following day, however, EKR was able to inform the yard that it was willing to give counter-guarantees for the yard for thenecessary loans on OECD terms, with WMI guarantees for any shortfall in the event of default by any subsidiary taking a loan fromthe Fund.  On 27th April, the Fund formally offered four loans to WMI or subsidiaries against WMI shortfall guarantees.  On the nextday, the Fundâs administration sent a note to the Board advising members that, as EKR had accepted WMIâs guarantee without anyadditional bank guarantee, the administration had proceeded on the basis, as Mr. Gideon agreed, âIf itâs good enough for them,itâs good enough for us.â  However, Mr. Gideon felt the Fund should put a higher requirement on the guarantee than EKR, and wassurprised to see from the tenor of the documents, which he had not seen at the time, that the Fund seemed to have left a decisionon the shortfall guarantees to EKR.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.26" class="para" id="p6.5.26">6.5.26</a> The yard was not yet, however, out of the wood.  On 30th April, the Fund formally advised the yard of the loan offered to WMI andindicated it would give the yard a single-instalment preliminary loan of 25% of the contract price, payable on certification by theyard of appropriate expenditure.  A manuscript note on the letter, however, suggested that the preliminary loans might be payablein six instalments, albeit at a higher rate of interest.  This would assist cash flow.  But the problems persisted.  On 5th June,Mr. Brothers was advised by the yard and other sources of the yardâs precarious position.  The immediate problem was a 20-day delayin the delivery of the latest Panamax which required the yard to seek credit of Dkr 40 million to continue, failing which bankruptcyproceedings might be commenced.  Mr. Gideon, however, asserted that this was a symptom of a more basic problem, namely the under-estimateof start-up costs and lack of productivity by the yard.  On a reading of the contemporary documents, that seems to me to be a fairassessment.  The Danish Government was reluctant to agree to further guarantees, but very quickly a productivity agreement was reachedand the Ministry on 8th June requested EKR to increase the guarantee framework to Dkr 275 million and to authorize the yardâs banksto obtain a mortgage on newbuildings for Dkr 40 million credit.  It was, therefore, as Mr. Gideon agreed, a Ministry decision tokeep the yard going.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.27" class="para" id="p6.5.27">6.5.27</a> It is a matter of dispute whether the yard used the extra Dkr 50 million facility.  Mr. Gideonâs impression was that it was used. On 25th June, however, Mr. Brothers met Mr. Schroeder at the Yard.  In his note, he recorded he had been told the yard had receivedpayment for hull 882 and had not used the credit facility.  Mr. Gideon was rather vague on this.  He explained that he was in a betterposition to know because of almost daily contact with the yard.  In my view, the contemporary document is more likely to be correct.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.28" class="para" id="p6.5.28">6.5.28</a> Mr. Brothers also reported the yard as being under-capitalized, with which Mr. Gideon agreed, because in 1980 and 1981 the yardâsdeficit exceeded its equity.  It was, according to Mr. Gideon, the subordinated loan from the steel supplier that kept the yard going. Mr. Gideon also accepted that, in July 1981, a 3-week delay in delivery could potentially have caused disaster.  He emphasised thatthe yard depended upon production for money.</p>    <p><a name="p6.5.29" class="para" id="p6.5.29">6.5.29</a> From here on, the yard seems to have turned the corner.  There was apparently no further alarm.  At the end of 1981, the yardâsloss for 1980/81 was Dkr 150 million.  At the end of 1982, it recorded a profit of Dkr 88 million and had assets of Dkr 47 millionin excess of liabilities.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="6.6">6.6    ADS and negotiations</a></p>    <p><a name="p6.6.1" class="para" id="p6.6.1">6.6.1</a> In January 1983, the Fund became aware, albeit unofficially, that WMI was in difficulty.  An approach from Mr. Brothers was thereforenot unexpected.  Between 22nd and 24th February, Mr. Edelmann went to the BW yard to see Mr. Brothers.  His general recollectionwas that Mr. Brothers indicated that WMI and the shipping arm of the Group were going to face a liquidity crisis although not immediately. The problem, however, could be solved if all bankers, including ADS, made a contribution.  A moratorium was being sought.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.2" class="para" id="p6.6.2">6.6.2</a> Following the meeting, Mr. Edelmann received on 25th February a telex from Mr. Brothers confirming that he was approaching bankersfor refinancing under which only interest would be payable until conditions improved.  Mr. Brothers said that a moratorium on paymentson Rangelock and Marilock were vital if WMI was to take delivery of Sealock on the basis of the original US$ loan from MMB.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.3" class="para" id="p6.6.3">6.6.3</a> By letter dated 28th February, on WM note paper, Mr. Brothers sent Mr. Edelmann a WMI consolidated balance sheet and profit and lossaccount for 1982, together with the draft letter to be sent to WMIâs bankers which indicated that unanimous support was requiredfor a 3 year moratorium.  There should have been a cash flow in relation to lenders secured on existing vessels but a manuscriptnote indicated that it would not be ready until the next day.  The letter indicated that newbuildings were to be dealt with separatelyand that a cash flow would be forwarded in a few days time.  That cash flow was sent to bankers on 18th March.  It is in disputeas to whether it was ever provided to ADS.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.4" class="para" id="p6.6.4">6.6.4</a> Also included with Mr. Brothersâ letter was a graph for a period of ten years based upon the cash flow for secured creditors. It was not exactly an encouraging document.  With a three year moratorium, WMI would go into deficit in mid-1986, a deficit whichbottomed out at US$20 million between 1989 and 1990.  Break even would be reached again in mid-1992.  Without a moratorium, the deficitwould begin in mid-1983 descending to US$60 million by the end of 1989 and recovering to a deficit of $17 million by the end of 1992. In the draft letter Mr. Brothers said âWMI is now facing an immediate cash flow shortfallâ.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.5" class="para" id="p6.6.5">6.6.5</a> By a private letter to Mr. Edelmann on 1st March, Mr. Brothers advised him that the cash flow would be arriving shortly and emphasisedthat it covered existing vessels and was on the basis of a three year moratorium.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.6" class="para" id="p6.6.6">6.6.6</a> On 2nd March, Mr. Brothers wrote to Mr. Edelmann and set out that WMI was seeking a moratorium on two payments in relation to Marilock,one payment in relation to Rangelock and postponement of the first payment on Sealock.  The instalments from the Dkr deposits wereto be released and used to pay MMB.  Mr. Brothers also enclosed a cash flow in relation to Sealock which showed a cumulative deficitof US$8.3 million over a nine year period.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.7" class="para" id="p6.6.7">6.6.7</a> Mr. Edelmann discussed WMIâs request with EKR on 2nd March.  EKR were adamant that the existing Dkr deposits should not be touched. However, in order to help the BW yard, EKR suggested that there might be a period of grace for several years in relation to Sealock,Annalock and Hull 912 and a longer period of repayment.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.8" class="para" id="p6.6.8">6.6.8</a> On 3rd March, Mr. Brothers wrote to Mr. Edelmann with a revised letter to WMIâs bankers and with a valuation of existing vessels. This showed book value of US$145 million, a with charter value of $132 million and charter free value of $100 million.  There wasalso a schedule of loans and guarantees, amounting to US$134 million,.secured on the vessels</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.9" class="para" id="p6.6.9">6.6.9</a> On 4th March, Mr. Edelmann prepared for the Fundâs board a note (App. 5/1) setting out the positions of WMI and EKR and indicatingthat MMB would be unlikely to agree to release of any deposit.  He then pointed out in the note that the EKR proposal was possiblebut would require the authorisation of the Ministry of Industry because the time frame for a normal OECD loan would be exceeded,while the Central Bankâs consent would be necessary because there would be a bigger subsidy than normal.  The note then recorded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe (EKR) indicated that such an emergency situation as the existing one should hopefully receive a favourable treatment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The board is therefore asked to decide whether the Fund can collaborate to such a solution as outlined by the (EKR).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.6.10" class="para" id="p6.6.10">6.6.10</a> On 7th March, the Fundâs board met and discussed WMI (App. 5/15).  Mr. Nielsen presented the note dated 4th March and indicatedthat the long term objective was to arrive at a âpacket solutionâ involving all three hulls.  Concern was expressed about theadditional subsidy that would be involved at the expense of the Central Bank, the breach of OECD rules and whether the WMI Groupmight be in serious difficulties.  It was noted that because of the outlay already incurred in respect of Sealock, WMI might be reluctantto refuse delivery but could cancel the other two hulls with little loss.  In the event, the consensus was that if the Ministry ofIndustry and EKR felt that a packet solution was desirable in order to help the yard and because the Fund would not be at risk, therewas really no reason not to comply with any request from the Ministry or EKR.  Accordingly, the chairmen were authorised if necessaryto make a decision.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.11" class="para" id="p6.6.11">6.6.11</a> Following the meeting, on about 9th March Mr. Edelmann met Mr. Gideon to confirm that EKR would continue to guarantee the loan evenif other securities became insufficient.  He understood that the decision was ultimately a political one to be taken by the Ministryin order to protect employment at the yard which would be in a difficult position if Sealock was not delivered.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.12" class="para" id="p6.6.12">6.6.12</a> Also on 9th March, Mr. Brothers wrote to Mr. Edelmann about Sealock.  He reiterated that the shipping industry was going througha bad time and explained the difficulty over Sealock was cash flow arising from depressed earning rates which were projected to beUS$6,000 in 1983, rising to $10,000 in 1985 as compared with $14,000 for two earlier hulls delivered by the yard in 1980.  Mr. Brotherscontinued that WMI could not fund the cash flow deficit of $10 million on Sealock however far repayment of the loan might be stretchedout if EKR insisted that the deposits were not touched.  He therefore proposed two possible solutions.  Solution A was a moratoriumof three and a half years for the Sealock loan and a revised loan period of 12 years.  The Fund was to have as security the new depositwhich would cover instalments for years four to eight only but with all interest.  This involved releasing cash from the depositsto pay MMB.  The Fund would also have as security amongst other things a second mortgage on the vessel, the value of the equity inwhich would grow as the bank was paid off.  WMI would also give a guarantee in case of any shortfall.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.13" class="para" id="p6.6.13">6.6.13</a> Solution B was a similar moratorium but the bank would keep the deposits as primary security until the market improved when it wouldswap the deposits for a first mortgage on the vessel.  WMI would again give a guarantee.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.14" class="para" id="p6.6.14">6.6.14</a> Mr. Brothers continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âEven if this can be agreed, there is still a shortfall in earnings but it is within manageable proportions.  Furthermore, as anarrangement relating to the provision of a first mortgage on the vessel can be agreed directly between ourselves and DSKF withoutinvolving our bankers, it means we can act very quickly not only to agree on 910 but also 911 and 912.  I understand this to be anessential ingredient to the overall solution.  I attach cash flows to illustrate the effects of those proposals.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Finally, in concluding, I think it is as well to make it clear that Wheelock Marden and Co. Ltd. cannot give any specific guaranteesor other support in respect of individual vessels.  To do so would invite all our creditors to insist on the same treatment.  Youwill appreciate that on the âMarilockâ and âRangelockâ, there are significant cash shortfalls that have to be funded.  Furthermore,interest has to be paid on the loans raised to purchase the Krone deposits for 911 and 912.  Support, if forthcoming, will have tobe by way of cash injection that will go toward improving the liquidity of the group as a whole.  I am sure you can understand thelogic of this.  As far as other assets of WMI are concerned, I have sent you a detailed list of all ships and existing loans.  Althoughour loans are covered, the disastrous effects of the market have considerably reduced all asset values and you will appreciate itwill be difficult to find much in the way of additional security through second mortgages etc. to cover our borrowings from you. We can, however, always explore this avenue if you so wish.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Please forgive this rather long letter but I want you and your colleagues to be absolutely clear over the position here and I alsohope that my comments and suggestions will assist in overcoming these present difficulties.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.6.15" class="para" id="p6.6.15">6.6.15</a> On 15th March, Mr. Edelmann prepared a note for his board (see App. 5/23).  He explained WMIâs proposals and reported that EKRwas prepared to help WMI, had asked the Fund and the yard to participate in negotiations with WMI, and would agree to Solution Aonly if no other course was open to secure delivery of Sealock and thus hulls 911 and 912.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.16" class="para" id="p6.6.16">6.6.16</a> The note then continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âThis solution must be avoided at any cost and subsequently all possible efforts must be made to keep a solution within the followingnegotiation frameworkâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.6.17" class="para" id="p6.6.17">6.6.17</a> That framework was, inter alia, that the moratorium would be for Sealock only while hulls 911 and 912 were to be delivered underunchanged conditions; that any grace period was to be as short as possible while the loan period of eight and a half years was notto be extended, with the deferred repayments becoming due on the final date of that period; that a higher interest rate should bepaid on the deferred instalments; and that WMI should prove it had initiated negotiation for a general moratorium.  It was also notedthat EKR was fully aware of the increased risk being taken but was willing to do so on account of BW.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.18" class="para" id="p6.6.18">6.6.18</a> In the note Mr. Edelmann then summarised the security that would be available to the Fund including both the WMI and EKR guarantees. Finally, Mr. Edelmann advised that the Ministry urged the Fund to participate in a solution within the framework, and asked theboard to decide if the Fund, in co-operation with EKR, should participate in an agreement within the framework prescribed or, ifnecessary, corresponding with the WMI proposal.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.19" class="para" id="p6.6.19">6.6.19</a> On 17th March the board approved the proposed course.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.20" class="para" id="p6.6.20">6.6.20</a> On 22nd and 23rd March, there were meetings in London between Mr. Edelmann and Mr. Faergemann, Mr. Brothers, Mr. Fraser of MMB andthree representatives of BW including Mr. Schroeder.  The problem was to persuade MMB to swap the deposits for a first mortgage onthe vessel as its security for the US$ loan.  MMB wanted release to it of 6 instalments from the deposits which would reduce theloan to an amount more commensurate with the value of the vessel.  The Fund and EKR, however, were only prepared to release fourinstalments which represented approximately a 23% reduction of the Fundâs security.  After two days of discussion, a compromisewas reached on the basis of 5 instalments, subject to MMBâs head office approval.  WM would give MMB a letter of comfort for thesixth instalment.  The Fund also wanted a share of any profits from the vessel after operating costs and to be informed about thestatus of Wheelock companies and the moratorium.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.21" class="para" id="p6.6.21">6.6.21</a> It is at these meetings that Mr. Brothers said he handed over the newbuildings cash flow of 18th March.  It is the ADSâ case thathe did not.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.22" class="para" id="p6.6.22">6.6.22</a> Mr. Faergemann had the impression at these meetings that Mr. Brothers was saying that everyone had to give or contribute a bit andthat the Fund should be as co-operative as all its other bankers, although the extent of the bankersâ co-operation was not knownto the Fund.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.23" class="para" id="p6.6.23">6.6.23</a> On 29th March, Mr. Edelmann prepared a note for the board.  He reported that MMB had agreed to the swap but that, on 28th March,he had been advised from Hong Kong that the WMI Board only agreed the arrangement if there was a corresponding arrangement for hulls911 and 912 and if their delivery was postponed until the market picked up.  He said that the administration took the view that nofurther steps should be taken.  Although not in that note, Mr. Edelmann had also been advised that WM would not give a letter ofcomfort until arrangements for 911 and 912 were worked out.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.24" class="para" id="p6.6.24">6.6.24</a> On 30th March, Mr. Brothers wrote to Mr. Edelmann to confirm the position but reporting that, if the Fund released the six instalments,MMB would not require a letter of comfort and the vessel could be delivered.  The Fund apparently accepted the position and Sealockwas delivered on 7th April.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.25" class="para" id="p6.6.25">6.6.25</a> It appears that at the March meetings it was also agreed to meet again in London in April to discuss the other two hulls.  At allevents, on 18th April, Mr. Schroeder of BW telexed Mr. Brothers to say that Mr. Gideon of EKR insisted on meeting on 21st/22nd Apriland that Mr. Brothers must be present.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.26" class="para" id="p6.6.26">6.6.26</a> The meetings took place and were difficult.  Mr. Brothers wanted a moratorium which Mr. Edelmann was not willing to give.  Further,LBI took a very narrow view and wanted only to ensure that they had sufficient security.  They would not accept US$4.75 million,which the Fund was willing to release from the deposits, as sufficient.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.27" class="para" id="p6.6.27">6.6.27</a> On 23rd May, to try and get things moving, Mr. Brothers telexed Mr. Edelmann.  He set out a number of conditions contained in theloan documents which might delay delivery of the vessels.  He suggested that the banks should agree not to insist on these conditionsif the Fund agreed to defer some payments.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.28" class="para" id="p6.6.28">6.6.28</a> On 30th May, there was a meeting at the yard.  Mr. Edelmann and Mr. Faergemann represented the Fund.  Mr. Brothers gave an accountof WMIâs problems which had by now become the subject of press comment. HKR was considering a three-year commitment to WMI of US$12million.  Any proposal would, however, have to go to its shareholders.  Press reports made plain that considerable shareholder resistancewas to be expected.  Mr. Brothers said he would be trying to get a bank moratorium and find a solution to 911 and 912 with LBI andMidland Bank.  Mr. Edelmann said he was not prepared to offer terms as relaxed as for Sealock.  In the circumstances, he saw no pointin opening new negotiations until after the position of the two banks and HKR was resolved and the WMI annual general meeting hadbeen held.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.29" class="para" id="p6.6.29">6.6.29</a> On 29th July, Mr. Brothers sent Mr. Edelmann a three-year cash flow for the WMI Group which assumed creditors, including the Fundin relation to hulls 911 and 912, accepting rescheduling by a three-year moratorium, but which did not include Spanish newbuildingsor the US$12 million injection âplannedâ by the Group.  This cash flow showed a US$7 million deficit in June 1986.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.30" class="para" id="p6.6.30">6.6.30</a> On 4th August, Mr. Brothers wrote two letters to Mr. Edelmann.  He asked that, in keeping with negotiations with other secured creditorsfor rolling up repayments, the Fund defer the first five repayments which would be put in one balloon at the end of the loan period. In relation to hull 911, he asked for an additional Dkr 5.2 million to cover extras.  Mr. Edelmann replied in a discouraging toneon 10th August, saying he would not put any proposal to the Fundâs Board which did not contain a high degree of certainty of deliveryand, in any event, negotiations with EKR were necessary as ânothing can be done without their approvalâ.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.31" class="para" id="p6.6.31">6.6.31</a> Mr. Brothers replied next day that agreement with the Fund was critical as otherwise the two banks involved, who had indicated awillingness to cooperate, might liquidate the deposits.  After that it was âdoubtful if we could ever recover to back to wherewe are todayâ.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.32" class="para" id="p6.6.32">6.6.32</a> The Board discussed the position on 15th August.  The latest cash flow, referred to in Mr Brothersâ letter, was noted althoughcopies had not been provided for members of the board.  It was also explained that BW had purchased material and would suffer substantialloss if delivery did not take place.  At a further meeting on 3rd October it was concluded that any assistance for WMI should comefrom its parent.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.33" class="para" id="p6.6.33">6.6.33</a> Meanwhile, on 24th September, Mr. Brothers telexed Mr. Edelmann that WM had agreed to provide WMI with a secured credit facilityof US$4 million for two years.  On 4th October, Mr. Edelmann and Mr. Faergemann met Mr. Brothers and representatives of BW and LBI. Mr. Brothers explained that WMI was seeking to sell older tonnage.  He said WM had received a report that WMI was worth saving andhad granted the US$4 million facility, secured by a pledge of WWW shares which were also subject to a pledge in respect of WMâsguarantee on Rangelock.  He said WMI were seeking a deferment of four or five payments on the two hulls.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.34" class="para" id="p6.6.34">6.6.34</a> Such deferment would have been worth about US$10 million.  Mr. Edelmann was astonished, pointing out that the Fund had already contributed$5.8 million to liquidity on Sealock while WMIâs parent was only prepared to assist with $4 million and even that was secured. He said, however, out of consideration for BW, the Fund was prepared to help.  A proposal was made that, in return for the two banksswapping the deposits for a first mortgage on the vessels on delivery, the Fund would finance interest accrued to that date whichwould be $4.75 million.  Although Mr. Brothers offered a second mortgage on the Fenlock as security the Fund preferred a second pledgeof WWW shares as appearing more valuable.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.35" class="para" id="p6.6.35">6.6.35</a> The Board considered the proposal on 8th November.  (App. 5/27) Concern was expressed about taking risks when the Fund was already100% secured by way of the deposit.  However, as Mr. Edelmann pointed out, whatever happened, the Fund would not be at risk becauseof EKRâs ultimate guarantee.  Some members felt the Board should distance itself from any decision by EKR to take a risk and wishedto emphasise that if EKR independently decided something the Fund would co-operate.  It was concluded that the Fund should contributeto a solution and, in principle, that would be assistance amounting to approximately US$4 million for both vessels together.  Thatassistance would not, however, be automatically increased if the parent increased its own support.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.36" class="para" id="p6.6.36">6.6.36</a> On 10th November, Mr. Edelmann met Mr. Brothers and representatives of BW.  He made it plain that the maximum support would be $4.75million.  Eventually, it was agreed that this amount should be focused on Annalock and used to reduce the LBI loan, while hull 912should, if possible, be sold by WMI.  The idea was that BW should acquire all the shares in the owner for $1.  The Board consideredthe proposal on 14th December and agreed that the administration should try to implement it so that it would be possible to negotiatean overall solution to BWâs problems.</p>    <p><a name="p6.6.37" class="para" id="p6.6.37">6.6.37</a> Between 20th and 23rd December, all parties met in London.  LBI wanted a solution for Annalock that was not dependent on hull 912. The Fund wanted a package for both.  The Fundâs position was that the $4.75 million maximum assistance was conditional on LBIswapping deposits for a mortgage on the vessel, and upon a pledge by WMI of WWW shares.  Mr. Edelmann said the only reason for non-deliverywould be the bankruptcy of WMI.

They discussed WMIâs requestfor assistance.  It was at this meeting that Mr. Gideon said EKR were not willing to move in relation to ships already deliveredbut suggested the possible framework for a package for hulls 910, 911 and 912.  Mr. Gideon prepared a note setting out the positionfor an extraordinary meeting of the Council of EKR on 11th March.  The note stated that if the loan period was extended to 12 years,EKR would have an unsecured risk of Dkr 88 million after the 8th year which would be secured by a mortgage on the ship which theFund had had valued at US$17 million.  Further, if WMI did not take delivery of hull 910, EKR was at risk in the sum of Dkr 20 millionon the pre-delivery loan while the yard itself would face a loss of Dkr 60 million.  At the meeting, Mr. Gideon provided the Councilwith further information:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â- the operating profit in Wheelock Maritime International Ltd. had been DKK 140 million in 1981 and aprox.

Mr. Gideon pointed out that EKR was in an unusual situation.  Normally, its securitywould lie in the ship.  Here, the loan had been fully secured by the deposits, so EKR was not afraid to give away a little thus puttingitself in a position that was normal for EKR, namely accepting a possible risk.  That was a risk that other guarantors would notnormally accept because of the length of the loan period which could run up to seven years or more.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.7" class="para" id="p6.7.7">6.7.7</a> Mr. Gideon would not accept that the Fund was indifferent to the negotiations because it always had the EKR counter-guarantee tofall back on.  In cross-examination, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWell, they had the guarantee, because of some sort of agreement between the Government and the Fund.  It was a requirement in theirassociations - statute of associations - that they should have a guarantee, but I am fully convinced at that time and today thatthe Fund at all times should behave as though they did not have that counter-guarantee.  They were the shipping experts.  They couldnot rely solely that the Government would guarantee their bonds and, as a consequence of this, they make one error after the other,so the Government had to make up and pay the claims to the Ship Credit Fund.  I do not think the Government would have been verymuch amused by this.  I think it was expected by the Fund that they would treat each case as though they did not have the counter-guarantee,but you are right, they had the counter-guarantee and they had full security, but that is not to say that they would not act seriouslyand honestly in this case and give us their best advice in the EKR.  They were expected to do that.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.7.8" class="para" id="p6.7.8">6.7.8</a> He was, however, rather confounded by the minutes of the meeting of the Fundâs Board on 8th November 1983 (App. 5/27) which recorded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMr. K. ENGELL JENSEN, Director, explained that the shipyard would be able to bear such a loss but that it should be the task ofother enterprises to assist in this situation.  One could sympathise with the unfortunate fact that the Danish Export Credit Councilshould suffer a heavy loss, but the difficulty of the situation was that the Danish Export Credit Council considered the positionsadopted by the Fundâs Board of Directors as deriving from expertise in the field even though the basis for the debate among theBoard members has been that the commitment was backed up by an export credit guarantee.  It was therefore important that the Shipcredit Fund of Denmark should adopt a clear position.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The Chairman found that the Danish Export Credit Council abused the Ship Credit Fund of Denmark with such reasoning.  Furthermore,it was unreasonable that apart from having undertaken to manage a subsidy scheme, the Ship Credit Fund of Denmark should also givefurther assistance.  As far as the authority of the Board was concerned, the Chairman was of the opinion that the Board members couldnot be held personally responsible.  The Fundâs practice has always been that, if the Danish Export Credit Council decides somethingindependently, the Ship Credit Fund of Denmark shall have no objection to cooperating, and this practice would have to be made quiteclear to the Danish Export Credit Council.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.7.9" class="para" id="p6.7.9">6.7.9</a> Mr. Gideon could only say that it was his opinion at the time and could not reconcile the Fundâs apparent attitude.  He said that,before delivery of the ship, the Fund was not at risk.  After delivery, the Fund had to make a decision, the Fund was independentof EKR, and EKR and the Fund would each make their own decisions.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.10" class="para" id="p6.7.10">6.7.10</a> As far as Mr. Gideon and EKR were concerned, Mr. Gideonâs position was this.  In relation to DA risks, the credit worthiness ofthe buyer had to be looked at.  With reference to the WMI graph (App. 2/8) showing the position in relation to secured creditors,which had been supplied by Mr. Brothers, Mr. Gideon said the upper curve was the one to focus on because EKR knew WMI intended tonegotiate a moratorium.  That curve showed a short-term problem, as opposed to a permanent problem, in the sense that after someyears break-even was reached.  However, he did not expect Mr. Brothers simply to put his feet up after arranging the moratorium. He thought that Mr. Brothers would work hard (as indeed he did), sell ships, arrange finance and keep WMI going.  Even the lowercurve on that graph, showing the position without a moratorium, began to come up again and would probably break even eventually. In essence, Mr. Gideonâs position was that there was a cash flow and not an asset problem on the part of WMI.  As the market improved,so would WMIâs assets.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.11" class="para" id="p6.7.11">6.7.11</a> Mr. Gideon and EKR appreciated the problems relating to Sealock.  Mr. Gideon said WMI wanted this ship to be self-financing becauseotherwise how could the company take it.  So he assumed that, with the help sought by WMI, it would be self-financing and that thesame would apply to hulls 911 and 912.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.12" class="para" id="p6.7.12">6.7.12</a> Mr. Gideon accepted that, in order to see the overall position, EKR would need cash flows for newbuildings and unsecured creditors. However, whether or not a cash flow for newbuildings would show an outflow rather than a profit, he did not have the knowledge tosay.  He said he and EKR were not experts on ships.  Rather, they relied on the Fund for an assessment of ships and shipping.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.13" class="para" id="p6.7.13">6.7.13</a> He acknowledged that WMIâs accounts had used book values for ships.  He acknowledged that the market had declined since the accountshad been drawn up.  He was not prepared to accept, however, that there had been any dramatic change in the values of the ships. He took the use of book values as a sign that WMI intended to continue trading and was encouraged by the fact that he and EKR hadnot been told anything negative about WMI.  He just thought that the shipping business was going through the usual cycle in the market.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.14" class="para" id="p6.7.14">6.7.14</a> Mr. Gideon did accept that, in spite of the Danish view that the WM Group would be behind WMI, it was clear from Mr. Brothersâletter of 9th March 1983 that support was by no means certain.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.15" class="para" id="p6.7.15">6.7.15</a> It was in such circumstances that EKR were prepared to accept a risk, both in its own interests given its exposure under the counter-guarantees;and to help the yard in what was described as an âemergencyâ situation.  It was an âemergencyâ situation in the sense thatthe yard would be taken by surprise and have a cash flow problem if WMI did not take delivery of Sealock and the other hulls.  Help,therefore, was the only proper course to follow if a crisis was to be avoided.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.16" class="para" id="p6.7.16">6.7.16</a> Negotiations with Mr. Brothers and MMB followed.  There is some dispute as to who was to be responsible for these negotiations. According to Mr Edelmannâs note of 15th March 1983 (App. 5/23), it was EKRâs board that decided there should be direct negotiationwith WMI/MMB and asked the Fund to âparticipateâ.  It is tolerably clear, however, from the documents and other evidence thatthe âDanish sideâ was represented by Mr. Edelmann.  Mr. Gideon said, and I accept, that he attended the meetings in London onlyto familiarize himself with the participants and the general picture.  It was only with some reluctance that he conceded that Mr.Edelmann consulted him from time to time.  He said that it was not really necessary for such consultation because Mr. Edelmann knewthe framework for negotiation which had been laid down by the Council of EKR.  He was adamant that he and EKR had no other role toplay.  He said that the question of any additional subsidy, if indeed there was such additional subsidy, arising from the extendedperiod for repayment of the loan and the possible breach of OECD rules arising from the extension, was for the Fund to consider inconjunction with the Ministry.  They were not matters of concern to EKR which would simply accept the risk and give a counter-guarantee,if they otherwise considered the risk an acceptable one, once the Ministry had indicated the legality of the position.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.17" class="para" id="p6.7.17">6.7.17</a> In carrying out these negotiations, Mr. Gideon expected the Fund to behave as experts in shipping and not look at the counter-guarantee. Rather, the Fund would do its utmost to ensure that every loan to be made did not result in a claim.  He was of the view that, ifthe Fund simply left shipping business to EKR so that EKR incurred one claim after another, the arrangement with the government wouldend immediately.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.18" class="para" id="p6.7.18">6.7.18</a> In his original statement at para. 26, Mr. Gideon said this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI understand that the defendants allege that the motive for entering into the loan on relaxed terms was to ensure delivery of thevessel, to avoid loss to the B&amp;W Yard, and to avoid a possible event of default under the loan agreement between the Fund andB&amp;W.  This is misleading.  The Fund at all times held the guarantee of EKR and therefore would not have suffered had the Yardbeen unable to repay the Fundâs loan (although of course EKR would have suffered a loss).  I do not believe, however, that anysuch loss would have occurred.  The vessels were worth about US$15 million on the open market at the time between willing buyer andwilling seller.  Discussions had been entered into with two large Danish ship-owning concerns (the Torm and A P MÃller Groups). We were naturally concerned to protect the position of the B&amp;W Yard, but I believe a sale at about US$15 million would havebeen quite sufficient to enable the Yard to repay the Fundâs loan, and the ensure the future of the Yard.  There was no reasonwhy we should wish, effectively, to give the vessels away to a bankrupt company with no real prospect of repaying the loans madeto it.  We would not have done so.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.7.19" class="para" id="p6.7.19">6.7.19</a> In cross-examination, Mr. Gideon clarified two matters.  He agreed it was the motive at the time but that was in the light of EKRâsexpectation that WMI would be in existence in eight yearsâ time.  He repeated that he and EKR had not been told anything negativeabout WMI, and assumed the information received was correct.  EKR would not have agreed to delivery if WMI had said that it wouldgo into liquidation.  EKR decided simply to maintain the counter-guarantee in spite of the changed circumstances.  At para. 43 ofhis supplemental statement, Mr. Gideon said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âEKR was influenced by a desire to assist B&amp;W, but not at any price.  It was not trying to avoid the financial consequencesto itself of non-delivery.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.7.20" class="para" id="p6.7.20">6.7.20 Later, in para. 46, he said:</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThere is no doubt in my mind that if someone seriously suggested that there was a significant prospect of the immediate liquidationof WMI, we would have broken off any further negotiations with WMI there and then - there would have been nothing left to discuss. Who in their right mind would have continued to negotiate with WMI if the prospects were that assets transferred to WMI would almostcertainly within a short period become subject of a liquidation.  I am also of the view that had WMI or any of its representativesmade any such statements, it would effectively have placed itself in a default situation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.7.21" class="para" id="p6.7.21">6.7.21</a> Second, Mr. Gideon agreed that, in his note for the EKR Council meeting of 11th March, he had outlined the possible risk to EKR,that is a loss of Dkr 20 million if Sealock was not delivered or Dkr 88 million in eight yearsâ time if WMI defaulted on the loan. He said that was the maximum loss but not one which EKR would necessarily end up with.  But he also acknowledged that if the yardstopped trading, EKR was open to loss on the other hulls.  He explained, however, that as far as EKR was concerned, WMI was anxiousto obtain the vessels.  Although there was no guarantee that WMI would be alive in eight yearsâ time, it was a risk EKR was preparedto run as against a certain loss if Sealock was not delivered.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.22" class="para" id="p6.7.22">6.7.22</a> The size of any loss to EKR would depend upon the disposal of any ship not delivered to the contracted buyer.  Mr. Gideon said therewould not necessarily be a forced sale.  As the largest creditor of the yard, EKR might be prepared to isolate the ship, pendingsale at a normal price, in order to avoid a bigger loss.  In the meantime, the yard could borrow up to the maximum as EKR was securedby the mortgage on the ship and borrowing on it would not be counted.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.23" class="para" id="p6.7.23">6.7.23</a> The March meetings ended in agreement for the Sealock on the basis of the release of five instalments from the deposits.  Subsequently,WMIâs Board refused approval.  Mr. Gideon made a note on 28th March of this position.  He said, and I accept, that it was a filenote which he later amended to include the subsequent agreement to deliver Sealock on the basis of six instalments.  This was notreported to the Council until October.  Mr. Gideon explained that it was not necessary to do so because the agreement was withinthe framework laid down by the Council.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.24" class="para" id="p6.7.24">6.7.24</a> At Mr. Gideonâs request, BW prepared, on 15th April 1983, calculations of possible losses to EKR and the yard.  Mr. Gideon acceptedthe principles involved in these calculations but not the actual figures.  There appears to be some justification for that becauseon 24th May modified calculations were made at Mr. Gideonâs request and even these contained one glaring error.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.25" class="para" id="p6.7.25">6.7.25</a> Mr. Gideonâs disagreement with the figures was on the basis that the yardâs indirect costs were too high and the profit too low. It was, however, an indication.  Mr. Gideon simply said to himself : âThatâs it, we canât do any more.  Leave it until a claimcomes upâ.  At that stage, EKR would instruct accountants to look into the yardâs accounts.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.26" class="para" id="p6.7.26">6.7.26</a> As far as indirect or fixed costs were concerned, Mr. Gideon complained that the yard had added depreciation and interest which wasnot acceptable to EKR.  It was pointed out that, in the modified calculations, these items appeared to have been eliminated.  Mr.Gideon asserted, however, that EKR had not accepted figures which EKR would want to calculate for themselves.  He said he would stickby the loss of Dkr 20 million on AB/K which he had included in his note for the extraordinary meeting of the Council on 11th March.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.27" class="para" id="p6.7.27">6.7.27</a> Under EKR guarantees, the yardâs costs, both direct and indirect, were guaranteed but not its profits.  It follows, therefore,that the yard would seek to maximize costs and minimize profit.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.28" class="para" id="p6.7.28">6.7.28</a> The yardâs calculations were prepared in respect of Annalock and to meet three different situations.  For each situation, the calculationswere made for a sale : (1) on a cash basis; (2) with an OECD loan; and (3) with a soft Danish loan.

Mr. Gideon said he had no recollection about EKR not accepting a substitute for Mr. Brothers. He said the Ministry was not involved in the decision making (except in so far as OECD rules required) and thought Mr. Schroederperhaps meant the EKR Council.  This seems to be confirmed by a note of the meetings dated 16th June made by Mr. Schroeder in whichhe recorded that Mr. Gideon was demanding a moratorium proposal within 14 days for submission to the Fundâs Board and to the Council. The meetings of course ended in stalemate.</p>    <p><a name="p6.7.33" class="para" id="p6.7.33">6.7.33</a> Negotiations, in which Mr. Gideon was not involved although he was kept informed by Mr. Edelmann, continued in a desultory manneruntil October when agreement was reached on a package for hulls 911 and 912.  The Fund reported to EKR by letter dated 6th Octoberin which, after explaining the swap, it recorded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSimultaneously the banks/WMI (provided that WMI has not gone bankrupt) commit themselves to take delivery of the ships.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.7.34" class="para" id="p6.7.34">6.7.34</a> Mr. Gideon prepared a note for a meeting of the Council on 28th October.  He set out the Fundâs letter in full and continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<u>Remark:  from the Secretariat</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">When the negotiations concerning the delivery of newbuilding n<sup>o</sup> 910 were taking place, EKR was in a weak bargaining position.  The ship was ready to be delivered and failure by the buyer to takeover the ship would immediately have created a serious liquidity crisis for B&amp;W.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The Secretariat therefore exerted pressure to set up the guarantee that the buyer/banks would take over n<sup>o</sup> 911 and 912 respectively in March and June 1984.  For both contracts a down-payment of 10% has been made.  The last 10% are to bepaid approx. 3 months before delivery of the ship upon its coming out of dock.  A final solution to the problem of take-over of the2 ships must be found at this point at the latest, seeing that otherwise the banks will probably not be inclined to further increasetheir engagements.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">If no solution is found and the 10% payments are not made, B&amp;W has made it a condition in its contract for building n<sup>o</sup> 915 that this shipowner will instead take over in that case newbuilding 911 or 912.  B&amp;Wâs risk is thus reduced to 1 ship andliquidity problems will become correspondingly easier to solve, and there will be 3 months to find a solution to this. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">If a solution is found, such as proposed by the Ship Credit Fund, the only risk will be whether WMI is still âin existenceâ atthe time of delivery of the ships.  EKR is already running this risk with its production time guarantee.  B&amp;W will have furtherreceived about DKK 50 million per ship in advance.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The best solution would be of course that the buyer takes over the ships on the agreed payment and lending terms and conditions. If EKR was not concurrently running a risk with the production-time guarantee and the pre-financing loans, it might be tempting toawait the completion of the ships.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The second-best solution is the one proposed by the Ship Credit Fund, combined with a third-party agreement as outlined.  The risktaken by EKR thereby must be deemed lower than the risk already incurred by EKR due to the production-time guarantees and the suretiesfor the pre-financing loans.  Moreover EKRâs payment commitment extends over 8Â½ years with the possibility also that WMI repaysthe loans in the future.  Finally it should not be forgotten that, with its grant of guarantee/surety in connection with the deliveryof a total of 7 ships, EKR incurs with B&amp;W alone a risk of at least DKK100 million on a selling price of about DKK1.5 billion.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.7.35" class="para" id="p6.7.35">6.7.35</a> The minutes of that meeting (in which names of some Council members have been edited out) recorded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<u>Gideon</u> informed [the Council] of the financing of the 5th vessel (new building no. 910) from B&amp;W to Wheelock Maritime InternationalLimited, Hong Kong, and about the background for the request from the owners for concessions in the agreed payment and loan termsfor the take over of new building no. 911 and no. 912.  The solution referred to at the bottom of page 3 of the note could be recommendedif the agreement at the same time was accompanied by a binding obligation from the financial institutions involved that deliverycan take place.  The assessment of the agreement had to include the advantages the exporter achieves and that EKR does not assumeany risk which is not already covered as well as [the fact] that it was only a case of approximately US$2 million for each of thetwo newbuildings.  Harmonisation of EKRâs accommodation in accordance with the size of the capital injection from WMIâs parentcompany is being sought.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[Blank] found that the proposed second best solution was almost as good as the latter.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[Blank] asked whether the first 6 instalments in connection with new building no. 910 and the suggested re-financing of interest onnewbuildings no. 911 and 912 were to be released from the deposits and whether the securities after delivery consisted only of thedeposits.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><u>Gideon</u> replied in the affirmative to the first question and explained that EKR also has a secondary mortgage over the vessels, but thatduring the production period, which means up until delivery can have taken place, there is no security as a starting point.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[Blank] assessed the ownersâ situation pessimistically, but thought that the second best solution referred to was the best obtainablein the given circumstances.  He thought it necessary that in similar transactions where an owner might be thought to be pulling out,in future it ought to be ensured that the Ship Credit Fund held a pledge from the outset over the deposits provided.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><u>Richnagel</u> stated that, in connection with contracts with bonafide owners, EKR had previously been satisfied with usual prepayment without deposit,and that it could hardly be regarded as a reduction of the security that a deposit was provided.  Attention should be given in futureto the possibility of already establishing a pledge over the deposits provided at the time the deposits were established.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><u>Gideon</u> noted in addition that in connection with new building no. 914 B&amp;W had been given a pledge over the deposit.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[Blank] asked about the market value of the vessels.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><u>Gideon</u> estimated that the market value was approximately US$15 million.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[Blank] subsequently recorded agreement on the proposed second-best solution.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.7.36" class="para" id="p6.7.36">6.7.36</a> After agreement was reached in London in December 1983, an agreement which EKR accepted because Mr. Gideon believed the arrangementwas within terms previously accepted by the Council, Mr. Gideon briefed the Council about that agreement at its meeting on 3rd February1984.  Thereafter, EKR appears to have played no further part in events leading up to delivery of Annalock on 22nd March.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="6.8">6.8    Defendantsâ submission</a></p>    <p><a name="p6.8.1" class="para" id="p6.8.1">6.8.1</a> The submission ran thus.  Even assuming representations were made and were passed to ADSâ Board, the decision-making authoritywithin ADS, no decisions were in fact made by the Board which was content to accept EKRâs guarantee and therefore simply deferredto EKR.  In turn, EKR made its decisions on the basis partly of a political need to assist BW and partly of minimising the immediateand unavoidable losses EKR would incur if the vessels were not delivered to WMI.  It was also suggested that it was in fact the normfor the Fund to follow EKRâs decisions.  The foundation for the submission was in two parts: one, the <u>inference</u> to be drawn from ADSâ attitude to financial information or a lack of it; two, the <u>evidence showing expressly</u> that ADS relied on EKRâs decision.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="6.9">6.9    INFERENCE</a></p>    <p class="heading"><u>Sealock</u></p>    <p><a name="p6.9.1" class="para" id="p6.9.1">6.9.1</a> By the time the revised arrangements were agreed, ADS had considerable information available to it.  It was accepted by ADSâ witnessesthat the ADS administration knew of the depressed state of the shipping market and the detrimental effect this had had on the valueof ships.  It also knew of WMIâs newbuildings, that these had been ordered at the top of or in a buoyant market and that this,combined with the depressed market, had created WMIâs financial difficulties.  ADS had also received WMIâs draft accounts for1982, schedules of book and market values of its existing vessels and a 10-year cash flow for secured creditors, i.e. existing vessels(App. 2/9).  ADS was aware of the limitation of that cash flow.  It was emphasised by Mr. Brothers.  ADS had also received a cashflow projection for Sealock which showed a deficit of US$10 million after 5 years if MMB declined to provide a moratorium.  Evenwith a moratorium, Sealock was still not self-financing or cash neutral.</p>    <p><a name="p6.9.2" class="para" id="p6.9.2">6.9.2</a> ADS did not have, as I find (para. <a>6.13.45</a>), the 18th March cash flow relating to newbuildings and unsecured creditors nor its graph (App. 2/13) which had been promised byMr. Brothers in his letter of 28th February but which thereafter disappeared from ADSâ view.</p>    <p><a name="p6.9.3" class="para" id="p6.9.3">6.9.3</a> It was further accepted by Mr. Faergemann and Mr. Nielsen that any newbuildings cash flow would have to be read cumulatively withthe cash flow for secured creditors.  It was accepted by Mr. Faergemann that any deficit projected for Sealock was likely to be substantiallysimilar for Annalock and 912 and that there would be further significant deficits for other newbuildings.  It would therefore havebeen possible for the Administration to calculate for itself, albeit in rough terms, the size of WMIâs deficit.  The result wouldhave been alarming.</p>    <p><a name="p6.9.4" class="para" id="p6.9.4">6.9.4</a> ADS also knew that the 3-year moratorium, which was an important feature of WMIâs plans, had not been arranged.</p>    <p><a name="p6.9.5" class="para" id="p6.9.5">6.9.5</a> In spite of Mr. Brothersâ promise of a cash flow for newbuildings, and in spite of his repeated offers in March and April 1983to provide further information, ADS did not ask for the cash flow or any further significant information; nor did it complain aboutthe quality or quantity of information provided, at least not in writing.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Annalock</u></p>    <p><a name="p6.9.6" class="para" id="p6.9.6">6.9.6</a> When agreement to revise the financial arrangements was reached in London in December 1983, in addition to its existing knowledgeADS had become aware of the secured US$4 million facility and that the 3-year moratorium was no longer being pursued.  Again, nofurther information seems to have been sought.  The defendants also emphasised that cash flows recently sent to ADS by WMI were notplaced before its Board on 9th August 1983.</p>    <p><a name="p6.9.7" class="para" id="p6.9.7">6.9.7</a> On that basis, the defendants submitted that ADS was not misled because it knew exactly the ambit of all documents it had receivedand either was satisfied with the information it had, or had little interest in receiving any more because it was content to relyon its guarantee from EKR.  In turn, EKR agreed to the revisions prompted by considerations of its own.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="6.10">6.10    EXPRESS EVIDENCE</a></p>    <p><a name="p6.10.1" class="para" id="p6.10.1">6.10.1</a> According to the defendants, ADSâ deference to EKR was apparent from the beginning.  On 9th March 1981, <u>ADS</u> explained to WMI the delay in approving the loan applications (para. <a>6.5.24</a>).  It also said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âPresently, our position is that we will demand a bank guarantee for the mentioned shortfall, but if the Export Credit Council considersthe guarantee of Wheelock Maritime International Ltd. as satisfactory, we shall in due course put the question before our board.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.10.2" class="para" id="p6.10.2">6.10.2</a> That deference to EKR, say the defendants, was understandable  because ADS would be fully secured by EKR against any risk of lossapart from the extra 5% interest to be charged on the deferred instalments and that, if recovered, was to be paid to the Danish CentralBank.</p>    <p><a name="p6.10.3" class="para" id="p6.10.3">6.10.3</a> ADS' deference to EKR was confirmed voluntarily by Mr. Lyngsie, who is now senior vice-president of the management of the Fund andwho has day-to-day responsibility for management of the loan department.  In his witness statement at para. 24, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe principal function of the Fund is to finance Danish built ships for Danish and foreign owners.  In some cases the Fund leftit up to EKR to evaluate whether or not the Fund should take the risk and grant the Loan.

Mr. Edelmannâs note dated 4th March 1983 for the Board asked it to decide ifit could âcollaborateâ with EKR (para. <a>6.6.9</a>).  At the Boardâs meeting on 7th March (App. 5/15) there are statements about complying with a request or appeal from the Ministryof Industry and EKR, about not obstructing EKR, and (by Mr. Edelmann) that as ADS incurred no risk âa decision would actually haveto be made on the risks incurred by [BW] and the Ministry of Industry/EKRâ.</p>    <p><a name="p6.10.5" class="para" id="p6.10.5">6.10.5</a> Then on about 15th March, Mr. Gideon of EKR wrote to ADS requesting it âto participate ... in the negotiations between... â.</p>    <p><a name="p6.10.6" class="para" id="p6.10.6">6.10.6</a> Mr. Edelmannâs next note dated 15th March for the Board (App. 5/23) set out the negotiating framework prescribed by EKRâs Board.

Mr. Edelmann prepared a note dated 24th October 1983 for the Board in whichhe reported on discussions earlier in the month and said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIf the Fundâs sole interests are considered, it must be maintained that there is no ground for the Board to enter into an agreementwhereby WMI is given assistance and the value of the deposits is diminished.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>However we are talking here about a considerable loss for B&amp;W together with EKR if the banks lose their patience and liquidatethe deposits and/or WMI does not take delivery of the two newbuildings.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.10.8" class="para" id="p6.10.8">6.10.8</a> This note was discussed by the Board on 8th November (App. 5/27).  After a further reference to there being no risk because of EKRâsguarantee and a reference to a possible loss of Dkr40-50 million by BW, there came the passage about the Fund co-operating with anyindependent decision by EKR (para. <a>6.7.8</a>).  Then Mr. Bagger said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â ... it would have to be made clear to the Danish Export Credit Council that in this affair, they acted on their own.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>while Mr. Fogh said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â ... the solution would have to be that the shipyard and the Danish Export Credit Council agreed on which risks should be taken,after which the Ship Credit Fund of Denmark would be asked to take care of the documentation even though the Shipownersâ Associationshould in principle declare themselves to be opponents of this relief measure.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.10.9" class="para" id="p6.10.9">6.10.9</a> Through Mr. Gideon, EKR participated in meetings and negotiations with WMI and the banks in March and April of 1983 and again inMarch 1984 just before Annalock was delivered.

We will leave page 214, but I must suggest to you, Mr Faergemann, that what is being said, and said plainly, in the middleof the page is in essence this:  that EKR considers that the conclusions, the attitudes taken up by the Fund's Board result fromthe Fund's expertise, but the Fund is actually having as the basis of its discussion the fact it is getting an export guarantee,so it will not be at risk.  Is that not the essence of what is being said there?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I think I said before, the essence, as I perceive this paragraph in the document, is that EKR at that time had all the relevantinformation.

He was then asked about a note relating to the WMI transactions prepared by Mr. Faergemann before he leftADS.  In that note, Mr. Faergemann expressed the fear there had been that MMB would not swap security with the Fund so that BW âwouldbe left carrying the can which is why the Fund and EKR did not really have any choiceâ.  Asked if that was a fair appraisal atday 31/33, Mr. Nielsen said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.  Well, we could object to that, but we would be helpful towards the yards, but we could easily object to it.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.

Sorry, I misunderstand you, Mr Nielsen.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  We did not like to take that other line of action, because that would cause a lot of public reaction and so on in this case, andwe still thought that, reminding of the cash flow curve and the hope that something would turn out, that here was a case where wewould and the board would think of considering helping the yard through.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  There was no real alternative to that in that situation, was there?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.

It depends on how much notice you would take.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.

There is a division of functions and duties here.  The EKR had decided on how far they would go according to the OECD rules andall that, with the help and support of the Ministry.

There were a number of proposals from the Fund, but EKR had the very, very strong feeling about not charging their own deposits.

They were closed cases.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  So long --</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I was just on the verge of saying that that meant that if some support should be given to the owner, it could only deal with thoseships that had not been delivered yet.  You could only look forward and not back.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  In general, so long as EKR was prepared, as it was, to give the counter guarantee the shipowner would perform, then there wasnothing to be concerned about as far as the Fund was concerned, was there?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.

At day 31/55:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.   ...  So his advice, really, at that stage, Mr Edelmann's advice, or suggesting it should be kept in mind "as the Fund hasno risk at all, a decision has to be made on the risks of the yard, the Ministry and EKR".  It is really their decisions, their approachwhich should determine the Fund's reaction; that is the substance of his comment, is it not?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I would not say it was so automatically. If we in the Fund and the board make decisions, we have to look at the security, butthat did not mean that we have the right to make any decision on behalf of the EKR saying that we could be irresponsible.  I thinkthat the note here is indicating a number of considerations put forward from the board members - for instance, Mr Fogh's remarksat the top of 91 about the status and the strength of this very large group, and there are other of the bankers that are giving alot of consideration to the basis of the decision, but at the end of the exchange of views, it has been decided - it is based onMr Kristian Edelmann's remarks that it could be viable to make this decision, because the Fund itself was supported by the EKR.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  He is not saying that at all.  He is not saying it is reasonable because the Fund is supported; he is saying the Fund has no risk,and then he goes on to say a decision would actually have to be made on the risks of the shipyard and the Ministry.  He is reallysaying it is their assessment which should determine the situation, is he not?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Their assessment?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  It is their risks, their assessment of the risks which should determine the situation.  If they decide to do this, we should goalong with them; that is the substance of what he is saying, is it not?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.

He also agreed that the initiative for finding a solution came from EKR.  When itwas put that ADS really had no interest in WMIâs cash flows because it had decided to follow EKR, he said:  âI accept that isthe true situationâ.</p>    <p><a name="p6.10.16" class="para" id="p6.10.16">6.10.16</a> The ADS board meeting of 8th November 1983 (App. 5/27) was taken up with Mr. Nielsen.  He was asked about the chairmanâs remarks,at day 32/22:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  ...  It could not be clearer, could it?  He is saying the practice of the Fund has always been if EKR itself decides something,the Fund will go along with it; is that not what he is saying?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  He is saying that, but I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, at the end of Mr Engell-Jensen's remark - "Therefore,it was important for the Ship Credit Fund of Denmark took up a clear attitude" - that I interpret here - I have not seen the actualDanish text - I interpret that we should keep it informed.  As the chairman says, "I would like to draw your attention to the factthat here we are in all actions and all decisions beyond the normal rule.  We are dealing with something that we could not normallydo, because we needed the clearance and acceptance by the EKR due to the relationship to the OECD rules, because we were in a fieldwhere we had no active powers whatsoever to act.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Q.  I accept this was a very unusual situation, I suggested that to you yesterday.  That is not what the chairman is saying.  He issaying in the last sentence not that this is an exceptional case, so here exceptionally we will have to do what EKR decide.  He issaying the practice of the Fund has always been that if EKR shall independently decide something, the Fund shall have no objectionto cooperate.  This is the usual form, is it not?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>A.  But I will not agree that - the practice of the Fund has been that we should, if the Danish Export Credit Council independentlydecides something, which they do in unusual cases outside the normal programme and the normal course of events, then we had to followup.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Q.  Certainly, that does not appear from what he says, does it?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>A.  I would not like to argue with you on that point.  I am just referring to my recollection of the cooperation - kind of cooperationwe had with the EKR.  Within the normal framework we decide on our own.  Beyond that limit, there was a close cooperation and fullcontact and information to EKR, because we were, so to speak, working in another room.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Q.  So, just to get your approach to this clear, Mr Nielsen, are you saying this:  you would not agree with what the chairman is sayinghere that the practice has always been that if EKR independently decides something, the Fund has no objection to cooperate?  Yousay that is only in unusual situations?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>A.  Yes, because otherwise the EKR would not have any cause to come and ask for something.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Q.  In an unusual situation, it is your position what is said here would be correct and that the Fund would then go along with whatEKR decides?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>A.  And wished us to do.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Q.  Yes.  If you were asked to do something by EKR in, for example, this situation --</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>A.  That would have a strong impact on the reaction of the Ship Credit Fund, because we were beyond the limits of our normal rulesand regulations and what our loan - lending terms and conditions allowed us to do, yes, of course.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Q.  Indeed, even on your approach it would go much further than having a strong influence, would it not?  It would then fall withinwhat the chairman says, that if a decision is made by EKR, the Fund would have no objection to cooperate?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>A.  Yes.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.10.17" class="para" id="p6.10.17">6.10.17</a> Mr. Johnson then referred Mr. Nielsen to an ADS board meeting on 14th December 1983, at day 32/31:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  ...  "The board agreed that the administration should try to implement the outlined packet solution so that it will be possibleto negotiate an overall solution of the problems of the shipyard at the beginning of 1984.  Mr Bagger enquired whether the Fund wouldstill be covered by EKR.  Mr Edelmann confirmed this.  Mr Hirsch pointed out that in these matters the Fund only administered theguarantee matters of the EKR."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">That, certainly, even on the limited view which you expressed to my Lord earlier that it was in exceptional matters that EKR madethe decision and the Fund followed - that would certainly be applicable in this case dealing with WMI in the situation which haddeveloped, would it not?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes, but the decision that you are relating to was taken in the process of negotiation and give-and-take and when a final decisionwas reached between the parties, and it seems to me that most of what goes on here is reflecting a sort of concerted action fromvarious parties to find a solution, but no-one in the game could finally go out and make the final decision without having the EKR'ssupport, but it was not dictated by the EKR; it was a concerted action through negotiation and, when that was finalised, then I cansupport that the whole operational thing of keeping track and monitoring the loans and putting up the loan documents was in the handsof the Ship Credit Fund.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  It goes further than that, does it not, Mr Nielsen?  Certainly, in this case, the decision-making was by EKR in liaison with theyard and the Fund, in spite of some murmurs, made it clear, looking at the board meeting minutes as we have seen them, that it wouldagree to what had been fixed upon by EKR, the Ministry, provided that the EKR guarantee remained in force?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes, I agree with you, if I may be allowed to add --</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Certainly.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  -- if the project was acceptable and eatable (sic) to the Fund in the case of the situation.  There have been cases, not in thisone, where the Fund could go and tell the Export Credit Council for this and that reason of precedents, relationships or other ownersand yards, "We are extremely unhappy with this and that element of the solution".  This would be brought to negotiations to overcomethat detail.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.

The situation is this, is it not, that in your statement and in your supplementary statement, from time to time you assert thatif the Fund had known particular facts or alleged facts, then the Fund would have reacted in a certain way - you say that of a numberof matters?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  But the true position is this, is it not, Mr Nielsen, that there is no reason whatever to believe that the Fund would have takenany different course from the course it took; it left the decision, in this case, this exceptional case, to EKR and the Ministryand went along with that decision so long as the counter guarantee was in place and it would have done whatever was known to it,would it not?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Mr Johnson, this is here where I feel that I cannot object to your presentation, because from a strictly legal point of view,you are of course right, but in the atmosphere in the cooperation in day-to-day work, there was a thought of cooperation betweenthe two institutions that were different, because the EKR did not ever approach the final client - that was the ship credit yard. The input came from the Ship Credit Fund to the EKR, and in this process, there was a lot of give-and-take and going back and forwardto find what was accepted and here the Ship Credit Fund has to make its own evaluations as to the chance, probability, of acceptingthe EKR guarantee, and then, at the end of the day, I can come closer to your presentation - at the end of the day, when we havereceived the EKR guarantee, the thing was of course settled and that was the purpose of it.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  As I think you told us earlier this morning, in exceptional cases of this kind which was outside the normal powers of the Fund,the effect of the decision whether or not negotiated terms should be confirmed and resulting in agreement, was a decision which EKRand the Ministry made and the Fund would go along with it, as we have seen in the minutes, provided the counter guarantee was inplace; that is the position, is it not?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes, I agree with you, because when we got stuck and hit our heads against the OECD roof, the Fund, as a decision-maker on itsown, was faced with a problem, because we would endeavour to do something that was illegal in quotation, because we were going beyondour mandate.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  It had to be an EKR/Ministry decision?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It has to be communicated, informed and negotiated and then, at the end of that process, the EKR, in that system, has to considerwhether they could support the Ship Credit Fund.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Its decision, I think one of your board members said - once that decision is made, provided the counter guarantee is in place,we will take care of the documents?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  We would take care of the documents, because EKR never did the documentation.

In para. 85.4 of his witness statement dealing with the meeting inDenmark on 23rd February 1983, Mr. Brothers said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMr. Edelmann said that he would have to discuss the matter with the DSKF Board.  I undertook to provide him with some detailedfinancial information on WMI which he asked for following my return to Hong Kong.  Mr. Edelmann asked me at the meeting to providehim with financial information on WMI to assist him with a presentation to be made by him at a DSKF Board meeting to be held on 7thMarch 1983.  I agreed to do so.  My recollection is that Mr. Edelmannâs request for information was in general terms and he didnot ask for any specific information.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.11.2" class="para" id="p6.11.2">6.11.2</a> Two thing are therefore established immediately.

Mr. Brothers acknowledged that Mr. Edelmann did not tell him to stop the flow becauseit was not wanted.  The cash flow of 18th March apart, the only material ADS did not receive, but the banks did, was the cash flowof 8th February.  True, Mr. Edelmann did not seek it.  But equally it was, by the beginning of March, out of date.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.4" class="para" id="p6.11.4">6.11.4</a> ADS had the cash flow of 3rd March (App. 2/9-12) showing the position in relation to secured creditors and the positions with andwithout a 3-year moratorium.  ADS' witnesses were criticised for focusing on the position with a moratorium which showed a maximumdeficit of US$20 million.  I find that criticism unjustified.  On the basis of the position without a moratorium, projecting a maximumdeficit of US$60 million, it is clear that ADS would not have discussed the matter further.  If any progress was to be made in reachinga mutually acceptable solution, it was necessary to look at what could be achieved.  That was the purpose of producing the cash flowand would have been expected to be of encouragement to ADS.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.5" class="para" id="p6.11.5">6.11.5</a> Absent indications to the contrary and there were none, ADS assumed</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) WM would provide support.  Even without any representation as to WMI being part of a group, that was a fair assumption given theDanish approach to support of ailing subsidiaries (para. <a>6.13.11</a>) and the relatively modest sum which would be required.  As to the amount required, Mr. Chalmers demonstrated that US$10 millioninjected immediately would have been worth almost the required amount by year 6.

It contained informationon or references to</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) the 3-year moratorium;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) WMIâs likely liquidity crisis;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) the cash flow graph for secured creditors;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) the new building programme;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5) Pacnorse, the principal cause of WMIâs losses;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6) WMI's accounts;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(7) ADS' exposure to the WM Group;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(8) support from WM.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.11.7" class="para" id="p6.11.7">6.11.7</a> Because it was not yet ready, there was no reference in that document to the cash flow of 18th March.  Nor is there any referencelater - which is not surprising in view of my finding.  Assuming it was right and appropriate to do so, could ADS have constructedan approximation of that cash flow, as the defendants argued it could?  In my view, ADS could not, apart from concluding that newbuildingswere likely to produce a cash deficit rather than the reverse, have even attempted to estimate the likely position.  There were threemain reasons:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Apart from the BW hulls, ADS had no information about the size, price, financing or charter-hire arrangements.  It certainly hadno idea that no less than 7 newbuildings were due for delivery in 1983.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) ADS did not know any details about individual arrangements for deferral of deliveries, cancellations, moratoria or reductionsin price.</p>        <p>(3) WMIâs purpose in seeking accommodation from ADS, as well as the arrangements mentioned in (2), was to render newbuildings cashneutral as far as possible.  Hence, the Sealock cash flow which was designed to persuade ADS that help was needed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.11.8" class="para" id="p6.11.8">6.11.8</a> Although Mr. Faergemann agreed in cross-examination that he could have done the calculations as postulated by Mr. Johnson, in re-examinationhe explained his position.  He pointed out that he did not have all the necessary information and said that as far as he was concerned,the 18th March cash flow would have caused serious reconsideration and would have been put before the Board.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.9" class="para" id="p6.11.9">6.11.9</a> Mr. Gideon approached the question of newbuildings in a much broader manner.  In the minutes of the EKR meeting of 11th March 1983,Mr. Gideon said that WMI would âneed US$20 million provided that newbuildings not yet delivered - including 910 - can be self-financingâ(para. <a>6.7.2</a>).  He was asked whether he had any reason to assume they would be self-financing and said at day 40/83:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â ... we certainly had the impression that what Wheelock Maritime were seeking with 910 was to make the ship self-financing, otherwisehow could they take delivery of the ship?  So, we thought the same would be the position for 911 and 912.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.11.10" class="para" id="p6.11.10">6.11.10</a> He was pursued about this later at day 42/48</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  Do I take it that, since this proviso was obviously of importance, you discussed with the Fund the question whether there wasgrounds for thinking that the newbuildings would be self-financing?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  No, I do not think so.  How should they know about this?  I think - well, I think we went over this extensively, and, as I justput it, I have no idea of knowing whether the newbuilding would be self-financing.  What I supposed was that, if WMI took on newships, they would be self-financing, because otherwise they could not take them on in the situation they were - so I just say thiscurve covers the situation, even with the new ships taken on, because they are to be self-financing.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.11.11" class="para" id="p6.11.11">6.11.11</a> Mr. Gideon was there referring to the with-moratorium curve on the graph of the cash flow for secured creditors (App. 2/8).  He wasthen taken to the Sealock deficit and was asked at day 42/50:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMR JOHNSON:  Q.  ...  You agreed the figures which shows a very large cumulative deficiency on what it projected for the employmentof the Sealock, so how can you say that you assumed that WMI would only take a ship if it would not lose money on it?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  That was what Mr Brothers explained in his letters, that there was no way in which they could take on 910 unless it was at leastself-financing - they could not take on 910 with a deficit of $10 million, and I just assumed that he would have the same attitudeto any ship he would take on.  Whether or not that would be the case - I cannot see that my assumption contradicts anything, I amsorry.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.11.12" class="para" id="p6.11.12">6.11.12</a> It is correct that there is no evidence Mr. Edelmann asked for the cash flow for newbuildings which he had been promised.  Therewas, however, a high degree of goodwill and trust between WMI and ADS at that time.  It seems to me not unreasonable to infer thatMr. Edelmann anticipated he would get it when ready and anticipated it was unlikely to be too alarming because of what WMI was doingto try and achieve cash neutrality.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.13" class="para" id="p6.11.13">6.11.13</a> Perhaps Mr. Gideon best summed up the position when he was being cross-examined about the graph of the cash flow for secured creditorsand why he regarded the problem shown as short-term.  He said at day 40/39:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.  Well, I do not think that that would be the end of Mr Brothers' work, that he would leave it with the moratorium and do notcare about the rest of it.  I would think that he would work very hard, he would try to sell ships, he would try to arrange for anothersort of financing on his way, try to keep the company going, and he would just not put his feet up at the table and say, "Well, thatis that.  I have just arranged a three-year moratorium.  I do not need to do any more".  I certainly think he worked very hard onthis.  That was his job, was it not, Mr Johnson?â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.11.14" class="para" id="p6.11.14">6.11.14</a> It was Mr. Edelmannâs note dated 4th March which was the basis of the board meeting on 7th March (App. 5/15).  As I have alreadyset out, the Administration initiated proposals for discussion.  At the meeting, Mr. Nielsen spoke to the note and discussion followedwhich included the possibility of obtaining a WM guarantee and covered the financial situation of WMI and the WM Group as a whole. Certainly, there were also references to the Ministry, to EKR and to the absence of risk.  But the conclusion plainly was that,after detailed discussion of that note as well as other factors, the Board was prepared to consider joining in a package deal.  Inmy view, the Board manifestly relied on the information which had been received from WMI.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.15" class="para" id="p6.11.15">6.11.15</a> The ADS scheme was unacceptable to WMI because, unless some of the deposits were released, WMI was still left with a US$10 milliondeficit on Sealock.  WMI replied on 9th March (paras. <a>6.6.12-14</a>) with solutions A and B and an explanation that there could be no WM guarantee.  This letter Mr. Edelmann communicated to his Boardwith his note dated 15th March in which he suggested a grace period and release of deposits and emphasised that WMI must show ithad entered negotiations for a moratorium.  The Board approved that proposal on 17th March.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.16" class="para" id="p6.11.16">6.11.16</a> Thereafter, Sealock was delivered.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.17" class="para" id="p6.11.17">6.11.17</a> The next real piece of information from WMI was on 29th July when Mr. Brothers sought to re-open negotiations on Annalock and 912and sent a cash flow dated 7th July (App. 2/15-16).  Mr. Edelmann rejected the application.  Mr. Faergemann prepared a note dated9th August for the Board in which he enclosed Mr. Brothersâ two letters but not the cash flow.  He simply reported the currentposition.  The Board met and discussed the position on 15th August.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.18" class="para" id="p6.11.18">6.11.18</a> I cannot see why failure by Mr. Faergemann to send the cash flow to the Board shows a lack of interest in financial information. The cash flow which was for 3 years was not alarming, in fact it was the least alarming of all WMIâs cash flows and did not includethe US$12 million investment being contemplated .  There was at that stage no proposal for the ADS Board to consider.  In any event,one member of the Board specifically</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â ... referred to the âcash-flowsâ mentioned in the letters which would have to be known in order to appraise the contents ofthe letters.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.11.19" class="para" id="p6.11.19">6.11.19</a> Another member</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â ... referred to the fact that in its letter of July 29, 1983 Wheelock Maritime International Limited had stated that additionaldecisive information would be available in August 16, 1983, and inquired whether this information had been received.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.11.20" class="para" id="p6.11.20">6.11.20</a> Negotiations resumed on 4th October in Copenhagen.  It is not in dispute that Mr. Brothers provided details of WMIâs financialposition including the Rothschildsâ report that WM was worth saving.  There was discussion about this and about support.  ADS expressedtheir astonishment at the support WM had provided.  Armed with this information, Mr. Edelmann agreed to revise the existing arrangementsbut ADS would not provide more help than WM, wanted security and an exchange of deposits. </p>    <p><a name="p6.11.21" class="para" id="p6.11.21">6.11.21</a> Mr. Faergemann reported to the Board by note dated 24th October.  His report left open whether the Board should decide to help EKRand BW.  The Board met on 8th November (App. 5/27) to discuss the note to which Mr. Nielsen again spoke and on which Mr. Edelmannelaborated.  Following the meeting, ADS pursued the possibility of security by way of the WWW shares and asked for WWWâs accounts.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.22" class="para" id="p6.11.22">6.11.22</a> Against that background, ADS finally agreed to revised arrangements for Annalock.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.23" class="para" id="p6.11.23">6.11.23</a> I am afraid I do not see how it can fairly be said that ADS was not interested in financial information about WMI.  The newbuildingscash flow apart, Mr. Edelmann at all times wanted to be up-to-date on WMIâs position.  In August 1983, he was not prepared to negotiatewith WMI until its position was clarified.  The information he received was passed to the Board. It is true Mr. Edelmann or Mr Faergemanndid not always pass cash flows to the Board.  Mr Faergemann was constrained to agree in cross-examination that he could not remembera cashflow being sent to the board.  Being practical, however, it made sense to pass on the gist of financial information in notesto the Board and provide the detailed documents if requested, as occurred at the meeting on 15th August.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.24" class="para" id="p6.11.24">6.11.24</a> Perhaps Mr. Edelmann can be criticised for not pursuing the newbuildings cash flow.  All the indications, however, were that newbuildingswould essentially be cash neutral so nothing particularly startling therefore was to be expected from such a cash flow.  In my view,this omission does not suggest some lack of interest on the part of Mr. Edelmann or the ADS Board.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.25" class="para" id="p6.11.25">6.11.25</a> I come to the conclusion, without hesitation, that ADS has demonstrated that it was interested and continuously interested in WMIâsfinancial position.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.26" class="para" id="p6.11.26">6.11.26</a> Did ADS nonetheless abdicate responsibility for making a decision in favour of EKR?  It is helpful to remember the Fundâs structureand purpose (para. <a>2.1.2</a> and following).  As the ADS documents show, its Board consisted of businessmen from different areas of commerce.  The members werenot inhibited from expressing their opinions which sometimes conflicted.  They were not appointed to act simply as some sort of conduitbetween an applicant for a loan and EKR.  They would undoubtedly have resigned very quickly if they thought they were some form ofrubber stamp.  Their function plainly was to decide whether or not to grant loans to applicants, each application being decided onits merits.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.27" class="para" id="p6.11.27">6.11.27</a> Equally, it is clear that the Fund worked closely with EKR.  There was good reason for this as Mr. Nielsen took the opportunity toexplain in re-examination, when seeking to clarify the Fundâs âno riskâ position, at day 32/115:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.  I certainly do not want to quarrel with Mr Johnson.  I want to state that Mr Johnson is perfectly right in saying that in lookingat the supplementary guarantee from EKR it looks that there was no risk and so on, but I do not fully accept the following sequencesaying that then we would act more irresponsibly than otherwise.  This is where I have my real problem.  In an attempt to try toexplain why I have difficulties here, I must tell you that, in Denmark, we have a bond market which is the world's largest in relativesize to the number of population and the size of the economy, GNP and so on.  It was developed in 1850 and since then and up untilnow there has been no single loss on this market for any investor due to default.  Of course, there are investment losses when interestgoes up and down and the market quotation changes.  When the Ship Credit Fund was established, it was decided to base it on the bondsystem, because we had this financial tool which was quite unique.  The problem with the Ship Credit Fund was that it was based onsecurity on movable property whereas the rest of the capital market as far as bonds was based on immovable properties.  That tendedto indicate for the investing public that you have a first-class bond in the immovable and a second-class in the movable part ofthe market.  It was a specific  interest to secure that the quality of the Ship Credit Fund's bonds were as high as possible to createan effective demand on these bonds and the tool was to see to it that the big investors were allowed to buy these bonds and the biginvestors were the life pension funds and insurance companies and other of these institutional investors that had strict rules andregulations as to what they could invest in.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">This matter was resolved by trying to make additional security on the Ship Credit Fund's bond issues to make it possible that theywill match the quality of the rest of the market and for that particular reason it was established this supplementary security onthese bonds so an efficient and effective market and demand could be established, meaning that the support - the cost carried byCentral Bank of the support scheme could be lowered as far as possible.  Therefore, all this talk about supplementary securities. This did not mean that the board and the administration did act irresponsibly, of course not.  They were trying to act very responsiblyand, if not for other reasons - you cannot point to just one - the prestige and the members and where they came from led them toconsider not to cause any losses in the way they acted.  I can only refer to the loss track or records of the Ship Credit Fund allthrough the years since its establishment - that has been extremely low, looking at this case aside.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">To this I almost suggest that Mr Johnson said that was because of the security.  To that I would answer then I would suggest you lookat the EKR's loss record towards the Ship Credit Fund, which was equally very low, so there is statistical proof on this basis thatthe Ship Credit Fund was trying to act very carefully and limit the exposure to losses, regardless of the fact that I have to admitthat there was this supplementary security, but the motivation for that supplementary security was inspired in some other considerationon the capital market.  Thank you.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Thank you, Mr Nielsen.  This morning I think in answer to a question from Mr Johnson, you indicated that you wanted to say somethingabout the relationship between the Fund and EKR.  Is that what you had in mind?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  This was something of that sort, yes, because I have been a little bit uneasy that I had only the opportunity to accept the strictlylegal position that there was a security from the EKR and that was the end of that story and this was what I felt rather uneasy about- it was not the end of that story.  Now I have the chance to try to fulfil or to describe the whole picture.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.11.28" class="para" id="p6.11.28">6.11.28</a> Under its rules, the Fund had to have EKRâs guarantee before it could finally approve the loan.  In practice, the Fundâs Boardwould consider a loan application and, if satisfied, approve it subject to EKR providing its counter-guarantee.  EKR would assesswhether or not to accept the risk on the basis of information provided by the Fund and, it seems, would take into account the Fundâsown assessment.  Each, I am satisfied, made an independent decision, albeit influenced at least in part by the other.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.29" class="para" id="p6.11.29">6.11.29</a> I do not, in the circumstances, attach any significance to the fact that initially ADS had to refer to EKR whether or not WMI couldprovide a guarantee, nor to the reference to EKR concerning revision of the arrangements.  Had ADS revised the loan arrangementswithout such reference, EKR could no doubt have disclaimed liability under its guarantee and the members of ADS board would havefaced possible personal consequences.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.30" class="para" id="p6.11.30">6.11.30</a> It is therefore not surprising that Mr. Edelmann went to see Mr. Gideon on 2nd March 1983 when they discussed the problem and possiblesolutions.  These were set out in Mr. Edelmannâs note of 4th March to the Board in which he said, if the Board decided to collaborate,he recommended management being authorised to negotiate with WMI and EKR so as to assist in delivery of the three BW vessels butin such a way that there was a global arrangement with all the banks involved and that security was not impaired.  That basis fornegotiation was important.  I agree with ADS that Mr. Edelmann was anxious not to put ADS at risk.  Mr. Edelmann plainly wanted toensure ADS got its money back by way of its own arrangements not from EKR.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.31" class="para" id="p6.11.31">6.11.31</a> Mr. Edelmannâs note was considered by the Board on 7th March.  At that meeting there was wide-ranging discussion about WMIâsposition; EKR and the Ministry were mentioned, as was the Fundâs risk-free position.  Mr. Fogh even said further support for WMIwas unreasonable.  The Board was clearly sympathetic to EKR, BW and the Ministry and less well-disposed towards WMI.  They were consciousthat whatever happened they were free of risk as long as they had EKRâs counter-guarantee.  On a fair reading of the minutes, however,I am persuaded that the Board did not lose sight of its usual aim, i.e. to avoid calling on EKR.  Were it otherwise I would haveexpected someone unequivocally to have said âletâs leave it to EKRâ.  I would not have expected the chairman to close by askingthe Administration to try and get a guarantee from WM.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.32" class="para" id="p6.11.32">6.11.32</a> After the EKR council meeting on 11th March, Mr. Gideon wrote to ADS on about 15th March requesting it to participate in negotiations. The suggestion by the defendants in cross-examination was that this indicated EKR were taking over direct negotiation with WMI. Mr. Gideon rejected this.  He said negotiations were at all times run by ADS.  I accept that.  There is really no foundation forthe suggestion, particularly when Mr. Gideonâs participation in the meetings on 22nd and 23rd March was confined to attendanceon the 2nd day only during which he made little contribution.  Mr. Edelmann played the principal role and succeeded in negotiatingterms stricter than those EKR would have accepted.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.33" class="para" id="p6.11.33">6.11.33</a> Mr. Edelmannâs note of 15th March for the Board in which he set out EKRâs frameworks for negotiation demonstrated, in my view,ADSâ independence.  Mr. Edelmann proposed stringent modifications (paras. <a>6.6.16-17</a>).  The Board decided ADS should co-operate and participate in such an agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.34" class="para" id="p6.11.34">6.11.34</a> That note, of course, refers to a request from the Ministry.  The Ministryâs role in this affair is rather obscure.  The defendantsurged me to view Mr. Gideonâs evidence that the Ministry had no role with considerable suspicion.  They submitted that there areprobably documents not discovered by EKR that would throw light on this.  I ruled EKR were not liable to discovery.  Mr. Gideon offereda degree of voluntary discovery by EKR but none of the documents thus discovered helped.  The ADS Board had a representative fromthe Ministry, Mr. Andersen, who had made a phone call.  If the Ministry was concerned to ensure ADSâ co-operation, there wouldsurely be some reflection of this in the Board minutes in the form of direct intervention by Mr. Andersen.  If it was not thoughtthat he carried enough weight, then the Ministry would possibly have communicated direct in writing with ADS.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.35" class="para" id="p6.11.35">6.11.35</a> It is beyond doubt that EKRâs decision to countenance revised arrangements was prompted at least in part by a desire to help BWwhich in turn probably had some political overtones.  Beyond that I am satisfied that there was no particular political pressureor influence on the decision.  The Ministryâs role, I find, was confined to understandable support for any measure that would helpBW and, had it been thought necessary, to seek approval from the European Commission for the revised arrangements (Part <a>8</a>).</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.36" class="para" id="p6.11.36">6.11.36</a> There was also another significant difference of approach between ADS and EKR before delivery of Sealock.  By 11th March, EKR wasalready prepared to face similar revisions for Annalock and 912.  ADS was not.  As matters developed, both agreed that sale of thetwo vessels was acceptable and ultimately, of course, 912 was sold without loss.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.37" class="para" id="p6.11.37">6.11.37</a> When negotiations over Annalock and 912 resumed in October 1983, they were conducted by Mr. Edelmann.  EKR was not present.  ADSâapproach, limiting help to US$4 million with security and exchange of deposits, was therefore formulated without reference to EKR.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.38" class="para" id="p6.11.38">6.11.38</a> The Fund reported to EKR on 6th October, omitting reference to its intention to take security.  This was another indication perhapsof its intention to rely upon its own arrangements rather than EKRâs backstop.  On 24th October, Mr. Faergemann prepared his notefor the Board in which it was left to the Board to decide whether to help EKR and BW.  While the decision was thus simply put, therecommendations are important</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIf the Board of Directors consequently decides that DSF should help B&amp;W and EKR, it is then recommended to authorise the managementto enter into an agreement between the banks/WMI and DSF, whereby DSF commits itself to refinance the interest accrued on both banksâloans since 13-7-1983.  The Fund hereby gives an assistance which corresponds essentially to that of the parent company.  The factthat the amount must necessarily be somewhat bigger, is because the two banks insist upon an identical treatment, and further insistupon a refinancing including the accrued interests as far back as 13-7.  1983.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>It seems regretfully necessary in any case to treat one of the banks with some caution.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>The prerequisite to consent to such a refinancing must be that a guarantee giving a reasonable cover for this amount is obtained.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>The management has endeavoured to get information on World Wide Wheelock Shipping Inc., but it has proved difficult to obtain specificdata before the Board Meeting.  There are grounds to believe that the shares are worth more than the US$ 10 million referred to earlier. DSF has proposed to WMI to take these shares as a pledge.  WMI has expressed its reluctance to mortgage these shares any further,but has, as an alternative, offered guarantee in a bulkcarrier, the âFenlockâ, built in Japan in 1981.  The cash sale value ofthis ship appears to be about US$ 14 to 15 million (the management has not yet given an estimate).  The ship is, for the time being,mortgaged for US$ 11.7 million with the Bank of America and this bank, by the way, has not given its consent to a second mortgaging. There is consequently an undocumented non-mortgaged value of US$ 3 to 4 million in this ship.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>We recommend that the refinancing should be guaranteed (if possible) by a third pledge (with the right to be advanced) of world WideWheelock Shipping Inc.âs shares, after a maximum of US$ 10 million has gone to WMIâs parent company, together with a second mortgageon m/s âFenlockâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>If only one of these guarantees can be obtained, it will then be more advantageous to secure pledge of World Wide Wheelock ShippingIncorporatedâs shares, also taking into account that the parent companyâs loan and the charter agreement must be deemed to berepaid and/or expired within the three coming years.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.11.39" class="para" id="p6.11.39">6.11.39</a> In my view, these recommendations smack of a careful and independent approach to WMIâs problems and how to ensure that ADSâ guidingprinciple - not to rely on EKR - could best be maintained.  Again this note was the basis of the Boardâs meeting on 8th December. It was the Fundâs own limited proposal which was discussed and approved.  The position of EKR and BW was clearly acknowledged. EKRâs anxiety to help BW plainly influenced the Boardâs decision.  It is important to remember, however, that the premise forthe negotiations and various decisions was always WMIâs request for a moratorium and release of deposits.  Ultimately, the Fundwas prepared to go some way towards helping WMI, the extent of that help being dictated by the information it had received from WMIand the picture it had formed of WMIâs financial position.  The Board approved a proposal which was less generous than EKR wouldhave been prepared to accept.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.40" class="para" id="p6.11.40">6.11.40</a> That proposal was further refined following a meeting with Mr. Brothers at BW.  The financial help was to go to Annalock while 912was to be sold.  The Fundâs board approved on 14th December.  At that meeting, when discussing the minutes of its previous meeting,one director Mr. Engell-Jensen said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... that even though the shipyard could bear its share of such a loss, one should show some understanding for the unfortunate factthat the Danish Export Credit Council should suffer a loss of this magnitude, but the difficulty in this situation was that the ExportCredit Council considered the positions adopted by the Fundâs Board of Directors as deriving from their expertise in this field,even though the basis for the debate among the Board had been that the commitment was backed by an export credit guarantee.  It wastherefore important that the Ship Credit Fund should adopt a clear position.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.11.41" class="para" id="p6.11.41">6.11.41</a> That remark must, however, be looked at in the context of what EKR was doing.  Mr. Gideon prepared a note (para. <a>6.7.34</a>) for the EKR council meeting on 28th October (para. <a>6.7.35</a>).  At that meeting, the Fundâs proposal for limited help was adopted.  It appears to me, therefore, that the Fund and EKR weretaking comfort from each other.  EKR was relying on the Fund for a proper appreciation of WMIâs position and for negotiation ofan acceptable arrangement - the Fund was comforted by the knowledge that if necessary it had EKRâs counter-guarantee.  And it isin that context that the evidence of Mr. Faergemann and Mr. Nielsen must be considered.</p>    <p><a name="p6.11.42" class="para" id="p6.11.42">6.11.42</a> I am satisfied, however, that ADS, while comforted by and relying on that counter-guarantee, equally relied upon the informationit received from WMI and the financial picture which emerged.  But for that, it would not have agreed the revised arrangements whichit did.  I am persuaded that ADS did not rely exclusively on the guarantee for its decisions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="6.12">6.12    EKR - RELIANCE AND MOTIVE</a></p>    <p><a name="p6.12.1" class="para" id="p6.12.1">6.12.1</a> It is not now necessary for me to consider the position of EKR.  I should, however, complete the picture.</p>    <p><a name="p6.12.2" class="para" id="p6.12.2">6.12.2</a> Until the six deposits were released in relation to Sealock, neither ADS, EKR nor BW were at any risk.  Assuming a swap of the deposits,these deposits which WMI had established fully covered repayment of ADSâ loan.  The effect of the revised arrangements was to leaveADS unsecured to the extent of Dkr 75.5 million and BW and EKR becoming at risk under their guarantee and counter-guarantee respectively. Hence, BWâs successful application in March 1983 to EKR for an AB guarantee.</p>    <p><a name="p6.12.3" class="para" id="p6.12.3">6.12.3</a> The defendants accept EKR acted prudently and with commercial common sense in deciding whether to agree to the revised arrangements. It weighed likely losses, if Sealock was not delivered because the arrangements were not revised, against the possibility of lossin the future if the arrangements were revised.  Initially, WMI proposed extending the loan to 12 years with a 3Â½-year moratorium. That would have led to a risk on the part of EKR of Dkr 88 million after 8Â½ years.  Mr. Gideonâs note for the EKR council meetingof 11th March said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn estimating the risk on DKK 88 million in 8[Â½] years which is secured by mortgage on the ship, one must take into account that,if WMI does not take over 910, EKRâs risk as a result of the production-time guarantee will be of about DKK 20 million.  In addition,B&amp;W will incur a loss estimated at DKK 60 million, which will entail immediate liquidity problems.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.12.4" class="para" id="p6.12.4">6.12.4</a> As the defendants submitted, EKR expected that after 8Â½ years they would have the benefit of a mortgage over an otherwise unencumberedvessel, the value of which might then well have exceeded the value of US$17 million placed on it by the Fund.  It appears to me,therefore, that the defendants were accepting that EKR was relying upon the prospect of WMI repaying.</p>    <p><a name="p6.12.5" class="para" id="p6.12.5">6.12.5</a> The more important point made by the defendants, however, concerned the reference to BWâs âimmediate liquidity problemsâ anda statement earlier in the EKR note that BW could, according to information on its liquidity, postpone delivery to the end of themonth, that was March 1983.  This led to a lengthy cross-examination of Mr. Gideon, the substance of which was that if BW did notreceive Dkr 214 million, the balance of the price, there might be real liquidity problems and a knock-on effect on other vesselsunder construction leading to further losses for EKR under other DO guarantees.</p>    <p><a name="p6.12.6" class="para" id="p6.12.6">6.12.6</a> Criticism was heaped on Mr. Gideon for failing to accept BW had a tight liquidity situation, insisting its financial position wassound and that there was no concern for a liquidity crisis.  In my view, the criticism was unjustified.  Mr. Gideon dealt capablywith cross-examination, provided satisfactory answers and emerged unscathed.  I found him to be an honest and reliable witness. He explained that BWâs financial situation in 1983 was different from that in 1981, a contention borne out by BWâs accounts whichshow profits of Dkr 88 million, 101 million and 38 million for 1982, 1983 and 1984 respectively, and equity of Dkr 47 million, 159million and 186 million for the same years.</p>    <p><a name="p6.12.7" class="para" id="p6.12.7">6.12.7</a> Mr. Gideon also explained that the real problem with Sealock was the short notice at which arrangements had to be made.  He saidif necessary the vessel could probably have been sold, as was done with 912, and even at current prices would not necessarily haveentailed any loss (other than loss of <u>profit</u> to BW).  The vessel was a valuable asset.  It could, if necessary, have been isolated pending sale and further credit extended toBW until such sale.  Mr. Gideon emphasised that the role in which EKR eventually found itself was the usual one of a guarantor havingto take a risk, a role which EKR usually assumed.  Until the deposits were released, EKR unusually ran no risk.  So it simply decidedto take the risk of WMI being in existence in 8Â½ yearsâ time. </p>    <p><a name="p6.12.8" class="para" id="p6.12.8">6.12.8</a> The EKR notes and minutes do not express any concern for EKRâs overall exposure to BW nor any concern for BWâs survival.  Thepassage in cross-examination on which the defendants rely for asserting that Mr. Gideon considered DO exposure, was a misinterpretationof Mr. Gideonâs evidence at day 41/75:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  Because at the time, when you obviously took some care in preparing this note for the extraordinary meeting, you had to considerthis very unusual situation and it seemed to you at the time that you had to contrast the certainty of the 20 million loss now withrunning a risk of being liable for a bigger sum in eight years time - that was the situation as you saw it then, was it not?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  Yes, and we had the DO obligation as well to consider, the obligation under the credit framework to consider, and that was biggerthan 20 million - it was even bigger than the delayed payments.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.12.9" class="para" id="p6.12.9">6.12.9</a> All Mr. Gideon was saying was that EKRâs DO exposure on Sealock, which was Dkr 96 million, was higher than its AB/K risk of Dkr20 million.  Mr. Gideon really summed it up thus at day 41/79:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.  You have to weigh it up - not against, Mr Johnson - you have to weigh it up - not against a certain loss of having deliveredthe ship, but you have to weigh it up, our situation, that WMI belonged to a very well respected Group.  We had no reason to disbelievethat they would not, as they continued trading, they would not be in business in eight and a half years.  We had looked at the graph- there was a gap even with the moratorium, but that, probably one way or the other, has been resolved.  We were not given any guaranteethat WMI would be in business after eight and a half years, but we were never given a guarantee in any cases that any shipowner wouldbe alive after eight and a half years.  We just returned to normal.  That is the situation you must consider now - would we takea situation of a certain loss of not delivering the ships, or should we go forward and deliver them to WMI?  As you very rightlyput it, they had an interest in taking over the ships - why not then run a risk, which eventually is what we were in business for.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><u>Annalock</u></p>    <p><a name="p6.12.10" class="para" id="p6.12.10">6.12.10</a> There is no doubt that from the beginning EKR was keen to see a solution for all three vessels.  The minutes of the EKR council meetingof 11th March show all three vessels were discussed and a global solution was suggested.  In the end, the council approved only theproposal which Mr. Gideonâs note had placed before it, i.e. for Sealock.</p>    <p><a name="p6.12.11" class="para" id="p6.12.11">6.12.11</a> Then on 18th April, Mr. Schroeder of BW telexed Mr. Brothers to say Mr. Gideon had advised that the meetings of 21st and 22nd Aprilcould not be postponed because Mr. Gideon had to put a recommendation to the Minister.  Next, there was a meeting on 30th May atBW.  In his note of the meeting, Mr. Brothers recorded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMr. Edelmann stated that the Fundâs thinking had somewhat changed since the last meeting in London.  At that time, there hadbeen, in their minds, some pressure to arrive at an early solution whereby in exchange for a âguaranteeâ that the Banks concernedwould finance the vessels, the DSKF would offer a loan moratorium.  DSKF now accepted that there would be no such guarantee fromthe Banks and at the same time was much more prepared to adopt a âwait-and-seeâ attitude.  In this respect, it wanted to seewhether or not the Groupâs various creditor banks would agree to the proposed rescheduling arrangements and also whether or notthe proposed US$12 million from Hong Kong Realty would be forthcoming.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.12.12" class="para" id="p6.12.12">6.12.12</a> Mr. Gideon was criticised for denying that there was at any stage <u>anxiety</u> on the part of EKR.  Again, I find the criticism unjustified.  The EKR minutes hardly suggest anxiety - perhaps an understandableand common sense desire to sort out the whole problem once and for all but the opportunity was not taken.  As to Mr. Gideonâs denial,I can find no such reference in cross-examination.  Mr. Gideon simply said of Mr. Schroederâs telex that it was in error as therewas no recommendation to be put to the Minister.  Mr. Gideon thought Mr. Schroeder might have meant the EKR council.  Mr. Schroederdid not, as had been anticipated, give evidence.  In relation to Mr. Brothersâ note, Mr. Gideon agreed that EKRâs attitude wouldbe that of the Fund and said at day 44/22:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.  Well, it took some months before a solution came and I think we must have had at that time the same feeling as the Fund, thatwe wanted to have a solution to 911 and 912 in fairly good time before the delivery, but not necessarily maybe in the month of May.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.12.13" class="para" id="p6.12.13">6.12.13</a> It was suggested that the wait-and-see attitude was a result of the calculations prepared by BW in May (paras. <a>6.7.29-31</a>).  These showed losses significantly reduced if the 10% floating-out instalments were paid because the resale price of the vesselcould then drop to about US$11 million before outweighing the benefit of the instalment.  At the time, a price of US$14 million ormore was in contemplation.  Mr. Gideon agreed the effect of the payment of the instalment but said it did not lie behind EKRâsmotives.  He said BWâs figures were still wrong and he simply decided not to take the calculations further but wait for a claimfor BW.  He agreed EKR would want to assess risks and likely exposure, and then at day 44/51:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.  So it was a risk situation, even though it was not a claim, and surely it was just the situation in which you would make surethat you had a pretty good assessment of what your exposure was; is that not right?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  As we have discussed before, there was a buyer willing to take over the ship if that could be arranged and, as we normally wereused to running risks, that is all right - if we have some trust in that the buyer would exist in some years time, that could bearranged.  I do not think we compared it with the AB-K problem.  If you remember my note to the Council on 11 March, I think I mentionedthere that the risk for EKR on the AB-guarantee would amount to 20 million Kroner and that does not compare very much to the relaxedterms - the balloon side - so we had in mind that, if possible, if it could be arranged and if we considered the risk as a fair risk,we would go a long way to accommodating a willing buyer to take the ship.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.12.14" class="para" id="p6.12.14">6.12.14</a> That again sums up, in Mr. Gideonâs straightforward manner, what EKR were doing.  An important component was WMIâs continuedexistence as to which the financial information from WMI would be crucial.  Having got Sealock out of the way, there was more timeto deal with the other two vessels.  Eventually, EKR recognised in October (para. <a>6.7.34</a>) that a solution had to be found soon otherwise the banks would not agree to the floating-out instalments.  The solution was finallyfound in December.</p>    <p><a name="p6.12.15" class="para" id="p6.12.15">6.12.15</a> Clearly, as the defendants submitted, EKR was motivated by a desire to protect its own financial interests as well as those of BW. Equally clearly in deciding to accept the risks involved, EKR took into account WMIâs ability to remain in business and pay offloans for which EKR relied on WMIâs financial information passed on by ADS. </p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="6.13">6.13    THE MISREPRESENTATIONS</a></p>    <p><a name="p6.13.1" class="para" id="p6.13.1">6.13.1</a> I now turn to deal with the specific allegations in the re-re-amended statement of claim.

Was it, however, false?  It became false when, according to ADS,WM decided not to support WMI.  Such a <u>decision</u> became manifest at the earliest in November 1984.  Before that date, the issues were WMâs intention and the honest belief of thedefendants.  I have already made findings about the belief of WM and Mr. Brothers.  It follows that at the relevant time this representationwas not false nor was there any failure to correct.</p>    <p><u>(2)  Para. 4.1.2</u></p>    <p><a name="p6.13.21" class="para" id="p6.13.21">6.13.21</a> This pleads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe explanation given for WMIâs need to restructure its finance, as set out in its proposals, was that it had a cash flow problembut such problem was described as being merely short term.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.13.22" class="para" id="p6.13.22">6.13.22</a> It is alleged that this representation was made orally by Mr. Brothers to Mr. Edelmann; and in writing by way of the draft lettersto WMIâs bankers contained with the letters dated 28th February and 3rd March 1983 from Mr. Brothers to Mr. Edelmann.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.23" class="para" id="p6.13.23">6.13.23</a> There was a meeting on 22nd and 23rd February at BW.  According to Mr. Edelmann, although he was unable to remember the exact words,he recalled that Mr. Brothers indicated that WMI faced a liquidity crisis by which he, Mr. Edelmann, understood WMI was running outof money and that it had a cash rather than an asset problem.  He did not, however, understand that the problem was immediate, merelythat Mr. Brothers foresaw a crisis.  Indeed, Mr. Edelmann remembered that, throughout their dealings, Mr. Brothers indicated it wouldbe two to three years before WMI ran into serious trouble.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.24" class="para" id="p6.13.24">6.13.24</a> The two draft letters which sought a 3-year moratorium on payments of principal both stated âWMI is now facing an immediate cashflow shortfallâ.  This indicated to Mr. Edelmann that the problem was short-term.  He said ADS was never told that WMI was dependenton third party support.  As Mr. Faergemann agreed, âimmediateâ means âat onceâ.  But as Mr. Edelmann pointed out in his statement,the 10-year graph, which accompanied the first letter, showed no substantial deficit until 1986 if the moratorium took place.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.25" class="para" id="p6.13.25">6.13.25</a> So there is a contradiction here.  Was there to be a cash flow problem starting at once, as the letters suggest and Mr. Faergemannaccepts, or was there to be a long-lasting problem starting sooner or later depending upon the moratorium?</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.26" class="para" id="p6.13.26">6.13.26</a> In my view, Mr. Nielsen summed it up correctly, namely that there was a long-term problem which would be solved in the short-termby the moratorium.  That would allow time for WM to make arrangements to provide support.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.27" class="para" id="p6.13.27">6.13.27</a> I confess to difficulty with this plea.  Looked at in isolation, ADS was perfectly aware that something much more substantial andsustained than a mere blip in cash flow was involved.  I cannot see how ADS was misled.  The gravamen of the complaint was put thusby Mr. Cullen in closing at day 157/36:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhat my clients did not know was that it was not the short-term problem shown on those secured creditors, because underneath therewas the newbuildings which turned it into a catastrophe.  So, having been told there was a short-term problem - the expression usedhere by all the Defendants, and we say Mr Brothers actually used that term to us - we say that was a misrepresentation, because unknownto us and known to Mr Brothers there was the 18th March cashflow which showed that this was no short-term problem.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.13.28" class="para" id="p6.13.28">6.13.28</a> To put this in context, it becomes necessary to look at further parts of the plea in relation to Sealock:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â4.1.4 A cash flow projection for WMI was sent to the Plaintiff (in the letter from the First Defendant dated the 28th February1983 referred to in Paragraph 3.4(1) above) which gave two projections, first, on the basis that all WMIâs lenders consented tothe proposed refinancing and, second, on the basis that they did not.  The former projection indicated that no substantial cash deficitwould arise before mid-1986.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">4.5 All the above representations were not true and did not present to the Plaintiff a true picture of, and (as to Paragraphs 4.1.2and 4.1.4) did not represent an honest opinion as to, the financial position of WMI and its prospects or of the First Defendantâsposition with regard to the support of WMI.  The situation as it was known to the <i>First and/or Fifth</i> Defendants at the time (which knowledge is more particularly pleaded below) was completely different.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">4.6 Further, the <i>First and/or Fifth</i> Defendants omitted to state the true position of WMI.

I have already dealt with this.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) Crucially, a failure to supply the cash flow of 18th March which had the effect of distorting or falsifying the picture presentedby the cash flow relating to secured creditors.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.13.30" class="para" id="p6.13.30">6.13.30</a> (1) is totally unsustainable.  ADS knew exactly what it represented at the time it was received.  ADS also knew that a cash flowfor newbuildings was being prepared.  The cash flow for secured creditors, therefore, carried no implications about newbuildingsand was not in itself misleading.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.31" class="para" id="p6.13.31">6.13.31</a> As to (3), the picture presented by the secured creditorsâ cash flow, however, was of a huge deficit which could be reduced tomanageable proportions by a 3-year moratorium.  I have already found that Mr. Brothers had made it clear that his intention was thatnewbuildings should be or should substantially be cash neutral.  The cash flow of 18th March, however, changed the picture completely. If it was not provided, in my judgment there was an omission âto correct the false impression given by the representations bystating the true position toâ ADS.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.32" class="para" id="p6.13.32">6.13.32</a> ADSâ allegation was not, as the defendants tried to argue, that the secured creditorsâ cash flow itself was falsified, but ratherthe impression it created was false and should have been corrected.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.33" class="para" id="p6.13.33">6.13.33</a> The crucial issue then is whether Mr. Brothers handed the newbuildings cash flow to Mr. Edelmann in London on 23rd or 24th March1983.  It is important to realise that, while the graph showing the effect of the cash flow was but a single sheet, the whole cashflow ran to over 20 pages of computer print-out of assumptions and calculations.  It was a bulky document.  It was not a single scrappysheet of paper.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.34" class="para" id="p6.13.34">6.13.34</a> There is no doubt that Mr. Brothers took it with him to London in March 1983.  He stopped in Geneva where he showed it to Mr. Ortiz-Patinowho, although he did not understand all the financial information and intricacies, for the first time obtained a good view of WMIâsposition (and if Mr. Ortiz-Patino was appalled, as he was, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that ADSâ reaction would beno different).  Once in London, Mr. Brothers said that on 24th March he saw Mr. Edelmann in Mr. Freelandâs office and there handedover the cash flow.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.35" class="para" id="p6.13.35">6.13.35</a> Mr. Brothers had, of course, written to Mr. Edelmann on 28th February promising the cash flow âprobably on Wednesdayâ.  Mr. Edelmannwas expecting this cash flow.  That, I accept, is hardly a sound basis for suppression of a document.  Indeed, it was sent to thebanks.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.36" class="para" id="p6.13.36">6.13.36</a> Although ADSâ witnesses were astute to say that they were interested in WMI information, there was no request for this cash flow. While that would be explicable if ADS had in fact received the cash flow, but either ignored it or mislaid it, it is equally explicableby the assumption on the part of ADS that newbuildings would be cash neutral.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.37" class="para" id="p6.13.37">6.13.37</a> Mr. Freelandâs note of the meeting on 24th March which referred to WM âdetermining how much supportâ (para. <a>6.13.17(4))</a> contained reference to</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â$4 million 1983, $7 million 1984 deficitâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.13.38" class="para" id="p6.13.38">6.13.38</a> Those figures reflect the deficits shown in the cash flow.  But they only reflect 2 years.  Mr. Brothers could have mentioned theserelatively small deficits.  Had Mr. Freeland seen and reviewed the whole cash flow, however, it seems likely he would have notedrather more than he did.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.39" class="para" id="p6.13.39">6.13.39</a> This cash flow was disastrous.  I cannot conceive Mr. Edelmannâs reaction would have been other than to pack his bags and go home. The cash flow went far beyond anything anyone was expecting, including Mr. Brothers.

The suggestion that Mr. Edelmann and ADS were simply not interested in it because they were preoccupiedwith EKR and BW does not hold water.  At para. <a>6.11.23</a> I have already examined how Mr Edelmann and Mr Faergemann dealt with cashflows.  No doubt Mr Edelmann would have mentioned this cashflowhad it been given to him.  It is clear that he had a somewhat jaundiced view of the whole WMI affair and would have been quite uninhibitedin drawing the boardâs attention to this document.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.41" class="para" id="p6.13.41">6.13.41</a> Discussions in London about delivery of Sealock took place on 22nd/23rd March.

First of all, my Lord, these were only assumptions in the cashflow and the Danes knew well enough that we were expecting, if wewere to take delivery at all of 911 and 912, that we would get the same terms we would for 910 --</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  I am sorry, Mr Brothers, you know this was not the point.  The point was this was information that was obviously of great interestto them.  You were asking either that they knew that you had it and did not bother to ask for it or you had it, but did not thinkit was important?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  I do not see how the information could be of interest to them.  It would not have helped them in one way or the other.  They knewalready that we expected to get the same terms for 911 and 912 if we did not cancel them.  If they had wanted the information, ifthey had needed to see it, of course they could have had it.  I brought it over specifically for that purpose.  There was no questionof withholding anything or anything of that nature.  It was just agreed or decided that the matter -- the briefing on the financialside of Wheelock Maritime would take place after the negotiations had taken place on 910.  That was how we both wanted it.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Mr Brothers, I must suggest to you that you deliberately did not hand over this document?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  We always made a point of giving all of the information to all of the creditors.  We did not deliberately withhold informationfrom anybody at any time.  It would have been totally out of character and totally unnecessary to have held back any informationfrom DSKF.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.  Perhaps it was just a negotiating stance not to give it to them?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.  It was not a negotiating stance at all.  In fact, it would probably help our negotiations to give it to them, not the opposite.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.13.42" class="para" id="p6.13.42">6.13.42</a> I am wholly unable to accept that.  The final answer is staggering.  The general thrust of the passage, that Mr. Edelmann shouldhave made the running and asked for the cash flow, is simply unacceptable.  Mr. Brothers, during 2 days of negotiation about Sealock,had in his briefcase a financial document which on any reading was going to cause concern.  Mr. Gideonâs assertion in para. 26of his original witness statement, albeit in a general context, that there was no reason to give vessels away to a bankrupt companywith no real prospect of repaying loans made to it, was an apt and realistic appraisal of this situation.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.43" class="para" id="p6.13.43">6.13.43</a> Mr. Brothers had the cash flow in his briefcase.  I am satisfied that, appalled by the consequences that would have undoubtedly flowedfrom its disclosure, Mr. Brothers kept it there.  It is worth remembering what Mr. Brothers said about âextremely wide-rangingrepercussionsâ concerning the problem that arose over Rangelock (para. <a>3.5.3</a>).</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.44" class="para" id="p6.13.44">6.13.44</a> There are no two ways about this issue.

ADS argued that there would have been no point in mentioning it unless theintention was to create such an impression.  In further and better particulars, however, ADS put its case more positively, namelythat Mr. Brothers stated that WM had received Rothschildsâ report âand that WMI ought therefore to receive assistance from [WM]â. In my view, the pleaded case and the argued case are inconsistent.  In a case involving fraud such an inconsistency is unacceptable. This allegation must fail.  But it would have failed anyway.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.48" class="para" id="p6.13.48">6.13.48</a> This allegation was plainly derived from a note dated 24th October which Mr. Faergemann prepared of the meeting that day.  In it,he recorded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âDuring the meeting R.

BROTHERS explained moreover that WMIâs parent company, Wheelock Marden &amp; Co. (WMCO)had received from its financial consultants a report concluding that WMI was worth saving, and therefore should be given assistanceby its parent company.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Because of this, WMCO has committed itself to grant WMI a loan of US$ 4 million over the next two years.  The loan will be given accordingto more specifically agreed conditions and against a guarantee in the form of a pledge of shares in World Wide Wheelock ShippingInc.  This company is a holding company in which WMI owns 51 per cent of the share capital.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>It should be noted that the above amount of US$ 4 million is based among others on the pre-condition that the Ship Credit Fund (DSF)will agree to postpone 4 (four) to 5 (five) instalments on each of the newbuildings no. 911 and 912 in connection with the delivery,which as a whole corresponds respectively to US$ 4,872,000.- (911) and US$ 5,124,000.- (912), i.e. a total of US$ 9,996,000.-.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>The management expressed its stupefaction at this assumption and pointed out that the Fund had, at no time whatsoever, implied thatsuch an assistance could be expected.  On the contrary, it should be underlined that in the Spring of 1983, the Ship Credit Fund,the Export Credit Council and B&amp;W had contributed US$ 5.8 million to WMIâs liquidity in connection with the delivery of 910,and that in August of this same year, the management had replied to WMI that a solution formula such as the one assumed would noteven been submitted to the Board of Directors.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>The management also remarked that 4 million dollars must be considered as insufficient assistance for the companyâs liquidity andthat the parent companyâs will to assist WMI may be seriously doubted, if one considers that the proposed 4 million would onlybe made available against full covering guarantee.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.13.49" class="para" id="p6.13.49">6.13.49</a> Mr. Edelmann clearly derived his draft statement from that note.

That WMI would therefore be receiving assistance from its parent company.  We were aware thatWMI had requested assistance of US$12 million, but were informed that the assistance took the form of a Loan of only US$4 million,which was secured by a First Pledge of 250 shares of World-wide Wheelock Shipping Inc. (âWWWâ), a joint venture Company betweenWMI and Worldwide Shipping, a Company controlled by Sir Yue-Kong Pao.  We were given to understand that WMI held 50.4% of the beneficialinterest in the shares of that Company.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>The WWW shares were also the subject of a pledge in favour of [WM] to cover a Guarantee of US$6 million for charter-hire of the vesselâRangelockâ, which had been the subject of a sale and lease-back refinancing arrangement between WMI and LBI.  The shares ofWWW were thus pledged to [WM] by WMI as to approximately US$10 million of their value.  At first sight the fact that the parent companytook collateral from its subsidiary should have been a warning sign, but the impression which I got was that despite the policy ofthe parent not to give Guarantees, they had done so and they indicated to me that they intended not to let WMI fail.  The fact thatcollateral was taken was, in my view, merely to avoid other Creditors requesting similar Guarantees as mentioned in Clause 34 above.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Mr. Brothers indicated that he hoped that the Fund would release 4-5 repayments on new building number 911, totalling approximatelyUS$4,872,000.  We were given the impression that provided the loans were refinanced, the difficulties of WMI would disappear.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>I expressed surprise at Mr. Brothersâ proposal.  We indicated that we took the view that the funding provided by [WM] was insufficient,especially as the Fund was required to provide more than [WM], the parent company of WMI, and as we had already contributed to WMIâsliquidity.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>We did, however, indicate that we were prepared to contribute to a solution in view of our desire to assist the yard.  We were, however,concerned about the financial standing of WMI, especially in the light of the total potential liabilities of that Company towardsADS.  We therefore required the Guarantee of WMI to be supported by other substantial securities.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6.13.50" class="para" id="p6.13.50">6.13.50</a> It is appropriate to consider the next alleged misrepresentation at this stage.</p>    <p><u>(4)  Para. 14.1.4</u></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â14.1.4  Further, at the meeting of 4th October 1983 the Plaintiff was given the impression that the support of a secured loan ofUS$4 million that had been offered by the First Defendant was sufficient to ensure the survival of WMI and that if the Plaintiffagreed to the proposed rescheduling of the Annalock loan WMIâs problems would be solved.

In cross-examination, Mr. Faergemannâs attention was drawn to the two different aspects of the final paragraph, i.e. <u>insufficient</u> assistance and <u>will</u> (<u>or willingness</u>) to support.  Mr. Faergemann agreed that <u>willingness</u> was the major word and there then followed, at day 28/27:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.

Mr. Schroeder saidthat Mr. Brothers explained that Rothschilds had made two proposals for support, namely US$12 million; or three instalments of US$4million each, supported by a 3-year moratorium (in fact, the original recommendation was for US$12 million by way of three annualcumulative instalments of $4 million each; the revised recommendation was for $12 million on condition debts were rescheduled, or$4 million over 2 years).  WM had opted for the latter as WMI did not need US$12 million, US$4 million having been calculated tobe sufficient for two years when the position could be reviewed.  Mr. Faergemann was asked if he remembered words to the effect thatWM was being looked to for short-term support sufficient for two years when the position could be reviewed.  He said, yes.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.54" class="para" id="p6.13.54">6.13.54</a> In fact, Mr. Schroederâs manuscript note records Mr. Brothers as saying: âWe are only looking for a breathing-space as we arecounting on better days in the futureâ.  Mr. Brothers echoed this in his witness statement when he said: âI made it quite clearthe support WM would be giving, following Rothschildsâ report, would be to provide a breathing-space for two yearsâ.  It wasput to Mr. Faergemann that Mr. Brothers said this in the context of the Fundâs view that US$4 million was not sufficient liquidityassistance.

The complete picture was never shown.  The defendants were plainly under an obligation to disclose this because ADS had asked for,and Mr. Brothers had promised, financial information.  In any event, given the nature of the transactions between them and that Mr.Brothers had made financial information available, plainly he was required to inform ADS of any material alteration to the picturewhich had been provided.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.63" class="para" id="p6.13.63">6.13.63</a> The 10-year cash flow in the S&amp;C report, which showed funding requirements of US$56 million in January 1990 with a moratoriumand US$105 million in August 1989 without a moratorium, was not disclosed.

It is true ADS knew WMI was in trouble.  It was not, however, aware of the truly precarious state of WMIâsfinances and of the total dependence on WM for survival in its existing form.  ADS was entitled to know this so that they could makea proper assessment of what, if any, concessions they could make to help WMI as well as EKR and BW.  Had they known, it is inconceivablethey would have adopted the same approach.  Mr. Brothers plainly understood that.  He was, I find, selective in the information hesupplied in order to avoid non-delivery of the vessels and the almost inevitable collapse of WMI that would follow non-delivery. He was dishonest in doing so.</p>    <p><a name="p6.13.69" class="para" id="p6.13.69">6.13.69</a> I find, therefore, that there were two misrepresentations by omission, that they were intended to be and were relied on by ADS, andthat they were fraudulent.

Therefore, section 13 does not apply. </p>    <p><a name="p6.14.4" class="para" id="p6.14.4">6.14.4</a> It is helpful to analyse what was taking place.  WMI was seeking loans, or revised terms for the loans, for its Group.  No pointwas taken that the subsidiary which would receive the loan was âany personâ, i.e. a person other than the person against whoman allegation of fraud was being made.  WMI wanted to guarantee the loans.  WMI therefore had to be financially acceptable in itsown right.</p>    <p><a name="p6.14.5" class="para" id="p6.14.5">6.14.5</a> WMI had to negotiate with ADS.  Like any other company, it could not negotiate âitselfâ.  It had to act through a director orother natural person.  In this case, as I find (Part 7), WM was a director and was directing mind and will of WMI.  But WM no lessthan WMI could act only through a natural person and that person was a director, Mr. Brothers.  In spite of the lengthy chain, WMIwas in fact making representations about its own credit and, on the strength of that, was given credit by ADS.  Credit was not toanother party. </p>    <p><a name="p6.14.6" class="para" id="p6.14.6">6.14.6</a> Section 13 LARCO is based on the Statute of Frauds Amendment Act 1828 (Lord Tenterdenâs Act), the aim of which was to prevent theevasion of the Statute of Frauds, which applied to guarantees, by the bringing of actions in deceit based on parole representations. All cases were to be on the same footing so that where, on the faith of a representation as to another personâs credit, creditwas given to that person, the one making the representation would not be liable in deceit unless the representation was in writing:  <i><u>Lyde v.

He lurks in the shadows, sheltering behind others who, he claims, are the only directors of the company to the exclusion of himself. He is not held out as a director by the company.  To establish that a defendant is a shadow director of a company it is necessaryto allege and prove: (1) who are the directors of the company, whether de facto or de jure; (2) that the defendant directed thosedirectors how to act in relation to the company or that he was one of the persons who did so; (3) that those directors acted in accordancewith such directions; and (4) that they were accustomed so to act.

But as I have said, the paramount purpose of disqualification is the protectionof the public not punishment.  I therefore approach the question of construction on the normal basis.  Section 300 requires the courtto have regard to âconduct as a director.â  I can see no reason why Parliament should have intended that the decision to disqualifyshould turn on the validity of his appointment.  The conduct relevant to future suitability to act as a director depends on a manâspast record as a director irrespective of the circumstances in which he came to act as such.  Mr. Turnbull relied on section 733(2)of the Act of 1985 as showing that when Parliament intended to include a de facto director it referred expressly to âany personwho was purporting to act in any such capacity.â  But section 733 extends the criminal liability of a company to others and itis not surprising that in an exclusivity (sic) penal provision the criminal liability of a de facto director has to be expresslyreferred to.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7.1.11" class="para" id="p7.1.11">7.1.11</a> <a>The Vice-Chancellor went on to review earlier authorities :  <i><u>In Re Canadian Land Reclaiming and Colonizing Co</u></i>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1880%5d%2014%20Ch%20D%20660" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1880] 14 Ch.

No doubt theywere not properly elected, and were, therefore, not <i>de jure</i> directors of the company; but that they were <i>de facto</i> directors of the company is equally beyond all question.  The point I have to consider is whether the person who acts as <i>de facto</i> director is a director within the meaning of this section, or whether he can afterwards be allowed to deny that he was a directorwithin the meaning of this section.  I think he cannot.  We are familiar in the law with a great number of cases in which a man whoassumes a position cannot be allowed to deny in a Court of Justice that he really was entitled to occupy that position.  The mostfamiliar instance is that of executor <i>de son tort.</i>  In like manner, it seems to me, in an application under this section, the <i>de facto</i> director is a director for the purposes of the section.  If he had taken the companyâs money, if by reason of becoming a directorhe had obtained the power of disposing of the money of the company (which he certainly could do under the 104th clause of the articlesof association) and had appropriated it to his own use, would it be tolerable to allow that man to say he had not acquired the moneyby virtue of his position as a director, and to say he was not a director under this section?  This section is a section intendedto punish torts or wrongs.

I can see, as WM argued, some contradiction betweenthese somewhat limited duties and the imposing title âGeneral Managersâ but, no doubt as anticipated would be the case, it isclear to me that WM assumed full management of WMIâs affairs: not by any express power but by tacit consent, as WM would have it;or by an exercise of direct authority over WMI, as ADS would have it.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.7" class="para" id="p7.2.7">7.2.7</a> I have already set out the structure of WM (Part <a>2.3</a>).

With their authority he would carry onwith the business in hand.  If authority from the WMI board was necessary, it would be obtained in the manner I have just indicated. Additionally, WMI documents were circulated to and initialled by Mr. Lees and Mr. Leung as managing directors of WM in order toobtain their approval or simply to keep them informed.

This helped todemonstrate, in my view, just how completely WM dominated WMI.  WMI Board meetings were called principally to consider the generalmanagersâ reports and the accounts.  As Mr. Lees said, these meetings were useful to keep the non-executive directors informedand enabled them to discuss policy with the executive directors, i.e. WM.  Occasionally, business would be approved or ratified ata meeting if the two coincided.  Otherwise, WMI business that required Board input was dealt with by circular.  That, of course,was provided for in WMIâs Articles and is not unusual in general practice.  It is noteworthy, however, that the circulars werefrequently after the event, seeking ratification or approval of agreements already reached by WM.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.11" class="para" id="p7.2.11">7.2.11</a> During the period in question, there appears only to have been one advance authorisation by WMI in favour of WM.  On 27th July 1979,WMI authorised WM to negotiate for the purchase of two vessels, one from the Koyo yard and the Gemini Trader.  It is interestingto see how this developed.  At the management committee on 21st March 1979, Mr. Lees said the WMI Group must start modernising itsfleet.  Mr. Brothers suggested newbuildings as a better bet than inflated second-hand vessels.  Shortly after, negotiations beganwith BW.  On 11th June 1979, Mr. Brothers wrote to the managing directors seeking approval for him to indicate to BW that WMI wouldtake up to six vessels and, when details had been worked out, formal documents would be laid before the WMI Board for approval. Progress on that project later lapsed but the general managerâs report of 20th July 1979 informed WMI that its group was workingtowards replacing old tonnage and was involved in negotiations.  That report was approved by the WMI Board on 23rd July.  On 26thJuly, Mr. Brothers sent a circular to directors, in consonance with âthe declared policy of the Group to acquire modern tonnageâ,seeking the approval to negotiate for two purchases, approval for which was given on 27th July.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.12" class="para" id="p7.2.12">7.2.12</a> That approval or authorisation seems to have been something of an aberration.  Thereafter, Mr. Brothers, with the endorsement ofMr. Lees or Mr. Leung, entered WMI into the various negotiations and agreements which appear in Part 3.  No prior authorisation wassought but rather ratification or approval after the event.  Thus on 5th December 1980, the acquisition of Marilock was dealt withby the WMI Board some three weeks after the complicated events (para. <a>3.2.5</a>).  It is to be noted that the Board did not ratify the performance guarantee signed by Mr. Brothers on behalf of WMI - doubtlessthe Board was bewildered by WMâs machinations.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.13" class="para" id="p7.2.13">7.2.13</a> I accept, as Mr. Brothers said in evidence, that he was authorised by the managing directors to negotiate and implement all thesetransactions.  It does, however, give a clear indication of WMâs attitude and function.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.14" class="para" id="p7.2.14">7.2.14</a> Even more extreme perhaps was the purchase of Osaka 404, Manila Spirit.  The purchase agreement by Julian Shipping and WMIâs performanceguarantee were executed on 29th March 1980.  The WMI Board ratified by circular on 18th July over three months later.  Even Mr. Brothersagreed that the delay might have mattered.  I should mention, however, that this vessel was not dealt with by Mr. Brothers but rather,as he recalled, by Mr. Marden, Sir Y.K. Pao and the managing directors, the building contract being switched from WWS to WMI.  Thiscosy arrangement, however, emphasises the role played by WM.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.15" class="para" id="p7.2.15">7.2.15</a> I have also mentioned at para. <a>3.6.31</a> the draw-down from the $4m facility on 28th February 1984.  The relevant documents were signed by the working directors.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.16" class="para" id="p7.2.16">7.2.16</a> The circular resolutions in the main therefore comprised approval or ratification of actions carried out or agreed to by WM whichrequired execution of documents by WMI and on occasion ratification of a directorâs signature on such a document.  With one exception,these resolutions were signed without demur by the WMI directors.  The exception coincidentally was the resolution involving deliveryof Sealock which was dated 7th April 1983 but not signed by Mr. Poon until 24th May because of his reservations about the loan guaranteeto HSS.  Delivery of Sealock was therefore taken without authority.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.17" class="para" id="p7.2.17">7.2.17</a> After 15th July 1983, the new management committee of WM was invested with full management powers of WM.  On 5th August, this committeedecided all agenda and resolutions of group companies should be subject to its prior review.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.18" class="para" id="p7.2.18">7.2.18</a> Once Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung and Mr. Brothers decided upon a course of action, they were uninhibited by any thoughts about the WMI Board. Each regarded Board approval or ratification as a formality.  Each of course would vote in favour of their own decisions and actions. They did not expect the non-executive directors to do otherwise and indeed it never occurred.  There appears to have been a slightlycavalier attitude towards these directors.  Mr. Yuen said, and I see no reason to doubt him, that before Board meetings he did notusually know what was to be discussed.  He also said that no one introduced him to Mr. Banner or Mr. Nicholson at the meeting on9th February 1983.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.19" class="para" id="p7.2.19">7.2.19</a> The picture which emerged, therefore, was one of firm control by WM over WMI.  Of vital importance was its role as decision-taker,a role in which it could be confident it would meet no opposition.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.20" class="para" id="p7.2.20">7.2.20</a> This is wholly consistent with what was, in my view, the tight scheme of control which WM wished to maintain over its subsidiaries,a scheme reinforced by the introduction of the management committee in 1983.  This control was effectively implemented, at leastin WMIâs case, by what was essentially the fiction of the role of general managers.  In reality, WM wanted and retained controland direction.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.21" class="para" id="p7.2.21">7.2.21</a> There is no evidence of how WM functioned as general managers when first appointed in 1953.  It is clear, however, and not in disputethat by 1982, it was running WMIâs business.  ADS made the point that WMIâs Articles make no provision for the appointment ofa managing director.  Whether or not it was intended that WM should effectively become managing director through its nominated roleas general managers is a matter now of speculation.  I am satisfied, however, that over the intervening years WM not only assumedthe role of director but in fact was managing director of WMI.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.22" class="para" id="p7.2.22">7.2.22</a> WM argued that it was not a de facto director because it never acted as, claimed or held itself out to be a director because it neverundertook functions which could properly be discharged only by a director and because it never did anything which could reasonablyamount to an assumption of office of director.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.23" class="para" id="p7.2.23">7.2.23</a> It is true that neither WM nor any of the de jure directors ever proclaimed WM to be a director.  None of the defendants thoughtWM was a director.  WM itself assiduously signed documents as âsecretaries and general managersâ of WMI.</p>    <p><a name="p7.2.24" class="para" id="p7.2.24">7.2.24</a> I understand why WM should adopt this approach.  It was prompted by the passage from the judgment of Millett J. in <i><u>Hydrodan</u></i> (para. <a>7.1.5</a>).  I am satisfied, however, that the judge was not laying down essential facts to be established.  The crucial requirement is inthe final sentence.  It must be proved that a person undertook functions which could properly be discharged only by a director. The judge, I am sure, was otherwise being descriptive in order to draw the distinction between de facto and shadow directors.  Idraw comfort from the judgment of Warner J. in <i><u>Re Moorgate Metals</u></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20BCLC%20503" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 BCLC 503</a> where at p. 517 he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSome of the expressions used by Millett J in the <i>Hydrodam</i> (sic) case could be construed as meaning that, for a person to be held to have been a de facto director, the label âdirectorâmust have been attached to him.  But I am sure that Millett J did not mean that.  He was concerned to distinguish between a de factodirector and a shadow director, the latter being a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of acompany (whether de jure or de facto) are accustomed to act.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7.2.25" class="para" id="p7.2.25">7.2.25</a> In my view, my task is to analyse exactly what role WM was performing regardless of labels or the views of others, although thesefactors must, of course, be taken into account.  My analysis is that WM assumed to act as director of WMI.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="7.3">7.3    Shadow directorship</a></p>    <p><a name="p7.3.1" class="para" id="p7.3.1">7.3.1</a> In case I am wrong about something which seems to me to be so plain and obvious that I am surprised so much time was spent arguingthe contrary, I must consider whether WM might have been a shadow director.  For this assertion, ADS relies upon the same material. That is justifiable because it is clear that the line between de facto and shadow directorship is often a fine one.</p>    <p><a name="p7.3.2" class="para" id="p7.3.2">7.3.2</a> There were no express directions or instructions from WM to WMIâs Board.  ADS' case was that the circulars generated by Mr. Lees,Mr. Leung and Mr. Brothers, who together constituted the directing mind and will of WM in relation to the operation of WMIâs business,in effect constituted such directions or instructions.  The continual ratification or approval of the circulars and the continualacquiescence in other acts carried out by WM and reported at Board meetings were capable of being evidence of and amounted to shadowdirectorship.</p>    <p><a name="p7.3.3" class="para" id="p7.3.3">7.3.3</a> In April 1994, the Financial Law Panel produced a paper entitled 'Shadow Directorships'.  The Panel was chaired by the Rt Hon TheLord Donaldson of Lymington.  Arden J was a member.  Millett LJ is recorded as having assisted.  The paper contains a very clearand helpful explanation of what is a shadow director,  the pitfalls and how they might be avoided.  Under the heading âWhat isa direction or instructionâ, the paper says:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAlthough it is thought that habitual acquiescence in response to    mere suggestions or advice is not sufficient to lead to a findingof shadow directorship, the distinction will be a difficult one to draw, when in fact the proposals are usually adopted.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7.3.4" class="para" id="p7.3.4">7.3.4</a> In Part II of their paper, the Panel also set out five suggestions for a parent company to enable that company to avoid becominga shadow director:</p>    <blockquote>        <p> âavoid asserting control over its subsidiaries, whether with regard to one particular area of activity or otherwise;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p> avoid becoming concerned, at head office, in the day-to-day management of the subsidiary company;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p> ensure that all, or substantially all of the directors of the subsidiary are not employees or officers of the parent;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p> consider entering into an agreement with the subsidiary providing   that the subsidiary shall have autonomy.  Some groups (particularlyin the finance sector) have agreements which control the flow of information between group companies;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p> individual parent board members should ensure that they do not     personally become involved in directing the management of thesubsidiary.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7.3.5" class="para" id="p7.3.5">7.3.5</a> I think it can be seen that, had it been available, that advice would have been of great benefit to WM.</p>    <p><a name="p7.3.6" class="para" id="p7.3.6">7.3.6</a> In cross-examination of the Defendants, much emphasis was placed upon the rubber stamping or passive role of the other directors,a role acknowledged by Mr. Lees.  The position taken by the Defendants, however, was that WM had never issued instructions, and Mr.Lee and Mr. Yuen had never received any.  Mr. Lee and Mr. Yuen relied upon the fact that, if WM had done or was proposing something,it could be assumed that the managing directors had carefully considered the matter and that it was thought to be in WMIâs interests. Unless the matter appeared improper, which never occurred, they ratified or approved the matter because of confidence in the managingdirectors. </p>    <p><a name="p7.3.7" class="para" id="p7.3.7">7.3.7</a> Much was also made of which hats Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung or Mr. Brothers were wearing when dealing with resolutions or at WMI Board meetings. To me, this had an air of unreality.  During the critical period of 1983 and 1984, most matters considered by WMIâs directorsoriginated from Mr. Brothers.  He was effectively running WMIâs business.  It may fairly be said that he thought these mattersto be in WMIâs interests in the first place.  All such matters were filtered by Mr. Lees or Mr. Leung and would therefore be inthe interests of the Group, WM and of course WMI.  Once any matter came up for ratification or approval by WMIâs directors, itwas unlikely that Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung or Mr. Brothers were going to subject it to some sort of schizoprenic WM/WMI analysis.  Plainlythey would vote in favour.</p>    <p><a name="p7.3.8" class="para" id="p7.3.8">7.3.8</a> During the critical period, of course, WMI did go its own way in relation to support and whether to carry on business.  It had independentfinancial and legal advice, albeit that both sets of advisers were retained by WM in the first place - Mr. Shaw and Norton Rose wereretained by Mr. Leung and S&amp;C by Mr. Lees or Mr. Brothers.  WMIâs directors debated these matters independently in the lightof advice.  Decisions to carry on trading were plainly not directed or instructed by WM.  These decisions were very important butthey must be seen in context.</p>    <p><a name="p7.3.9" class="para" id="p7.3.9">7.3.9</a> Before delivery of Sealock, there was only one WMI Board meeting where advice was available, that was on 9th February 1983.  Alldiscussion centred around WMIâs plan for solving its difficulties.  There was no discussion about fraudulent trading, and the questionof support arose only obliquely as being a requirement for a moratorium on the part of the banks.</p>    <p><a name="p7.3.10" class="para" id="p7.3.10">7.3.10</a> The first serious advice about fraudulent trading and liquidation was given by Mr. Shaw at the meetings around 17th February.  Mr.Marden, Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung, Mr. Brothers and Mr. Poon were present.  It was at this meeting that Mr. Shaw gave his advice aboutno new credit being incurred.  No Board meeting was called, however, to discuss what were plainly serious problems.  The Sealockloan was subsequently drawn down on the basis of a circular.</p>    <p><a name="p7.3.11" class="para" id="p7.3.11">7.3.11</a> At the next WMI Board meeting on 20th April, all directors received Mr. Shawâs advice about trading.  The Board simply agreed toapproach WM.  At the next meeting on 30th April, the Board simply approved an approach to HKR.</p>    <p><a name="p7.3.10" class="para" id="p7.3.10">7.3.12 Meetings on 20th and 28th May dealt with company business in a normal manner.  Then on 15th September, WMI after advice anddiscussion resolved to carry on trading until 23rd September.  On 23rd September, it was agreed to accept the US$4 m. facility andit was agreed that this was an acceptable basis for continuing to trade.  On 30th September, WMI dealt with the usual business. There was no further Board meeting until 11th April 1984, after delivery of Annalock.</a></p>    <p><a name="p7.3.13" class="para" id="p7.3.13">7.3.13</a> Against that background, WM continued to conduct WMIâs business.  Crucially, it decided to take delivery of Sealock, notwithstandingthe advice and discussion with Mr. Shaw at the meeting on about 17th February and notwithstanding the availability of the S&amp;Creport.  It also decided to take Annalock, notwithstanding the time which had elapsed since the last Board meeting and the financialsituation then prevailing.</p>    <p><a name="p7.3.14" class="para" id="p7.3.14">7.3.14</a> It is also right to acknowledge that the WMI minutes do not record everything that happened at the Board meetings.  There was discussionand debate.  The non-WM directors asked questions.  The transcript of the meeting of 15th September 1983 vividly demonstrates this.</p>    <p><a name="p7.3.15" class="para" id="p7.3.15">7.3.15</a> The reality of the situation, however, was that non-WM directors were not exercising independent judgment.  Indeed, they were inno position to do so given the nature of the business involved and their need to rely on Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung and Mr. Brothers.  Theywere content to follow the dictates of WM.  It is clear to me, and I would so have found, if necessary, that WM was a shadow director.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="7.4">7.4    Fraudulent Intent</a></p>    <p><a name="p7.4.1" class="para" id="p7.4.1">7.4.1</a> WM having been a de facto director and having been instrumental in carrying on WMIâs business and drawing down the two loans, theissue for determination is whether it had an intent to defraud.  This gave rise to a nice pleading point.</p>    <p><a name="p7.4.2" class="para" id="p7.4.2">7.4.2</a> ADSâ allegation was that WM was a director and, like the other Defendants, carried on or took part in fraudulent trading.  As partof the particulars, it was alleged WM did not intend to support. </p>    <p><a name="p7.4.3" class="para" id="p7.4.3">7.4.3</a> WMâs intentions, like those of any other body corporate, can only be derived from the intentions of the directors forming its directingmind and will.  In the case of a small company, with perhaps only two directors of whom one is dominant, that director will almostcertainly be its directing mind and will for all purposes.  In the case of a large company, however, like WM, with diverse businessinterests and operations, its directing mind and will will almost inevitably vary according to which directors are responsible forwhich area of operations.</p>    <p><a name="p7.4.4" class="para" id="p7.4.4">7.4.4</a> As far as WMIâs business was concerned, it is obvious Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung and Mr. Brothers were WMâs directing mind and will. It was also suggested that Mr. Marden should be included but, while he took a deep interest in WMIâs affairs, he was not particularlyinvolved in carrying on WMIâs business.</p>    <p><a name="p7.4.5" class="para" id="p7.4.5">7.4.5</a> In opening, however, Mr. Cullen submitted on day 19 that as far as WM was concerned, the crucial question was whether it was committedto or intended to support WMI.  He said that that intention was to be found in the intentions of non-WMI directors because they werethe ones who would decide upon support and they were WMâs directing mind and will for this purpose.</p>    <p><a name="p7.4.6" class="para" id="p7.4.6">7.4.6</a> Mr. Cullen opened for 20 days.  I intend no criticism.  This judgment will give some indication of why that was necessary.  Afterthe evidence concluded, the parties made written submissions which, all told, came to about 3,000 pages.  After I read these, thehearing resumed for counsel to refine or clarify their submissions.  It was only on day 157, the last but one day of the trial, thatI appreciated the significance of Mr. Cullenâs submission.  I take some comfort from the fact that Mr. Johnson also seemed to havemissed it.</p>    <p><a name="p7.4.7" class="para" id="p7.4.7">7.4.7</a> The significance was that on the evidence, so Mr. Cullen argued, WM had no intention of supporting WMI.  In relation to Sealock,the supporters of Mr. Marden and Mr. Cheung were split 2/2, and in relation to Annalock Mr. Cheungâs supporters were in the majority. As Mr. Cheung would not have supported, the WM Board would either have been split and therefore unable to support, or against support.</p>    <p><a name="p7.4.8" class="para" id="p7.4.8">7.4.8</a> This submission suffered from a number of difficulties.  First, it was not pleaded.  However, no particulars were sought so thisis not the strongest objection.</p>    <p><a name="p7.4.9" class="para" id="p7.4.9">7.4.9</a> I observed that there appears to be no authority on this point.  It seems to me, as I remarked at the time, that where fraud is pleadedfull particulars should be given of how that fraud is to be found.  That will enable the defence to grapple with the allegationsrather than be taken by surprise as the evidence develops.</p>    <p><a name="p7.4.10" class="para" id="p7.4.10">7.4.10</a> Second, it was necessary to impeach for this purpose the honesty of persons not party to the proceedings; who were not, because theissue was not fully appreciated, afforded the opportunity to deal with the allegation. This leaves the Defendants and the court ina difficult and embarrassing position.</p>    <p><a name="p7.4.11" class="para" id="p7.4.11">7.4.11</a> Third and crucially, there is a distinction between WMâs intent to support and WM carrying on or being party to carrying on WMIâsbusiness with intent to defraud creditors.  Who, it must be asked, was WMâs directing mind and will for this latter purpose?  Unquestionably,Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung and Mr. Brothers.  There is no link between WMâs non-WMI directors and the carrying on or participation inthe carrying on of WMIâs business.  This submission therefore does not get off the ground.</p>    <p><a name="p7.4.12" class="para" id="p7.4.12">7.4.12</a> No complaint was made about ADSâ alternative and straightforward approach, i.e. that Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung and Mr. Brothers wereWMâs directing mind and will.  Nor could there be.  No particulars were sought.  As the trial proceeded, the focus was on Mr. Lees,Mr. Leung and Mr. Brothers, not the other WM directors apart from Mr. Ortiz-Patino who maintained he would support anyway.</p>    <p><a name="p7.4.13" class="para" id="p7.4.13">7.4.13</a> WMâs intent in relation to fraudulent trading is therefore to be derived from Mr. Lees, Mr. Leung and Mr. Brothers.

Hence, recovery would be contrary to public policy or offendagainst the principle âex turpi causaâ.  The illegality arises from the fact that the financial arrangements were made subjectto English law; that English law must apply the law of the European Community; that under Community law, the financial arrangementsconstituted state aid and/or foreign credit, the alterations to which were required to be notified to the European Commission; andthat, notification not having been given, the aid was illegal.</a></p>    <p><a name="p8.1.2" class="para" id="p8.1.2">8.1.2</a> <a>In reply, ADS asserts that, even if Community law is relevant, the finance provided did not constitute aid; that in any event, theaid was not incompatible with the Common Market and did not require notification; and that even if the aid was unlawful, it was notprecluded from enforcing contractual obligations which did not constitute part of the aid.</a></p>    <p><a name="p8.1.3" class="para" id="p8.1.3">8.1.3</a> <a>This issue therefore involved an extensive excursion into Community law, in particular competition law, with the aid of two experts,Dr. Richard Plender Q.C., for the Defendants, and Mr. Nicholas Forwood Q.C., for ADS.  Both experts have practised extensively inCommunity law.  In addition, Dr. Plender is a considerable author on matters within that field and on wider aspects of law generally. He has an impressive number of qualifications and academic appointments.  It would not be unfair to characterise Dr. Plenderâsevidence as precise and academic.</a>  <a>Mr. Forwood, in contrast, is a pure practitioner.  This background was reflected in his evidence and led to the challenge that hewas playing the role of advocate rather than disinterested expert.  Early in his evidence, Mr. Forwood perhaps did not do himselfjustice.  But he gradually warmed up and later in cross-examination demonstrated clearly that the opinions he was expressing werethe product of a close scrutiny and careful analysis of the relevant Community legislation and jurisprudence.  Those opinions werenot tailored to meet the particular case.  I acquit Mr. Forwood of behaving other than objectively.  Whether I accept his opinionsis another matter.</a></p>    <p><a name="p8.1.4" class="para" id="p8.1.4">8.1.4</a> <a>I take here the opportunity of rejecting also, and without exploring them, the attacks made on these experts in final submissions.

In this case, for reasons which I did not consider worth investigation,there was no such meeting.  Dr. Plender produced three reports; Mr. Forwood four reports and a position summary.  Once Dr. Plenderbegan giving evidence, it became apparent that there was a number of misunderstandings about the expertsâ respective positions. At my instigation, heads were then put together.  A schedule of issues was produced and, later, an agreed statement of positionssetting out the issues, a brief statement of any common ground and a synopsis of the opposing views where differences remained. This document was of inestimable value to me in penetrating the labyrinth of material which had been placed before me.

After a hearing, he deliversfor the court an opinion upon the questions or issues which arise in the case before it.  After receiving that opinion, the judgesof the court will consider and deliver a judgment.  That judgment is collegiate and formal, a refined product of much deliberation,consultation and even compromise.  It often will not deal with some of the issues if their resolution is not necessary to the resolutionof the dispute before it.  To the extent that the court has not dealt with an issue, the Advocate-Generalâs opinion on that issuebecomes authoritative rather than persuasive and, absent any subsequent judgment by the court on the issue, should not lightly bedeparted from.</a></p>    <p><a name="p8.2.5" class="para" id="p8.2.5">8.2.5</a> <a>In interpreting an Article of any Treaty or other piece of legislation, the ECJ adopts a purposive approach and asks, âwhat is ittrying to achieveâ.

The ECJ is, however, conscious of the need for certainty and will depart from earlier judgments âonly rarelyand with cautionâ, as Dr. Plender put it.</a></p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="8.3">8.3    the legislation</a></p>    <p><a name="p8.3.1" class="para" id="p8.3.1">8.3.1</a> <a>Having established the background against which I should approach Community law, I turn to the particular legislation with which Iam concerned.</a></p>    <p><a name="p8.3.2" class="para" id="p8.3.2">8.3.2</a> <a>Under that part of the Treaty headed âPrinciplesâ, from para.

Second, an obligation on Member States, following notification, not to implement aiduntil the Commission has decided on compatibility.  I shall call this the âstandstillâ.</a></p>    <p><a name="p8.3.5" class="para" id="p8.3.5">8.3.5</a> <a>It was the Defendantsâ case that the Kingdom of Denmark failed in its obligation to notify first, its âplans to grant aidâ,i.e. the original arrangements, and second, its âplans to alter aidâ, i.e. the revised arrangements.  From documents which werediscovered by ADS in March 1996, during the course of the trial, it is now accepted that Denmark did make sufficient notificationof the original arrangements.  The issue dividing the parties therefore crystallized as to whether or not there was a need to notifythe revised arrangements.  That is a matter of Community</a> <a>law.

The first is Council Decision 73/391/EEC dated 3rd December 1973 (the 73 Decision); the second, Council Directive 81/363/EEC dated28th April 1981 (the 5th Directive).  They will be found at App. 6/10 and 17.  The 5th Directive invokes Article 93(3); the 73 Decisioncontains a separate and distinct protocol in relation to foreign or export credits.  Each therefore gives rise to different considerations,the 5th Directive involving state aid which often takes the form of an export credit under the 73 Decision.</a></p>    <p><a name="p8.3.7" class="para" id="p8.3.7">8.3.7</a> <a>The 73 Decision is based on Article 113 of the Treaty.  Its purpose was to arrest the âbeggar your neighbourâ policies of theMember States.  It was made upon a proposal from the Commission and, with effect from 1st January 1974, introduced provisions forâthe procedure for consultation in matters of credit insurance, credit guarantees and financial creditsâ.  I shall call thisâconsultationâ to distinguish it from notification because, as Article 15 of the 73 Decision shows, the Member State initiatingconsultation is free to proceed with its proposal in spite of any adverse comment.

The OECD, in which the Communityis a participant, has sought to regulate the amount of subsidy made available to their domestic yards by participant states havinga shipbuilding industry.  In 1969, the OECD reached agreement on an understanding on export credit for ships.  That understandingwas adjusted from time to time, and by the time relevant to these proceedings an understanding dated 30th July 1981 had been adoptedby the OECD Council (the 81 OECD Understanding) which is at App. 6/22 and whose wording is identical to that adopted by the resolutionof 30th January 1980.</a></p>    <p><a name="p8.3.10" class="para" id="p8.3.10">8.3.10</a> <a>In contrast to the specific provisions of OECD understandings relating to the shipbuilding sector, the OECD in what was called anâinformal Arrangementâ drew up guidelines for the most generous provisions for credit which its participants might offer (theOECD Arrangement).

The guidelines laid down a minimum cash payment of 15% of the price,maximum repayment terms of 8.5 to 10 years and minimum interest rates of 7.5-8%.  They also provided for notification by a participantwhich intended to support terms in excess of the guidelines and for the matching by another participant of those terms.  The OECDArrangement was adopted by the Council by a decision dated 4th April 1978 for a period of 6 months, which was extended from timeto time.

The point in dispute was whether that proposal was one to depart from âany other norm adopted by the MemberStatesâ.  According to Dr. Plender, there were no such norms.  In particular, the 81 OECD Understanding was not a ânorm adoptedby the Member Statesâ, but rather a resolution adopted by the OECD Council in which the Community, but not Member States as such,was a participant.  Therefore there was a requirement to consult pursuant to Article 1 following the procedure laid down in Articles4, 5 and 7.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.2" class="para" id="p8.4.2">8.4.2</a> In his first supplementary report dated July 1995, once the significance of the 73 Decision had begun to emerge, Mr. Forwood wasof the opinion that Member States had adopted a norm in relation to shipbuilding finance in the form of the 81 OECD Understanding. The proposed grant of credit by Denmark did not exceed the limits set out in the Annex to that Understanding.  Accordingly, therewas no obligation to consult.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.3" class="para" id="p8.4.3">8.4.3</a> There the matter rested until March 1996, i.e. the 7th month of trial, when ADS discovered 3 further bundles of documents.  Amongstthe first bundle was a telex dated 17th March 1981 from EKR to the Commission (App. 6/32).  It is accepted that this telex initiatedthe consultation required by the 73 Decision and provided the information required by Article 4 in relation to 4 Panamax vessels,including Sealock and Annalock.  It is also accepted as a matter of Community law that this telex would have constituted notificationfor the purpose of Article 93(3) of the Treaty and Article 10 of the 5th Directive.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.4" class="para" id="p8.4.4">8.4.4</a> The first bundle also contained the comments of three Member States in response to EKRâs telex.  UK had âno comments providedthe starting point is at each or on mean deliveryâ, echoing the wording of paragraph A.I. of Annex I to the 73 Decision; Greeceand Belgium had no comments.  Finally, on 2nd October 1981 EKR advised the Commission that âwe have accepted the transaction onthe terms consultedâ.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.5" class="para" id="p8.4.5">8.4.5</a> It is not surprising therefore that in his second supplementary report dated 28th May 1996, Dr. Plender said that these documentsconfirmed his earlier opinion âthat the proposal to grant export credit was notifiable pursuant to that (73) Decisionâ.  He pointedout that EKR would hardly have consulted the Commission in a form appropriate to Article 4, nor would Member States have respondedas they did, if they had not all shared his view that the proposal to grant export credit required consultation.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.6" class="para" id="p8.4.6">8.4.6</a> Further, said Dr. Plender, Article 4(f) requires the consulting Member State to specify the precise grounds for departing from thenorms mentioned in Article 1.  EKRâs ground was ânormal oecd termsâ.  If OECD terms were a ground for departing from âanyother normâ, it must follow that such terms cannot have been among other norms adopted by the Member States.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.7" class="para" id="p8.4.7">8.4.7</a> In chief, Dr. Plender distinguished between the Community, which was a participant in and a party to the 81 OECD Understanding, andits Member States which were not.  He was of the view that norms adopted by Member States would be something in the nature of furtherCommunity legislation or at least action by Member States in Council having to do with Community law.  Article 1 of the Annex tothe 73 Decision does not denote action by Member States in an entirely different forum.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.8" class="para" id="p8.4.8">8.4.8</a> In cross-examination, Dr. Plender explained his view in this passage (Day 137 pages 162-164):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ:  Why, as a matter of principle or purpose, should an OECD understanding adopted by the Community not be regarded as a norm adoptedby a Member State.  What is the principle behind that?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A:   The principle is the distinction between a matter of Community competence and a matter of Member States competence.  It willbe difficult to find any proposition in Community law more central or fundamental than the transfer of sovereignty from Member Statesto the Community.  Thus, it is a central issue in Community law to determine whether something has been adopted by the Communityor by the Member States.  One would not expect draftsmen of Community legislation to use the term âMember Statesâ when they meanâCommunityâ.  ..... â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Q:   Dr. Plender, I understand when one is talking of questions of sovereignty, but one is looking here at the position really ofEuropean practice, and practice of Member States.  If the Community adopts a norm in its own name, as it were, then why should thatnot be regarded insofar as it is beneficial as having been a norm adopted by Member States, or is it just a matter of practice?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>A:   There is, apart from the principle of sovereignty, an important daily point of practice.  What Article 1 here contemplates isthat norms may be adopted by the Member States, not by the Council, not by the Community, but by the Member States.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>The use of the term âMember Statesâ, which is relatively unusual in a context of this kind, indicates that the norm in questionis to be adopted by the States acting in their capacity as such; that is to say, in their sovereign capacity.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.9" class="para" id="p8.4.9">8.4.9</a> At page 172, in answer to a question from me, Dr. Plender said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âBut the way in which I say Member States would adopt norms is that the Member States, probably meeting in Council, not sittingas the Council of the European Communities, I note, but meeting in Council, would agree upon norms to be added to or to modify thosein the annex.</p>        <p>What is the significance here of norms adopted by the Member States is that it does not say norms adopted by the Council, or by theCommission, it preserves the sovereignty of the Member States in this matter.  So the States, as such, meet in Council and the States,as such, have, under this decision, the power to adopt further norms.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.10" class="para" id="p8.4.10">8.4.10</a> And at page 173,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA:  I say what is contemplated, and has in fact occurred, I believe, is that the Member States, and only the Member States, asMember States, adopt new norms in respect of export credits.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.11" class="para" id="p8.4.11">8.4.11</a> Dr. Plender clarified in re-examination at Day 139 pages 90-92:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.   ...  The relevant distinction here is between the Council, that is the Council of the European Union, on the one hand, andthe Member States on the other.  Where a decision is taken by the Council, the Council acts as an institution of the Community.<br />        The matter in question is a matter falling within Community competence, to the exclusion of the competence of the MemberStates, and accordingly the Council legislates.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It is true that the Council is made up of representatives of the Member States, but it is the Council of the European Union.  Itsdecision is therefore taken on behalf of the union, or the Community. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q:   Does that bind or not bind individual members who, partaking in discussion, dissented or would wish to have dissented from theconclusion?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A:   It binds the entire territory of the Community.  It therefore binds also the territories of any dissentient Member States.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It would not be technically right to say that it binds a Member State, save insofar as Member States have the obligation to co-operatewith one another in the achievement of the Communityâs tasks.  The obligation created by the decision is the obligation incumbentupon the Community.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">On the other hand, there are matters which remain within the sovereignty or competence of the Member States.  Where these matters,falling within the sovereignty or competence of the Member States, are related to or have a bearing upon the operation of the union,or of the Community, then the Member States commonly meet in council.  The French expression is even more picturesque: âReunisau sein du Conseilâ, meeting in the bosom of the Council.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The Member States meet normally in Brussels.  Wherever geographically they happen to meet, they may be meeting in council becausethe matter is related to the Community, but their decision is that of the Member States. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The distinction between what is done by the Member States, on the one hand, even meeting in council, and what is done by the Councilof the Union on the other hand is a very important one.  It has a bearing upon where sovereignty lies.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It also has a bearing upon other issues, such as whether the decision may be reviewed by the Court of Justice of the European Communities. That is a decision adopted by an institution of the Community.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">There are a number of practical consequences which follow from determining whether something is done by the Council or by the MemberStates.  It is for that reason that I would expect any legislation which envisaged measures to be adopted by the Council to use theterm âthe Councilâ and any legislation which envisaged measures to be adopted by the Member States to say âMember Statesâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Where I find legislation referring to measures adopted by Member States, I do not understand that to be a reference to âmeasuresadopted by the Councilâ, even though we all know that the Council is made up of representatives of the Members States.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.12" class="para" id="p8.4.12">8.4.12</a> In cross-examination, a number of passages from the second edition of <u>Introduction to the Law of the European Communities</u> by Kapteyn and Verloren van Themaat were put to Dr. Plender.  These passages were from the chapter on âThe Common Commercial Policyâ. Section 2.1 deals with âThe commercial policy competence of the Communityâ.  Paragraph 2.1.1 explains âThe concept of commercialpolicyâ and begins:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe power to regulate commercial policy relations by unilateral measures concerning imports and exports (autonomous commercialpolicy) or by agreements with third countries (conventional commercial policy) is expressly included in the EEC Treaty in Articles113 and 114.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.13" class="para" id="p8.4.13">8.4.13</a> Paragraph 2.1.2 is entitled âThe exclusivity of Community competence in the field of commercial policyâ and states:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe case-law demonstrates that the Community has exclusive competence in relation to conventional as well as autonomous measures;indeed after the end of the transitional period national commercial policy measures are only permissible by virtue of specific authorisationby the Community.  In Opinion 1/75 the Court based this exclusivity on the ground that the common commercial policy was conceived.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.14" class="para" id="p8.4.14">8.4.14</a> To the latter passage, Dr. Plender paid particular attention (Day 138 page 8) in support of the distinction to be drawn between thecompetence of the Community to adopt measures and the competence of Member States to do so.  He maintained that significance shouldbe attached to the use of the words âMember Statesâ (i.e. in Article 1) rather than the Community.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.15" class="para" id="p8.4.15">8.4.15</a> Paragraph 2.1.2 then went on to deal with Opinion 1/75  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20ECR%201355" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) ECR 1355</a> upon which much of section 2.1 in Kapteynâs book is based.  This Opinion was obtained under Article 228 of the Treaty which enablesthe Commission to seek the opinion of the ECJ as to the compatibility with the Treaty of an international agreement.  In Opinion1/75, the compatibility of a draft âunderstanding on a local cost standardâ, drawn up under the auspices of the OECD, was inquestion.  In turn, this raised the issue of whether the Community had power to conclude this understanding and if so, whether thepower was exclusive.  At page 1363 in relation to exclusivity, the Opinion said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â2.  The exclusive nature of the Communityâs powers</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The reply to this question depends, on the one hand, on the objective of the Understanding in question and, on the other hand, onthe manner in which the common commercial policy is conceived in the Treaty.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">At Nos I and II the Understanding itself defines the transactions to which the common standard applies, and those which, on the otherhand, are excluded from its field of application because they are directed to specifically military ends or because they have beenentered into with developing countries.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It is to be understood from this definition that the subject-matter of the standard, and therefore of the Understanding, is one ofthose measures belonging to the common commercial policy prescribed by Article 113 of the Treaty.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Such a policy is conceived in that article in the context of the operation of the Common Market, for the defence of the common interestsof the Community, within which the particular interests of the Member States must endeavour to adapt to each other.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Quite clearly, however, this conception is incompatible with the freedom to which the Member States could lay claim by invoking aconcurrent power, so relations, at the risk of compromising the effective defence of the common interests of the Community.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In fact any unilateral action on the part of the Member States would lead to disparities in the conditions for the grant of exportcredits, calculated to distort competition between undertakings of the various Member States in external markets.  Such distortioncan be eliminated only by means of a strict uniformity of credit conditions granted to undertakings in the Community, whatever theirnationality.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It cannot therefore be accepted that, in a field such as that governed by the Understanding in question, which is covered by exportpolicy and more generally by the common commercial policy, the Member States should exercise a power concurrent to that of the Community,in the Community sphere and in the international sphere.  The provisions of Articles 113 and 114 concerning the conditions underwhich, according to the Treaty, agreements on commercial policy must be concluded show clearly that the exercise of concurrent powersby the Member States and the Community in this matter is impossible.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">To accept that the contrary were true would amount to recognizing that, in relations with third countries, Member States may adoptpositions which differ from those which the Community intends to adopt, and would thereby distort the institutional framework, callinto question the mutual trust within the Community and prevent the latter from fulfilling its task in the defence of the commoninterest.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.16" class="para" id="p8.4.16">8.4.16</a> This passage, said Dr. Plender, again reinforces his point.  If the 81 OECD Understanding constituted a norm, which he did not accept,then it was a norm adopted by the Community both as a participant in the OECD and as a Community.  The entire Community is then committedto it and derives benefits and obligations.  The Community is the party to the international engagement.  The consequences of thatengagement flow to individual Member States including those which may have been in a minority in a Community vote on whether or notto enter the engagement.  It is not, however, open to Member States to adopt this norm, because competence to do so lies exclusivelywith the community.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.17" class="para" id="p8.4.17">8.4.17</a> Next, in Kapteynâs work at section 2.3 âCommercial policy arrangementsâ, para. 2.3.1 deals with âAutonomous commercial policy;regulation of imports and exportsâ. At page 805 is the passage:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIn relation to the manner in which the Member States promote exports to third countries relatively little has been done in theway of introducing uniform principles in the sense of Article 113 EEC.  Article 112(1) EEC provided for a progressive harmonisationby the end of the transitional period of the systems by which the Member States grant aid for exports to third countries âto theextent necessary to ensure that competition between undertakings of the Community is not distorted.â  Such a harmonisation haspretty well not taken place.  In the closely related field of <i>export credits, guarantees and insurance</i> a group of officials is entrusted with the co-ordination of Member Statesâ policies in these matters and an information and consultationprocedure is prescribed.  The Council has also adopted a number of directives in this field although it has not yet proved possibleto bring them into force in the absence of agreement on a common premium system.</p>        <p>In the meantime by a decision on April 4, 1978 the Council adopted on behalf of the Community the OECD consensus reached as an Arrangementon Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits.  The Commission negotiated the adoption of these Guidelines on the basis ofCommunityâs exclusive competence recognised by the Courtâs Opinion.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.18" class="para" id="p8.4.18">8.4.18</a> On this, Dr. Plender made two points.  First, the text correctly mentions that what has been done in relation to export credits,etc. has been done by co-ordination of Member Statesâ policies and this reinforces the distinction between measures adopted byMember States and those adopted by the Community.  Footnote 167 to the passage then singled out the 73 Decision as an area for co-operationbetween Member States.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.19" class="para" id="p8.4.19">8.4.19</a> Second, said Dr. Plender, the text again correctly records that the Council adopted the OECD Arrangement âon behalf of the Communityâ,not Member States.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.20" class="para" id="p8.4.18">8.4.20</a> Finally, Dr. Plender gave two further reasons why the 73 Decision is inapt to the 81 OECD Understanding.  On Day 138 at page 28,he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âA:  The reference in Council Decision 73/391 to the adoption of norms by Member States was inserted in anticipation of the adoptionof norms stricter than those laid down in the decision.</p>        <p>The drafting is such that there is a contravention of the norms laid out in this decision, even though there may be compliance withsome wider norm or standard elsewhere.  But if there is a stricter norm, then Council Decision 73/391 would bite upon it.  That waswhat the draftsman had in mind in speaking of consultation in the event of departure from these norms, or other norms which mightbe adopted by the Member States.</p>        <p>So the case of the OECD understanding is quite the opposite, that is to say a looser norm.  But there would always be a contraventionof the norm laid down here, even if there were compliance with a looser norm elsewhere.  That is another reason why it seems to methat the reference to the understanding is inapt.</p>        <p>A third is that the OECD understanding was entered into, of course, by a wide variety of States.  What is envisaged here, when referenceis made to the adoption of norms by Member States, is the progressive tightening by these Member States of the standards here laiddown.</p>        <p>In the event, the tightening that was anticipated in 1973 has not occurred, largely in consequence of the enlargement of the Community,and hence the difficulty of obtaining unanimity.</p>        <p>I say for all of those reasons that the Council Decision 73/391 is inapt to the OECD understanding and I say that the proof of thepudding is this: not only was the present case notified and regarded as normal, but to the best of my knowledge, and I have madeenquiries, Member States have regularly notified to the Commission grants of export credits consistent with OECD terms, month inand month out, for 23 years, and the argument that they were not obliged to do so has never, to be best of my knowledge and thatof the Commission, been advanced.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.21" class="para" id="p8.4.21">8.4.21</a> Mr. Forwoodâs position was clarified in chief.  He said that it is now common ground that following Opinion 1/75 given on 11thNovember 1975, the adoption of norms as to the terms of export credits to be granted by Member States falls within the scope of theCommon Commercial Policy and thus within the exclusive competence of the Community.  There is no longer any room for Member Statesto adopt norms.  He then put the position thus on Day 140 at page 70:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âThe choice, in effect, that your Lordship is faced with is to decide whether the European Court would therefore construe the wordsâa norm adopted by the Member Statesâ, in the 1973 decision, in a manner that would render it essentially empty of content, sincethe Member States acting as such, otherwise than through the Community, could not either individually or collectively lawfully adoptsuch a norm; or, whether it should be construed in a purposive manner that would envisage the adoption of such norms in the onlyway that Member States could lawfully adopt such norms, namely by the Council under Article 113 as part of the common commercialpolicy.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.22" class="para" id="p8.4.22">8.4.22</a> Mr. Forwood said it was his belief that the 73 Decision was worded as it was because, until 1975, there existed some doubt betweenMember States and Community institutions as to the extent to which Member States had any residual competence in the area of the CommonCommercial Policy.  He explained that there had been a number of OECD Understandings in relation to export credit for ships goingback to 1968 or 1969.  Until 1979, however, such understandings were adopted by Member States rather than by the Community.  Thereforeat the time of the 73 Decision by the Council there were already norms adopted by Member States in the form of the earlier OECD Understandingsand there was reason to think that any further amendments to OECD Understandings would be negotiated by Member States.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.23" class="para" id="p8.4.23">8.4.23</a> In support of his belief, Mr. Forwood referred to one of the three new bundles of documents I mentioned earlier.  This bundle containeda number of Council decisions, including one dated 24th July 1979.  In keeping with Community protocol, the Commission had made aproposal in relation to the OECD.  In response, the Councilâs decision provided that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âDuring the negotiations within the OECD about the Communityâs participation in the export credit understanding for ships as wellas in the alteration of this understanding, the Commission shall express the Communityâs position in accordance with the negotiationdirectives set out in the Annex hereto.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.24" class="para" id="p8.4.24">8.4.24</a> The Annex to that decision read:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â<u>I.  UNDERSTANDING COVERED BY THE</u></p>        <p>NEGOTIATION DIRECTIVES</p>        <p>The understanding in question is the export credit understanding for ships which follows on from the OECD Councilâs resolution of30th May 1969 with subsequent alterations.</p>        <p>II.  NEGOTIATION DIRECTIVES</p>        <p>A.  <u>The Communityâs participation:</u></p>        <p>It should be ensured that the Community as such participates in the agreement instead of the Member States.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.25" class="para" id="p8.4.25">8.4.25</a> The Annex went on to spell out credit terms and procedures.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.26" class="para" id="p8.4.26">8.4.26</a> Mr. Forwood said that that Decision confirms that this was the time when OECD Understandings were transformed from agreements betweenOECD members, including Community Member States, into agreements between the Community and other members of the OECD, not includingMember States of the Community.  Accordingly, said Mr. Forwood, the ECJ would, applying a purposive interpretation, extend the wordsâadopted by the Member Statesâ to measures adopted by the Community in exercise of the Common Commercial Policy which had previouslybeen adopted by Member States.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.27" class="para" id="p8.4.27">8.4.27</a> In cross-examination, Mr. Forwood was constrained to accept that he is not an expert on OECD matters.  He maintained however thatMember States of the Community are members of the OECD as independent sovereign states and take part in working groups.  Since 1978,however, when obligations arise in parallel with Community obligations, Member States have participated through the Community.  Before1978, Member States remained independent parties to any understandings.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.28" class="para" id="p8.4.28">8.4.28</a> More crucially, Mr. Forwood was pursued about the plain wording âadopted by the Member Statesâ.  He was referred to <u>Kapteyn</u> and in particular the passage at page 805 which I have already set out.  Mr. Johnson suggested a distinction was being drawn betweenthe Commissionâs participation in OECD negotiations and commitments and Member States being able to make domestic arrangementsbetween themselves.  That suggestion Mr. Forwood rejected because of the Communityâs exclusive competence in Common CommercialPolicy matters as laid down in Opinion 1/75 which competence, he said, was both external and internal.  He said that is what Kapteynrefers to at para. 2.1.2 where the text speaks of âconventional as well as autonomous measuresâ.  Where, at page 806, Kapteynrefers to âthe co-ordination of Member States policiesâ and, in the relevant footnote, to the 73 Decision, Mr. Forwood was ofthe view that a different distinction was in issue.  He said that at the end of the transitional period provided for in the Treaty,trade policies of individual Member States did not automatically come to an end, but were gradually superseded by the developmentof the Common Commercial Policy.  After the transition, however, Member States were precluded by virtue of Opinion 1/75 from enteringnew commercial commitments.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.29" class="para" id="p8.4.29">8.4.29</a> Dealing with Opinion 1/75, Mr. Forwood said that the reference by the ECJ to âin the community sphere and in the internationalsphereâ showed the internal and external aspects.  He accepted the obvious danger of Member States being able to make separatearrangements from the Community in international matters but would not accept that that logic would have no application to domesticnegotiations between Member States, e.g. to reduce the length of the credit term and thus establish a new norm for the purpose ofArticle 1 of the 73 Decision.  Mr. Forwood explained that under Article 113 of the Treaty, Common Commercial Policy measures aremade upon a proposal from the Commission adopted by the Council on a qualified majority basis.  It would be inconsistent with theconcept of a Common Commercial Policy and the exclusive nature of the Communityâs powers to adopt policy in this area by a decisionof Member States, even if unanimous, on something which the Commission itself did not think desirable.  The involvement of the Commissioncould thus be circumvented.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.30" class="para" id="p8.4.30">8.4.30</a> Therefore, while the procedure required under Article 113 of the Treaty had been followed in relation to the 73 Decision and thewords in issue used, it would nonetheless be contemplated that any amendment of the norms contained in Annex 1 would be by way ofsimilar procedure.  Mr. Forwoodâs view was that the ECJ would be unlikely to uphold as valid an aspect of Common Commercial Policyformulated other than as required by Article 113, that is by the Council.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.31" class="para" id="p8.4.31">8.4.31</a> It was then suggested to Mr. Forwood that the words in issue fall within the second part of the passage I have set out from para.2.1.2 of Kapteyn.  That passage is derived from the judgment of the ECJ in <i><u>Suzanne Criel, nÃ©e Donckerwolcke and Henri Schou v. Procureur de la RÃ©publique au Tribunal de grande Instance, Lille</u></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20ECR%201921" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) ECR 1921</a> where the court was considering the Common Commercial Policy and âfree circulationâ of goods originating outside the Community. At page 1937, the court said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe fact that at the expiry of the transitional period the Community commercial policy was not fully achieved is one of a numberof circumstances calculated to maintain in being between the Member States differences in commercial policy capable of bringing aboutdeflections of trade or of causing economic difficulties in certain Member States.</p>        <p class="quote">Article 115 allows difficulties of this kind to be avoided by giving to the Commission the power to authorize Member States to takeprotective measures particularly in the form of derogation from the principle of free circulation within the Community of productswhich originated in third countries and which were put into free circulation in one of the Member States.</p>        <p class="quote">Because they constitute not only an exception to the provisions of Articles 9 and 30 of the Treaty which are fundamental to the operationof the Common Market, but also an obstacle to the implementation of the  common commercial policy provided for by Article 113, thederogations allowed under Article 115 must be strictly interpreted and applied.</p>        <p class="quote">It is in the light of this interpretation that the compatibility of the âmonitoring measuresâ described above with the rules concerningthe free circulation of goods within the Community should be considered.</p>        <p class="quote">First of all it should be stressed with regard to the scope of such provisions, that under Article 115 limitations may only be placedon the free movement within the Community of goods enjoying the right to free circulation by virtue of measures of commercial policyadopted by the importing Member State in accordance with the Treaty.</p>        <p class="quote">As full responsibility in the matter of commercial policy was transferred to the Community by means of Article 113(1) measures ofcommercial policy of a national character are only permissible after the end of the transitional period by virtue of specific authorizationby the Community.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.32" class="para" id="p8.4.32">8.4.32</a> As Mr. Forwood pointed out, full responsibility for the Common Commercial Policy had been transferred to the Community by Article113 of the Treaty.  The only derogation from that principle exists by virtue of Article 115 which permits the Commission, <u>not the Council</u>, to allow Member States to take specific action in certain circumstances.  He said that Article 1 of the 73 Decision could not thereforehave been intended as an application of the derogation provisions of Article 115.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.33" class="para" id="p8.4.33">8.4.33</a> Mr. Forwood suggested that the words in issue might reflect not a derogation but a recognition of norms previously adopted by MemberStates in earlier OECD Understandings.  He did not accept that the word âadoptedâ was exclusively prospective.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.34" class="para" id="p8.4.34">8.4.34</a> As to the nature of the 73 Decision, Mr. Forwood agreed that it is wide, covering exports of goods and services without limitation,and that it contains a uniform application of the restrictions or norms imposed by Annex 1.  He also accepted that the words âanyother normâ in Article 1 contemplated a provision which would fit in with the existing scheme and purpose, but added that theycould envisage the adoption of norms in specific sectors.  He further accepted, as Dr. Plender had suggested, that at the time the73 Decision was made, there was generally a drive to reduce export credits so that the Decision envisaged a strengthening of anynorms although the wording of the Decision itself did not necessarily dictate that.  Mr. Forwood said, and saw no difficulty in it,that paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Annex 1 of the 80 OECD Understanding could be regarded as norms which might be adopted in relationto the shipbuilding sector and which, while extending the credit period, imposed a restriction in relation to the interest rate.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.35" class="para" id="p8.4.35">8.4.35</a> The OECD Understanding was, of course, relied on in Article 2 of the 5th Directive.  Mr. Forwood disagreed, however, that that wasthe extent to which the Community wished to take account of that Understanding.  He said the primary purpose of the Directive wasto allow for compatibility in relation to export credit arrangements falling within the scope of the Understanding.  It was concernedwith state aid to shipbuilding and was not an exhaustive statement of the scope of export credit.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.36" class="para" id="p8.4.36">8.4.36</a> The biggest problem Mr. Forwood had to overcome, however, was the EKR telex of 17th March 1981 which began consultation.  He hadto accept that there was nothing to indicate that it was not routine; also that by specifying ânormal oecd termsâ an inferenceto be drawn was that the Danish authorities recognised the transaction was outside the terms of Article 1; and that the responseswere normal.  He suggested, however, that an explanation might be that some doubt existed as to whether OECD terms were outside theconsultation procedure and that having regard to the obligation on Member States to co-operate, States had agreed informally to consultin such circumstances whatever the true legal position.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.37" class="para" id="p8.4.37">8.4.37</a> Dr. Plender had made enquiries of the Commission and discovered that, for over 20 years, Member States had consistently consultedover OECD terms.  Mr. Forwood had not himself made any such enquiries.  He was not prepared to draw any conclusion from this practice.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.38" class="para" id="p8.4.38">8.4.38</a> I come to the conclusion that Mr. Forwood is correct in his historical analysis.  It is plain from Opinion 1/75 that until November1975, there was uncertainty as to Member Statesâ competence in relation to the Common Commercial Policy.  It is also plain fromthe Council Decision dated 24th July 1979 that, as late as 1979, Member States had had some independent role in relation to the OECDand its earlier understandings.  It is therefore understandable that the words âadopted by the Member Statesâ were used in 1973. What is less easy to understand is why the words were not appropriately amended in 1985 when the 73 Decision was amended on theaccession of Spain and Portugal.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.39" class="para" id="p8.4.39">8.4.39</a> It would not make sense, however, for âadoptedâ to be interpreted other than prospectively.  To do otherwise would be to causeArticle 1 to embrace, in a matter of no small importance to the common commercial policy, unspecified norms agreed upon by MemberStates at an earlier stage of the Communityâs development, norms which would in all probability be more generous and which wouldtherefore offend against what was clearly intended to be a more rigorous regime.  If other norms already existed the Council could,and no doubt would, have spelt them out in successive Decisions in order to avoid uncertainty and argument.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.40" class="para" id="p8.4.40">8.4.40</a> After November 1975, I am satisfied that norms in relation to the Common Commercial Policy, of which the 73 Decision was part, couldonly be adopted by the Council in exercise of the Communityâs exclusive competence in the field of that policy.  It would not beacceptable, as Mr. Forwood said, to allow that policy to be circumvented by Member States acting independently and contrary to Article113.  If Article 1 of the 73 Decision, therefore, is to have any sensible meaning and effect, it seems to me likely that the ECJif asked to interpret this provision would, in applying a purposive approach, inevitably read âCommunityâ for âMember Statesâ.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.41" class="para" id="p8.4.41">8.4.41</a> It is true that from the 2nd Directive onward the Council has directed that aid relating to shipbuilding may be compatible if itcomplies with the OECD understanding in force at the time.  It is also not difficult to extract from such OECD understandings provisionswhich might be regarded as norms for the purpose of the 73 Decision.  But I do not regard the recognition of OECD understandingsby the Council in Directives, which were aimed at eliminating or controlling distortion, and at curbing the propping up of ailingshipyards, as adopting norms for the purpose of export credits generally.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.42" class="para" id="p8.4.42">8.4.42</a> I find as a fact therefore that under Community law no other norms had been adopted for the purpose of Article 1 of the 73 Decisionand consultation was therefore required where a Member State proposed to grant or guarantee foreign credit on OECD terms.  As Denmarkproposed such terms it was required to consult.  I am fortified in this finding by the fact that consultation was initiated.  I reject,without an instantâs hesitation, the notion that consultation took place simply as a precaution. </p>    <p><u>Issue 2</u>:  Was there an obligation to notify the initial proposal under Articles 4 and 7?</p>    <p><u>Issue 3</u>:  Was that initial proposal notified?</p>    <p><u>Issue 4</u>:  Was there a proposal to offer new basic terms of credit which differ from those initially specified?</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.43" class="para" id="p8.4.43">8.4.43</a> Assuming the resolution of Issue 1 in favour of the Defendants, as I have found, it is common ground that the answer to these threeissues is âyesâ.</p>    <p><u>Issue 5</u>:  Was there</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) a breach of the obligation to notify new terms without more, or</p>        <p>(b) only such a breach if the new proposal was made before a final decision to grant credit (i.e. where it is still a proposal oronly a conditional agreement to grant credit), but the breach did occur before such final decision?</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.44" class="para" id="p8.4.44">8.4.44</a> I have used the expertsâ formulation of these issues although, of course, the obligation referred to is one to consult rather thanto notify.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.45" class="para" id="p8.4.45">8.4.45</a> The point at issue is whether under Article 8 of the Annex to the 73 Decision a proposal of ânew basic terms of creditâ givesrise to ârenewed consultationâ, not only before a final decision to grant credit has been made but also after such a decision.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.46" class="para" id="p8.4.46">8.4.46</a> It was Dr. Plenderâs opinion that the obligation to renew consultation is not extinguished upon the âfinal decisionâ of theconsulting Member State referred to in Article 15 of the Annex but continues thereafter.  There was some debate about the meaningof âfinal decisionâ.  Dr. Plender expressed it as âthe decision ultimately taken by the consulting state on the question ofwhether it will grant the credit in questionâ.  This is exemplified by the EKR telex dated 2nd October 1981 notifying the Commissionthat it âaccepted the transactionâ.  Mr. Forwood, however, was of the view that it was the formal commitment by the Member Stateto the prospective recipient of the credit, e.g. WMIâs two subsidiaries which were intending to place or at least confirm ordersfor the construction of the two vessels.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.47" class="para" id="p8.4.47">8.4.47</a> My view is that in this Decision the Council was concerned, inter alia, that the Member States and Commission be given the opportunityto consider, comment on and object to credit terms going outside the norms and to know at the earliest opportunity whether or notthe proposal under consultation was to proceed, with or without amendment, or to be withdrawn.  The Council was not, it seems tome, concerned with the formal commitment by the consulting state to a third party which might or might not be more or less contemporaneous.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.48" class="para" id="p8.4.48">8.4.48</a> In cross-examination, Dr. Plender justified his opinion thus.  The overall aim of the 73 Decision was to end or at least reduce thetendency of Member States to apply a âbeggar your neighbourâ policy in relation to export credits; and to ensure that MemberStates and the Commission had an opportunity to scrutinise proposals and express views about them although Article 10 does not givea Member State power to veto a proposal (see Day 136 page 29).  The hope would be, however, that where other states voiced strongobjection, the consulting member might be dissuaded from pursuing its proposal.  That was the purpose for requiring suspension pendingthe outcome of consultation (see Day 136 page 54).</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.49" class="para" id="p8.4.49">8.4.49</a> While Dr. Plender saw this as the principal purpose of the requirement to consult, a subsidiary purpose is to allow undertakings,e.g. shipyards in other Member States, to make matching offers in appropriate circumstances.  He did not discount matching as a purpose,but pointed out that in the case of a substantial contract, there might not be sufficient time to permit matching.  He emphasisedthe principal purpose to be to arrest or reduce the tendency of Member States to offer more and more attractive credits resultingin an increasingly expensive and distorting spiral (see Day 138 pages 51-52).  Dr. Plender later added that alterations to a credit,if more attractive and expensive, may have the same distorting effect as if offered initially (see Day 138 page 60).</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.50" class="para" id="p8.4.50">8.4.50</a> Dr. Plender was then asked what would be the purpose of consultation after the contract underlying the export credit terms had beenplaced, e.g. a formal order for construction of vessels is given to a shipyard, so that any element of competition was already spent. His answer at Day 135 page 62 was:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âMy short answer to that is because Member States have an acute and continuing interest in the grant of export credit terms andmay wish to raise objections under Article 10.  The Member State would wish to know what I at the moment would wish to know: whatwill happen if the revision does not take place?  If it does not take place, what consequences will follow for the industry in question?</p>        <p>Now, I put forward one scenario as a possibility, I do not know.  It may be that in those circumstances WMI would have been unable,or its subsidiaries would have been unable to service the loans.  It may be that the mortgages over the vessels would not have beensufficient to cover the total purchase price from B&amp;W.  It may be that the coverage given by EKR to B&amp;W would not be sufficient. It may be that the consequence would be that B&amp;W would then be placed in a less advantageous position, perhaps even a seriouslyless advantageous position.</p>        <p>If any of those hypotheses were correct, then the variation of the terms would be a matter to which others might well object.  Theymight say: âThis variation strengthens the position of your shipyard and a condition in which it would otherwise be less able tocompete in the future with the shipyards of other Member States.  If amounts, even, to a new grant of aidâ.  They simply wouldwant to know.  The short answer to your question, âWhy notify?â; the answer is because other Member States would want to know.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and at page 64:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âPerhaps the most important reason why other Member States needed to be notified in the first place is that they would want to verifycompliance by the notifying authorities with any conditions of relevance in their bilateral or multilateral relations.  The reasonwhy they would want to be notified of a change is precisely the same, they would want to verify compliance with any bilateral ormultilateral negotiations.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.51" class="para" id="p8.4.51">8.4.51</a> As to whether there was any point in suspending a decision to alter terms of credit after a contract had been placed, Dr. Plenderdrew a distinction between the contract and the proposed new terms of the credit.  The new terms, he said, would not yet have beenimplemented and the consulting Member State must in good faith consult, entertain any objections and consider although not necessarilyaccept them.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.52" class="para" id="p8.4.52">8.4.52</a> Mr. Forwoodâs opinion was that consultation about new basic terms is only required up to the point when the consulting state makesa firm commitment to a purchaser or recipient of credit.  Shortly before the expert evidence began, when the Defendantsâ positionon Article 8 emerged, he summarised his position thus</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)   the objective of the 73 Decision (like the OECD Arrangement and Understanding) is to reduce distortion of competition in theplacing of orders for exports of goods and services through subsidized credit.</p>        <p>(b)   The scheme of the procedure is that consultation should take place where it is âproposedâ to grant or guarantee foreigncredits and before a final âdecisionâ is taken to grant such credits (see Articles 1, 4(e), 7, 8, 13, 15).</p>        <p>(c)   Article 8 applies where <u>before</u> a final decision is taken, there is a change in the <u>proposed</u> terms of credit (or a change in factors).</p>        <p>(d)   Article 8 does not apply where a change is made to the terms of a credit months or even years after the decision to grant thecredit has become âfinalâ.  By then the order in respect of which the credit was given will have been placed.</p>        <p>(e)   This conclusion is confirmed by the first part of Article 8 which requires a renewed consultation upon a change in factors. While this requirement is understandable if the factors justifying a departure cease to apply before the decision to grant the proposedcredit becomes âfinalâ and an order is placed on the basis thereof, it is purposeless to require renewed consultation if theâchangeâ takes place after the proposed credit has become final and the order placed.</p>        <p>(f)    Nor is it apparent what, if any, useful purpose is served by requiring a renewed consultation in respect of an alteration tothe terms of credit even after that credit has been âfinallyâ agreed to and acted upon.  If there is such an obligation, doesit extend to alterations taking place even in year 8 of an 8Â½ year credit?</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.53" class="para" id="p8.4.53">8.4.53</a> In chief, Mr. Forwood amplified reasons (b) and (c).  He said that section I of the Annex to the 73 Decision is entitled âScopeâ. Article 1 then requires consultation âwhere it is proposed ...â.  Once credit is no longer a proposal but has been granted,the consultation procedure prescribed in section II of the Annex would not have any application.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.54" class="para" id="p8.4.54">8.4.54</a> Mr. Forwood then focused on âchanges in factorsâ in the first part of Article 8.  He said these referred to (Day 140/79-80):</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â ... changes that take place between the moment of the original notification, when a certain number of factors will have been setout to justify departure; and the final decision to grant credit.  In other words, if you ask for a dispensation on the basis ofa certain - on a certain basis, and then before you come to give the credit those grounds no longer appear to apply, then you areobliged to go back.</p>        <p>It would not seem to me to be consistent with the scheme of the decision, or indeed to serve any useful purpose, to require a renewedconsultation if the changes, in factors justifying departure, take place after the decision has become final, and indeed after therelated contract has been entered into and even performed.</p>        <p>It seems to me, therefore, to follow that the only changes that are envisaged in relation to the first part of the article are changesbetween the original consultation and the placing of the order.  That, in my submission - I say âsubmissionâ, I mean âopinionâ- points towards the conclusion that the second possibility envisaged there, alteration in terms of the credit, likewise is limitedto that situation.</p>        <p>In relation to that, I draw comfort from the use of the words ânew basic terms of the credit are proposedâ, rather than, perhaps,the words such as âif there is any alteration to the basic terms of creditâ: in other words, the emphasis being on the projectstill being at the stage of a proposal, rather than after the moment of implementation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.55" class="para" id="p8.4.55">8.4.55</a> As far as the importance of competition is concerned, Mr. Forwood referred to the 81 OECD Understanding.  His analysis of paragraphs6 and 7 was that (Day 140/83-84):</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â ... the scheme is that the purpose of giving notice is to allow effective competition, to allow other States to be able to competeeffectively, and the obligation on the part of the States is not to provide support for any order finally placed on more favourableterms, before all other participants have been given the due notice.  It is relevant there to note, therefore, that the formal prohibitionon action of the State is to refuse support on more favourable terms for the order finally placed. </p>        <p>In other words, if you like, the determining question is whether at the time of the final placing of the order you have or have notoffered as a State credit terms on which there has been appropriate consultation.</p>        <p>Now, that seems to me relevant in the context of the present case, of arguing - of the relevant - for the purpose of assessing whetherArticle 8 is to be interpreted as requiring a renewed consultation, even after, to use the terms of the 1978 decision - the 1973decision, the decision to grant the credit has become final.  I realise there is a slight difference of terminology between the decisionbecoming final and the order being finally placed, but by and large those two events will broadly be contemporaneous.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.56" class="para" id="p8.4.56">8.4.56</a> Mr. Forwood also drew attention to the editorâs note in the Encyclopaedia of European Law in relation to the 73 Decision whichreads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe fundamental aim of the consultation procedure set out in the present Decision is to ensure that Member States keep their creditterms broadly in line, and that no single state obtains any undue competitive advantage ...â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.57" class="para" id="p8.4.57">8.4.57</a> In cross-examination, Mr. Johnson postulated the position where, between the consulting state formally committing itself to givecredit and actually granting it to a customer, i.e. before any money is put at risk, terms have to be rescheduled because the customercan no longer meet the repayment schedule.  He asked why the decision to reschedule, which is operative to advance money, is notthe âfinal decisionâ.  Mr. Forwood replied that it was because it was not âthe relevant final decision for the purpose of assessingwhether the offer of export credit terms has influenced the placing of the orderâ.  He said the intention of the 73 Decision wasto provide a mechanism for ensuring that competition for the placing of orders for goods and services takes place on a level playingfield.  In the example given, the game had already been played and won, so there was no realistic possibility of the order and competitionfor it being re-opened.  There would be no risk of the credit spiral to which Dr. Plender had referred.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.58" class="para" id="p8.4.58">8.4.58</a> The position was also put to Mr. Forwood of an order for the purchase of a vessel being placed before any proposal for credit wasmade.  Mr. Forwood agreed that in such circumstances there would be no possibility of distorting competition and no point in consultation. Yet that was the position in the instant case.  The building contracts were entered into on 24th February 1981; the âfinal decisionâi.e. the offer and acceptance of the loans, did not take place until some months later.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.59" class="para" id="p8.4.59">8.4.59</a> Mr. Forwood was also cross-examined on his reason (f), that suspension under Article 10(3) pending consultation would be pointless,the credit already having been committed and acted upon.  It was put to him that other Member States would still wish to know whetherthe consulting state was complying with its obligations.  He said (Day 141/88):</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âI can understand that a Member State or the Commission might wish to know whether other Member States had or had not subsequentlyaltered the terms for a particular contract, and therefore I can at least see an interest of the type described by Dr. Plender inrelation to the possibility of monitoring subsequent action by the States after the order became final.  But the point that I ammaking is that although I can understand that as an argument, but I do not agree with it in relation to Article 8, it seems to methere is no purpose in that situation in requiring the suspension under Article 10(3), which is for a different purpose altogether;namely to allow the competition to proceed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.60" class="para" id="p8.4.60">8.4.60</a> In my view, however, a telling passage was this.  It was common ground that Member States are sensitive to any departure from OECDterms and would be likely to oppose or enquire about any proposal to depart from such terms.  It was put to Mr. Forwood that if,before any money was put at risk, there was a change from OECD terms other Member States would wish to know.  Mr. Forwood said thesame sensitivity would not arise and that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is not uncommon for agreed credit arrangements to have to be revised, and so long as other states were satisfied that this was,if you like, a normal credit revision, rather than some backhanded subsidy, I do not see that they would be particularly concerned.â<br />        (Day 141 page 86)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.4.61" class="para" id="p8.4.61">8.4.61</a> Of course, Member States will not know the nature of the new arrangements unless they are consulted, so it seems to me that Mr. Forwoodeffectively accepted that Member States wish to know what is going on.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.62" class="para" id="p8.4.62">8.4.62</a> It is my view, and I find, that the principal purpose of the 73 Decision is to ensure that Member States are kept informed aboutcredit terms.  Given the short time limits provided for in section II and the paucity of the information required by Article 4 ofthe Annex; the fact that the consulting state does not have to give in to any objections; and that, in practical terms, the finaldecision or commitment to the grant of credit will be a more or less contemporaneous with, or even after, the order for goods, itseems to me that the competition factor is very much a subsidiary factor as Dr. Plender suggested.  Indeed, it seems plain to methat the whole thrust of the 73 Decision is directed towards the exchange of information rather than the opening up of a spiritedbidding for the contract in question.</p>    <p><a name="p8.4.63" class="para" id="p8.4.63">8.4.63</a> In the present case, events had overtaken the parties.  There was by then a new proposal - to revise the grant of credit to alloweven more generous terms.  That seems to me to be precisely the situation that calls for consultation.

The agreement of the DanishCentral Bank to re-purchase at par low interest bonds issued by ADS amounted to aid by a Member State or through state resources. It is also common ground that the aid was liable to affect trade between Member States (should that issue arise in a national court). The issue is whether the initial financing arrangements fell outside Article 93(3) and the 5th Directive because</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)   they conformed with the 81 OECD Understanding and were therefore not liable to distort competition; or</p>        <p>(2)   anything relevant which was granted was not aid to shipbuilding, specifically to BW.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.2" class="para" id="p8.5.2">8.5.2</a> It is probably helpful to begin by clarifying Article 92(1).  Aid granted by a Member State only becomes objectionable, i.e. incompatiblewith the Common Market, unless the Commission determines otherwise, if it distorts or threatens to distort competition (I shall simplyrefer to this as âdistortionâ) and affects or is likely to affect trade between Member States.  If a Member State grants aidon commercial terms, then it is not objectionable.  But âaidâ and âcommercial termsâ are almost a contradiction because âaidâreally only occurs where commercial terms are unobtainable or at least unwise.  It was nicely put by Mr. Advocate-General Jacobsin <i><u>Kingdom of Spain v. the Commission</u></i> (Joined Cases C-278/92, C-279/92 and C-280/92) at para. 28:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â28. Although it is sometimes suggested that financial assistance granted by the State must, in order to qualify as State aid, begratuitous, the better view is surely that State aid is granted whenever a Member State makes available to an undertaking funds whichin the normal course of events would not be provided by a private investor applying ordinary commercial criteria and disregardingother considerations of a social, political or philanthropic nature.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.3" class="para" id="p8.5.3">8.5.3</a> The court appears to have adopted this approach in relation to the facts of the Joined Cases when it said at para. 21:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn order to determine whether such measures are in the nature of State aid, it is necessary to consider whether in similar circumstancesa private investor of a size comparable to that of the bodies administering the public sector might have provided capital of suchan amount.  ...â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.4" class="para" id="p8.5.4">8.5.4</a> An affirmation of this approach is to be found in <i><u>Kingdom of Belgium v. the Commission</u></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%203%20CMLR%20213" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 3 CMLR 213</a> when the court said at page 1012:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â26.

A subsidy is normallydefined as a payment in cash or in kind made in support of an undertaking other than the payment by the purchaser or consumer forthe goods or services which it produces.  An aid is a very similar concept, which, however, places emphasis on its purpose and seemsespecially devised for a particular objective which cannot normally be achieved without outside help.  The concept of aid is neverthelesswider than that of a subsidy because it embraces not only positive benefits, such as subsidies themselves, but also interventionswhich, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which, without, therefore,being subsidies in the strict meaning of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect.</p>        <p class="quote">....</p>        <p class="quote">A subsidy or aid, within the meaning of the definition given above in itself constitutes an obstacle to the most rational distributionof production at the highest possible level of productivity inasmuch as, being a payment made by someone other than the purchaseror consumer, it makes it possible to fix or maintain selling prices which are not directly related to production costs and therebyto establish, maintain and develop economic activity which does not represent the most rational distribution of production at thehighest possible level of productivity.</p>        <p class="quote">Judged on this basis and in the sense in which they are normally defined, subsidies or aids granted by the States are incompatiblewith the common market because they constitute an obstacle to one of its essential aims.</p>        <p class="quote">In view of this, it must be recognized that subsidies and aids, in the sense in which they have traditionally been and are usuallyunderstood, are what Article 4(c) recognizes as incompatible with the common market and accordingly declares abolished and prohibited.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.6" class="para" id="p8.5.6">8.5.6</a> The Treaty does not define aid.

It is not, in my view, necessary for present purposes to go so far.  At the very least, assistance constitutes an aid if the recipientobtains a benefit which he would not have received in the normal course.  A loan at a rate of interest below normal commercial ratesis an obvious example.  So, however, may be the provision of capital under normal market conditions but on a scale not normally availablein the capital market.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.8" class="para" id="p8.5.8">8.5.8</a> Given the disparity between commercial interest rates which were in the region of 18% at the relevant time and the interest rateof 8% which the Danish Government offered to the WMI subsidiaries, it is not surprising that it was common ground that there wasstate aid.  It was Mr. Forwoodâs opinion, however, that it is appropriate for a national court to consider whether or not therewas distortion.  Such a consideration, if carried out in the present case, will lead to the conclusion that there was no distortion.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.9" class="para" id="p8.5.9">8.5.9</a> It is also common ground that the Commission has exclusive competence in determining whether or not aid is compatible with the CommonMarket.  An important, perhaps the most important, factor the Commission will have to consider is distortion.  But I agree with Mr.Forwood that that does not mean that a national court should have no regard for distortion.  If it is clear-cut that there is nodistortion, why should the national court make an order that would suspend implementation of the aid pending consideration by theCommission.  I am satisfied it should exercise a filtering jurisdiction.  Upon an application for judicial review of a grant of aidby a Member State, it would be nonsense if a national court felt obliged to grant some form of relief, pending consideration by theCommission, notwithstanding that the aid plainly had no propensity to distort competition.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.10" class="para" id="p8.5.10">8.5.10</a> In taking this view, I do not overlook the opinion of Mr. Advocate-General Lenz in <i><u>Namur-Les Assurances du Credit SA v.

This means in particular that the Commission has to examine the adverse effects on the common market of national aid measures- distortion of competition and the effects on trade between Member States.

As far as the tasks of the national courts are concerned, they have to ensure that the aid measure is not implemented before theCommission has carried out the aforementioned review.  Consequently, that task is tailored to prevent, through the application ofcertain âprocedural criteriaâ, the practical importance of the Commissionâs prerogative to check the compatibility of everynew or altered aid with the common market from being impaired by precipitate conduct on the part of the Member States.]</p>        <p class="quote">65. In any event, it cannot be denied that the checks that are necessary on one side and the other in order to carry out the varioustasks overlap to a certain extent.  In order to be able to secure the prohibition of implementation provided for in the third sentenceof Article 93(3), the national court must find whether a âgrant or alteration of aidâ has taken place.  In this connection, theCourt has consistently acknowledged in its case-law that the concept of aid - which characterizes the field of application of Article92 et seq. and therefore is to be interpreted and applied in each individual case by the Commission - may also be interpreted andapplied by the national courts within the confines of the task conferred upon them.</p>        <p class="quote">66. The concept of aid which, accordingly, it is competent to the national courts to review, alongside the Commission, refers to thefirst part of the causal connection described in Article 92(1) and resulting in distortion of competition or effects on trade betweenMember States or both.  The concept of aid stands for the grant of certain unmarketlike advantages attributable to the State whichare liable to improve the economic situation of the undertaking which benefits from them in comparison with that of other undertakings. In other words, it covers the effects to which the State measure gives rise at the level of the undertaking or undertakings whichbenefit by the advantages.  The Court stated as follows in the judgment in <i>Denkavit:</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â[Article 92(1)] refers to the decisions of Member States by which the latter in pursuit of their own economic and social objectives,give, by unilateral and autonomous decisions, undertakings or other persons resources or procure for them advantages intended toencourage the attainment of the economic and social advantages sought.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">67.

Whilst that aspect is also to be checked by the national courts, the second part of the causal connection - the relationship betweenthe aid and any distortion of competition and effects on trade between Member States - falls to the Commission alone.

But the Commission does that on the basisof raw material.  If there is no such raw material, it should not be troubled.  It seems to me that paragraphs 65 and 66 anyway callfor the national court to carry out at least a limited filtering exercise.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.13" class="para" id="p8.5.13">8.5.13</a> That would seem to me to be consistent with the approach adopted by Mr. Advocate-General Warner in <i><u>Pigs and Bacon</u></i> when in relation to Article 93(3), he said at page 2204:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI would accept of course, on the basis of a familiar general principle of law (âde minimis non curat lexâ), that an alterationthat can properly be described as negligible may be ignored for the purposes of that provision.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.14" class="para" id="p8.5.14">8.5.14</a> The exercise of a filtering jurisdiction may however be little more than academic.

In his first report, Mr. Forwood even put it thus:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA mere possibility that competition may be distorted is sufficient so long as the possibility is a real one and not merely fanciful.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.15 class=" id="p8.5.15">8.5.15</a> In <i><u>Philip Morris Holland B.V. v. the Commission</u></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20ECR%202671" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) ECR 2671</a>, Mr. Advocate General Capotorti said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI should like to say immediately that, in my opinion, the wording of Article 92(1) lends itself to being construed as meaning thatthe distortion of competition should be a consistent and necessary consequence of the benefit given to certain undertakings or theproduction of certain goods by means of the State aid.  That construction is confirmed by logical rules of the economy.  Interferencefrom outside which is selective in its nature cannot but distort the working of competition.  It is permissible therefore to startfrom the presumption that any public aid granted to an undertaking distorts competition - or threatens to distort it where the aidis only proposed and not yet granted - unless <u>exceptional circumstances</u> exist (for example the total absence in the common market of products which are identical to or may be substituted for those manufacturedby the recipient of the aid).â </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>My emphasis.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.16" class="para" id="p8.5.16">8.5.16</a> The value of that opinion is, however, much reduced by the fact that the court itself examined the information which was before theCommission and concluded that the Commission was justified in finding the proposed aid would threaten distortion.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.17" class="para" id="p8.5.17">8.5.17</a> I would therefore put the position thus.  A national court can and should consider whether there is any aid that falls to be consideredby the Commission.  It is the Commissionâs task to determine the compatibility of any such aid and, in discharging that task, assesswhether or not there is any distortion.  The degree of distortion so assessed will no doubt be a factor influencing the Commissionwhen it considers whether to exercise its discretion under Art. 92(3).  It follows, in my judgment, that a national court has todo no more than detect a whiff of distortion before granting the relief necessary to allow the Commission an opportunity to considerthe aid in question.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.18" class="para" id="p8.5.18">8.5.18</a> Mr. Forwoodâs position was contained in paragraphs 338-339 of his first report:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â338. ... The real issue is whether the aid distorted or threatened to distort competition between shipyards by âfavouringâcertain undertakings, <i>in casu</i> Danish shipyards.</p>        <p class="quote">339. As to this, it seems probable (though it must be a matter of fact for the trial judge) that in 1981 financing schemes of oneform or another (sellers credit or buyers credit) in accordance with the OECD guidelines (80% of purchase price, 8% interest and8 1/2 year repayment) were in place in all the EC Member states with significant shipbuilding capabilities.  If this is so, thenit seems to me that, while the Danish scheme offering the OECD guidelines would undoubtedly have an appreciable <u>effect</u> on competition, it would not âdistortâ competition, in the sense of Article 92(1).  Rather, it would operate to remove a distortionby restoring a level playing field as between the shipyards of the EEC Member States.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.19" class="para" id="p8.5.19">8.5.19</a> In his second report, at para. 29, he put it the other way round:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhether the situation in 1981 was, in reality, that OECD terms were available in all community shipyards, so that it would onlyhave been the <u>non-availability</u> of such terms in Denmark that could have constituted a distortion of competition between shipbuilders.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.20" class="para" id="p8.5.20">8.5.20</a> I was referred by the Defendants to Commission Reports to the Council and Parliament between 1979 and 1983 on âstate aids to shipbuildingâ. These show there were 8 Member States, including Denmark, having significant shipbuilding capacity.  Under the heading âCreditfacilities for salesâ, six Member States, including Denmark, are shown to have schemes on âOECD conditionsâ.  Germany and Holland,however, had interest rebate schemes albeit âlimit OECD conditionsâ.  So while there was much congruence, there was not totaluniformity of schemes.  Further OECD terms established only a minimum interest rate - 8%.  Even if that rate was granted uniformly,Member States, such as Denmark, with high interest rates - 18% - would gain an advantage over Member States with lower interest rates,e.g. at the time the UK rate was 12%.  Finally, there is no evidence as to whether best OECD terms were always granted for everyshipyard for every vessel.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.21" class="para" id="p8.5.21">8.5.21</a> The real answer lies, I think, within the 5th Directive itself.  In Article 1 it defines âaidâ as state aid within the meaningof Arts. 92 and 93 and continues âsuch aid may be considered compatible ..... provided it complies with the criteria for derogation(herein)â.  Art. 2 provides that credit facilities for sales of vessels âmay be considered compatible ..... provided (they comply)with the OECD (understanding)â.  Art. 10 requires aid plans to be notified in accordance with Art. 93(3).  Nothing could more plainly,it seems to me, indicate that aid even when conforming with OECD terms was still considered to be distorting and requiring the Commissionâsdetermination as to whether it may nonetheless be compatible.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.22" class="para" id="p8.5.22">8.5.22</a> I reject Mr. Forwoodâs opinion.  While it is plain from the recitals of the 5th Directive that the Council was anxious to establisha level playing field, it is equally plain that it did not consider that such utopia had been achieved.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.23" class="para" id="p8.5.23">8.5.23</a> So I proceed to the next sub-issue, whether or not there was aid to shipbuilding.  In cross-examination (Day 142/74 and Day 143/7),Mr. Forwood clarified his position.  He accepted that there was aid to shipbuilding in a broad sense, and that both Article 93(3)and the 5th Directive applied to it.  In a narrow sense, however, he took the view that the aid was to the shipowners not to BW,but the aid produced correspondingly more or less tangible benefits for the BW yard.  Who was in fact the recipient of aid wouldbe relevant to later issues as to what measure constituted the grant of aid and as to the application of national law in relationto invalidity.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.24" class="para" id="p8.5.24">8.5.24</a> Mr. Forwood having accepted there was aid to shipbuilding, and in view of my finding on sub-issue (1), Issue A is answered in favourof the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.25" class="para" id="p8.5.25">8.5.25</a> But insofar as it may be relevant, who in fact did receive the aid?  Or, in terms of Art. 92(1), who was the grantee?  Dr. Plenderâsopinion was that BW was the grantee, while WMIâs subsidiaries, the shipowners, were no more than a conduit through which the aidpassed to BW.  Mr. Forwood, however, was of the view that the aid was to the shipowners.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.26" class="para" id="p8.5.26">8.5.26</a> Having accepted that, in a broad sense, there was aid to the shipbuilding sector, it seems to me that Mr. Forwoodâs view is almostuntenable.  It is not difficult to identify which undertaking in the shipbuilding sector benefited.  It was BW because it was commonground that the Danish Governmentâs purpose was to ensure building contracts for BW, the contracts being linked to the provisionof the export credits.  The background I have already set out in Part 6 shows the concern about BWâs future and the relief whenthe Danish Government at last made up its mind.  Consistent with that is a passage in Mr. Brotherâs evidence (Day 95/105) whenhe agreed with a suggestion of mine that the Fund simply wanted WMI as a peg upon which to hang the transfer of funds to BW (notan elegant metaphor, but it conveys the picture).</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.27" class="para" id="p8.5.27">8.5.27</a> Neither the Fund, EKR, nor any other institution involved were anxious to give or in the business of giving cheap funds or creditsto foreign shipowners to enable them or their shareholders to flourish.  Rather they were anxious to ensure Danish funds stayed inDenmark for the benefit principally of Danish shipbuilding.  In practical terms, while WMIâs subsidiaries obtained good creditterms, the hard cash generated by the credit went to BW enabling it to pay off its loan from the Fund, improve its cash flow, keepits order book open and retain its workforce.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.28" class="para" id="p8.5.28">8.5.28</a> The passages I have already cited (para. <a>8.5.5</a>) from the judgment of the court in <i><u>Coal and Steel</u></i> describe aid and, in particular, that its <u>purpose</u> is important.  In <i><u>Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v. Denkavit Italiana S.r.l.</u></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20ECR%201205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) ECR 1205</a>, the court at page 1228 said of Article 92(1):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â31. This provision thus refers to the decisions of Member States by which the latter, in pursuit of their own economic and socialobjectives, give, by unilateral and autonomous decisions, undertakings or other persons resources or procure for them advantagesintended to encourage the attainment of the economic or social objectives sought.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.29" class="para" id="p8.5.29">8.5.29</a> Finally, there is the definition of the concept of aid used by Mr. Advocate-General Lenz in para. 66 of his opinion in <i><u>Namur</u></i> which I have set out at para. <a>8.5.11</a>.  In particular are the words âliable to improve ... the undertaking which benefits ...â.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.30" class="para" id="p8.5.30">8.5.30</a> From the 4th Directive onward, these Directives are entitled âon aid to shipbuildingâ.  âAidâ is defined as âstate aidwithin the meaning of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty ...â.  Article 2 of the 5th Directive refers to âaid in the form of creditfacilities for all sales ...â which would include export credits provided under the 73 Decision.  In <i><u>Coal and Steel,</u></i> a bonus out of public funds was payable to coal miners.  ECJ in its judgment at p. 11 said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe real question is whether, even though the âBergmannsprÃ¤mieâ is paid to the workers, it does in fact benefit the miningundertakings.  The intervener has realized the difficulties of the over-strict criterion which it proposes and defends itself inadvance by emphasizing that almost all grants from the State indirectly serve the interests of the undertakings.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Adoption of the purely formal criterion based on the recipient of the grant conflicts with economic reality.  Subsidies which aremanifestly illegal may be made available in a legally acceptable form if they appear to be paid to third parties although the realbeneficiaries are the undertakings.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The concept of subsidy in the Treaty must be interpreted in the light of economic considerations.  There is a prohibited subsidy wheneverthis confers an economic advantage on an undertaking which distorts the conditions of competition with other coal or steel undertakings,in other words, whenever the âmost rational distribution of production at the highest possible level of productivityâ withinthe meaning of the second paragraph of Article 2 of the Treaty is infringed by the grant of an advantage to one or more undertakings.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.31" class="para" id="p8.5.31">8.5.31</a> ECJ concluded at p. 30 that the bonus âconstitutes a subsidy or aid granted by the Government ... â and annulled the measure.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.32" class="para" id="p8.5.32">8.5.32</a> It is clear therefore that the actual recipient of cash is not necessarily the grantee of aid.  It is appropriate to look behindthe superficial arrangement in order to find the true nature of what was taking place.  If that exercise reveals that, in truth,state aid was involved the Commission can make the appropriate order regardless of who physically received the aid.  The importantand crucial aspect is <u>intervention</u> by the state in pursuance of an intention to favour a sector or undertaking.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.33" class="para" id="p8.5.33">8.5.33</a> It seems to me, therefore, beyond argument that the grantee of state aid, however it is contrived, is in the final analysis the sectoror undertaking that was intended by the Member State to benefit, not some intermediate person or body through whom the benefit ismade available.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.34" class="para" id="p8.5.34">8.5.34</a> Commission decision (92/11/EEC) of 31st July 1991 causes me no difficulties.  The Toyota Motor Company was found by the Commissionto have received state aid from the sale of land at an undervalue by the Derbyshire County Council in U.K., which was unlawful asbeing in breach of Article 93(3) and incompatible.  The Commission accepted that no aid was intended, although doubtless the councillorsof Derbyshire wished to see employment opportunities and consequent improvements to the cash flow of Derbyshire shops and other businesses. But it is clear to me, as the Commission found, that the real beneficiary was the motor vehicle industry, in particular Toyotaâsnew car factory, an undertaking established or to be established in Derbyshire.  The consequent benefits to the people of Derbyshirewould be identical to the benefits which the people of Copenhagen derived from the contracts won by BW.</p>    <p><u>Issue B</u>  :  Was the proposal to grant such aid either notified or exempted from notification as aid granted pursuant to an existing systemof aid?</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.35" class="para" id="p8.5.35">8.5.35</a> It is common ground that the EKR telex dated 17th March 1981 satisfied any obligation that might have been incumbent on the Danishauthorities to notify the initial grant of aid.  It is also common ground that the initial grant of aid conformed with the OECD understandingand thus conformed with the âsystem of aid existingâ in Denmark on the eve of accession to the Community in 1973.</p>    <p><u>Issue C</u>:  Was there an alteration not being a negligible alteration in the proposal to grant aid, such as to bring about a change in theproposal as notified?</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.36" class="para" id="p8.5.36">8.5.36</a> It is common ground that the deferral of the first instalments and their accumulation with interest in a balloon payment at the endof 8 years together with the other elements in the re-structuring were not ânegligibleâ events.  The issue is whether they amountedto a relevant alteration in the original proposal.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.37" class="para" id="p8.5.37">8.5.37</a> In the unlikely event that a Member State advanced funds or made credit available to an undertaking on a purely commercial or marketinvestor basis, there would be no state aid falling foul of Article 92(1).  Indeed, that is precisely the situation where a nationalcourt would, in an appropriate case, exercise the filtering jurisdiction which I have found it competent to exercise.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.38" class="para" id="p8.5.38">8.5.38</a> It is Mr. Forwoodâs opinion that this was in effect what Denmark did when it agreed to the revised arrangements.  He relies uponpara. 11(c) of the OECD Arrangement (App. 6/31).  In his view, that provision, which he calls âcreditor interestâ, is to be impliedas part of the ânormal OECD termsâ specified by EKR in its telex because these terms encompass all OECD terms, not just thosecontained in the OECD understanding.  Later, Mr. Forwood added that para. 11(c) does no more than preserve an existing right.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.39" class="para" id="p8.5.39">8.5.39</a> It is, as Mr. Forwood accepted, a matter of construction for me.  Community law as such is not involved, except insofar as I mustapply a purposive construction.  The phrase ânormal OECD termsâ was used in the context of consultation under the 73 Decision. In that context, it is plain to me that it can refer to no more than the âtermsâ, as they are so described, set out in para.1 of the Annex to the OECD Understanding.  That Understanding in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Annex, contains derogation provisions. It does not make any reference to the OECD Arrangement.  It is difficult to see how a derogation provision such as âcreditor interestâcould or needs to be implied.  The only conceivable way in which any provision of the Arrangement could be implied in the 81 OECDUnderstanding is in relation to para. 6 which provides for notification âin accordance with the procedure established ...â. There is no evidence of any such procedure other than a procedure in relation to âderogationsâ in para. 9(a) of the Arrangement(it is not necessary to set it out).  That however is no warrant for bringing âcreditor interestâ within the OECD Understanding.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.40" class="para" id="p8.5.40">8.5.40</a> Further, para. 4(c) of the Arrangement requires the terms of the Arrangement to be applied to ships not covered by the Understanding,while para. 10(e) expressly excludes ships covered by the Understanding from the terms of the Arrangement.  It is difficult to seehow the OECD could more clearly have separated the provisions of the 2 agreements.  The reason is clear as Dr. Plender explained. The Arrangement is a set of informal guidelines of general application laid down by the OECD as it tries to work towards higherand more specific standards.  Once agreement is reached on higher standards and crystallised in an understanding, such as the 81OECD Understanding which contains its own free standing provisions, there is no room for the application of the general and lessstrict provisions of the Arrangement.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.41" class="para" id="p8.5.41">8.5.41</a> I accept, however, that para. 11(c) of the Arrangement does recognise that OECD members should be able to act independently to solvea situation that is perceived to be likely to result in a loss.  It seems to me that âcreditor interestâ applies also to MemberStates who have granted aid.  This, in my judgment, has nothing to do with âOECD termsâ or whether it was a term implicit inthe existing Danish scheme.  There is no reason why the states should be in any different position from any other creditor.  Thereis no reason for them to be locked into the original terms of a grant of aid if those terms have for genuine economic or commercialreasons become unworkable.  Plainly, the states must be at liberty to re-negotiate terms in the same way as any other creditor, providedthat the renegotiation is on commercial terms.  There seems to have been some recognition of this, at least on the part of EKR whichwas plainly more familiar with the intricacies of Community rules.  Thus, at the meeting between EKR and the Fund on 2nd March 1983,Mr Gideon is recorded as saying âEKRâs interest as a creditor lay in finding a solution surrounding the newbuildings nos. 910-912......â. Also, at para. <a>6.7.4</a>, Mr Richnagelâs reference to âcreditorâs interestsâ.</p>    <p><u>Issue D</u>:  Was the alteration notifiable without more or only if</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)   it gave rise to a further state aid over and above any initial aid, and</p>        <p>(b)   that further state aid viewed separately from the initial aid distorted or threatened to distort competition and affected tradebetween Member States, and</p>        <p>(c)   it brought the grant outside the existing scheme.</p>        <p>((a), (b) and (c) together called the âalteration aid requirementsâ)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.42" class="para" id="p8.5.42">8.5.42</a> Dr. Plenderâs position was simple.  If there is an alteration of aid, being a non-negligible alteration, it must be notified. The words âalter aidâ in Article 93(3) could not be plainer.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.43" class="para" id="p8.5.43">8.5.43</a> Mr. Forwood, in whose opinion the alteration aid requirements are pre-conditions, took the position effectively that an alterationonly requires notification if it amounts to a new scheme, or to an individual or one-off grant of new or further aid.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.44" class="para" id="p8.5.44">8.5.44</a> Article 93 requires the Commission to do two things.  First, under Article 93(1), to review existing systems of aid for their continuingcompatibility.  Second, under Article 93(3), to screen for compatibility plans to grant or alter aid.  Each requirement is carriedout by the procedure prescribed in Article 93(2).</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.45" class="para" id="p8.5.45">8.5.45</a> An existing system or scheme of aid is one which was either in existence when a Member State joined the Community, or which was subsequentlyapproved or not disapproved by the Commission.  It will relate to a particular sector or region.  It was not in dispute that sucha scheme existed in Denmark in relation to shipbuilding at the time of its accession to the Community.  It became common ground,but was not when reports were exchanged, that individual grants of aid under such a system do not require notification.  It was alsocommon ground, as I have said earlier, that under the 5th Directive and Article 93, the original arrangements did not require notificationas aid (although they did call for consultation as an export credit).</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.46" class="para" id="p8.5.46">8.5.46</a> Apart from systems, it is also necessary for Member States to notify one-off grants of aid.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.47" class="para" id="p8.5.47">8.5.47</a> Having regard to the scheme of Article 93, it was Mr. Forwoodâs opinion that notification required by Article 93(3) relates onlyto plans to introduce a new scheme of aid or further aid, or to alter an existing system or a proposal to grant aid where that proposalhas not yet taken effect.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.48" class="para" id="p8.5.48">8.5.48</a> In <i><u>Namur</u></i>, the court had to consider three questions, of which the first 2 were:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1)  Must Article 93(3) of the Treaty be interpreted as meaning that the granting or alteration of aid includes a decision of aMember State to authorize, after the entry into force of the Treaty, a public establishment, which previously engaged only incidentallyin credit insurance for exports to other Member States, to exercise that activity in future without restriction, so that the aidwhich was granted by that State to the establishment under legislation predating the entry into force of the Treaty now applies tothe exercise of that activity as thus extended?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)   Must Article 93 of the Treaty be interpreted as meaning that it is necessary to regard new aid as being subject to the rulesgoverning existing aid if new aid, not having been notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 93(3), was the subject ofa complaint to the Commission and the latter, after carrying out a preliminary examination of the aid and addressing to the MemberState concerned a request for information concerning the aid in which it stated that, in the event of failure to reply or receiptof an unsatisfactory reply before the end of the period allowed, it would be obliged to initiate the procedure laid down by Article93(2) of the Treaty (which request was satisfied), did not initiate the said procedure within a reasonable period?â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.49" class="para" id="p8.5.49">8.5.49</a> In his opinion, Mr. Advocate-General Lenz at page 3845 said of Article 93(3):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â57. As regards the objective of Article 93(3), it should be observed on a general level that it supplements the review mechanismprovided for in Article 93(2).  By means of the rule on notification laid down in the first sentence of Article 93(3), âthe draftsmenof the Treaty have sought to provide [the Commission] with sufficient time for consideration and investigation to form a <i>prima facie</i> opinion on the partial or complete conformity with the Treaty of the plans which have been notified to it.  In other words, the purposeof the first sentence of Article 93(3) is to provide the Commission with an opportunity to review, in sufficient time and in thegeneral interest of the Communities, any plan to grant or alter aid.</p>        <p class="quote">58. In this connection, the purpose of the third sentence of Article 93(3) is to âprevent the implementation of aid contrary tothe Treatyâ.  It safeguards the machinery for review laid down by that article, which, in turn, is essential for ensuring the functioningof the common market.  The prohibition laid down in that article on putting any proposed measures into effect is designed to ensurethat the effects of a system of aid cannot take place before the Commission has had a reasonable period in which to study the proposedmeasures in detail and, if necessary, to initiate and conclude the procedure provided for in Article 93(2).</p>        <p class="quote">59. Consequently, the expression âgrant or alteration of aidâ characterizes an event which, in view of its potential effects onthe common market, systematically necessitates a review of whether the advantage conferred on the undertaking is compatible withthe principles set out in Article 92(1).  Those potential effects on the common market should not take place before the said reviewhas been concluded - whether at the stage of Article 93(3) or of Article 93(2).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.50" class="para" id="p8.5.50">8.5.50</a> After going on to discuss the respective responsibilities of national courts and the Commission, Mr. Advocate-General Lenz said inpara. 69 of his opinion:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â69. Under the same system of Article 93, supervision of existing aid is a matter for the Commission under paragraph 1 of that article. This covers not only aid granted by the original Member States before the EEC Treaty entered into force, to which aid granted bynew Member States before their accession is equated.  The system of paragraph 1 also applies to aid which, after it has been reviewedby the Commission as new aid and deemed compatible with the common market, is implemented by the Member State concerned.  In allthose cases, circumstances may arise in the course of time which raise the question whether the aid is still compatible with thecommon market.  However, of those circumstances, only the âalterationâ of (existing) aid triggers the mechanism provided forin Article 93(3) in which the national courts are involved in the manner which I have indicated.  Moreover, it is for the Commissionconstantly to review those circumstances in the light of the criteria set out in Article 92.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>And at paragraph 77, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... whether aid has been granted or altered depends, as also emerges from the foregoing considerations, on whether in the portfolioof measures of a Member State providing for advantages (in the nature of aid) for the benefit of undertakings, a change has occurredwhich has affected the content or extent of those advantages.  In this connection, it is clear from a comparison between paragraphs1 and 3 of Article 93 that the term âaidâ in paragraph 3 is synonymous with the expression âsystem of aidâ in paragraph 1. It follows that an aid is granted within the meaning of Article 93(3) where a new system of aid is created, whilst the alterationof aid presupposes a substantive change in a system of aid.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.51" class="para" id="p8.5.51">8.5.51</a> Hence, the Advocate-General came to advise that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA decision of a Member State to authorize, after the entry into force of the EEC Treaty, a public establishment, which previouslyengaged only incidentally in credit insurance for exports to other Member States, to exercise that activity without restrictionsso that the aid which was granted by that State to the establishment under legislation predating the entry into force of the EECTreaty now applies to the exercise of that activity as thus extended, is to be regarded as the grant or alteration of aid.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.52" class="para" id="p8.5.52">8.5.52</a> In its judgment, the court said at page 3869:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe distinction between existing aid and new aid and the allocation of powers and responsibilities between the Commission, on theone hand, and the Member States and their courts, on the other</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">10 Article 93 of the Treaty, whose purpose is to enable the Commission to examine and keep under constant review aid granted by theStates or through State resources, makes provision for separate procedures depending on whether the aid concerned is existing aidor new aid.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">11 As far as existing aid is concerned, paragraph (1) of Article 93 gives the Commission the power, in cooperation with the MemberStates, to keep aid under constant review.

Paragraph (2) of the same article providesthat, if, after giving notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments, the Commission finds that aid is not compatiblewith the common market having regard to Article 92, or that such aid is being misused, it is to decide that the State concerned shallabolish or alter such aid within a period of time to be determined by the Commission (judgment in Case C-47/91 <i>Italy v Commission</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%20ECR%20I%2d4145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] ECR I-4145</a>, paragraph 23).

If, at the end of that examination, it considers that any such plan is not compatible with the common market having regard to Article92, it is to initiate the contentious review procedure provided for in Article 93(2).  In such a case, the last sentence of Article93(3) prohibits the Member State concerned from putting the proposed measures into effect until the procedure has resulted in a finaldecision.  New aid is therefore subject to preventive review by the Commission and in principle cannot be put into effect as longas that institution has not declared it compatible with the Treaty (judgment in Case C-47/91 <i>Italy v Commission</i>, cited above, paragraph 24).  However, that last rule must be qualified by the case-law of the Court, according to which, if theCommission, after being informed by a Member State of a plan to grant or alter aid, fails to initiate the contentious procedure,this State may, at the end of a period sufficient to enable a preliminary examination of the plan to be carried out, grant the proposedaid, provided that it has given prior notice to the Commission, and this aid will then be governed by the rules concerning existingaid (judgment in Case 120/73 <i>Lorenz v Germany</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%20ECR%201471" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] ECR 1471</a>, paragraph 6).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">13 It is clear from both the terms and purposes of those provisions that aid which existed before the entry into force of the Treatyand aid which could be properly put into effect under the conditions laid down in Article 93(3), including those arising from theinterpretation of that article given by the Court in its judgment in the <i>Lorenz</i> case, is to be regarded as existing aid within the meaning of Article 93(1).  On the other hand, measures to grant or alter aid,where the alterations may relate to existing aid or initial plans notified to the Commission, must be regarded as new aid subjectto the obligation of notification laid down by Article 93(3) (see the judgment in Joined Cases 91/83 and 127/83 <i>Heineken Brouwerijen v Inspecteurs der Vennootschapsbelasting, Amsterdam and Utrecht</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20ECR%203435" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] ECR 3435</a>, paragraph 17 and 18).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>And at page 3874:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â28  As far as that question and the application of paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article 93 are concerned, the emergence of new aidor the alteration of existing aid cannot be assessed according to the scale of the aid or, in particular, its amount in financialterms at any moment in the life of the undertaking if the aid is provided under earlier statutory provisions which remain unaltered.

After rejecting that argument, Mr. Advocate-General Darmon said in para.34 of his opinion at page 6494:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â34. However, it must be emphasized that the consequences of the fact that a system of aid is an existing system are so importantthat great strictness must be applied to the notification of alterations.  It is not contested in this regard that the SCGS existedprior to the accession of the United Kingdom and as such, constitutes an existing system.  However, as far as its âevolutionâis concerned, the French version of the Commissionâs pleadings and the annexes thereto may give rise to considerable perplexity. Whilst it is made clear that the 1982 Order was not notified in that it did not affect the substance of the system, it is statedin the French translation of the letter from the United Kingdom Permanent Representation that the Order âa renforceâ (strengthened)the existing system.  But the original English version uses the term âconsolidatedâ.  By consulting the Concise Law DictionaryI have been able to ascertain that âconsolidatedâ meant âcodifiedâ in legal language and not âstrengthenedâ.  This beingso, it is possible moreover to agree that an alteration (consolidation âwith amendmentâ) consisting in the administrative improvementof the system - the view taken of the 1982 Order by the Commission and the United kingdom - need not be notified provided that itin no way accentuates the intensity of the system.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.56" class="para" id="p8.5.56">8.5.56</a> It was Mr. Forwoodâs opinion that the Advocate-General established the proposition that there is no need to notify an alterationto an existing system or scheme unless there is an increase in the intensity of aid.

That would be a construction which could only be justified as a last resort.  Second, in any eventMr. Forwoodâs position is against common sense because it would allow Member States to circumvent what would otherwise be incompatibleaid by progressive alterations which are either not new grants or are not significant.

For the most part they deal with systems themselves or in one outrageous case, <i><u>British Aerospace Plc and Rover Group Holdings Plc v. the Commission</u></i> (Case C-294/90) of 4th February 1992, breach of conditions attached to a grant of aid.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.61" class="para" id="p8.5.61">8.5.61</a> I believe, however, that assistance can be derived from two cases.  <i><u>Rijn-Schelde-Verolme (RSV) Maschinefabrieken en Scheepswerven NV v the Commission</u></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20ECR%204617" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) ECR 4617</a> involved aid by the Netherlands Government to the applicant RSV.  It was not a scheme or system in the sense of a set of provisionswithin which individual grants might be made.  Rather it was a large scale plan to assist RSV out of its difficulties.  In a letterdated 1st June 1979, the Government made an offer which was subject to Commission approval, a copy of which was sent to the Commission. The Commission took no action on it.  In April 1980, the Government agreed to make further aid available amounting to HFL330 millionof which HFL280 million was to cover existing losses, and also to pay a percentage of further losses, that is, an open-ended commitment. The Commission finally approved this aid in March 1981.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.62" class="para" id="p8.5.62">8.5.62</a> On 6th April 1982, because losses were continuing to rise, the Government set an upper limit amounting to HFL294 million on its contributionto losses.  This was largely put into effect, but the Commission was not notified until July 1982.  Eventually in October 1982, theCommission opened the Article 93(2) procedure and, in December 1984, decided that the aid was incompatible and required recovery. RSV challenged that decision on 8 grounds, about which Sir Gordon Slynn, the Advocate-General, said at page 4643:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe first argument is that the recovery obligation is illegal because the 1982 arrangements did not have to be notified to theCommission under Article 93(3).  This is because, according to RSV, the April 1982 arrangements only modify the 1980 arrangements(by limiting them rather than extending them) which in turn flow from the letter of 1 June 1979 which the Commission approved.  TheCommission argues, rightly in my view, that the letter of 1 June 1979 is not an agreement, nor does it institute an aid measure:rather, it is the statement of an intention to grant aid, the details of which were to be set out in a letter to RSV.  The Ministerdescribed that letter as such a statement in his letter to RSV of 17 March 1980.  In any case, the Commission did not approve thatletter.  Nothing that happened subsequently seems to me to prevent the Commission from saying in these proceedings that it took theletter at its face value and that its silence is not to be taken as approval of an aid programme therein set out.  Moreover, it isto my mind clear that the Commission was not aware of the open-ended arrangements made in the letters of 17 March and 23 April 1980at that time or when the April 1982 arrangements, which for the first time gave the Commission specific details, were notified toit.  There was no justification for the Ministry of Economic Affairs to tell RSV (as it did in its letter of 3 April 1981) that theCommission had approved the aid set out in those two letters.  In any case, Article 93(3) requires Member States to notify âplansto ... alter aidâ and on any view the 1982 arrangements were alteration of aid already given or promised.  It seems to me thatthere is no substance in RSVâs first argument and I would reject it.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.63" class="para" id="p8.5.63">8.5.63</a> The court itself simply decided that the Commission had taken too long to reach a decision and declared the decision void.  The factsthere were very different.  It is of course arguable that what was involved there was a new aid, or at least an intensification ofthe existing aid.  Equally, however, it seems to me to support the principle that where a grant of aid has been approved or fallswithin an existing system, and that grant has been committed or âpromisedâ, any relevant alterations must be notified.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.64" class="para" id="p8.5.64">8.5.64</a> In <i><u>Heineken</u></i>, the Netherlands Government pursuant to Article 93(3) notified the Commission of legislation it intended to introduce which madeprovision for a regional investment scheme aided by tax allowances.  The Commission following the Article 93(2) procedure approvedthe provision.  Before being passed into law, however, the provision was altered.  The ECJ said at page 3453:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe third question</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">16.   In this question the Gerechtshof asks whether the obligation to inform the Commission of plans to grant aid which is imposedon Member States by the first sentence of Article 93(3) also applies to alterations made to such plans in the course of parliamentarydebate.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">17.   It is sufficient to note that Article 93(3) is not confined solely to the grant of aid, but also covers the alteration thereof,and that the aforesaid aim of the first sentence of that provision could not be achieved if the Commission were informed only ofthe initial plans and not of subsequent alterations.  However, it must be added that such information may be supplied to the Commissionin the course of the consultations which take place between the Commission and the Member State concerned following the initial notification.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">18.   In reply to the third question it must therefore be stated that the obligation provided for in the first sentence of Article93(3) to inform the Commission of plans to grant or alter aid does not apply solely to the initial plan, but also covers subsequentalterations to that plan; such information may be supplied to the Commission in the course of the consultations which take placefollowing the initial notification.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The fourth question</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">19.   The fourth question concerns the prohibition, laid down by the last sentence of Article 93(3), on the putting into effect ofthe proposed measures before the procedures prescribed in Article 93(2) and (3) have resulted in a final decision.  The Gerechtshofasks whether that prohibition applies to a plan for aid which has been duly notified in its initial version but subsequently alteredwithout the Commission being informed of the alteration and whether, in such a case, the prohibition applies solely to the part ofthe aid which has been introduced by that alteration.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">20.   As the Court has already emphasized, <i>inter alia</i> in its order of 20 September 1983 (Case 171/83 R <i>Commission v France</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20ECR%202621" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] ECR 2621)</a>, the final sentence of Article 93(3) is the means of safeguarding the machinery for review laid down by that article, which, in turn,is essential for ensuring the proper functioning of the common market.  The prohibition laid down by that article is intended toensure that the aid measures do not come into effect before the Commission has had a reasonable period in which to consider the planin detail and, if necessary, to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 93(2).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">21    It follows that the prohibition applies to the aid programme in its entirety and in the final version adopted by the nationalauthorities.  If the initial plan has been altered, the last sentence of Article 93(3) therefore applies to the plan as altered. Where the plan has been notified and the Commission has not raised any objections to it, but the Member State concerned has madealterations of which the Commission has not been informed, the provision precludes the putting into effect of the aid programme inits entirety.  The position may be different only where the alteration in question is in actual fact a separate aid measure whichshould be assessed separately and which is therefore not such as to influence the assessment which the Commission has already madeof the initial plan.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">22.   In reply to the fourth question it must therefore be stated that the prohibition on the putting into effect of aid measures,which is laid down in the last sentence of Article 93(3), applies to the proposed aid programme in its entirety and in the finalversion adopted by the national authorities.  If the plan initially notified has in the meantime undergone alterations of which theCommission has not been informed, the prohibition applies to the plan as altered, unless the alteration in question is in actualfact a separate aid measure which should be assessed separately and which is therefore not such as to influence the assessment whichthe Commission has already made of the initial plan; in that case, the prohibition applies only to the aid measure introduced bythe alteration.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.5.65" class="para" id="p8.5.65">8.5.65</a> The Advocate-General Mr. Mancini said in his opinion at page 3460:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â5.   The third question is intended to establish whether the duty to notify the Commission of plans to grant or alter aid, imposedon States by Article 93(3), also includes amendments made to such plans in the course of their passage through parliament.  The Courtcan but reply in the affirmative.  However, in my view, its answer must be given subject to a reservation dictated by the fundamentalaim of that provision.  The Court itself has said that the provision was drafted to enable the Commission to assess the compatibilityof such plans with the common market.  That objective does not require the imposition on States of an absolute obligation to notifythe Commission of every aspect.  In other words the States must notify the Commission of alterations which, because of the effectwhich they have on undertakings or their competitive relationship, may influence the Commissionâs decision.  It is not on the otherhand necessary to communicate alterations which are merely formal and which do not pose a threat to the freedom of competition.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>And perhaps summed up at page 3461:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhat then is the position if the same State has made amendments to the original plan without informing the Commission?  I considerthat the prohibition in question also applies in that situation.

The opinionof Mr. Mancini supports Mr. Forwoodâs view that there is no need for notification when, as here, the element of competition hasevaporated.  Equally, however, the judgment of the court lends powerful support for drawing a distinction between simple alterationsand alterations which are so sweeping that their effect is to produce a new, separate or different grant of aid which will have tobe assessed independently of the original grant.  Further, the court in para. 20 attaches importance to the coming into effect ofany aid measures which, in our case, would be upon the issue by ADS of its bonds and their purchase by the Central Bank.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.67" class="para" id="p8.5.67">8.5.67</a> It seems to me that the second passage cited from Mr. Manciniâs opinion is apt.  As I suggested during trial, it is but a shortstep for a Member State, in protection of its own sectoral interests, to indicate to a purchaser or a recipient of aid that the termscan later be relaxed.  Not to put too fine a point to it - fraud.  I was rebuked by Mr. Grossman.  I remain unrepentant.  I am comfortedthat in <i><u>British Aerospace</u></i> Mr. Advocate-General Van Gerven thought fit to deal with the position of a Member State which has been economical with the truth.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.68" class="para" id="p8.5.68">8.5.68</a> And it is this case, I think, which provides the key.  By a decision, the Commission declared compatible aid to be given by U.K.to the Rover group to assist in its acquisition by British Aerospace.  The aid was compatible on condition, among others, that thereshould be no further financial concessions.  The Commission later discovered there had been such concessions and sent a letter toU.K. government declaring the concessions to be unlawful aid because it infringed the conditions.  The Commission required U.K. torecover the aid.  U.K. implemented the letter but also sought a declaration from ECJ that the letter was void.  ECJ annulled theletter on the ground that the Commission had proceeded improperly.  In his opinion, however, the Advocate-General considered 4 courseswere open to the Commission if it thought there had been infringement of one of its decisions.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.69" class="para" id="p8.5.69">8.5.69</a> First, the Commission could refer the matter to ECJ.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.70" class="para" id="p8.5.70">8.5.70</a> Second, it could require suspension pending provision of information to enable it to conduct an examination in accordance with Art.93(2).

The Danish scheme under which the aid was granted was, inmy view, the equivalent.  There were also no express conditions.  The terms of the scheme were in effect conditions.  The new termscontemplated and implemented by the parties constituted, in my view, an infringement.  Whether that infringement is characterisedas an alteration or new aid is in my view immaterial.  What is important is that changes in the <u>intervention</u> by the Member State, if other than negligible, are notified so that the Commission may determine whether there is an infringementand, if so, one that requires referral to ECJ or an assessment under Art. 93(2).</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.75" class="para" id="p8.5.75">8.5.75</a> The changes in the present case were other than negligible and, subject to creditor interest and the market investor principles,should have been notified.</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.76" class="para" id="p8.5.76">8.5.76</a> Sympathetic though I am to the predicament in which all concerned found themselves, I am unable to accept that the revised financialarrangements were some form of application of those principles.  If the arrangements constituted new aid, the terms were plainlyones which would have been unobtainable from the ordinary investor.  Nor, in my view, did they constitute creditor interest.  Itis one thing to accommodate a debtor who gets into difficulties and encounters problems with his repayments.  It is quite anotherto rewrite financial arrangements before credit has been drawn down. The loans did not have to be made.  Other solutions were available. As Mr. Gideon said, the vessel or vessels could have been isolated pending sale elsewhere.  Consequently, notification remainednecessary.</p>    <p><u>Issue E</u>:  If the alteration was notifiable without more or the alteration aid requirements were satisfied, was there a breach of the obligationto notify the alteration?</p>    <p><a name="p8.5.77" class="para" id="p8.5.77">8.5.77</a> It is common ground that there is no evidence of notification of the alteration.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="8.6">8.6    the common issues</a></p>    <p><u>Issue 7</u>:  For the purpose of relying on the direct effect of the relevant prohibition in proceedings in a national court, do the Defendantshave to show that they fall within a certain class of persons and, if so, what was that class and did the Defendants fall withinit?</p>    <p><a name="p8.6.1" class="para" id="p8.6.1">8.6.1</a> Direct effect is the principle by which rights conferred by an Article in the Treaty, a Council decision or other piece of Communitylegislation can be enforced by an individual against the state in a national court.

These are questions, and distinct questions, of Community law.

Treaty - to create a Common Market, the functioning of which directly affects the citizens of the Community- implies that this Treaty is more than an agreement creating only mutual obligations between the contracting parties.  This interpretationis confirmed by the preamble to the Treaty which, in addition to mentioning governments, affects individuals.  The creation of organsinstitutionalising certain sovereign rights, the exercise of which affects both member-States and citizens is a particular example. In addition, the nationals of the States, united into the Community, are required to collaborate in the functioning of that Community,by means of the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Council.  Furthermore, the role of the Court of Justice in the frameworkof <b>Article 177</b>, the aim of which is to ensure uniformity of interpretation of the Treaty by the national courts, confirms that the States recognisedin Community law have an authority capable of being invoked by their nationals before those courts.  We must conclude from this thatthe Community constitutes a new legal order in international law, for whose benefit the States have limited their sovereign rights,albeit within limited fields, and the subjects of which comprise not only the member-States but also their nationals.  Communitylaw, therefore, apart from legislation by the member-States, not only imposes obligations on individuals but also confers on themlegal rights.

The language is precise, immediate and unconditional and gives rise to individual rights.  There is direct effect.  There is no basis,Dr. Plender said, for reaching a conclusion different from that in relation to Article 93(3).  It is then, according to Dr. Plender,a matter for a national court to decide as a matter of national law whether or not an individual, such as WMI or its directors, canrely on breach by ADS of its obligation to consult under the 73 Decision.</p>    <p><a name="p8.6.7" class="para" id="p8.6.7">8.6.7</a> Mr. Forwood, however, maintained that it was not only necessary as a matter of Community law to show that the provisions in questionpassed Dr. Plenderâs pre-conditions, but also to show as a matter of Community law that the provision was apt to confer rightson individuals.  After some hesitation, he asserted that both were requirements of direct effect.  He relied upon <u>Direct Effect and the Supremacy of Community Law</u> by Professor Hartley.  Chapter 7 at page 195 reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe purpose of this chapter is to consider the extent to which provisions of Community law must be applied by national courts -in other words, the extent to which they are part of the law of the land. ...</p>        <p class="quote">The key concept is that of <i>direct effect</i>.  The European Court has, on numerous occasions, made clear what is meant by this: if a legal provision is said to be directly effective,it is meant that it grants individuals rights which must be upheld by the national courts.  It should be noticed that this definitionrefers to <i>rights</i>, rather than to obligations, and to rights enforceable by <i>individuals</i>, rather than by public authorities.  This is because the most common situation in practice is where a private citizen seeks to invokeCommunity law against a public authority in a Member State, usually the central government. ...</p>        <p class="quote">As a matter of general principle, a legal provision cannot be directly effective unless two requirements are satisfied.  First ofall, the provision must be part of the law of the land or, to put it in a different way, it must be legally valid from the pointof view of the national courts.  This does not mean that it has to be part of the national legal system, in the sense that an Actof Parliament is part of the United Kingdom legal system, but merely that the national courts must recognize it as valid and bindinglaw.  <u>The second requirement is that the terms of the provision must be appropriate to confer rights on individuals</u>.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.8" class="para" id="p8.6.8">8.6.8</a> It was in relation to that last sentence (my emphasis) that much of the argument arose, until it was eventually accepted by the Defendantsthat the second requirement did arise.  The Defendants maintained however that, although it was to be determined by Community law,it was distinct from albeit related to direct effect.  Whether or not that is correct, it was at least common ground that, both setsof requirements having been satisfied, it is for the national courts to give effect to the relevant provision and, in the case ofan English court, by application of section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972.</p>    <p><a name="p8.6.9" class="para" id="p8.6.9">8.6.9</a> There was no dispute that the 73 Decision complied with the 3 pre-conditions.

One of Mr. Costaâs arguments was that nationalisation inherently involved state aid which was incompatible withthe Common Market.  He relied on a number of Articles in the Treaty, including Article 93.  Several passages of the judgment of thecourt are instructive.  At page 595, the court said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âOn the interpretation of Article 102</p>        <p>Article 102 provides that, where âthere is reason to fearâ that a provision laid down by law may cause âdistortionâ, the MemberState desiring to proceed therewith shall âconsult the Commissionâ; the Commission has power to recommend to the Member Statesthe adoption of suitable measures to avoid the distortion feared.  .....</p>        <p>By virtue of this provision, Member States have limited their freedom of initiative by agreeing to submit to an appropriate procedureof consultation.  By binding themselves unambiguously to prior consultation with the Commission in all those cases where their projectedlegislation might create a risk, however slight, of a possible distortion, the States have undertaken an obligation to the Communitywhich binds them as States, but which does not create individual rights which national courts must protect.  For its part, the Commissionis bound to ensure respect for the provisions of this Article, but this obligation does not give individuals the right to allege,within the framework of Community law and by means of Article 177 either failure by the State concerned to fulfil any of its obligationsor breach of duty on the part of the Commission.</p>        <p>On the interpretation of Article 93</p>        <p>Under Article 93 (1) and (2), the Commission, in cooperation with Member States, is to âkeep under constant review all systems ofaid existing in those Statesâ with a view to the adoption of appropriate measures required by the functioning of the Common Market.</p>        <p>By virtue of Article 93(3), the Commission is to be informed, in sufficient time, of any plans to grant or alter aid, the Member Stateconcerned not being entitled to put its proposed measures into effect until the Community procedure, and, if necessary, any proceedingsbefore the Court of Justice, have been completed.</p>        <p>These provisions, contained in the section of the Treaty headed âAids granted by Statesâ, are designed, on the one hand, to eliminateprogressively existing aids and, on the other hand, to prevent the individual States in the conduct of their internal affairs fromintroducing new aids âin any form whatsoeverâ which are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or productsin an appreciable way, and which threaten, even potentially, to distort competition.  By virtue of Article 92, the Member Stateshave acknowledged that such aids are incompatible with the Common Market and have thus implicitly undertaken not to create any more,save as otherwise provided in the Treaty; in Article 93, on the other hand, they have merely agreed to submit themselves to appropriateprocedures for the abolition of existing aids and the introduction of new ones.</p>        <p>By so expressly undertaking to inform the Commission âin sufficient timeâ of any plans for aid, and by accepting the procedureslaid down in Article 93, the States have entered into an obligation with the Community, which binds them as States but creates noindividual rights except in the case of the final provision of Article 93(3), which is not in question in the present case.</p>        <p>For its part, the Commission is bound to ensure respect for the provisions of this Article, and is required, in cooperation with MemberStates, to keep under constant review existing systems of aids.  This obligation does not, however, give individuals the right toplead, within the framework of Community law and by means of Article 177, either failure by the State concerned to fulfil any ofits obligations or breach of duty on the part of the Commission.(My emphasis)</p>        <p>On the interpretation of Article 53</p>        <p>By Article 53 the Member States undertake not to introduce any new restrictions on the right of establishment in their territoriesof nationals of other Member States, save as otherwise provided in the Treaty.  The obligation thus entered into by the States simplyamounts legally to a duty not to act, which is neither subject to any conditions, nor, as regards its execution or effect, to theadoption of any measure either by the States or by the Commission.  It is therefore legally complete in itself and is consequentlycapable of producing direct effects on the relations between Member States and individuals.  Such an express prohibition which cameinto force with the Treaty throughout the Community, and thus became an integral part of the legal system of the Member States, formspart of the law of those States and directly concerns their nations, in whose favour it has created individual rights which nationalcourts must protect.  .....</p>        <p>On the interpretation of Article 37</p>        <p>Article 37(1) provides that Member States shall progressively adjust any âState monopolies of a commercial characterâ so as toensure that no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of MemberStates.  By Article 37(2), the Member States are under an obligation to refrain from introducing any new measure which is contraryto the principles laid down in Article 37(1).</p>        <p>Thus, Member States have undertaken a dual obligation: in the first place, an active one to adjust State monopolies, in the secondplace, a passive one to avoid any new measures.  The interpretation requested is of the second obligation together with any aspectof the first necessary for this interpretation.</p>        <p>Article 37(2) contains an absolute prohibition: not an obligation to do something but an obligation to refrain from doing something. This obligation is not accompanied by any reservation which might make its implementation subject to any positive act of nationallaw.

It was Mr. Forwoodâs view that persons entitled to rely upon breaches of obligation of this nature are competitorsor other persons adversely affected.  He suggested that Mr. Costa could be said to be adversely affected because nationalisationof the electricity industry removed competition from the industry and, with it, the possibility of lower electricity charges.</p>    <p><a name="p8.6.14" class="para" id="p8.6.14">8.6.14</a> <i><u>Gebr.

The German authorities had notified the Commission of a proposal to make changes in their systemof regional grants, but implemented the proposal before any decision on compatibility was made by the Commission.  Under the newlaw, the plaintiff was unable to obtain an investment grant.  At page 1482, the court said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âThe third question asks whether the term âMember Stateâ in Article 93(3) of the Treaty must be interpreted as meaning thatthe individual has a direct right in the non-infringement of this provision or whether it, at the very least, requires the nationalcourt of its own motion to take account of the invalidity of a law which grants aid in contravention of the prohibition on implementationlaid down in Article 93(3). </p>        <p>It has already been decided in the judgment of 15th July 1964 (Case 6/64, Rec. 1964, p. 1141), that the prohibition on implementationreferred to in the last sentence of Article 93(3) has a direct effect and gives rise to rights in favour of individuals, which nationalcourts are bound to safeguard.</p>        <p>The immediately applicable nature of this prohibition extends to the whole of the period to which it applies.</p>        <p>Thus the direct effect of the prohibition extends to all aid which has been implemented without being notified and, in the event ofnotification, operates during the preliminary period, and where the Commission sets in motion the contentious procedure, up to thefinal decision.</p>        <p>As regards the second part of this question, while the direct effect of the prohibition in question requires national courts to applyit without any possibility of its being excluded by rules of national law of any kind whatsoever, it is for the internal legal systemof every Member State to determine the legal procedure leading to this result.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.15" class="para" id="p8.6.15">8.6.15</a> Case No. 6/64 there referred to was <i><u>Costa v.

The levy on the latter, however, was lower.  After notification of the proposal under Art.93(3) of the Treaty, but before the standstill had expired, France implemented the system.  Although the system would benefit them,representatives of the domestic fishing industry, because of the disparity in the levy, sought to have the relevant ministerial orderannulled.  At page 5528 the court, immediately after the passage I have already referred to, said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn view of the foregoing considerations it must be held that the validity of measures giving effect to aid is affected if nationalauthorities act in breach of the last sentence of Article 93(3) of the Treaty.  National courts must offer to individuals in a positionto rely on such breach the certain prospect that all the necessary inferences will be drawn, in accordance with their national law,as regards the validity of measures giving effect to the aid, the recovery of financial support granted in disregard of that provisionand possible interim measures.</p>        <p class="quote">It is true that in its judgments in Case C-301/87 <i>France v Commission</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20ECR%20I%2d307" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] ECR I-307</a> and Case 142/87 <i>Belgium v Commission</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20ECR%20I%2d959" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] ECR I-959</a> the Court did not find that the Commission had the power to declare aid illegal solely on the ground that the obligation to notifyhad not been complied with and without having to investigate whether the aid was compatible with the common market.  However, thatfinding has no effect on the obligations of national courts deriving from the direct effect which the prohibition laid down by thelast sentence of Article 93(3) of the Treaty has been held to have.</p>        <p class="quote">In this respect it should be noted, as did the Advocate General in point 24 of his Opinion, that the principal and exclusive roleconferred on the Commission by Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty, which is to hold aid to be incompatible with the common market wherethis is appropriate, is fundamentally different from the role of national courts in safeguarding rights which individuals enjoy asa result of the direct effect of the prohibition laid down in the last sentence of Article 93(3) of the Treaty.  Whilst the Commissionmust examine the compatibility of the proposed aid with the common market, even where the Member State has acted in breach of theprohibition on giving effect to aid, national courts do no more than preserve, until the final decision of the Commission, the rightsof individuals faced with a possible breach by State authorities of the prohibition laid down by the last sentence of Article 93(3)of the Treaty.  When those courts make a ruling in such matter, they do not thereby decide on the compatibility of the aid with thecommon market, the final determination on that matter being the exclusive responsibility of the Commission, subject to the supervisionof the Court of Justice.</p>        <p class="quote">In the second part of its question, the Conseil dâÃtat inquires about the possible effect, on the validity of measures giving effectto the aid, of a final decision by the Commission declaring the aid compatible with the common market.</p>        <p class="quote">It must be stated in this regard that the Commissionâs final decision does not have the effect of regularizing <i>ex post facto</i> the implementing measures which were invalid because they had been taken in breach of the prohibition laid down by the last sentenceof Article 93(3) of the Treaty, since otherwise the direct effect of that prohibition would be impaired and the interests of individuals,which, as stated above, are to be protected by national courts, would be disregarded.  Any other interpretation would have the effectof according a favourable outcome to the non-observance by the Member State concerned of the last sentence of Article 93(3) and woulddeprive that provision of its effectiveness.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.18" class="para" id="p8.6.18">8.6.18</a> It is not difficult to see in that case how Article 93(3) is capable of creating rights for individuals.  Nor is it difficult tosee how, for the purpose of Issue 7, the French fishing representatives were amongst those conferred with such rights, and why theirstatus did not merit debate.  The case is also instructive in spelling out as it does:  the respective functions of the Commission,i.e. to adjudicate on compatibility, and of the national court, i.e. to enforce compliance with the standstill provision of Article93(3); the obligation on Member States; and the ârights of individuals faced with a possible breachâ.  The last quote is perhapsas good a touch-stone as any for a national court in determining whether an individual is one on whom rights have been conferred. Put another way, a person who has a legitimate interest in the relevant obligation, e.g. the standstill procedure in Article 93(3),being properly observed.  As I said, the French fishermen plainly faced a breach; equally plainly, French coal miners, for example,did not.  In some cases the, line may be difficult to draw.

Insuch a case the Commission must, under Article 92 and 93, assess the situation as a whole, including the method of financing theaid.  If follows that the Commission must be informed of the method of financing under Article 93(3).</p>        <p>That the grant of an aid or the alteration of an aid in breach of Article 93(3) is unlawful, and that that provision has direct effectin the sense that private persons are entitled to rely on it in the national Courts, are propositions established by decisions ofthis Court so numerous and so familiar that it is unnecessary to cite them.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.20" class="para" id="p8.6.20">8.6.20</a> As I have said, it was Mr. Forwoodâs view that the persons entitled to rely on breach of obligation by a Member State were competitorsor others adversely affected by the measure in issue.  In relation to this case, Mr. Forwood said the way in which the financingof a scheme is imposed on those who have to contribute is regarded as an integral part of the Commissionâs assessment of compatibility. Therefore in <i><u>French Salmon</u></i>, the French fishermen who brought the proceedings could have been entitled to take part in the procedure before the Commission underArticle 93(2) and make a submission to the effect that the scheme distorted competition because it unfairly imposed different levelsof levy.

To the detriment of land based traders in Germany,certain shipping companies organised day trips from Baltic ports during which passengers could buy duty-free items, such as spirits,butter, meat and other commodities.  Also, export refunds on butter and meat were granted to the companies to the detriment of theCommunity.  Two traders commenced proceedings in the finance court claiming the âbutter buying cruisesâ were in breach of Communitylaw on the basis that the German authorities had granted exemption from customs duties which they were not entitled to grant andhad infringed the Community regulation on the common customs tariff.

A directive âshall be binding, as to the result to be achievedâ, but leaves to the nationalauthorities the choice of form and methods.  According to the case-law of the Court the binding effect of a directive implies thata national authority may not apply to an individual a national legislative or administrative measure which is not in accordance witha provision of the directive which has all the characteristics necessary to render possible its application by the court.</p>        <p>It follows from these considerations that a person may rely before the national courts on his rights under the regulation.</p>        <p>Likewise, a national authority may not apply to a person legislative or administrative measures which are not in accordance with anunconditional and sufficiently clear obligation imposed by the directive.</p>        <p>With regard to the right of a trader to request the courts to require the authorities of a Member State to compel a third party tocomply with obligations arising from Community rules in a given legal situation in which that trader is not involved but is economicallyadversely affected by the failure to observe Community law, it must be remarked first of all that, although the Treaty has made itpossible in a number of instances for private persons to bring a direct action, where appropriate, before the Court of Justice, itwas not intended to create new remedies in the national courts to ensure the observance of Community law other than those alreadylaid down by national law.  On the other hand the system of legal protection established by the Treaty, as set out in Article 177in particular, implies that it must be possible for every type of action provided for by national law to be available for the purposeof ensuring observance of Community provisions having direct effect, on the same conditions concerning the admissibility and procedureas would apply were it a question of ensuring observance of national law.  .....</p>        <p>The reply to the third, fifth and eighth questions should accordingly be as follows:</p>        <p>âThe system of legal protection established by the Treaty, as set out in Article 177 in particular, implies that it must be possiblefor every type of action provided for by national law to be available before the national courts for the purpose of ensuring observanceof Community provisions having direct effect, on the same conditions concerning admissibility and procedure as would apply were ita question of ensuring observance of national law.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.22" class="para" id="p8.6.22">8.6.22</a> That answer clarifies that a person involved in litigation involving Community law in a national court must have available to himthe same forensic weapons and remedies as if he was pursuing national litigation, and that he may pursue or enforce any rights conferredon him.  The passage also assumes that âa person whose interests are adversely affectedâ is a proper party.  Further light isthrown on the subject in the opinion of Mr. Advocate-General Capotorti.  After distinguishing between persons upon whom a personalright has been conferred and persons who simply have an interest in enforcement of a particular provision, the Advocate-General saidat page 1850:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIn conclusion, the proposition may be advanced that it is sufficient not to confuse, on the one hand, the personal right whicharises in the context of a specific relationship on the conditions laid down in the provision in question and, on the other hand,the interest of third parties that the provision should be observed.  Only the holder of the right, as opposed to a person who hasan interest of the latter class, is entitled to bring legal proceedings in order to ensure that the provision is applied in relationto his particular situation.  Any other view would entail allowing a kind of <i>azione popolare</i> [civil action serving as a test case on a matter affecting public interests] on the basis of directly applicable Community provisions;but that would be contrary to the legal traditions common to the Member States and would, moreover, threaten to give rise to seriouspractical difficulties in the administration of justice (one has only to think of the number of persons who might have some kindof interest in the proper application of certain Community provisions!).</p>        <p>The conclusion at which I have arrived does not, however, rule out the possibility that persons having an interest in the enforcementof a regulation may be able to claim rights under the national legal system applicable to them where the action of the administrativeauthorities at variance with Community law is subject to an appraisal the basis of which includes provisions or principles of nationallaw, provided that under such provisions or principles the persons in question are considered to have rights which may be enforcedin the courts.  The most obvious example is the right to damages for the loss resulting from an unlawful act of the administrativeauthorities: the matter dealt with in the above-mentioned judgment in the <i><u>Russo v. AIMA</u></i> case.  However, there is nothing to preclude the view that, where there are provisions of national legislation at variance with Communitylaw or with personal rights guaranteed by the constitution (where, for example, a national constitution extends protection of theright to equal treatment to persons engaged in economic activity), a private individual may rely upon such rights in order to havethe provisions discontinued and thereby ensure, indirectly, that Community law is complied with.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.23" class="para" id="p8.6.23">8.6.23</a> Finally, in relation to directives, the Advocate-General said at page 1851:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIt must be borne in mind that the provisions of a directive are not usually of such a nature as to create rights for the benefitof individuals; such an effect may be recognized only as an exception and with regard to certain provisions of directives which displayspecific characteristics.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.24" class="para" id="p8.6.24">8.6.24</a> In <i><u>Bulk Oil (Zug) AG v. Sun International Ltd.</u></i> case 174/84, dated 18th February 1986, the litigants sought to rely upon an alleged failure by the United Kingdom to comply witha Decision requiring Member States to consult, but not to standstill, if they contemplated changes to their policies of liberalizationof trade with third countries.  The court found that UK was not in breach of an obligation.  But at page 591, the ECJ said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â51. However, the Commission takes the view that, supposing the United Kingdom to have failed to fulfil its obligation under thedecision of 9th October 1961 to give prior notice of its policy, the obligation to notify is not a rule of Community law which hasdirect effect in the sense of the Courtâs judgment of 15th July 1964 (Case 6/64, <i><u>Costa v. ENEL</u></i>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20ECR%20585" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] ECR 585)</a>, since the 1961 decision does not oblige the Member State to obtain or even to seek approval for the measures which envisages.  Evenafter the consultations provided for by the decision the Member State remains free, subject to its other obligations under Communitylaw, to adopt whatever policy it thinks appropriate.  Such a failure to notify therefore does not affect the validity of the UnitedKingdom policy in the light of Community law.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>And at page 594;</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â61. A Member State which fails to give prior notice, delays in doing so or does so in an inadequate manner fails to fulfil itsobligations under the combined provisions of the Council decisions of 9th October 1961, 25th September 1962 and 16th September 1969.</p>        <p>62. It must be pointed out, however, that that obligation, to which all the Member States are subject under the provisions referredto, concerns only the institutional relationship between a Member State and the community and the other Member States.  In proceedingsbefore national courts between natural or legal persons such persons cannot attack a policy or measure adopted by a Member Stateon the basis that that Member State has failed to fulfil its obligation to inform the other Member States and the Commission beforehand. Such a failure therefore does not create individual rights which national courts must protect.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>8.6.25 Mr. Forwood also took comfort from this case.  He emphasised the difference between Article 93, which he said was part of theframework for achieving a Common Market in which competition is not distorted, and the 73 Decision as part of the common commercialpolicy which policy was concerned with co-ordinating Member Statesâ external trade policies progressively into a community tradepolicy.  <i><u>Bulk</u></i>, he said, fell into the latter category when the court found that the relevant Directives did not produce effects on which individualscould rely or rights which needed to be protected.</p>    <p><a name="p8.6.26" class="para" id="p8.6.26">8.6.26</a> Mr. Forwood drew a further distinction.  He said Article 93(3) invokes Article 92(2) under which the Commission gives ânotice tothe parties concerned to submit their commentsâ.  Accordingly, there is a defined role for individuals and a right to be involvedin the decision-making procedure.  In contrast, the 73 Decision contains no such provisions.  Mr. Forwood put it thus (Day 140/98):</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIn that connection, when it comes to deciding whether Article 93(3) creates rights for individuals which Courts must protect, itis relevant that the standstill obligations in Article 93 are intended, as the Courts have pointed out on several occasions, to allowthe proper performance of the examination by the Commission of the compatibility of the aid in question.</p>        <p>In my view, that is a very different situation from the situation which exists under Articles 8 and 10(3) of the 1973 decision, wherethe consultation essentially takes place between States without any involvement of the undertakings who may be affected by the grantof credit and, moreover, in a situation in which the result of that consultation is not binding on the consulting State in the waythat a decision by the Commission, on the incompatibility of an aid, is binding on the notifying State under Article 93(3); subjectto, of course, appeal to the Court of Justice.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.27" class="para" id="p8.6.27">8.6.27</a> <i><u>Ketelhandel P. van Paassen B.V. v.

It was referred to by Advocate General Sir Gordon Slynn in <i><u>Bulk Oil</u></i>.  It concerned a Directive which required a Member State intending to adopt a certain system in relation to turnover taxes to consultand âit shall refer the matter to the Commission in good time, having regard to the application of Article 102 of the Treatyâ. Article 102 raised the possibility of a later more formal procedure.

The sixth paragraph of the article thenstipulates that the State concerned my not apply the proposed measures until the period for entering objections has expired or aftera particular procedure has been implemented.  Again, Article 93(3) of the Treaty provides for the Commission to be informed.

The Directive did not prohibit the sale and use of plastic bags.  The absence of such a prohibitiondid not prevent Member States from imposing their own prohibitions to protect the environment.  The Directive required Member Statesto inform the Commission in good time of any draft rules relating to such sale and use.  At page 2517, the court said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â19. The purpose of the third question is to determine whether Article 3(2) of Directive 75/422 gives individuals a right whichthey may enforce before the national courts in order to obtain the annulment or suspension of national rules falling within the scopeof that provision on the ground that those rules were adopted without having previously been communicated to the Commission of theEuropean Communities.</p>        <p>20. Article 3(2) merely requires the Member States to inform the Commission in good time of any draft rules within the scope of thatprovision, without laying down any procedure for Community monitoring thereof or making implementation of the planned rules conditionalupon agreement by the Commission or its failure to object.</p>        <p>21. The obligation imposed on the Member States by Article 3(2) is intended to ensure that the Commission is informed of any plansfor national measures regarding waste disposal so that it can consider whether Community harmonizing legislation is called for andwhether the draft rules submitted to it are compatible with Community law, and take appropriate measures if necessary.</p>        <p>22. Neither the wording nor the purpose of the provision in question provides any support for the view that failure by the MemberStates to observed their obligation to give prior notice in itself renders unlawful the rules thus adopted.</p>        <p>23. It follows from the foregoing that the abovementioned provision concerns relations between the Member States and the Commissionand does not give rise to any right for individuals which might be infringed by a Member Stateâs breach of its obligation to informthe Commission in advance of draft rules.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.29" class="para" id="p8.6.29">8.6.29</a> Mr. Forwood felt there was a parallel to the present case, not least the view expressed in para. 20.

The first point which must be made is that Directive 83/189 is designed to protect, by means of preventive control, freedomof movement for goods, which is one of the foundations of the Community.  This control serves a useful purpose in that technicalregulations covered by the directive may constitute obstacles to trade in goods between Member States, such obstacles being permissibleonly if they are necessary to satisfy compelling public interest requirements.  The control is also effective in that all draft technicalregulations covered by the directive must be notified and, except in the case of those regulations whose urgency justifies an exception,their adoption or entry into force must be suspended during the periods laid down by Article 9.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">41.    The notification and the period of suspension therefore afford the Commission and the other Member States an opportunity toexamine whether the draft regulations in question create obstacles to trade contrary to the EC Treaty or obstacles which are to beavoided through the adoption of common or harmonized measures and also to propose amendments to the national measures envisaged. This procedure also enables the Commission to propose or adopt Community rules regulating the matter dealt with by the envisagemeasure.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.31" class="para" id="p8.6.31">8.6.31</a> And later:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â48.   ... it is undisputed that the aim of the directive is to protect freedom of movement for goods by means of preventive controland that the obligation to notify is essential for achieving such Community control.  The effectiveness of Community control willbe that much greater if the directive is interpreted as meaning that breach of the obligation to notify constitutes a substantialprocedural defect such as to render the technical regulations in question inapplicable to individuals.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">49.    That interpretation of the directive is in accordance with the judgment given in Case 380/87 <i>Enichem Base and Others v Comune di Cinisello Balsamo</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20ECR%202491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] ECR 2491</a>, paragraphs 19 to 24. ...</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">50.    ... the aim of the directive is not simply to inform the Commission.

Moreover, the wording of Articles 8 and 9 of Directive 83/189 is clear in that those articles provide fora procedure for Community control of draft national regulations and the date of their entry into force is made subject to the Commissionâsagreement or lack of opposition.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.32" class="para" id="p8.6.32">8.6.32</a> ECJ held that individuals could rely on this directive.</p>    <p><a name="p8.6.33" class="para" id="p8.6.33">8.6.33</a> Having regard to the evidence, the authorities and the submissions made, all of which I have studied carefully although because oftheir scope I have not been able to reproduce them in anything like comprehensive form, I reach the following conclusions :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1.   Although a provision in Community legislation maybe precise, immediate and unconditional, a national court will still have todetermine whether it gives rise to individual rights or concerns only the institutional relationship between Member States and theCommission.  Only if the court determines that the provision creates individual rights, will an individual be able to take advantageof the doctrine of direct effect.  For what it is worth, because the argument seemed to me to be somewhat sterile, I find Mr. Forwoodand Professor Hartley to be correct in their view that the concept of direct effect is only complete if the provision concerned isapt to confer individual rights.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2.   A distinction is to be drawn between individuals who have a mere interest in the proper enforcement of a provision and thosewho are able to claim a right.  The former category may be very broad as in <i><u>Rewe</u></i>.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>3.   In general, provisions requiring consultation that enables the Commission to consider whether any harmonisation is necessarydo not confer individual rights.  Provisions which impose a prohibition on Member States are, however, likely to confer such rights.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>4.   Where rights are conferred, the individuals (or class) who can enforce them include those whose interests will be adversely affectedby the failure of the Member State to comply with its obligations under the provision.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>5.   The 73 decision is about consultation.  Its provisions go further then mere notification or consultation.  It prescribes themethod for providing information and the information required, and provides for a timetable and for a standstill.  The passing ofinformation and consultation, however, is confined to Member States.  The consulting state is not obliged to accept objections orcontrary views of other Member States.  It is, in essence, a monitoring provision.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>6.   In contrast, Article 93 and the 5th directive cast a wider net and allow âparties concernedâ to contribute.  At stake isthe question of compatibility which, involving as it does matters of distortion and effect on trade, admits of contribution fromparties involved in undertakings or production of goods similar to that to which aid is to be granted.  The Commissionâs assessmenton compatibility is binding and enforceable by sanctions.  It is to be noted, however, as ECJ made clear in <u>Costa</u> (para. <a>8.6</a>.12), that it is only the standstill in Article 93(3) that is directly effective, not the wider requirements of that Article.  Thestandstill is, of course, a prohibition by nature.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>7.   I find therefore that the 73 decision is confined to imposing obligations between Member States and is not apt to create individualrights.  The Defendants cannot rely on it.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>8.   Even if the 73 decision created individual rights those rights would be conferred on individuals who could make a relevant contributionto consultation, principally perhaps persons seeing themselves disadvantaged by the terms in issue and wishing either to oppose themor be afforded the opportunity to improve on them.  The Defendants would not fall within this or any other relevant class.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>9.   The individuals afforded rights under Article 93(3) and the 5th directive (which are admittedly directly effective) are similarlyrestricted.

It is also common ground that a national court must drawall the necessary inferences in accordance with their national law as regards the validity of measures giving effect to aid.</p>    <p><a name="p8.6.53" class="para" id="p8.6.53">8.6.53</a> The implementation of the revised arrangements was illegal as a matter of Community law to the extent that it involved giving effectto alterations or a new grant of aid.  It is therefore necessary to determine whether the other elements of the revised loan arrangementsare distinct or severable from the illegality, which is a matter of national law.  The other elements include the borrowersâ promisesto repay, provisions for repayment in full in the event of certain events, and the related guarantees and other securities.</p>    <p><a name="p8.6.54" class="para" id="p8.6.54">8.6.54</a> The law is clear.  National courts must protect community rights: see <i><u>French Salmon</u></i> at para. 8.6.17 above.  No question of <u>need</u> to protect such rights, as ADS suggested, therefore arises.  If an individual has acquired rights under Community legislation, heis entitled to see them given effect by his national court.  By the same token, I do not see how giving effect to such rights, conferredby Community legislation, might somehow give rise to considerations of incompatibility with common market objectives, as the Defendantssuggested.</p>    <p><a name="p8.6.55" class="para" id="p8.6.55">8.6.55</a> The latter point is somewhat artificial.  It was generated by ADSâ understandable outrage at the windfall WMI would have receivedhad the financial arrangements turned out to be unenforceable.  The difficulty arises because the European authorities are confinedto cases, brought generally by an adversely affected party, where the result amongst other things has been an order for recoveryof the illegal aid but not a striking down of the whole aid arrangement.  That has the effect of furthering the Communityâs aimof eliminating distortion and enhancing fair competition.  How, ADS asked, will that aim be furthered by allowing WMI and the Defendantsto retain the whole benefit of the aid including the illegal parts thereof.</p>    <p><a name="p8.6.56" class="para" id="p8.6.56">8.6.56</a> In my view, this conundrum simply emphasises how unlikely it is that WMI or the Defendants acquired any rights under the two provisions.

The Defendantsâ case is that the revised financial arrangements, including the WMI guarantees,were illegal.  The guarantees were illegal either because they were part of an overall scheme or were tainted by the underlying transactions. That led to consideration of the line of authority following <i><u>St. John Shipping Corporation v.

Consequently any other contractual provisions which are not affected by the prohibition, and which therefore do not involve theapplication of the Treaty, fall outside Community law.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.60" class="para" id="p8.6.60">8.6.60</a> In his opinion, Mr. Advocate-General Roemer said at page 259:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â..............the reply to this question does not raise any special difficulties if the objectives of the Treaty are kept in mind. It is necessary to start with the idea that the Treaty only prohibits anything which might run counter to the implementation ofits principles.  This means in the present case obstacles of an international character placed in the way of competition and of acertain magnitude.  Other factors which may be found alongside these obstacles do not matter in the eyes of the Treaty, or at anyrate they do not matter for Article 85.  Thus it seems to be established in principle that the only parts of an agreement which canbe struck down by the nullity imposed by Article 85(2) are those which bring about a restriction on competition and which must beconsidered as the decisive causes of an interference with competition.  I do not think the acceptance of wider effects would be justified,particularly since it is often only by chance that at the same time as causing a restriction on competition the parties enter intoother commitments and include them in the same agreement.  In particular it would be a mistake to agree with Technique MiniÃ¨re thatthe total nullity of the agreement is justified by the idea of penalizing undertakings which infringe the principle of competition. National competition law does not go along with such ideas either. ............  Nor, finally, do I see insurmountable difficultiesin the fact that to decide which are the clauses that matter from the point of view of a restriction on competition may sometimesbe a delicate task, especially when this only results from a combination of several clauses.  The difficulties are not insurmountablebecause once the principle of conferring on the national court the power to decide whether the factor justifying the applicationof Article 85(1) have arisen is accepted (and that is only right), it may also be entrusted with the duty of carrying out the severanceof the agreement of which I have made mention above.  It may particularly be entrusted with this duty thanks to the existence ofArticle 177 of the EEC Treaty, which can, where necessary, render assistance through the preliminary rulings of this Court.</p>        <p>Accordingly, let me say that in principle the competition law of the Treaty only covers those parts of an agreement which come withinthe province of that law.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.61" class="para" id="p8.6.61">8.6.61</a> That case received recognition in <i><u>Chemidus Wavin Limited v.

TheCourt of Appeal agreed, saying that the position had been made clear by <i><u>Technique MiniÃ¨re</u></i>.  At page 519 Buckley L.J. said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â[18]  So, the position appears clearly to be this, that where in a contract there are certain clauses which are annulled by reasonof their being in contravention of <b>Article 85, paragraph (1)</b>, of the Treaty, one must look at the contract with those clauses struck out and see what the effect of that is in the light of thedomestic law which governs the particular contract.  In the present case, we have to consider what effect the invalidity, if any,of the clauses in the licence agreement by reason of <b>Article 85</b> would have upon that contract as a whole.  Whether it is right to regard the matter as one of severance of the contract or not, Ido not think it is necessary for us to consider now.  I doubt whether it is really a question of severance in the sense in whichwe in these courts are accustomed to use that term in considering whether covenants contained in contracts of employment and so forthare void as being in restraint of trade, and, if they are to any extent void, whether those covenants can be severed so as to savepart of the covenant, although another part may be bad.  It seems to me that, in applying <b>Article 85</b> to an English contract, one may well have to consider whether, after the excisions required by the <b>Article</b> of the Treaty have been made from the contract, the contract could be said to fail for lack of consideration or on any other ground,or whether the contract would be so changed in its character as not to be the sort of contract that the parties intended to enterinto at all.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.62" class="para" id="p8.6.62">8.6.62</a> Orr and Goff L.J.J. agreed, the latter saying at page 522:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âwhat happens to the rest of the agreement is then a matter for the municipal lawâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8.6.63" class="para" id="p8.6.63">8.6.63</a> The result is, in my view, sensible.

It is ADSâ case, as set out in its Reply, that Community law is irrelevant.  The foundation of ADSâ claimis that it is a creditor of WMI, a status it derives from the guarantees given by WMI as part of the <u>1985</u> restructuring.  In the restructuring, according to ADS, Liberian ship-owning companies took up new obligations to repay the moneyalready advanced so that there arose new, free-standing covenants to repay supported by new guarantees, while the allegedly voiddebt was extinguished.  The Defendants pleaded that the 1985 agreements were illegal because, like the earlier revisions, they werenot notified.  This ADS met in its Reply by a general denial.  No evidence or argument however was addressed to the illegality ofthe 1985 arrangements.  Therefore, argued ADS, the Defendantsâ plea must fail.</p>    <p><a name="p8.7.2" class="para" id="p8.7.2">8.7.2</a> The Defendants accepted that the illegality, if any, affected the 1983/84 revisions because of their non-notification and implementation. They argue, however, either that the 1985 agreements were tainted or infected by the earlier agreements - an argument which cannotsucceed because there is no relevant evidence; or that because the 83/84 agreements were illegal and unenforceable, there was nothingto transfer in 1985 - which is not pleaded.  In any event, argued the Defendants, ADS should not be allowed to raise at this stagewhat is in effect a new positive case which is at variance with their pleaded case that the loans were âcontinuedâ.  Further,if ADS relies on extinction of the 83/84 agreements and on the free standing nature of the agreements reached in 1985, then the linkwith the 83/84 agreements on which ADS founds liability is lost.  The only relevance of the 83/84 agreements would have been historical.</p>    <p><a name="p8.7.3" class="para" id="p8.7.3">8.7.3</a> I accept, as Mr. Cullen submitted, that there was a novation in 1985 in order to ensure that the two original ship owning companieswere released from any liability.  The reality of the situation, however, was that for the benefit of WMI and its group, the loanswere âcontinuedâ, as ADS pleaded.  In my view, those agreements were part and parcel of the overall financial arrangements betweenADS and WMI and inseparable from any illegality affecting those arrangements arising from non-notification and implementation ofthe revised loan terms.  Accordingly, I would not have allowed the Defendantsâ plea of illegality to fail had it otherwise beensustained.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><b><a name="9">9.

The calculation,however, is not so simple as that for which they contended.  What is involved is actual not theoretical loss.  The actual loss canbe calculated by reference to what EKR had to pay under its DA guarantees.  EKR did not call for liquidation of the deposits butmade shortfall payments during the life of the two loans.  These payments amounted to Dkr 114,774,000.00 and 74,196,200.00 in relationto Sealock and Annalock respectively.

In my judgment, the appropriate rate is not simply the 7Â½% payable by ADS on its bondsbut the rate given by these courts on awards of debt or damages.  That rate fluctuates according to circumstances.  I am of the viewthat 13% is a proper rate in this case having regard to rates which have prevailed in these courts, the rate provided for in relationto the deferred instalments and commercial rates then prevailing in Denmark.  That rate is to run from 22nd November 1991 in relationto Sealock and 25th November 1992 in relation to Annalock, in each case until judgment.  Thereafter, interest will be at the rateprescribed by the Chief Justice in accordance with the Rules of the Supreme Court.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left; text-transform: uppercase;margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:left;text-indent:0in"> </p>    <p><b><a name="10">10.

The burden of what was, by any standard, a long and difficult trial was made very much lighter by the mannerin which they assembled and presented the prodigous quantity of material, both legal and factual.  I also pay tribute to the friendlyand cooperative way in which they conducted themselves without, of course, losing sight of their duty to their clients.  BecauseI was not continually called upon to resolve disputes and calm tempers I was able to concentrate on the evidence and issues.</a></p>    <p><a name="p11.2" class="para" id="p11.2">11.2</a> <a>I must also thank the instructing solicitors for the coherent and practical assembly of the large number of documents, the technicalarrangements and the ready way in which they responded to my requests for copies and other assistance.</a></p>    <p><a name="p11.3" class="para" id="p11.3">11.3</a> <a>Finally, I should mention that, apart from the live television link to which I have referred, the trial was afforded the use of LiveNote. This system provides a near-instantaneous record of the proceedings with the aid of a computer.  It  has the advantage that anydoubt or dispute about what was said can be resolved immediately, while earlier evidence can be recalled easily and quickly. I acknowledgethe cheerful help I received from all LiveNote staff whether in producing the transcript or educating a hitherto pen-and-ink judgein the mysteries of modern technology.</a></p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"> </td>            <td width="50%">                <p align="center"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">(N.J.
