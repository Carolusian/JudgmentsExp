Her death was not due to any of the actions or negligence on the part of the Defendant.  ThePlaintiff is seeking compensation for the breach of common duty of care under Sec. 3 of the Occupiersâ Liability Ordinance andfor the negligence of the Defendantâs servants or agents in failing to take reasonable care of the deceased as a resident and traineeat the Hostel.  It is the Plaintiffâs case that Choi Ying sustained injuries due to a fall on 31<sup>st</sup> October 2003 which was caused by the hospitalâs failure to maintain a safe environment for Choi Ying or to take reasonable stepsto ensure that Choi Yingâs stay at the Hostel was free from injuries.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b><u>The Plaintiffâs Case</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Plaintiff relied on the records kept by the Defendant and the hospitals alleging 14 incidents of falls and injuries on variousdays prior to the accident on 31<sup>st</sup> October 2003 to show that Choi Ying was prone to falling while she was a resident at the Hostel and that Choi Yingâs fall on 31<sup>st</sup> October 2003 was within the Defendantâs contemplation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  An account of Choi Yingâs falls and injuries during the period she was a trainee at the Hostel is set out in Schedule A to theclosing submission of Mr. Wong.

It was noted onthe Defendantâs record and registration form, Choi Ying suffered from weak left limbs and had difficulty living on her own, thatwas the reason why she was admitted to the Hostel for training (B660).  The registration form (B656-658) further recorded the reasonfor Choi Ying seeking admission into the Hostel was so that she could be looked after and her sister Fung Sin would not be requiredto bathe her and deliver meals to her daily and that Choi Ying would be trained to develop her potentials for self care.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Plaintiff further claimed that the Hostel staff knew of Choi Yingâs oedema was the reason for her difficulty in balancingresulting in a tendency of falling.  The Plaintiff relied on the Defendantâs record of accidents involving Choi Ying and the recommendationsmade by the Defendantâs Hostel staff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The Plaintiff claimed that the Defendant failed to heed its own staffâs recommendations and refused to put Choi Ying in a wheelchairor send a staff to accompany Choi Ying whenever Choi Ying used a quadripod to walk in the Hostel, visited the toilet after mealsand before bed time.  The Plaintiff claimed that it was because the Hostel staff had failed to escort Choi Ying after breakfast on31<sup>st</sup> October 2003 or put her in a wheelchair that resulted in Choi Yingâs fall near the doorway of room 210.  The Plaintiff furtherclaimed that Choi Ying was pushed in the morning of 31<sup>st</sup> October 2003 that resulted in the fall.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  It is the Plaintiffâs case that the Defendant was negligent and in breach of a common duty of care under Sec. 3 of the Ordinance;it had failed to take any reasonable care to see that Choi Ying would be safe in the Hostel.  The Plaintiff further claimed thatthe Defendant failed to maintain a safe environment for Choi Ying knowing she was prone to fall if allowed to walk unassisted dueto the oedematic condition of her left lower limb.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b><u>The Defence Case</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Defendant claimed it had discharged its duty of care to Choi Ying, that she was safe as a trainee and resident at the Hosteland that the Defendant had taken reasonable steps to ensure Choi Ying would not be exposed to risks of injuries.  The Defendant furthermaintained that Choi Yingâs fall on 31<sup>st</sup> October 2003 was due to a spontaneous haemorrhage of her brain tumour.  The Defendant relied on the findings in the medical reportsof Dr. Edmund Woo and Dr. Yu Yuk Ling.  Doctors Woo &amp; Yu both concluded that Choi Yingâs fall on 31<sup>st</sup> October 2003 was due to the increasing debilitating effects of Choi Yingâs brain tumour which suffered a spontaneous haemorrhagethat caused Choi Ying to fall on the day of the accident.  The fall was inevitable and unavoidable and it was not caused by any negligenceon the part of the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Defendant further claimed that Choi Yingâs fall on 31<sup>st</sup> October 2002 was due entirely to her own carelessness; it could not have been avoided even if Choi Ying was escorted by the staffof the Hostel at the time.  The recommendation for Choi Ying to be accompanied to the toilet after breakfast was made on 23<sup>rd</sup> August 2003 which was duly implemented by the Hostel staff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  As to the alleged left hand injury of Choi Ying on 11<sup>th</sup> February 2002, the Defendant claimed that the Hostel did not receive any medical slip or report from the Princess Margaret Hospitalreferring to a fracture sustained by Choi Ying.  During the period of 11<sup>th</sup> to 17<sup>th</sup> February 2002, Choi Ying was on Chinese New Year home leave.  The Defendantâs Hostel record did not show Choi Ying had sustainedany fall or injuries before her home leave on 11<sup>th</sup> February 2002, the allegation was made only after she returned from leave on 18<sup>th</sup> February 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The Defendant claimed that Choi Ying and her elder sister did not request for the use of a wheelchair during this period of time. Choi Ying was given a wheelchair between 18<sup>th</sup> February to 24<sup>th</sup> February 2002 because of her left hand injury, it was withdrawn on 25<sup>th</sup> February on the advice of the nursing staff after Choi Yingâs cast on her left arm was removed.  The Defendant claimed that ChoiYing was put in a wheelchair whenever her left leg was found to be swollen (P.B783) and taken off when the swelling improved to encourageher to exercise her limbs.  The Defendant claimed it was only sometime in late 2003 that the Plaintiff requested for a wheelchairfor the Defendant, her application for a wheelchair from the Social Welfare Department was approved in January 2004.  Unfortunately,the Plaintiff failed to consult the Hostelâs staff before she purchased the wheelchair which was found to be unsuitable for ChoiYing upon delivery to the Hostel on 29<sup>th</sup> May 2004 (P.A244).  The foot rests and back of the wheelchair had to be altered to fit Choi Ying before it was put to use.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The Defendant further relied on 2 letters written by the Plaintiff published in the Defendantâs newsletters of April 2002 andMarch 2003 thanking the Hostel for the care and training given to Choi Ying to show that the Plaintiff and Choi Ying were happy andsatisfied with the care and training at the Hostel.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  It was the Defendantâs evidence that the Hostelâs staff including the nurses, the caretakers and the physiotherapists had kepta close watch of Choi Yingâs oedematic condition at her left limbs and the doctors had prescribed diuretics for Choi Ying to reducethe oedema.  According to physiotherapist Mr. Pei, Choi Ying would only be given a wheelchair if her walk was unsteady due to theoedema on her left lower limb, it would be withdrawn when the oedema improved before the fall on 31<sup>st</sup> October 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  According to the evidence of Miss Cheung Yuet Wah, the case social worker at the Hostel, Choi Ying was usually the first to finishbreakfast in the morning, as a matter of routine; she would be the first of 17 trainees taken to the toilet after breakfast.  Asthe accident on 31<sup>st</sup> October 2003 took place at about 8:30 a.m. Choi Ying must have already been to the toilet after breakfast.

Choy Ying was mentally retarded from a youngage.  On 7<sup>th</sup> June 1999 she received an operation involving partial removal of her brain tumor.  According to the Hostelâs record on Choi Ying,on admission, she was said to suffer from moderate mental retardation, had a partial brain tumour removed and had pre-existing lefthemiplegia and suffered from epilepsy.  According to the Defendantâs witnesses, the Hostel would not require a traineeâs guardianor next of kin to produce a full medical record on the trainee because of data privacy protection reasons.  It only required thetrainee or his/her guardian to produce a letter from a general practitioner certifying the medical condition of the trainee.  Theguardian or next of kin of the trainee is responsible for taking the trainee to clinics and hospitals for his/her regular followup treatments.  Upon admission at the end of November 2001, Choi Ying was evaluated by the physiotherapist Mr. Pei who recorded that:âEven she could ambulate independently without aid, she demonstrated with fair stability and with decreased (L) hip, knee control. Thus, she was given a quadripod for ambulation.  Her sitting balance was satisfactory and her standing balance was fair only.  Shewas able to perform sit to stand independently.  However, she also demonstrated not much active movement over her (L) upper limb(0/5) and (3+/5) over her (L) lower limb in gross muscle testing.  Tubrigrip was given to her left foot due to swelling.â (PhysiotherapyReport dated 24<sup>th</sup> March 2005 on page A 90).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  According to the registration form record of 9<sup>th</sup> November 2001, prepared by the social worker Cheung Yuet Wah (DW2) as a background report of the trainee prior to admission, paragraph9, under âcase analysisâ she recorded:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">1.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">å­¸å¡ç¾ä½³æ®µæ¢è½ç¨å±ï¼èªçè½åçæä¸é¯ï¼å¯¦éä¸å­¸å¡å¨æäºéè¦çèªçé ç®ä¸è¡¨ç¾ä¹ä¸ç®å¾å¥½ï¼ä¾å¦ç©¿è¡£åæ²æ¶¼ãéå¯è½ç±æ¼å­¸å¡è¿å¹´å·¦éæè³ä¸éæ´»æè´ï¼ä½å·¥ä½å¡ç¸ä¿¡å­¸å¡ç±å°è³ä»ä¹æ²æäººæå°éå¥¹æ­¤ç­èªçé ç®ï¼å ç¶æ¯å°å¥¹éä»½æººæï¼ä¸ç´ä»¥ä¾ä¹ç§é¡§é±å°ï¼è³ç¶éèº«ï¼æ¯å¹´èæåæå§åå©æé²ç§çé¢èç­æ«ææåï¼æå­¸å¡çæ½è½åæ²ãææ­¤è¥å­¸å¡ææ©æå¥å®¿æ¬ä¸­å¿æ¥åè¨ç·´ï¼å­¸å¡å¨åæ¹é¢è½ååææ©ææåã</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">2.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">æ­¤å¤ï¼å­¸å¡1Â½ å¹´åç¼ç¾è¦çç¤ï¼å·²ä½åé¤æè¡ï¼ä½ä»æå°é¨ä»½å¨è¦å§ï¼å æå¾å¤ç¥ç¶ä½ç½®é è¿ï¼æä¸å®åé¤ãä½æ­¤ç¤å±¬è¯æ§ï¼å°å­¸å¡ä¸æ§æçå½å±éªï¼ç¾ææè¦è¨ºè¦ç¥ç¶å¤ç§ãä½ä¸æ¬¡æè¡å¾ä»¤å­¸å¡å·¦éæè³å¤±å»å¤§é¨ä»½æè¦ºãå·¥ä½å¡èªçºç¾å¨å­¸å¡æè³è®å¾ä¸éæ´»çå¦ä¸åå æ¯æè¡å¾å­¸å¡ä¸¦æ²æè·é²ç©çæ²»çè¨ç·´ï¼æå·¦éèè½æä¾æå·®ãæä»¥è¥å­¸å¡å¥å®¿å¾ï¼å¯è½ä»ç©çæ²»çæåï¼æ¹åå¶å·¦éæ´»åè½åã</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦â¦â¦â¦</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">5.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">ç¾å¨å­¸å¡ç¨å±ï¼æ¾ç¶è©¦éè·åå¨å°ä¸ï¼çå è¥èä¸è½èªè¡èµ·èº«åè³æäºçï¼å­¸å¡èªè¡ç¬å¾æ¯è¦ªå¨æ¸¯æä½¿ç¨ä¹ãæå½é¾ãä¸¦ææ£ï¼æ¿ç½²æ´¾äººå°å¥¹å®¶ææå¥¹æ¶èµ·ï¼å¥¹åæç¤ºæ¿ç½²è·å¡è´é»å¶å§ï¼ç±æ­¤å¯è¦å­¸å¡å¾å·éï¼ä¸¦è½èªè¡æèèªææ­¥é©ãï¼æ­¤æ¬¡è·åå­¸å¡ä¸¦ç¡å¥é¢ï¼å æ²å¤ªå¤§æå·ãï¼(pageA83 to A84 of Bundle)â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In paragraph 10 of the registration form, Miss Cheung recommended the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">1.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">ç¡å¿«å®æå­¸å¡é¢è«åå¥å®¿ï¼å¥å®¿å¾è½ä»ç©çæ²»çè·é²å¶å·¦éæè³èè½ææ³ã</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">2.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">å å¼·è¨ç·´èªçé ç®ï¼æåèªæç§é¡§è½åã</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">3.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">æå°èäººæºéä¹æå·§ãâ(page A83 of Bundle)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  It was based on the aforesaid information and recommendations that Choi Ying was admitted into the Hostel.  According to the evidenceof the Hostelâs supervisor Miss Jenny Yu (DW1), the information was supplied by Fung Sin, the guardian of Choi Ying, at the interviewand home visit conducted by the Hostel social worker Miss Cheung Yuet Wah (DW2).  Miss Yu claimed that there was nothing to indicateat admission that Choi Ying was suffering from recurrent tumour.  Miss Yu maintained that had the Hostel found out Choi Ying hada recurrent brain tumour she would not have been considered suitable for the Hostel.  In Miss Yuâs view, a person with a recurrentbrain tumour would require more nursing care and should be admitted to an institution designed for such patients.   Miss Yu furtherclaimed that it is incumbent upon the family and guardian of the trainee to inform the Hostel of any changes in the medical conditionof the trainee.  The Hostel relied on the information disclosed by the family member or guardian who took the trainee to her/hisregular medical appointments.  The Hostel staff would not be able to obtain such information from the traineeâs doctors.  Therefore,if the family member or guardian of the trainee who accompanied the trainee to follow-up treatments failed to inform the Hostel theup-to-date medical condition of the trainee, there is no way the Hostel staff could have obtained such information.  Though the nursingstaff of the Hostel would keep a record of the reply slips signed by the attending doctors of the trainee after each medical visit,the reply slips would not disclose the full details on the traineeâs medical condition.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  So far as Choi Ying was concerned, Miss Yu admitted the nursing staff at the Hostel had noticed a gradual deterioration of ChoiYingâs ambulatory ability and discussed it at the 23<sup>rd</sup> August 2003 class meeting, after which the Hostel staff had discussed Choi Yingâs condition with the Plaintiff and requested herto talk to the doctor at the next medical appointment.  It was beyond the control of the Hostel, however, if the Plaintiff failedto take up the matter with Choi Yingâs doctors.  Miss Yu further claimed that the Hostel would conduct a yearly review on eachtrainee at a meeting with the traineeâs family member or guardian.  The meeting would be attended by the social worker, the nurse,the trainee and her family member.  At the meeting, a report on the traineeâs progress, her health condition and the daily activitiesduring the year would be discussed.  The trainee and her family member or guardian would have an opportunity to raise any matterof concern and take part in reaching a consensus on the training direction for the trainee in the following year.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  From the Defendantâs Hostel record, it is clear that the Hostel emphasized on physical training of trainees to strengthen theirself help capacity.  A record is kept on the progress, exercise and physiotherapy training with ratings on the progress of each trainee. Detail recordings of each incident involving each trainee are kept by the Hostel.  In Choi Yingâs case, each family visit andconversation with the family member involving Choi Ying, record of medical visits by Choi Ying escorted by the Plaintiff and replyslips signed by Choi Yingâs doctors, the drugs prescribed for Choi Ying and each incident at the Hostel and injuries found on ChoiYing by the staff of the Hostel would be carefully kept by the Hostel staff.  There would be an incident report if Choi Ying hadan accident at the Hostel with recommendations from the staff reporting the incident.  Choi Ying would be further examined by thenursing staff at the Hostel for any injuries sustained and if necessary, arranged for medical attention.  The Plaintiff had basedher case on the same Hostel records on Choi Ying in her claim against the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The Plaintiff did not dispute she had failed to disclose to the Hostel that Choi Yingâs brain tumour had recurred, she claimedthat she did not know about the recurrence of Choi Yingâs brain tumour, she further claimed she believed the doctors had recordedthe details on the reply slips.  From the medical records of the doctors at Tuen Mun Hospital Neurosurgery Department during therelevant period of time, Choi Yingâs brain tumour had returned before her admission to the Hostel.  The medical report of Dr. HungWai Man, medical officer at the Department Neurosurgery of Tuen Mun Hospital (page A277 of the Bundle) recorded at paragraph 5 ofthe report  âShe was regularly followed up in our clinic.  Postoperative MRI brain was performed and increasing size of residualtumour informed to relatives in 2001.  But they refused second operation.  She was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for head injuryin November 2003.  We took over the patient and surgical excision offered.  But her sister refused operation again.â</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The consultation summaries on Choi Ying indicated that the doctors at the Neurosurgery Unit of Tuen Mun Hospital had discussed withthe Plaintiff on numerous occasions about Choi Yingâs recurrent brain tumour.

There was no such evidence in support of the allegation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The Hostel was ignorant of Choi Yingâs recurrent brain tumour which was the cause of her gradual deterioration in motor strength,which in Dr. Wooâs opinion could not be improved by physiotherapy or exercise at the Hostel.  Dr. Yu cited the falls on 31<sup>st</sup> January 2002, 5<sup>th</sup> September 2003 and 31<sup>st</sup> October 2003 as evidence of Choi Yingâs gradual deterioration caused by the increase in size of the tumour in Choi Yingâs head(see para. 31 above).  I am satisfied that had the Hostel known the recurrent brain tumour of Choi Ying at the time of admissionand during the time she was a trainee at the Hostel, the plan for Choi Yingâs training at the Hostel would have been very different. In fact, it is likely the Hostel would have recommended Choi Ying be transferred to a different institution.  This was indeed recommendedafter she returned to the Hostel from the hospital in November 2004.  I find the fall due to brain haemorrhage suffered by Choi Yingcould not have been foreseen because of the concealment of her recurrent brain tumour by the Plaintiff from the Hostel.  All along,the Hostel staff mistakenly attributed the cause of Choi Yingâs difficulty in balancing her steps to the oedema of her lower limbs;in fact, the real culprit was the recurrent brain tumour which turned malignant and was growing in size.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  I refer to the case of Holgate and another v. Lancashire Mental Hospital Board Gill and Robertson  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%204%20All%20ER%2019" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] 4 All ER 19</a> and the case of Kelly v.

In Holgateâs case, the court found that the Calderstone Institution in Lancashire knew the mental patient hadbeen convicted of assaults on a number of occasions when the patient was let out on a licence.  During the period of the extendedlicence, the patient assaulted the plaintiff savagely.  In the case of Kelly, the plaintiff who suffered from epileptic attacks wastaken off all medications for the purpose of observation; the defendant was found liable for injuries sustained by the plaintiffwho was left unattended and climbed out of the window.  In both cases, the patientsâ medical histories were known to the defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  I have considered the Hostelâs incident reports on various falls and injuries sustained by Choi Ying prior to 31<sup>st</sup> October 2003, I have also considered the evidence of the Defendantâs witnesses such as the nurse, the physiotherapist Mr. Pei andthe centre supervisor Miss Yu.  It is clear that the Hostel had imposed and devised care and training plans for each of its traineesbased on the medical history and health condition of each trainee.  Relying on what was disclosed by the Plaintiff to the Hostelat the time of admission of Choi Ying and information related from time to time by the Plaintiff to the nursing staff of the Hostelduring Choi Yingâ stay at the Hostel, the care and training given to Choi Ying by the Hostel was an appropriate one.  It is plainfrom the records that the Hostelâs staff had taken full consideration as to when and under what circumstances Choi Ying neededto be escorted or whether a wheelchair should be used by her.  This decision was clearly made after due consideration of the circumstancesat the time based on the medical conditions of the trainee disclosed to the Hostel from time to time.  These decisions were welldocumented.  Contrary to the Plaintiffâs claim, the reply slips submitted to the Hostel after each medical visits by Choi Yingrecorded the symptoms, treatments administered and medicine prescribed by the doctors, they failed to disclose the recurrence ofChoi Yingâs brain tumour which was made known to the Plaintiff by the doctors prior to Choi Yingâs admission to the Hostel.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In considering if Choi Yingâs fall could have been prevented had she been escorted at the time prior to the fall, I take intoaccount the timing of the fall which indicated that Choi Ying must have finished her breakfast and finished with her toilet visit. She was seen approaching the TV area of the room before the fall took place, as Choi Ying was a fully grown adult of over 160 pounds,it would be unlikely that anyone escorting her could have prevented the fall even if she was escorted at the time.  The accidentreport of 5 September 2003 recorded that Choi Ying fell down under escort of a Hostel staff in the toilet, and the staff was notable to prevent the fall because of Choi Yingâs weight (P.B749).  In any event, according to the neurologistsâ reports, the injuriesdue to the fall was described as a mild one and had not resulted in any material deterioration of Choi Yingâs neurological statusbecause her fall was caused by the haemorrhage in the tumour that affected her motor ability.  As were the 3 previous falls referredto in Dr. Yuâs report.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Applying the foreseeability test, I have assessed the facts against the legal standard and Lord Denningâs dicta in the case ofStewart v.

It would be unreasonable to expect the Hostel to do so.  I am satisfied the Defendanthad provided an adequate system of care to its trainees and did pay special attention to Choi Yingâs needs based on conditionsknown to the Hostel.  Choi Ying was told to ask for help if she needed it and told to wait for assistance if she wanted to move about. It is apparent she had failed to do so on 31<sup>st</sup> October 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  After taking all the circumstances into consideration, I find the Plaintiff has failed to prove that the Defendant was negligentor was in breach of a common duty of care under Sec. 3 of the Occupiersâ Liability Ordinance.  I therefore dismiss the Plaintiffâsclaim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Costs</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Costs nisi order. Cost should follow the event.  The Defendantâs cost should be borne by the Plaintiff, to be taxed, if not agreed,with certificate for Counsel.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(H.C.
