As a result of the accident, the deceased died. The deceased was at the time working as a metal worker or welder underthe employ of the defendant. The plaintiffs are administratrices of the estate of the deceased. They claim against the defendantunder the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23" class="autolink_findacts">Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap.23</a></em> on behalf of the deceased's estate, and under <em>the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a>,</em> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22">Cap.22</a> on behalf of the dependents of the deceased.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The trial before me was for determination of the issue of liability. The question of damages had been ordered to be tried separately.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The defendant was the contractor undertaking the installation of a "dust-collecting house" ("the house") at the said premises. Variousparts of the house which were mainly made of metal had already been constructed elsewhere and the defendant's job was simply to putup the parts to form the house at the said premises. The deceased and other workers were employed by the defendant to do the work.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> On 6 May 1992, while the deceased was carrying out work on the second level of the house, he fell and landed on the first level about13 metres below. The defendant raised no issue that he owed a duty of care to the deceased or that he was under a duty to providea safe system and a safe place of work to the deceased. Nor was there any dispute that the defendant should provide competent staffand give adequate and proper instructions to the deceased on the proper manner or procedure in carrying out the work and all necessaryprecautions to be taken, or that he should provide adequate and effective supervision to ensure that the deceased carried out hisduties properly and safely. The issues for my determination are :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) whether the defendant was in breach of any duty of care, or any contractual duty or statutory duty, resulting in the death ofthe deceased; and</p>        <p>(b) whether the deceased was solely responsible for or guilty of any contributory negligence resulting in his death.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The documents in the plaintiffs' Bundle of Documents were agreed to be authentic and admissible, save for the following items. Item10 was ruled by me to be inadmissible as being hearsay, consequent upon the application of Mr Lin for the defendant. Items 9, 13,16, 18 and 20 were agreed to be irrelevant to the question of liability. All the other documents were agreed by counsel to be admittedin evidence. Statements of three witnesses who were called to give viva voce evidence were also adduced as part of their evidencein chief. Two witnesses were called by the plaintiffs, namely, Mr Yeung Sau Chi and Mr Ho Juh Kuen, and the defendant himself testified.After considering the totality of the evidence, I find a number of facts. The reasons for finding these facts are stated wheneverappropriate.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Towards the end of April 1992, the defendant sent a team of workers to the said premises to execute the job. The defendant did notvisit the said premises everyday although he did it occasionally. In effect, he delegated the tasks of supervision of the job aswell as the provision and supervision of the safety measures for the workers to one Lam Cho Ming. This finding is based on the defendant'sstatutory declaration made on 8 May 1992 to the Labour Department and his statement of 13 May 1992 made to the Police. His oral evidencewas to the effect that he supervised the work himself and that he visited the said premises every morning although Mr Lam stood infor him during his absence. I have no hesitation in rejecting his oral testimony and accepting his statements in this regard, whichwere made shortly after the accident. Mr Lam did not testify before me and his statement given to the Police, being hearsay, wasnot admitted in evidence. Mr Yeung was a co-worker of the deceased at the time of the accident. It was clearly stated in Mr Yeung'sstatements that Mr Lam was the responsible officer at the site, and this evidence was not challenged or challenged successfully.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Both Mr Yeung and the deceased were working at the said premises although Mr Yeung started work there a few days before the deceaseddid. The job included the setting up of 6 funnel-like objects ("funnels") of similar size inside the house, installing air-ductsto link each of the funnels to a damper which was to stand on a platform situated half way in between the first and second levelson two opposite sides of the house. On 6 May 1992, shortly before 2:30 p.m., the deceased and Mr Yeung and two other colleagues oftheirs were working on the second level of the house. The deceased was in the course of helping to move a damper to a platform.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> In order to appreciate the condition of the place at which the deceased was working, it is necessary to describe the floor of thesecond level in some detail. The six funnels were prefabricated complete with lids on them and these lids were steel plates witha large number of holes. The lids were fixed on the wide end of the funnels. The funnels were installed in such a way that the sixlids were flush with the second level of the house, forming the entire floor of the second level which was rectangular in shape,measuring about 10 metres by 13 metres in area. The condition of the floor can be gathered from exhibit D2. Each of the six lidsmeasured 4,275 mm by 5,000 mm, and contained two groups of lines of holes with a strip of 408 mm (about 16 inches) between the twogroups. There were 45 holes in each group, being 9 x 5, and altogether there were 90 holes in the two groups of holes on each lid.The whole floor had a total of 540 holes in it. The holes were uniform in size, each 292 mm (about 12 inches) in diameter, whichwas large enough for someone to insert a whole leg up to the thigh into it. The shortest space between two adjacent holes was about93 mm (less than 4 inches) wide. The distance between the floor edge to the edge of the lines of holes available to the worker towalk on as a passageway along the floor edge was either 464 mm (about 18.5 inches) or 501.5 mm (about 20 inches), dependent on whichside of the floor one was on. The widest space on the floor uninterrupted by any of the holes was the place where two lids joined,which was about 1,003 mm (about 40 inches). There was an I-beam each erected at the four corners of the house. On one side of thehouse, one I-beam stood in between the two corner I-beams, facing the one standing exactly opposite. On the other pair of oppositesides, two I-beams were installed in between the corner ones. These 10 I-beams were positioned along the edges and at about equaldistance from one another, surrounding the whole floor. There were two other I-beams in the middle of the floor. Each side of thesquarish I-beam measured about 200 mm (about 8 inches) and the perimeter would therefore be about 800 mm (about 32 inches). The I-beamsprotruded high above the floor of the second level. There were two nylon ropes tied to the 10 I-beams along the edges and these ropestherefore surrounded the edges on all four sides of the floor.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> There were six dampers for the six funnels. The dampers were almost identical: each was rectangular in shape, measured about 2 metrestall by 1 metre square and weighed about 500 kilogrammes. Three dampers had at the time been installed on the platform on one sideof the house. Two other dampers were still to be installed and they were originally lying horizontally on the floor of the secondlevel. They were to be lifted up and lowered down by the use of a mobile crane onto the platform below on the side of the house oppositeto that where the three dampers had already been installed. Shortly before the accident, the deceased was trying to have a damperput onto the far end of the platform. The deceased was near the edge and the corner of the floor at that far end because the damperwas assembled there. He attached the 2-wire sling of the crane to the holes in the bracket on the top of the damper which was lyingflat on the floor. After he had fixed the sling onto the damper, he hand-signaled to Mr Yeung who was standing on the opposite sideof the second level. The deceased was then standing close to the corner of the house near to the I-beam at that corner. Mr Yeungin turn signaled to the crane driver (Mr Lo Yuk Lun) to lift the load. Mr Lo and the crane were situated at the side of the houseonly visible to Mr Yeung, opposite to the side at which the deceased was working. When the damper was lifted above the floor forabout one to two feet (25 mm to 50 mm), Mr Yeung could not see the deceased any more. He felt something had gone wrong and signaledto Mr Lo to stop the lifting operation. On the other hand, Mr Lo stopped lifting the load even before he saw the hand signal of MrYeung to stop, because he felt that the load was swaying slightly. Mr Yeung ran to where the deceased was and found that he had fallento the ground on the first level of the house. The deceased was taken to hospital promptly but was certified dead at sometime after4 p.m. These are the facts I find.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Incidentally, at one stage of his evidence, Mr Yeung described two steps having to be taken to move a damper lying horizontally onthe floor of the second floor level. He said that a damper had to be hoisted to make it stand upright first. There were catches somewherein the middle of the damper lengthwise on which the 2-wire sling of the crane would have to be secured in order to hoist the damperto make it stand upright. After the damper had been made to stand vertically, the sling had to be retrieved from those positionsand securely hooked to two diagonally opposite holes in the bracket on the top of the damper. Those, according to Mr Yeung, werethe proper procedure. The deceased had to climb up to the top of the upright damper, position himself on a plank placed by him onthe top as a foothold, catch the sling from the crane and secure the 2-wire sling onto two opposite holes in the bracket. After that,the deceased had to climb down and land on the floor of the second level. This evidence was later withdrawn by Mr Yeung who saidthat in fact one step as described in the preceding paragraph took place. I do not think any more time should be spent on this procedureinvolving two steps, which is rejected. However, I do not accept the submission of Mr Lin for the defendant that this matter reducesthe reliability of other aspects of Mr Yeung's evidence. Having observed this witness closely while he was giving evidence, I hadthe impression that he was basically and generally honest. He told me that he returned from China on 3 December 1995, a Sunday, togive evidence on 4 December, and he had been told that he would be required only on Monday. He had promised his employer in Chinathat he would return to his work after Monday. He was obviously annoyed and frustrated that he had to be in court on Tuesday, althoughhe was helpful to attend. The two-step procedure was mentioned by him in the early afternoon of Tuesday during cross-examinationwhich had started since the afternoon of Monday. The other aspects of his evidence were also substantially the same as what he hadstated in his statements and declaration made shortly after the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The plaintiffs claim that the defendant failed to provide a safe system and place of work and failed in his statutory duties wherebythe deceased died. Mr Lin submitted that there was no evidence of the cause of the death and the cause of the accident, and as aresult, the plaintiffs had failed to prove any causal link between the death and the breach of any duty on the part of the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The plaintiffs' case is that the defendant fell off the edge of the floor of the second level, as a result of which he died. Mr Linchallenged this on the basis that no one witnessed how the deceased met with the accident. Before the deceased was found lying onthe floor of the first level, he was last seen by Mr Yeung. Mr Yeung's evidence is that the deceased was standing at about the cornerof the rear of the second level near the edge. How the accident exactly happened, Mr Yeung could not say. Mr Lin submitted that therecould have been a number of ways that the deceased met with the accident, and at least the factors mentioned in the fatal accidentreport made by Mr Ho Juh Kuen, the factory inspector who inspected the site on 7 May 1992, were some possible examples. The deceasedmight have lost his balance and fell, he might have been scared by the sway of the damper while it was being lifted and lost hisbalance and fell, or he might have been pushed by the swaying damper out of the floor edge. Mr Lin further argued that if the deceasedwas struck by the swaying damper, and if there had been a guard-rail at the edge, the deceased would have been trapped between therail and the damper and crushed. The presence of a guard-rail would therefore have worsened the position. It was submitted that wherethe court could not make a finding as to what caused the death of the deceased, the causal link between his death and any breachof duty on the part of the defendant was missing.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Mr Ho's fatal accident report described the fatality as caused by fall from height. The photographs annexed to the report also indicatedthat the deceased fell down from a particular position near the corner of the floor. They also showed the position of the damperand other structures or articles on the floor. The photographs were taken on 7 May 1992 when nothing on the site immediately afterthe accident had been moved. In the statutory declaration of Mr Yeung made to the Labour Department, he stated that the deceasedlost his balance and fell on seeing the damper sway, or he was pushed to fall by the damper. The notice of the accident signed bythe defendant himself also stated that the deceased lost his balance and fell. The impression common among all these persons whowere either there at the time of the accident (i.e., Mr Yeung) or who learned and investigated the accident shortly afterwards wasthat the deceased lost his balance and fell. Although Mr Lin submitted that the evidence of the injuries shown on the medical reportwas inconclusive as to what caused the death, on all the evidence before me, I come to the conclusion on the balance of probabilitiesthat the death was caused by the fall itself. If Mr Lin is right in his surmise that the deceased was hit by the swaying damper,because there was no hard object behind the deceased over the floor edge (only two nylon strings or ropes), it is most unlikely thathis death was caused by being struck by the damper and not caused by the fall. Anyhow, the suggestion that the damper caused thedeath was never put to any of the witnesses by Mr Lin. Mr Lo, the crane driver, mentioned in his statements that immediately uponfeeling that the load swayed slightly, he stopped the lifting operation, and that was seconds after he had started to hoist the damper.Mr Yeung's statements were to the effect that it was when the damper was lifted about 1 or 2 feet above the floor that he could notsee the deceased any more. He immediately signaled to Mr Lo to stop the crane, but according to Mr Lo, he stopped the crane beforeseeing Mr Yeung's signal. If the damper had hit the deceased, only his legs would be injured, and it is most unlikely that the leginjuries set out in the medical report would have resulted in his death. I am of the view that most of the injuries found in thereport were sustained by the deceased because of the fall, as a result of which he died. He might have been hit on the leg by theslightly swaying damper or he might have been alarmed by the swaying damper, lost his balance and fell. However, on the balance,especially bearing in mind the evidence of the injuries on his right leg and the position of the damper shown in the photographs,I find that he was hit by the damper, lost balance and fell. Yet his death was caused by the fall.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> I am also of the view that the following factors led to the fall, namely,</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) the deceased was standing on the floor near the corner and the edge of the floor;</p>        <p>(b) the damper was being hoisted close to the deceased; and</p>        <p>(c) there was no guard-rail along the edge.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The plaintiffs claim that the defendant failed to provide a safe system and a safe place of work and failed in his statutory dutieswhereby the deceased died. It was not disputed that at the time of the accident:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) the deceased was provided with a safety belt;</p>        <p>(b) he was wearing the safety belt; and</p>        <p>(c) there were two nylon ropes which had been tied to the 10 I-beams around the edges of the floor of the second level, and the twonylon ropes were positioned at about 500 mm and 1,000 to 1,100 mm respectively above the level of that floor.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> As the deceased was standing close to the edge, it seems to me that if either of two things happened, i.e., there was a guard-railof adequate strength along the edge from which the deceased fell, or he had anchored his safety belt securely to a sufficiently stronganchorage, he would either not have fallen or his fall would not have been fatal.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The defendant's case is that he had fulfilled his duty of care or other statutory or contractual duties by providing a safety helmetand a safety belt to the deceased. Mr Yeung's witness statement mentioned that he and the deceased did put on the safety belt andsafety helmet provided to them, but there was no anchorage point on the floor for attaching the safety belt. Exhibit D1 is a safetybelt similar in size and design to that one worn by the deceased when the accident occurred. The safety belt consisted of mainlythree parts, the <u>belt</u> itself with a buckle which was to be worn by the worker around his waist, a <u>lanyard</u> (or some witnesses called it a life line) fixed to the belt at one end with its other end fixed to a <u>hook</u>. The length of the lanyard up to the tip of the hook was about 1.5 metres (less than 5 feet). The hook was intended to be attachedor hooked to something as an anchorage. The defendant's case is that the deceased was himself responsible for the accident or alternativelyguilty of a substantial degree of contributory negligence because he should not have stood at a place close to the edge of the flooror put himself in a position of danger or he failed to attach the lanyard or hook of his safety belt to one of the following anchoragessuggested by the defendant in evidence:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) the spaces between the holes on the funnel lids made of steel plates which formed the floor of the second level, or</p>        <p>(b) the I-beam at the corner near the deceased, or</p>        <p>(c) either of the nylon ropes surrounding the entirety of the second level.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Mr Yeung gave evidence that he was, just like the deceased, wearing a safety belt (similar to exhibit D1) at the time, because theyhad been told by the defendant or Mr Lam Cho Ming that they had to wear it while working at a height. Neither he nor the deceased,however, had the hook attached to anything but the buckle of the belt itself, with the lanyard looped round the back of the neck.He said to the effect, and I accept, that it was not practicable to attach the hook to any of the three suggested anchorages.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> He told me that if the worker was to attach the lanyard through two of the holes on the floor, it would take up about 8 inches (about200 mm) out of the whole length of the lanyard which was about 1.5 metres. The worker would not be able to stand straight, and anywayhis movements would be severely restricted. The deceased had to attach the 2-wire sling to two opposite holes on the top of the damperand he would be very much inconvenienced in his work if he had the lanyard hooked to the space between two adjacent holes on thefloor. His mobility would be limited to a radius of about 1.3 metres from the floor because about 200 mm of the lanyard would betaken up by hooking onto the lanyard itself through two adjacent holes. While he was helping to position the damper when it was beinghoisted to the proper place for lowering onto the platform, his mobility would be very much restricted if he had the lanyard of hissafety belt linked to the holes on the floor, and that would also pose a great danger to his own safety for he might not be ableto avoid the damper if it swayed in the air. Moreover, the deceased would have to mind the numerous holes on the floor which greatlylimited his movement and created a danger for him if he had anchored the lanyard through two adjacent holes on the floor. The passagealong the edge on which the deceased stood before the accident was also very narrow, the widest part being about 500 mm (20 inches)wide. His mobility was already quite limited.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Nor would the I-beam close to the deceased be a good or reasonable anchorage, for if the lanyard was hooked to the I-beam, the deceased'smovement would be severely hampered. The distance between him and the I-beam would be less than 700 mm because the perimeter of theI-beam would take up about 800 mm of the lanyard. The room available for the maneuvre of the deceased would also be limited to thespace in front of the corner itself. Any sway of the damper would put him in great danger. He was in the course of helping to havethe damper hoisted and lowered onto the platform where it was to be installed. If he had attached the lanyard of the safety beltwhich he wore onto the I-beam, it would be very difficult for him to carry out the operation effectively or efficiently. I also thereforereject this as a practicable, suitable or reasonable anchorage in the circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The defendant blamed the deceased for failing to use either of the two nylon ropes surrounding the second level which were tied tothe I-beams (altogether 10 I-beams at the edges of the whole house) as anchorage for his safety belt. Mr Yeung said he would notuse either of the nylon ropes because he did not have faith in them. Although the workers themselves, including Mr Yeung and thedeceased, were told to tie the nylon ropes round the I-beams to surround all the edges, the nylon ropes were simply not solid enoughas anchorage for the safety belt. Mr Yeung described the diameter of the rope being about 6 mm and Mr Ho estimated it to be about5 mm. The defendant, however, said that it was 10 mm thick. I shall return to the divergence later. Anyhow, Mr Yeung had no knowledgeof the weight that the nylon rope could support. He said that there was a long distance between two I-beams on which the ropes weretied. In fact, the shortest distance between two I-beams along the edges was about 4 metres (about 13 feet). An added factor whyhe did not trust the nylon rope was that attaching the lanyard to it, which was not solid, would create an uncertainty as to distancefrom it which a person could travel, which could create misjudgment while the worker would have to avoid the holes on the floor.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> I must say that ex post facto it might seem better in the circumstances for the deceased to have hooked up his lanyard on one ofthe nylon ropes, for at least it would be a sort of an anchorage although not too much reliance could have been placed on it. However,the fall of the deceased had proven that the nylon ropes were not able to stop a person of the height of the deceased, who, accordingto Mr Yeung, was about between 1.5 and 1.6 metre, from falling. No expert evidence was adduced by the defendant to say that Mr Yeung'sviews, as an experienced worker, were wrong or incorrect, or that the nylon rope would be suitable anchorage, and for that matter,no expert evidence was given that the space between two adjacent holes on the floor or the I-beam close to the deceased were suitableor proper anchorages. Mr Yeung and Mr Ho described the diameter of the nylon rope as 6 mm and 5 mm respectively. The defendant saidthe diameter was 10 mm. He supported his evidence by saying that he bought the ropes himself. Both Mr Yeung and Mr Ho said that theropes were red in colour and they were there as a warning sign to workers of the edge of the platform. The defendant, however, saidthat they were to provide protection to workers from falling. The fact remains, the deceased fell from the second level despite thetwo nylon ropes stretched along that area. On the evidence before me, I come to the view that regardless of the diameter of the ropes,and I find on the balance that it was about 6 mm, they did not provide a sufficient protection to the deceased from falling overthe edge, and that the nylon ropes were not a proper or reasonable anchorage provided to the deceased in the circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> I now turn to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59">Cap. 59</a>. A number of the regulations are relied on by the plaintiffs. I set out the relevant parts hereunder underlining the importantwords.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<strong>6.</strong>(1) Subject to paragraph (2) on every stage, gantry, or similar place where a lifting appliance having a travelling or slewing motionis in use, the contractor responsible for the appliance shall ensure that an <u>unobstructed passageway</u>, not less than 600 millimetres wide, is maintained between any part of the appliance liable so as to move and any nearby guard rail,fence or other fixture.</p>        <p class="quote">(2) If at any time it is impracticable to maintain any such passageway at any particular place, the contractor shall ensure that allreasonable steps are taken <u>to prevent persons from having access to that place</u> when the appliance is in use.</p>        <p class="quote"><strong>38N.</strong>(1) The contractor responsible for a construction site shall ensure that <u>every side of a working platform</u>, working place, gangway, run or stair being a side <u>from which a person is liable to fall</u> a distance of more than 2 metres is provided with <u>a suitable guard-rail or guard-rails of adequate strength</u> to a height between 900 millimetres and 1,150 millimetres.</p>        <p class="quote">(2) The guard-rails required under paragraph (1) may be removed or remain unerected for the time and to the extent necessary for theaccess of persons or the movement of materials.</p>        <p class="quote"><strong>38P.</strong>(1) The contractor responsible for a construction site shall ensure that every opening, corner, break, <u>edge</u> or other dangerous place through or from which any <u>person on the site is liable to fall</u> a distance of more than 2 metres is provided with either -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) <u>a suitable guard-rail or guard-rails of adequate strength</u> to a height of between 900 millimetres and 1,150 millimetres above the surface across which <u>persons are liable to pass</u> so erected as <u>to prevent as far as possible the fall of persons</u>; or</p>            <p class="quote">(b) a covering so constructed as to prevent the fall of persons, materials and articles; any such covering shall be clearly and boldlymarked to show its purpose or be securely fixed in position.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2) Such guard-rails and coverings may be removed or remain unerected -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) ...; or</p>            <p class="quote">(b) for the time and to the extent necessary for the access of persons or the movement of materials or other purposes of the work.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote"><strong>38Q.</strong>(1) Where by reason of the special nature or circumstances of any part of the work or of the access thereto or the egress therefromit is <u>impracticable</u> to comply with all or any of the requirements of regulations ... 38N and 38P so far as they relate to the falls of persons, the contractorresponsible for a construction site <u>shall erect and keep in such positions as to be effective to protect persons</u> carrying on that part of the work or using the said access or egress <u>suitable safety nets or safety belts or other suitable and sufficient equipment</u> of such a design and so constructed and installed as <u>to prevent</u> so far as practicable <u>injury to persons:</u> ... .</p>        <p class="quote">(2) Where the use of a safety belt is required pursuant to paragraph (1) the contractor shall provide each workman employed on thesite with a suitable <u>safety belt</u>.</p>        <p class="quote">(3) Where a safety belt is provided under this regulation the contractor <u>shall also provide a suitable and sufficient anchorage and suitable fittings</u> therefor; and each such safety belt, anchorage and fitting shall be of such a design and so constructed as <u>to prevent serious injury in the event of a fall</u> to any person using it.</p>        <p class="quote">(4) ... .</p>        <p class="quote">(5) The contractor shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that no workman remains on any dangerous place on the construction sitewithout wearing a safety belt provided to the workman in pursuance of this regulation.</p>        <p class="quote"><strong>38R.</strong> Every workman employed on a construction site who has been provided with a safety belt shall wear it and keep it attached to a secureanchorage whenever the use of the belt is necessary for his own or any other person's safety."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Regulations 38N and 38P apply to the situation of this case, where the height between the floor of the second level and that of thefirst level was about 13 metres, far exceeding two metres. Both sections provide that the contractor responsible for the constructionsite shall ensure that a suitable guard-rail or guard-rails shall be provided along the edges of any platform or place to preventworkers from falling. The guard-rail must be of adequate strength. The nylon ropes provided by the defendant around the second levelof the house could not be a good or reasonable substitute for a guard rail, and there was no challenge to the evidence of MessrsYeung and Ho describing the ropes as for warning of the edges, as opposed to for protection against falling from the edges.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Mr Lin relied on paragraphs (2) of both regulations 38N and 38P to argue that no guard-rails were erected along the edges becauseit was necessary at the time to move the dampers. I disagree. First, the point was never mentioned by or to any witness. Secondly,the evidence of the existence and positioning of the two nylon ropes flies in the face of the argument, for no one ever suggestedthat the nylon ropes, and by the same token any guard-rails, had any effect of even inconveniencing the movements of the dampers.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Impracticability to comply with regulations 38N and 38P in the context of providing guard-rails was neither raised in the Re-AmendedDefence nor proved. I find that the defendant failed to comply with the two regulations.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> I am not saying that any worker in the circumstances of the deceased or Mr Yeung could have properly risked their own safety forconvenience while they were working at a height. The use of the safety belt would doubtless in most circumstances reduce their mobilityand cause them inconvenience, but these could not be total justification for not taking steps to protect themselves from injuries.On the other hand, I do not accept the suggestion or claim of the defendant that the worker should attach the safety belt to an anchoragefor every step that he took. If it were so, then a worker walking along the edge of the floor would have to attach the hook of hissafety belt to the space between two holes on the floor, release it after he had finished a couple of steps and attach it to anotherpair of holes ahead of his path, release it and repeat the same rigmarole every couple of steps. This was most impracticable andwould create so much interruptions to the work to be carried out by the workers on the site, bearing in mind the condition of thefloor. It would also involve the danger of the worker having to stoop or squat to apply and release the hook on a passageway whichwas about 20 inches at the widest. There is no evidence that the workers were advised to take any of such suggested steps save beinggiven a safety belt and a helmet. Although the defendant claimed himself to be an experienced metal worker, he himself had neverused a safety belt in all his alleged experience. Mr Yeung was in a much better position to see whether there was any reasonable,suitable or practicable anchorage for the safety belt on the floor of the second level, and I find as a fact that there was none.I also find as a fact that neither the defendant nor Lam Cho Ming to whom the defendant had delegated the duties of carrying outand supervising the works and safety measures, had instructed the deceased or Mr Yeung to use any suggested anchorage. In fact, thedefendant himself admitted in his own statutory declaration made shortly after the accident that he never considered whether anchorageswere available on the working platform. I come to the conclusion that the defendant had failed in providing a safe system and a safeplace of work to the deceased and must be liable for the consequence.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Mr Yeung said in evidence that he and the deceased would rely on their own experience as to where to anchor the safety belt insteadof simply following instructions from anyone else. Mr Yeung further said that he and the deceased would make a choice of the positionto stand for their own safety and would not take instructions from anyone as to where to stand. Mr Lin submitted on the basis ofthis evidence that whether the deceased was given instructions where to stand and where to anchor his safety belt was irrelevantbecause anyway he would rely on his own judgment and experience whether to accept the instructions or directions. I do not agree.First, Mr Yeung cannot be the deceased's spokesman: what he said about how the deceased would behave on a hypothetical basis cannotbe treated in the same way as an admission made by the deceased. Unfortunately, the deceased's own reaction to such hypotheticalquestions will never be known. Secondly, if the deceased had been instructed that he must stand at a certain position or he mustuse certain things, whatever that might be, on the site as anchorage for his safety belt, not following such instructions would bea totally different consideration. Without any evidence that such instructions had been given, it is not open to the defendant toenter into this realm of conjecture. The defendant can, of course, try to satisfy me that there were ample and sufficient anchoragesavailable to the use of the deceased on the site, but the three suggested anchorages are all rejected by me as not suitable, practicableor reasonable in the circumstances. From the photographs attached to the fatal accident report, I cannot see any other possible anchoragewhich would have been suitable, practicable or reasonable either. There is no evidence that the deceased was supervised in any mannerat the time he carried out his work, or he being told where and where not to stand, or what should be used as an anchorage for hissafety belt. I also accept Mr Yeung's evidence that Lam Cho Ming was not at the site at the time of the accident. Had Lam been thereand supervised the performance of the deceased's duties, he could have warned the deceased not to stand where he did before the accidentoccurred. The defendant breached his admitted duty to provide adequate supervision to ensure that the deceased carried out his worksafely. In the circumstances, the deceased was just as good as any other worker experienced in the field to make his own choices,as to where to stand and what was a suitable and proper anchorage. Apparently, the deceased did not or could not find any such anchorage.He was left with no guard-rails and no suitable and sufficient anchorage for him to attach his safety belt to protect himself. Therewere clear breaches of the statutory duties imposed on the defendant by regulations 38N, 38P and 38Q(3), which breaches caused thedeath of the deceased.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Is the deceased totally free from contributory negligence? In this regard, I keep in mind the law as summarised succinctly by theeditors of <em>Clerk and Lindsell on Torts</em>, 17th Ed., para.3-22, which was approved by the Court of Appeal in <strong>Li Man Yuen v. Li Chung I</strong> (unreported, Civ. App. No.91 of 1991, 14 November 1991, pp.12-13) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Where the defendant is charged with the breaches of a statutory duty, the standard by which the plaintiff's contributory negligenceis judged is on occasion less exacting than that used for ordinary negligence. Lord Tucker stated it in this way:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'This is not so illogical as may appear at first sight when it is remembered that contributory negligence is not founded on breachof duty, although it generally involves a breach of duty, and that in Factory Act cases the purpose of imposing the absolute obligationis to protect the workmen against those very acts of inattention which are sometimes relied upon as contributory negligence so thattoo strict a standard would defeat the object of the statute.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The Court of Appeal has also cautioned against undermining the object of statutory provisions by too ready findings of contributorynegligence. The plaintiff's conduct must be judged in the context of the circumstances of his work and in the light of the defendant'sstatutory responsibility for his welfare."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Mr Lin submitted that the cause of the accident was that the deceased stood at a dangerous place. If he had placed himself far awayfrom the edge of the floor, the accident would not have occurred. After the deceased had finished tying the 2-wire sling of the craneonto the damper, he should have moved away from anywhere near the damper and the edge. He was an experienced worker and that waswhat he should have done. This argument flies in the face of the duty imposed by the Safety Regulations that the contractor shouldensure that dangerous edges are to be railed, fenced or covered, or that safety nets should be provided, to prevent persons fromfalling. If nobody is liable to be near any edge, then the protection intended by the Regulations would not be required. Albeit thedeceased was an experienced worker, he was very much liable to be close to the edges of the second level, bearing in mind the peculiarcondition of the floor (which was obvious by looking at exhibit D2) which the defendant or his delegate Lam must have been aware.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> In the absence of any suitable and sufficient anchorage on the floor near the place where the deceased worked, the safe place forthe deceased to put himself would be somewhere close to the centre of the floor. When he was facing Mr Yeung to give the hand signalfor the damper to be hoisted, there was the damper on his left. Just left to the damper was a huge structure, what appears to bea part of an air-duct, lying on the floor. The damper was to be lifted and moved to somewhere in front of the deceased, and it seemsto me that the only safe place for him to position himself during the lifting process was somewhere near the middle of the floorbut one-third from the edge on the side of the platform on which the damper was to be put. That was a place about a metre wide withoutholes. If he did that, he would have to go back to the edge of the floor where that platform was to see whether the damper was lowereddown to the right position of the platform. He would have to move quite some distance from one position to another, along the narrowpassageways of widths of 464 mm to 408 mm, with the floor edge or holes on either side.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> As I said before, the deceased could have been prevented from falling if there was a sufficiently strong guard-rail at the edge closeto which he stood. On the other hand, if the deceased had attached his safety belt to any anchorage, his fall might not have beenfatal. Regulation 38R imposed a statutory duty on the deceased to wear the safety belt provided to him and keep it attached to asecure anchorage whenever the use of the belt was necessary for his own safety. The space between two adjacent holes on the floorand the I-beam close to him could be secure anchorages, but as I have already held, they were not practicable, suitable or reasonable.The nylon ropes were not secure or strong enough to act as a suitable or sufficient anchorage. Yet, if he had positioned himselffarther away from the damper when it was being lifted, e.g., to the middle of the floor, or if he had attached his safety belt toone of these ropes, he might not have fallen or his fall might not have been fatal. I think that as an experienced worker, it wasnegligent of him not to have taken any or any sufficient step such as those mentioned above to protect his own safety. He shouldhave kept his eyes open and take proper precautions to guard against the occurrence of an accident, and he should not have placedhimself in a position of some degree of danger. In all the circumstances, taking into account causation and culpability, I thinkit proper and reasonable to assess the degree of the deceased's contributory negligence to be 20%. The defendant is therefore 80%liable for the damages arising from the death.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> As the trial of the issue of damages is still pending, I accept Mr Lin's suggestion that the question of costs should be reserved.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <div style="text-align:center">        <center>            <table border="0" width="100%">                <tr>                    <td width="50%"></td>                    <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">(K.
