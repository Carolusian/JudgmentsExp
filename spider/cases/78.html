Thealuminium bar formed part of the top of a window frame at Flat B3 on the 20th floor of Belcher Court. The horizontal distance betweenthe place where the aluminium bar fell and the plaintiff was 8 metres. The plaintiff was 2.5 metres away from the near edge of the3 metre wide pavement at Kennedy Town Praya.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The 1st and 2nd defendants were registered as owners of the flat as at the date of the accident. The 3rd defendant was the contractorengaged to replace the windows at the flat with noise insulation windows and the 4th defendant was an employee of the 3rd defendantactually carrying out the replacement work.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> On 9 November 2001, judgment in default of notice of intention to defend was entered against the 3rd defendant with damages to beassessed. Liability of the other defendants is in issue and I shall consider each of them below.</p>    <p class="heading">Liability of 1st defendant</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> It is common ground that the 1st defendant was an occupier of the flat.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> In 1998, the 1st defendant learned that the flat qualified for <em>ex gratia</em> payments by the Government for noise insulation works which comprised improving electricity supply facilities; improving windowsin the 2 bed-rooms and the sitting room; and installing/replacing air-conditioners in the 2 bed-rooms and the sitting room.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> It was not until a few months later that the 1st defendant and her husband decided to take up the Government's offer. By this time,a not insignificant number of units at Belcher Court had completed their noise insulation works. The 1st defendant and her husbandmade enquiries with their neighbours and the 3rd defendant was recommended. The 3rd defendant was no stranger to them because the3rd defendant's shop was located at Shop No. 14B on the ground floor of Belcher Court and had been around for sometime. The 1st defendantdecided to engage the 3rd defendant. In my judgment, the 1st defendant's choice of the 3rd defendant as an independent contractorwas reasonable and she selected an apparently competent contractor. The track record of the 3rd defendant was such that satisfiedcustomers recommended them to the 1st defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Under the general rule, the 1st defendant is not responsible for any tort committed by the 3rd defendant in the course of the executionof the work. Both counsel referred me to the following passages at paragraphs 5-48, 5-49 and 5-59 in <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em>, 18th edition:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>Introduction</em> If the employer has employed an independent contractor to do work on his behalf the general rule is that the employer is not responsiblefor any tort committed by the contractor in the course of the execution of the work and in this respect the employees of the contractor,whilst acting as such, stand in the same position as their employer, so that the employer of the contractor is not liable for thetorts committed by the contractor's employees. Of course, even though the damage complained of may have been caused by the wrongfulact or omission of an independent contractor or his employee, it may also be attributable to the negligence or other personal faultof the employer. If, for example, he has negligently selected an incompetent contractor, or has employed an insufficient number ofmen, or has himself so interfered with the manner of carrying out the work that damage results, he will himself have committed atort for which he can, of course, be held liable. Again if the employer has authorised or ratified the independent contractor's tortthen, on normal principles, he will be jointly liable for such tort. So in <em>Ellis v. Sheffield Gas Consumer's Co</em>., where a gas company, which had no statutory powers to take up the streets for the purpose of laying their gas-pipes, employed acontractor to take up the surface of the streets and lay their pipes for them, and the contractor's employees, having laid theirpipes, insufficiently reinstated the surface, whereby damage occurred, the gas company was held liable. As Erle J. stated: 'The causeof the accident was the very thing done in pursuance of the specific directions of the defendants contained in their contract.'"(Paragraph 5-48)</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>Exceptions to the general rule: non-delegable duties</em> To the general rule that an employer is not liable for the negligence of an independent contractor there are certain apparent exceptions.It is submitted, however, that these are not true exceptions (at least in so far as the theoretical nature of the employer's liabilityis concerned) for they are dependent upon a finding that the employer is, himself, in breach of some duty which he personally owesto the claimant. The liability is thus not truly a vicarious liability and is to be distinguished from the vicarious liability ofan employer for his employee. If the circumstances are such that the law imposes a strict or absolute duty upon the employer, thenhe cannot discharge his duty by delegating performance of the work in question to an independent contractor. If, therefore, the dutyis not fulfilled, the employer is liable even though the immediate cause of the damage is the contractor's wrongful act or omission.Such strict or absolute duties are often described as 'non-delegable' and may arise either by statute or at common law. For presentpurposes, they are to be contrasted with the ordinary duty to take reasonable care which can be discharged by the employment of acontractor reasonably supposed by the employer to be competent. At the least, the non-delegable duty is 'a duty not merely to takecare, but a duty to provide that care is taken,' so that, if care is not taken, the duty is broken." (Paragraph 5-49)</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>Extra-hazardous acts</em> In many of the cases cited above emphasis was placed upon the dangerous nature of the defendant's undertaking and in <em>Honeywill and</em> <em>Stein Ltd v. Larkin Bros Ltd</em> Slesser L.J., delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, enunciated a general principle governing 'extra-hazardous or dangerousoperations'.</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'Even of these,' his Lordship said, 'it may be predicated that if carefully and skilfully performed, no harm will follow; as instancesof such operations may be given those of removing support from adjoining houses, doing dangerous work on the highway, or creatingfire or explosion: hence it may be said, in one sense, that such operations are not necessarily attended with risk. But the ruleof liability for independent contractors' acts attaches to these operations, because they are inherently dangerous, and hence aredone at the principal employer's peril.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The facts of the case were that the plaintiffs had procured the defendants, as independent contractors, to take photographs of theinterior of a cinematograph theatre, and the premises were damaged by fire owing to the defendants' negligence in the use of magnesiumflash powder. The plaintiffs were held to be liable to the owners of the theatre of the damage done, and entitled to recover fromthe defendants the sum paid by them (the plaintiffs) to the owners. In the light of this case it appears that a non-delegable dutyexists whenever an independent contractor is employed to perform an 'extra-hazardous' act, but difficulty arises in determining themeaning of 'extra-hazardous'. As Slesser L.J. recognised in the passage set out above, even 'extra-hazardous' acts will not causedamage if carefully and skilfully performed. Yet any act may cause damage if it is not carefully and skilfully performed, and 'itis clear that the ultimate employer is not responsible for the acts of an independent contractor merely because what is to be donewill involve danger to others if negligently done'. Slesser L.J. himself said that 'extra-hazardous' acts were 'acts which, in theirvery nature, involve in the eyes of the law special danger to others; of such acts the causing of fire and explosion are obviousand established instances.' The principle of <em>Honeywill</em> could be framed to apply to operations involving the use of things recognised in law to be 'dangerous in themselves'. However, theCourt of Appeal in <em>Alcock v. Wraith</em> held that in a case of re-roofing a slate roof with a tile roof, within a row of terraced houses, there was a special risk due tothe known difficulties of making waterproof joints between slates and tiles. The defendants were liable (for trespass, nuisance andnegligence) for damage consequent on the re-roofing work of their independent contractor." (Paragraph 5-59)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The next question is whether the 1st defendant has a non-delegable duty in this case.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> There is no evidence of any defective condition of the windows or the window frames. The evidence of the 4th defendant is that theframes were so securely affixed to the wall that he had to apply force in using a hammer and chisel to loosen or dislodge the frames.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The frames did not overhang or overlook the private rear alley.

He is not able to control the way in which the independent contractor does the work, and the vicarious obligation ofa master for the negligence of his servant does not arise under the relationship of employer and independent contractor. I thinkthat it is entirely accepted that those cases - and there are some - in which an employer has been held liable for injury done bythe negligence of an independent contractor are in truth cases where the employer owes a direct duty to the person injured, a dutywhich he cannot delegate to the contractor on his behalf. The whole question here is whether the occupier is to be judged by thegeneral rule, which would result in no liability, or whether he comes within one of the somewhat special exceptions - cases in whicha direct duty to see that care is taken rests upon the employer throughout the operation.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">This is clear from authority; and for convenience I take from <em>Salmond on Torts</em>, 14th ed. (1965), p. 687, this statement of principle:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'One thing can, however, be said with confidence: the mere fact that the work entrusted to the contractor is of a character whichmay cause damage to others unless precautions are taken is not sufficient to impose liability on the employer. There are few operationsentrusted to an agent which are not capable, if due precautions are not observed, of being sources of danger and mischief to others;and if the principal was responsible for this reason alone, the distinction between servants and independent contractors would bepractically eliminated from the law.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I am satisfied that that statement is supported by authority, and I adopt it for the purposes of this judgment.</p>        <p class="quote">One can compare at once that statement with the statement of principle upon which the judge relied. Having referred to some of theconsiderations to which I have myself already referred, he said:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'The principal, unlike the employer, is not liable for incidental acts of negligence during the work; for instance, dropping a hammeron someone's head; but he is liable if the very act he orders to be done contains in it a risk of injury to others, and someone isinjured as a result of the contractor's negligence as a consequence of that risk. In this case' - he meant the instant case - 'therecan be no doubt that there was an inherent risk of injury to others when the tree was felled unless proper care was taken to getrid of the risk.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I make two observations upon those words of the judge ...</p>        <p class="quote">Secondly, I would venture to criticise the statement of principle which he applied as being too wide. Taken literally, it would meanthat the fare who hired a taxicab to drive him down the Strand would be responsible for negligence of the driver en route becausethe negligence would be negligence in the very thing which the contractor had been employed to do. No one is disposed to suggestthat the liability of the employer is that high; and although the judge reinforced himself by certain observations of Romer L.J.in <em>Penny v. Wimbledon Urban District Council</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1899%5d%202%20QB%2072" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1899] 2 Q.B. 72</a>, 78, in my opinion, the test which he applied was far too stringent.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In truth, according to the authorities there are a number of well-determined classes of case in which this direct and primary dutyupon an employer to see that care is taken exists. Two such classes are directly relevant for consideration in the present case.The first class concerns what have sometimes been described as 'extra-hazardous acts' - acts commissioned by an employer which areso hazardous in their character that the law has thought it proper to impose this direct obligation on the employer to see that careis taken. An example of such a case is <em>Honeywill &amp; Stein Ltd. v. Larkin Bros</em>, (<em>London's Commercial Photographers</em>) <em>Ltd.</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1934%5d%201%20KB%20191" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1934] 1 K.B. 191.</a> Other cases which one finds in the books are cases where the activity commissioned by the employer is the keeping of dangerous thingswithin the rule in <em>Rylands v. Fletcher</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281868%29%20LR%203%20HL%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1868) L.R. 3 H.L. 330</a> and where liability is not dependent on negligence at all.</p>        <p class="quote">I do not propose to add to the wealth of authority on this topic by attempting further to define the meaning of 'extra-hazardous acts';but I am confident that the act commissioned in the present case cannot come within that category. The act commissioned in the presentcase, if done with ordinary elementary caution by skilled men, presented no hazard to anyone at all.</p>        <p class="quote">The second class of case, which is relevant for consideration, concerns dangers created in a highway. There are a number of caseson this branch of the law, a good example of which is <em>Holliday v. National Telephone Co.</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1899%5d%202%20QB%20392" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1899] 2 Q.B. 392.</a> These, on analysis, will all be found to be cases where work was being done in a highway and was work of a character which wouldhave been a nuisance unless authorised by statute. It will be found in all these cases that the statutory powers under which theemployer commissioned the work were statutory powers which left upon the employer a duty to see that due care was taken in the carryingout of the work, for the protection of those who passed on the highway. In accordance with principle, an employer subject to sucha direct and personal duty cannot excuse himself, if things go wrong, merely because the direct cause of the injury was the act ofthe independent contractor.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">This again is not a case in that class. It is not a case in that class because in the instant case no question of doing work in thehighway, which might amount to a nuisance if due care was not taken, arises. In my judgment, the present case is clearly outsidethe well defined limit of the second class to which I have referred. Mr. Bax, accordingly, invited us to say that there is a thirdclass into which the instant case precisely falls, and he suggested that the third class comprised those cases where an employercommissions work to be done <em>near</em> a highway in circumstances in which, if due care is not taken, injury to passers-by on the highway may be caused. If that be a thirdclass of case to which the principle of liability of the employer applies, no doubt the present case would come within that description.The question is, is there such a third class?</p>        <p class="quote">Reliance was placed primarily on three authorities ...</p>        <p class="quote">The last case relied upon was <em>Walsh v. Holst &amp; Co. Ltd.</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1958%5d%201%20WLR%20800" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1958] 1 W.L.R. 800</a>, a decision of this court. In that case the occupier of premises adjoining the highway was carrying out works of reconstruction,which involved knocking out large areas of the front wall. He employed for that purpose a contractor, who employed a sub-contractor.It was obvious to all that such an operation was liable to cause injury to passers-by by falling bricks unless special precautionsagainst that eventuality were taken. Indeed, very considerable precautions were so taken. However, on a day when the only workmanemployed was an employee of the sub-contractor, one brick escaped the protective net, fell in the street and injured a passer-by.The passer-by sued the occupier, the contractor, and the subcontractor, relying on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. In my judgment,the only thing decided by that case was that on those facts the precautions which had been taken against such an injury rebuttedthe presumption of negligence which might otherwise have arisen under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. No attempt appears to havebeen made in argument to distinguish the liability of the occupier as compared with that of the contractor or sub-contractor, andit certainly was not material to the decision. But Mr. Bax relied upon it for dicta which unquestionably are helpful to him. He referredfirst to the judgment of Hodson L.J., who, having stated the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, went on to deal with the relevant positionsof the parties. He said at p. 804:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'So far as the board is concerned,' [the board were the occupiers] 'the law as stated by Romer L.J. in <em>Penny v.

He said, at p. 812:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'As the electricity board had authorised work to be done adjoining the highway which might without due precautions cause injury toanyone on the highway, the authorities already cited by my Lords show that the board would be liable for the negligence of the contractorsor sub-contractors in failing to take due precautions.

But in my judgment, having consideredthis matter with such care as I can, I can find nothing in the authorities to which Sellers L.J. referred which justifies a conclusionin the terms which he uses; and, as I have already said, this decision was obiter because the case turned on the absence of negligenceand not upon any nice question of which of the defendants might have been liable if negligence had been proved.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Accordingly, in my judgment, there is no third class of cases of the kind put forward by Mr. Bax; and it was for those reasons thatI concurred" <em>per Widgery LJ at pp. 336-340.</em></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The occupier through his wife employed an apparently competent independent contractor to do the work and, therefore, on general principlehe is not liable for that contractor's negligence.

There are indeed, certain categories of cases in which an occupieris under such a primary duty to others that he in effect warrants the safety of his property against those who are injured by whathappens upon it, or alternatively is personally responsible for having any work on it done in a competent manner even if he has selecteda competent independent contractor.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Those categories, which I do not propose to attempt to list exhaustively, include one where the occupier is under a statutory dutyto have work either safely or properly done or to keep his property in safe or proper repair.

(1965), p. 691. It is there treated as being a separate and narrow category, and rightly so to my mind - on the assumption,of course, that the phrase 'upon a highway' or 'in a highway' includes the air space above it and the ground below it.

It is into that category that the present case wasplaced by the judge.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">As regards work done on land close to a highway, there is, to my mind, a sharp distinction between cases in which the work done isinherently dangerous and cases where there is no such danger, although there may be risks entailed if the work is done incompetently.The dividing line between the two classes of case may sometimes be difficult and involve questions of degree; but generally speakingthis is a matter of common sense as to what, in plain English, is 'inherently dangerous' having regard, inter alia, to the distancefrom the highway of the place where the work is being done.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In the present case it seems clear to me that there was nothing 'inherently dangerous' in the operation of removing this particularhawthorn tree.

That work went on inside a bed-room and he was in the sitting room. Work in fact took place at 5 windows and theflat was filled with noise and littered with debris. He had 2 small children (a 4-year old and a 7-year old) to look after and therewere 4 - 6 workers inside that 400 sq. ft. flat. Consistent with his conduct after the accident, he was indifferent to the processof implementation of the window replacement works.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> I have carefully considered <strong>Wong Sau Chung and Wong Sau Mui v Ho Kam Chiu and others</strong> HCPI 872 of 1996, unreported, Seagroatt J, 27 January 2000, and for reasons given above, hold that the 1st defendant is not liableto the plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">Liability of 2nd defendant</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The contention that in paragraph 3 of the Amended Defence of the 1st and 2nd Defendants that the 2nd defendant "had in fact dulytransferred all her beneficial interests in the Flat to the 1st Defendant by virtue of a verbal agreement" is frivolous or vexatious,see the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing and Property Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219">Cap. 219</a>, including <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 3</a>-<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> If the 2nd defendant were an occupier, then for the same reasons given on her co-owner's liability, the 2nd defendant is also notliable to the plaintiff.

In any event it was clearly useless to stop the top frame from falling as there wasa big gap at the top of the window opening extending over the whole width of the window opening and the height of the air-conditionerat the top of the window opening. I reject the 4th defendant's account of the window frame falling by itself. The inference whichI draw from the fact that the aluminium bar landed 8 metres away is that it fell in the course of the 4th defendant dislodging it,probably using a hammer and a chisel. If this inference is not permissible, the facts speak for themselves. The window frame whichwas hitherto fastened onto the wall would not have fallen into the rear alley in the course of the 4th defendant's removal of thewindow frame without some want of care on his part.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The plea of contributory negligence put forward by Messrs Au-Yeung, Cheng, Ho &amp; Tin, former solicitors for the 4th defendant,in paragraph 7 of the 4th defendant's Defence is plainly nonsensical and I reject it.

Mr Victor Gidwani also relied on the case noted in paragraph 2504, i.e. <strong>Chung Hok Sung v Li Kam Ming &amp; another</strong> HCPI 393 of 1995. Having regard to the fact that the injury to the plaintiff was to his the dominant hand, and the deflation since1998, I assess damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenities at $250,000.</p>    <p class="heading">Past loss of earnings</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The plaintiff's evidence on damages is wholly unsatisfactory.

These add up to $34,540 for the period startingfrom the date of his employment to the date of the accident on 14 November 1998. I do not believe that his daily wage was $800. $10,140is not a multiple of $800. I do not believe his evidence on the commencement date and on the footing that at least 15 days must haveelapsed before he was paid on 19 September 1998, I took 5 September 1998 to be the earliest commencement date. From 5 September to14 November 1998, his earnings totalled $34,540. There was no evidence on whether that job finished on or about 14 November 1998or how much longer he would have been employed on that job had he not been injured. In the absence of evidence I see no reason whyI should assume that his employment would have continued. He had only himself to blame for not being forthcoming in his evidence.There was also no evidence on the time gap between that employment and the preceding one. According to his bank book, the date ofthe credit entry before the 19 September 1998 credit entry was 28 July 1998. Assuming in the plaintiff's favour that the precedingemployment ended on 28 July 1998, he earned $34,540 between 28 July 1998 and 14 November 1998. There is no evidence of his incomefrom earlier jobs which means that there is no evidence that his income from earlier jobs was higher than $34,540 for a 3 1/2 monthperiod. Based on the wholly unsatisfactory evidence before me, I find that his average monthly income at the time of accident was$9,869.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> He was granted sick leave from 14 November 1998 to 1 December 1999 and his loss of income during this 121/2 month period amountedto $123,363.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> The plaintiff's witness statement was positively uninformative about his income after the sick leave period and it is not possibleto make any finding on his income from 1 December 1999 to the date of trial. He chose to say no more than that he could only resumeworking in July 2000 but said nothing about his income from being a wall-painter and a light electrical worker. He then went on tosay that from the middle of September 2000 to middle of May 2001 he worked as a light-duty electrician with Yee Hing at a daily wageof $550, making no attempt to say what his monthly income was. He then claimed he was dismissed by Yee Hing and he asserted in paragraph23 that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I remained unemployed and could only engage in light electrical work on casual basis so that I could have sufficient rest time forrecovery of power of my right arm whenever I completed an assignment."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> There he lied. Almost immediately after the Yee Hing job ended and his employment lasted until the Yee Hing job was finished, heworked for the MTR, the income from which was credited into his bank account at p. 305 of the bundle. He told the Court nothing abouthis job from December 2001 or early 2002 at the science park at a daily wage of $700.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> It is incumbent on the plaintiff to prove his loss and damage. It is not the function of this Court to go through his bank passbooksand try to guess his income or to plough through the bundle to try to work out a figure.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> In my judgment, the plaintiff has not proved what his income from 1 December 1999 to the date of trial was, and thus has not provedthat he has suffered any loss of income as from 1 December 1999, compared with his pre-accident average monthly income of $9,869.</p>    <p class="heading">Loss of future earnings</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> The plaintiff's right hand achieved with lifting force of 19 kg, carrying force of 19 kg, pushing force of 85 kg and pulling forceof 80 kg at the final physical and work tolerance evaluation on 26 November 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The plaintiff should have no problem with almost all works of the electrician except working on heavy cables. There is no evidencethat his work prior to the accident involved lifting work materials of about 50 kg and carrying roll of circuit about 80 kg for theinstallation task in his job. On the date of accident he was working at the alley between 2 residential buildings. He was not workingon cables with circumference measuring at least 630 mm. There was no difference in pay between an electrician working on heavy cablesand an electrician working at a residential or office building or unit. The plaintiff has not made out any case of loss of futureearnings.</p>    <p class="heading">Loss of earning capacity</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> This involves quantifying the present value of the risk of the financial damage which the plaintiff will suffer if the substantialor real risk that the plaintiff will lose his present job at some time before the estimated end of his working life, having regardto the degree of the risk, the time when it may materialise, and all the circumstances of this case including the plaintiff's chancesof getting a job at all, or an equally well paid job. The plaintiff has made no attempt to tell me what his present job is, or toestablish any risk that he will loss his present job. He has not begun to make out any case for loss of earning capacity.</p>    <p class="heading">Special damages and tonic food</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Like all the other items, there is a paucity of evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> I accept Mr John Kerr's submission and assess medical expenses at $6,320 and tonic food at $5,000.</p>    <p class="heading">Summary</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> I assess pain, suffering and loss of amenities at $250,000, past loss of earnings at $123,363, and special damages and tonic foodat $11,320, adding up to $384,683.</p>    <p class="heading">Employees' compensation</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> But for the point about giving credit for the money he received by way of employees' compensation, I would have entered judgmentin favour of the plaintiff against the 3rd and 4th defendants in the sum of $384,683, with interest at 2% per annum on $250,000 from24 October 2001 to the date of judgment and interest at 4.07% per annum on $123,363 and on $11,320 from 14 November 1998 to the dateof judgment</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> It is common ground the plaintiff would give credit for the money he received by way of employees' compensation in the sum of $388,640.The certificate of assessment is dated 28 January 2000 and the plaintiff's bank passbook shows that he received it by 25 February2000, 1 year 3 1/2 months after the date of the accident, but 1 year 8 months before the date of issue of the writ. $388,640 exceeds$384,683 by $3,957. The plaintiff has not proved any loss or damage in excess of what he should give credit for and no award shouldbe made in his favour.</p>    <p class="heading">Judgment</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> I order that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) The plaintiff's action against the 1st and 2nd defendants be dismissed.</p>        <p>(b) The plaintiff's action against the 4th defendant be dismissed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> The 1st and 2nd defendants have wasted time on the issue of the 2nd defendant's ownership of the flat and the feigned concern ofthe 1st defendant's husband in the window replacement works.

I make an order nisi that judgment be entered in favour of the 1st and 2nd defendantsagainst the plaintiff for 75% of their costs of this action. The 4th defendant has lost on liability and the plaintiff has not establishedany loss or damage in excess of employees' compensation.
