Yau Kin Wai the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, also a subcontractor, employed the plasterers, and instructed and directed them in the work they undertook.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  On 24 June 2004 the plasterers were given the task of spraying concrete on a ceiling of the carpark which was in the course of constructionon the site.  They worked in unison, on an elevated mobile platform which was equipped with safety rails around its four sides.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The work proceeded without incident.  Then Mr Yau took Mr Tariq off the platform to spray a small additional area that had not sofar been covered.  The elevated platform with rails was occupied; thus Mr Tariq was told to use another.  But this had no rails orother barrier to avoid risk of a mishap.  And during the course of his work he accidentally stepped backwards off the platform, fallingabout two meters to the floor.  He suffered injuries to his lower back and, to a lesser extent, his right knee.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  This is his claim for recompense in damages, founded in the tort of negligence, in breach of his contract of employment and in breachof the statutory duty of care he was owed.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Although a defence was pleaded, on the first day of trial I was told by Mr Chan, counsel representing all three defendants, thatliability was admitted; in the event there was no evidence forthcoming on liability.  What remains in dispute is as to whether therewas contributory negligence by the injured Mr Tariq.  Mr Chan argued that to the extent of 20 to 30%.  Miss Tsang, counsel for MrTariq, urged upon me that there was no contributory negligence at all.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The remaining matters in dispute all go to the issue of quantum of Mr Tariqâs loss.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Mr Tariq is a Pakistani.  He was born in Pakistan in 1966, which made him 38 at the time of the accident.  He is now 41.  He cameto Hong Kong in 1987.  He is married with three school-aged children.  His wife does not work; he has all along been the sole breadwinner.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Between 1987 and 1997 Mr Tariq worked as a factory worker and security guard.  From 1997 he became a casual construction site worker.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In January 1999 he met up with Mr Yau the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant and thereafter when work was available he came to be employed by him.  Just how much work was offered that he then undertookis at issue to which I shall return.  Suffice to say he became a plasterer so that when he was employed he was paid the daily rateof $600.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Mr Tariq was assigned to the construction site at Aberdeen on 11 May 2004 and was there until the day of the accident when his injuriesprevented a resumption.  During that time he earned $11,400, which equates with about $7,600 per month.</p>    <p class="heading">The Job Description</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The work that Mr Tariq was employed to carry out on the Aberdeen construction site required him to spray concrete on to the wallsand ceilings of the carpark in a team of about 9 or 10 co-workers.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The spraying equipment comprises a machine through which liquid concrete is pumped into a flexible pipe of several meters endingin a nozzle which is about a meter long.  The pipe is pressurized, which thus forces the concrete out and on to the designated surface. When the ceiling was the prescribed target, each worker was required to climb on to the elevated platform bringing with him thenozzle attached to the pipe.  Part of the weight of the pipe would be carried by a tie affixed to the safety rail around the platform.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The machine can be turned on and off by a switch located at or near the nozzle, and the pressure similarly regulated.  By this meansthe worker can spray his designated area ensuring sufficient coverage evenly spread.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Mr Tariq said that with the partial support I have referred to the weight to be thus borne by the worker is about 30 kilogrammes,and 10 kilogrammes more if the pipe is not tied off to the rail. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  It was not said but it goes without saying that this is a job which requires strength and stamina and concentration.  The need toensure an even and adequate coverage whilst operating in noisy, dirty and crowded conditions would make this a taxing exercise.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Coupled with this activity the plasterer is required to move his machine around from floor to floor as may be necessary, and tocarry bags of cement and other weighty material from time to time.</p>    <p class="heading">The Accident</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  It was towards the end of the working day that Mr Yau directed Mr Tariq to carry out the spraying in question.  The area was smallâ no more than about two square meters.  Mr Tariq estimated it should have taken about four minutes.  As directed he climbed onto the available platform which had no guard rails.  He was aware of that.  He brought with him the nozzle, with the pipe snakingbehind it.  As there was no rail there was nothing to tie it off on to; thus it weighed 10 kilogrammes more than before.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Mr Tariq began to spray.  As he did so he was stepping backwards.  He underestimated his distance from the edge and stepped backwardsinto space.  He landed on the floor on his back.  He had been engaged on this job for about three minutes.</p>    <p class="heading">The Injuries</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Mr Tariq was taken by ambulance to Queen Mary Hospital.  A report reveals he complained of back, left hip and right knee pain. There was tenderness at the left paraspinal area around the 5<sup>th</sup> lumbar vertebra.  There was no neurological deficit.  The diagnosis was back sprain and right knee contusion.  He was held for twonights and then discharged for follow-up; this was to be with analgesics and physiotherapy.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Physiotherapy was begun on 12 August.  Mr Tariq was found to have very limited extension and lateral flexion left and right.  After15 sessions there was impaired mobility but by this time the condition was static and he was discharged on 8 November with a programmeof home exercises.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr Tariq received a series of sick leave certificates up to 5 July 2005; a period thus of 12.5 months.</p>    <p class="heading">Post-Accident Circumstances</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Mr Tariq did not attempt to return to the construction site workforce at the termination of his sick leave or at all afterwards. He said that since the accident he has suffered from back pain with varying severity.  He cannot sit or walk for more than a shorttime without taking a break.  Moreover his back could not stand the physical pressures of manning a spray machine, of mounting anddismounting from the elevated platform, of lugging the machine around the site and of carrying the heavy loads a plasterer is requiredto bear.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Instead, following his sick leave, he tried for less arduous employment, including becoming a security guard.  In the event he cameto be so employed, but not until nearly a year later in June 2006, and then only for a month as it was temporary relief work.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  He finally became properly employed on 8 October 2006 when he joined Nam Tai Security Company Limited.  He is with them to date. He works the night shift for a stint of 14 hours, and benefits from occasional overtime.</p>    <p class="heading">The Issues</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Those matters for resolution now follow:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     Has contributory negligence been established, and if so to what extent?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)    What was Mr Tariq earning on average up to the date of the accident?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)     Could he have returned to work on construction sites after his sick leave?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d)    Should he have been able to find work straight after his sick leave, or at least earlier than was the case?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(e)     What is a proper award for pain suffering and loss of amenities?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(f)     What is the proper level of loss of income pre-trial, and post-trial?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(g)     Should there be provision for loss of earning capacity?</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Contributory Negligence</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  This is a fact sensitive issue.  Mr Tariq said that during the brief course of his working on the unsafe platform he overlookedthat there were no guardrails.  He was used to pushing back until coming into contact with the rail.  Mr Chan pointed out that thetime between his climbing on to the platform and then falling from it was so short that it was obviously negligent of him to allowhimself to step off it.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  I accept that Mr Tariq was not on the platform for long before he fell off it.  But I also recognise that he was engaged in whatI have earlier described as noisy, dirty and taxing activity.  It was at the end of a long working day.  He had to bear more weightthan before because his pipe was not tied off.  He was sent up on to a platform that was unquestionably unsafe if not downright dangerous. He was doing the best he could.  I find it not established that he was negligent which caused or assisted in his fall.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  There will be thus no reduction for contributory negligence.</p>    <p class="heading">The Pre-accident Income</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Notoriously in cases of this sort involving a construction site accident to a casual worker there is a paucity of data to establishwhat sort of work history the victim had before the accident.  It is not unheard of for an exaggerated workload to be put forward.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Mr Tariq said that as a casual worker on $600 per day he could work up to 26 days per month.  But he conceded that there were periodswhen he was not employed.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Not long before the Aberdeen site stint when there had been no work he had gone to Pakistan where he stayed for about five months.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  And it is pertinent that for the 44 days he was available to work on the Aberdeen site he was paid a total of $11,400, which meanthe worked only 19 days, or less than half the days available.  Of course that percentage may well have been increased had he notsuffered the fall.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Miss Tsang submitted that a realistic estimate is that he worked on average 18 days per month, making thus $10,800 per month.  MrChan submitted he could not justify more than $7,600.  Tellingly, in cross-examination Mr Tariq agreed with this.  In fact that isthe monthly income he was being paid at the Aberdeen site, and pays no heed to the times he was not employed at all.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In my view that is a generous calculation; one which I am satisfied is as much as could be acceptable.  I find thus Mr Tariq earned$7,600 per month up to the date of the accident.</p>    <p class="heading">Was Construction Site Work Post-Accident an Option?</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  In respect of this issue I turn to medical opinion for assistance. </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  As a pre-trial direction Mr Tariq was examined by two orthopaedic surgeons, Dr Patrick Wong (appointed by Mr Tariq) and Dr Lee PoChin (appointed by the three defendants).  They were then asked to file a report which came to be adduced without the calling ofthe doctors.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Mr Tariq was examined in November 2005 and the report came out a month later.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The doctors noted that he still complained of back pain which affected his ability to sleep and to walk and to sit for long periods. There was also mild right knee pain.  He told them he could not return to his former job because of the strength and agility neededto perform the concrete spraying and that the back pain would make that intolerable.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  He was asked to perform various tests to establish the extent of flexion, extension and other exercises in mobility.  X-rays ofhis back revealed a loss of normal lumbar lordosis and mild degenerative spondylosis with reduced L5/S1 disc space.  There was nobone or joint lesion in either the back or right knee attributable to trauma.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Both doctors then gave their opinion.  Both noted local tenderness and reduced lumbar spine movement.  There was no significantlower limb abnormality.  Both said he âdemonstrated a number of inappropriate physical signsâ by which I take it he exaggeratedhis symptoms.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Dr Lee opined that the impairment of the lower back was 3% with no further impairment associated with the knee.  Dr Wong put theback impairment at 5% and the knee at 1%.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  And they came to different conclusions on his ability to return to his pre-accident employment.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Dr Wong said of that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMr Mahmood is incapable of performing his pre-accident job as efficient as before basing on the job description supplied by him. He may need help from other workers from time to time.  He should have no problem in performing other types of light to moderatemanual jobs such as machine operator, cleaning worker or security guard.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>And Dr Lee said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMr Mahmood should be able to return to his old job as a cement worker in view of the mild low back symptoms.  Change of occupationis not necessary.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  It is apparent that both doctors regard Mr Tariqâs condition as relatively mild on the scale of mild to severe.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Nevertheless, I wonder whether Dr Lee had sufficient information before him as to the extent of strength, stamina, fitness and mobilityneeded to undertake the concrete spraying that was Mr Tariqâs particular construction site activity.  And this included manhandlingthe machine to whatever level and carrying heavy weights such as cement.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  It seems to me that this is work that can only be properly and safely undertaken by a worker who is fully fit.  Mr Tariq is notfully fit.  It would be unreasonable to expect assistance from co-workers.  And the risk of a recurrence or aggravation of back painis obvious.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In the circumstances I believe returning to his former employment was not an option, and remains so.  The work he undertakes now,that of a security guard, is realistic in the circumstances.  His average monthly income including overtime is $6,600.</p>    <p class="heading">When Could Mr Tariq Have Returned to Work?</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Mr Chan submitted that to take 11 more months after the sick leave was over to find suitable employment was far too long, givenparticularly that Mr Tariq was returning to work as a security guard which activity he had undertaken in the past.  He invited meto hold he should have succeeded by three months after the sick leave.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Ms Tsang countered with the fact that Mr Tariqâs English and Cantonese are basic (he needed a Punjabi interpreter in giving hisevidence) and that would have made the task of getting work harder.  She submitted he had done enough in trying to find an alternativejob.  When he did find one, it was one which requires him to work long hours and night shift, and he works overtime when he can.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  That said, there was no evidence to show what efforts he did make.  He admitted that he took another trip to Pakistan at this time. My view is that he should have found an appropriate position by six months after the end of his sick leave.</p>    <p class="heading">PSLA</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Both counsel submitted copies of recent judgments in cases tried locally to assist me in reaching the right level of award underthis head.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Miss Tsang submitted six, with particular emphasis on three: <i>Yeung Tai Hung v Hong Kong Baptist Hospital</i>, HCPI 684/2004, <i>Lung Kwong Ying v So Sai Lo</i>, HCPI 206/2001 and <i>Cheung Yuk Lin v Unipar Limited</i>, HCPI 1189/1997.  In respect of these cases the awards were respectively $300,000, $250,000 and $250,000.  She proposed a figureof between $250,000 and $300,000.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Mr Chan considered these awards to be too high for this case.  He put forward his selection, of which I mention the following: <i>Ho Kwai Hong v Chung Kok</i>, HCPI 93/2002, <i>Tam Kwok Man v Kowloon Motor Bus Co.</i>, HCPI 755/2001 and <i>Lai Kam Wah v Wing &amp; Kwong Co.

It is agreed that the multiplier should be (if applicable)12; thus I can now calculate his loss of income.</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="55%">            <tr>                <td width="40%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Pre-trial income:</td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align: right">ã</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="40%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">$7,600 x 18.5 months (to 5.1.06)</td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align: right">$140,600</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="40%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">related MPF:</td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align: right"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="40%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">$140,600 x 5%</td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align: right">7,030</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="40%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">$7,600 - $6,600 x 16 months (to 4.5.07)</td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align: right">16,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="40%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">related MPF:</td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align: right"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="40%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">$16,000 x 5%</td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align: right"><u>800</u></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="40%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align: right">$164,430<br />                =======</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="40%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Future loss of income:</td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align: right"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="40%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">$7,600 - $6,600 x 12 x 12</td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align: right">$144,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="40%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">related MP:</td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align: right"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="40%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">$144,000 x 5%</td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align: right"><u>7,200</u></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="40%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" style="text-align: right">$151,200<br />                =======</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Loss of Earning Capacity</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Mr Chan submitted that this should only be contemplated were I to have found Mr Tariq sufficiently recovered to have returned tothe work of a construction site worker; otherwise, there is nothing to suggest that he is at risk of being dismissed from workingas a security guard or similar by reason of his disabilities.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  I agree.
