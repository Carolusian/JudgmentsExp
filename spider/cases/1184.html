The plaintiff is the Bank Negara of Indonesia Hong Kong Branch carrying on a bankingbusiness in Hong Kong, The defendant is the Hong Kong and Kowloon Wharf and Godown Co. Ltd. which carries on business inter aliaas warehouseman and wharfinger. On the 5th of September 1968 one Nam Hoi Co. Ltd (hereinafter referred to as "the Nam Hoi") appliedto the plaintiff for an irrevocable letter of credit in favour of the Central Asia Investment Co. in Singapore in the sum of 1,056,000Singapore dollars in respect of importation of what was alleged to be 32 tons of Nutmeg Oil packed in 160 drums from Singapore toHong Kong (hereinafter referred to as "the goods"). The goods were to be held by the plaintiff as security for the money so advanced.The goods were duly shipped on board the s.s. 'Var' with a bill of lading issued by the ship's agent to the effect that the goodswere to be delivered to the order of the Bank Negara Indonesia, Hong Kong. In the meanwhile the bill of lading, the sales invoice,the weight notes and the packing list were all sent to the plaintiff. The s.s. 'Var' arrived in Hong Kong on the 8th of October in1968 and the goods were discharged to the defendant's wharf. Outturn reports given in respect of the goods were furnished to theplaintiff in document P.114,115,115 A to C. In the meanwhile a draft was drawn by the Central Asia Investment Co. of Singapore underthe said letter of credit. The draft was honoured. Up to date the bill had not been retired. On or about the 22nd of October 1968the plaintiff gave the bill of lading and the relevant documents to one Chan Kung Wo the Managing Director of Nam Hoi in order toobtain a Delivery Order from the ship's agent in respect of the goods. The Delivery Order addressed to the defendants reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Please deliver the undermentioned goods, upon endorsement and after payment of all charges due to you, to Messrs. Bank Negara Indonesia(Hong Kong Branch) 25, Des Voeux Road Central, Hong Kong. Telephone 246922 ex. s.s. 'Var'. Voyage Bill of Lading No. 1 from Singaporearriving on or about 8th October 1968."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The goods were described in this Delivery Order as 160 Steel Drums said to contain Nutmeg Oil. On or about the 24th of October 1968Chan Kung Wo presented the Delivery Order with a forged endorsement on the back of it and obtained delivery of the goods which werecarted to a business house in Shaukiwan in Hong Kong. That was the last occasion on which anyone saw the goods which subsequentlydisappeared. Extended police investigation drew a bank. As a result there was a total loss. One of the reasons why Chan Kung Wo wasable to take delivery with a forged document was that the staff of the defendant released the goods without checking on the endorsementon the back of the Delivery Order. The said Chan Kung Wo was later charged with the offences of uttering a forged document and ofobtaining goods by uttering a forged document. He made statements to the Police of the Commercial Crime Office which sufficientlyshowed and that he was an innocent agent as far as the Attorney General was concerned and a nolle prosequi was entered in his favour.On the 7th of November 1968 the plaintiff wrote to the shipping agent for another Delivery Order and was given one on the same datein favour of the plaintiff. The plaintiff again presented the Delivery Order to the defendant. However the plaintiff was told thatthe goods had already been released and were no longer with the defendant. These facts are not seriously disputed except as to thecontents of the 160 drums of so-called Nutmeg Oil. Subject to this question I have found that the facts as aforesaid proved.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The plaintiff's case is that they were entitled to immediate possession on presentation of the Delivery Order of the 32 tons of NutmegOil contained in a 160 drums of 200 kilogram each, On or about the 8th of October 1968 the goods were taken into storage by the defendant.On or about the 24th of October 1968 the defendant released the goods without the plaintiff's authority but on he strength of a DeliveryOrder which bore on the reverse side a forged endorsement of the plaintiff. Therefore the defendant failed to deliver the goods tothe plaintiffs on the latter's lawful demand.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The defendant's case is that they do not admit that the goods were Nutmeg Oil. They contend that the plaintiff was negligent in releasingthe bill of lading to the Nam Hoi together with other documents with the intention of allowing the Nam Hoi to take the goods away.Altermatively the defendant contends that the loss was contributed by the plaintiff for not getting back the bill of lading or theDelivery Order from Nam Hoi or Chan Kung Wo thereby enabling Chan to represent to the defendant that he had the plaintiff's authorityto take delivery, By presenting the Delivery Order with a purported endorsement of the plaintiff's thereon the said Chan Kung Wowas acting in fact with the plaintiff's authority. Alternatively the plaintiff failed to inform the defendant of the loss of theDelivery Order earlier and therefore deprived the defendant the opportunity of retaining the goods so released. It is also the defendant'scase that the plaintiff was bound by the Conditions of Business issued to it. One of the terms of the Conditions of Business wasthat the company was not liable to loss caused by forgery of document of title or negligence of the company's servants. Another termwas that the defendant would not be liable for the error of judgment or negligence of their employees in checking the authenticityof the document and that the defendant was entitled to assume that the person presenting the Delivery Order was a person entitledto take delivery of the goods. Further, the plaintiff failed to give notice of the value of the cargo which was rated as valuablecargo and as such there was a limit to the defendant's liability to the extent of only $500 per package. Thus even if the defendantwere liable the liability would be limited to a total sum of $200,000. Lastly it is pleaded that the defendant was not bound by aletter admitting that the defendant was at fault because the letter was written by the solicitors at the material time when theywere acting both for the defendant as well as the plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> In the course of the hearing it is not argued that the defendant was bound by this letter written by the then solicitors acting forboth parties. It appears to me that the said letter was written by the solicitors concerned in their capacity as legal advisors tothe plaintiff rather than as representative of the defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Having regard to the pleadings however there appears to me that there are three main issues for consideration. The first is whetherthe plaintiff has proved that the goods in question were Nutmeg Oil to the value of two million odd Hong Kong dollars. The secondissue is that whether the goods were delivered to some person authorised by the plaintiff to take delivery or with the plaintiff'sconsent to do so either expressed or implied. The third issue is whether the goods were delivered through mere negligence of thedefendant's counter-clerk and if so whether the defendant would be relieved from liability or be entitled to limit the quantum ofliability by virtue of the terms of storage contained in the defendant's Conditions of Business.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> With reference to the first issue the plaintiff adduces no oral evidence but replies on documentary evidence including the documentscontained in the Hearsay Notices served on the defendant. It is contended that the sales contract (Document 122A) dated the 11thSeptember 1968 showed that the Nam Hoi agreed to sell to the Yanyang Trading Company Ltd. a total of 32 tons of Nutmeg Oil for thesum of HK$2,745,600. The invoice dated the 25th of September 1968 (Document 122B) issued by the Central Asia Investment Co. of Singaporeto the Nam Hoi shows that 32 tons of Nutmeg Oil packed in 200 kilogram steel drums was shipped per s.s. 'Var' from Singapore to HongKong for the sum of 1,056,000 Singapore dollars.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On the 5th of September 1968 the said Nam Hoi applied to the plaintiff for an irrevocable letter of credit in favour of the saidCentral Asia Investment Co. of Singapore to the extent of 1,056,000 Singapore dollars for the said 32 tons of Nutmeg Oil packed in200 kilograms steel drums and the plaintiff established the letter of credit in favour of the said Central Asia Investment Companyof Singapore for that purpose. The weight note, Document 122C the packing list Document 122D were in evidence. The bill of lading,document 122 refers to the goods as Nutmeg Oil. The outturn report is sued by the defendant document 114 to 115 also described thegoods as Nutmeg Oil. In addition the plaintiff also relied on a letter dated on the 27th of May 1969 written for the Commissionerof Preventive Service contained in the Hearsay Notice dated the 16th of November 1977 which reads as follows:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">I refer to your letter dated the 24th of May 1969 concerning the examination of a consignment manifested as Nutmeg Oil, which arrivedin Hong Kong on board the s.s.

The examination revealed that the drums contained a yellowish colour oil which had a strongsmell of spice.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">I trust the foregoing information will be of assistance to you."</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> There is evidence that in Document 139 when Chan Kung Wo was charged with the offence of obtaining from the defendant 160 drums ofNutmeg Oil upon a forged Delivery Order he neaver denied in his answer to the charge that there had been no Nutmeg Oil at all. Indeedin his statements to the officer of the Commercial Crime Office of the Hong Kong Police in Items 14 and 15 in the Hearsay Noticesserved by the defendant Chan Kung Wo repeatedly refered to the goods as Nutmeg Oil. Learned counsel for the plaintiff therefore contendsthat since the goods were lost due to conversion on the part of the defendant the plaintiff in entitled to rely also on the principalof omnia praesummtur contra spolia-torem.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In rebuttal the defendant relies on the two statements aforementioned made by Chan Kung Wo namely Items 14 and 15 served under HearsayNotices. Such statements were made to the Police before Chan stool trial for offences of uttering a forged document and of obtaininggoods on a forged Delivery Order. His statements were to a large extent corroborated by vouchers, payment slips and account booksseized from the Nam Hoi by officers of the Commercial Crime Office. So much so that Chan had satisfied the proper authority thathe was nothing but an innocent agent and a nolle prosequi was entered in his favour. In his statement Chan Kung Wo alleged that twoof the plaintiff's officers at the material time namely Soekarno Soedirman and Iu Wing Nin were deeply involved in the transactionof importing the goods to Hong Kong from Singapore. Soekarno was the plaintiff's assistant manager and Iu was the first officer incharge of the Import and Export Department. Both of them regularly received payments from the Nam Hoi. It was Soekarno who gave thebill of lading to Chan Kung Wo to obtain the Delivery Order for the 160 drums of the alleged Nutmeg Oil and Iu was the person whogave Chan Kung Wo the invoice, the packing list, etc, for the purpose of showing the Preventive Service Personnel so as to have thegoods examined. An Insurance Policy to cover the goods between the 24th of October 1968 to the 24th of November 1968 was appliedfor by Iu though not ultimately effected. Chan said that Soekarno and Iu also helped in arranging the letter of credit to be grantedin respect of an earlier transaction that took place in July 1968. On that occasion 7 tons in 35 drums of Nutmeg Oil was importedfrom Singapore to Hong Kong. The importer was the Nam Hoi and the shipper was also Central Investment Co. in Singapore. The plaintiffswere also the banker which opened letter of credit for the transaction to the sum of Singapore dollars 231,000. After the CentralInvestment Co. obtained the payment in Singapore the said company promptly remitted back to Hong Kong $300,000 to Nam Hoi which inturn transferred the said sum to the latter's account with the plaintiff in part settlement of an overdraft. For his help Soekarnowas paid $46,000 by Nam Hoi.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> In addition the defendant also called one Captain John Herring, a retired master mariner who turned to the business of quality andquantity surveying and loss adjusting from 1955 to 1976 in Singapore. His evidence is that Nutmeg Oil is obtained by the simple processof boiling the kernal and the maze of the fruit of nutmeg. However, only 1% of oil can be so obtained from the raw material viz;one pound of nutmeg oil can be obtained from 100 pounds of nutmeg kernal or maze. Only three nutmeg trees were found in Penang andone in Singapore. The total production was one to two tons per year in this area. He said that it was a home industry. There wereonly two dealers in Penang and three in Singapore. He never heard of the company by the name of Central Asia Investment Co. He hadbeen instructed by buyers and bankers before to survey nutmeg oil purchased in the area for shipment abroad. His practice was togo through an intricate process of lab-test, issuing certificates with marked samples for the buyers and the bankers. He would takethe samples from the containers immediately prior to shipment and would go to the extent of accompanying the cargo alongside theship and supervise the loading. He said that export of nutmeg oil consignment required survey report, analysis report and exportdeclaration. He further said that the nutmeg oil could mix easily with a variety of other oils. A mixture of this sort with a verysmall percentage of nutmeg oil would still give a very strong spicy smell. In his 25 years of experience as a surveyor the largestconsignment he ever heard of was between five to nine 44 gallon drums. He never heard of 32 tons in a 160 drums being exported inone consignment In cross-examination Captain Herring admitted that analysis or examination of nutmeg oil form a very small part ofhis experience in survey of goods and that nutmeg oil could also be purchased in Indonesia in much bigger quantity, He further admittedthat the yield of oil from Indonesian nutmegs were as high as 13%. He handled exports of nutmeg oil from Singapore only. He neverhandled nutmeg oil exported from Indonesia and transhipped at Singapore or nutmeg oil imported into Singapore for re-export to otherplaces.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Finally, the defence witness John Terrance Hung testified that when the goods were taken to the defendant's godown for storage theirfull value was never declared by the plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The statements of Chan Kung Wo in Items 14 and 15 of the Hearsay Notice as corroborated by the evidence given by Lau Kar Wing, ChowSun Yau and Kwan Chun Leung certainly indicated that the goods were lost or stolen as a result of a conspiracy between one Chan LipGiong and S.K. Lee. They also indicated that Soekarno and his brother Soekartono and Yiu Wing Nin were bribed so that Soekarno andYiu Wing Nin abused their authorities as officers of the plaintiff's so as to give the Nam Hoi credit facilities without taking careto ensure any adequate security for the plaintiff. The so-called re-sale by the Nam Hoi to the Yanyang Co. Ltd. might even be a fictitioussale. This of course could be part and parcel of conspiracy between Chan Lip Giong and S.K. Lee. Taking the evidence in their totality,including that of Captain Herring which I shall examine later, the position is equally consistent with the goods being genuine nutmegoil or not, There is no allegation that the plaintiff was implicated in this plot. No fraud has been alleged against anybody in thiscase-not in the pleadings at least. Thus the question of fraud is irrelevant (See Wallingford v. Mutual Society in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281880%29%205%20AC%20685" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1880) 5 A.C. 685</a> at page 701) except for the point that the fraud of Chan Lip Giong and S.K. Lee and the third parties, might be relevant to the questionwhether the goods were in fact nutmeg oil. But I find that a fraud practiced by third parties in the present case would not indicatenecessarily that the goods were not nutmeg oil. As it was the whole lot of the goods had been lost, whether the goods were of genuinenutmeg oil and to the value as claimed in the plaintiff's Statement of Claim is of little significance. The conspirators could havedisposed of genuine nutmeg oil since the price quoted for them was no more than the market price. If the goods were not genuine therewould be no need for the conspirators to take delivery from the defendant's godown so as to risk the chance of being found out bythe Preventive Service and the uncertainty of litigation. There was no suggestion that the conspirators chose a particular victim.I presume that as far as conspirators were concerned they would not care whether the victim should be the plaintiff or the defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The significance of Captain Herring's evidence is that such a large consignment of 32 tons of nutmeg oil in 160 drums from Singaporeto Hong Kong was quite improbable if not impossible. However, he frankly admitted that he had very little experience as to the quantityof nutmeg oil produced in Indonesia and that he had never been asked to survey import of nutmeg oil into Singapore. He said in re-examinationthat on transhipment of nutmeg oil at Singapore the bill of lading would still show the original port of export namely Indonesiahad the oil come from Indonesia. But he also admitted that there could be exceptions, Again in cross-examination he agreed that therewas a period of confrontation between Singapore and Indonesia in 1968. It is not difficult to imagine that there could be a suspensionof trade between these two countries and that the ingenuity of merchants could arrange for re-export or re-sale of original Indonesianproducts as exports from Singapore. Captain Herring admitted that he obtained most of his technical knowledge about nutmeg oil fromthe Encyclopaedia Britannica which published that exports from Indonesia in 1968 including nutmegs amounted to 31,467 metric tonsthough he doubted the Indonesian statistics. In view of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that Captain Herring's evidence is notsufficient to show that the cargo could not have been genuine nutmeg oil from Indonesia via Singapore.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Taking the evidence generally I am inclined, on balance of probability, that the goods were genuine nutmeg oil to the value as statedin the relevant documents produced. It is well to say that none of the documentary evidence could be of much value for the authorof such documents had no direct knowledge as to the nature of the goods. On the other hand, as I have said, there were at least twopropositions to counter this argument, First of all, if the goods were not genuine nutmeg oil there was no need for the conspiratorsto take delivery from the defendant so as to risk the chance of detection by the Preventive Service of the Department of Commerce&amp; Industry. Even if the conspirators were able to choose their victims of fraud namely the defendant they must be accreditedwith the knowledge of law and presumed to take the risk of uncertainty of litigation. Had the goods been water or substitutes itwould have been simpler to leave them with the defendant. One way or another the role played by Soekarno if he were one of the conspiratorswould be known to the proper authority, and there would be no way to protect him. Secondly, and in addition, the Loss was occasionedby a tort of conversion committed by the defendants. In the case of Coldman v. Hill (1919) 1 K.B.443 Sorutton L.J. quoting the caseof <u>Travers (Joseph) &amp; Sons</u> v. <u>Cooper</u> at (1915) 1 K.B.73 said at page 457 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Pickford J. held that the burden of proof was on the bailor to show that there was negligence which caused the loss, and that ashe left the matter in doubt, he failed, All the members of the Court of Appeal thought this was wrong. They took the view that itwas incumbent upon the defendant, the bailee, when the goods were lost, to prove that he had taken reasonable care to keep and preservethem."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Later he cited the unreported case of <u>Morison</u> v. <u>Walton</u> before the House of Lords and said at page 458 that:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="8%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="90%" class="quote">The House of Lords held that the man who had, by breaking his contract, destroyed the possibility of any evidence on the subject,could not be heard to say that there was no evidence that his breach of contract caused the loss. It was his duty as bailee to provethat his breach of duty did not cause the loss, not the plaintiff's duty to show that it did. This appears to be merely an applicationof the principle omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem, under which a man who having converted property, refuses to produce it thatits exact value may be known, is liable for the greatest value that such an article could have: Armory v. Delamirie; and HammersmithRy. Co. v. Brand.

It is contended that, forthis reason, the plaintiff is estopped from denying that Chan Kung Wo was the authorised person to take delivery of the goods. Insupport of this allegation the defendant relies on two statements by Chan Kung Wo served on the plaintiff under Hearsay Notices andmarked items 14 and 15. In paragraph 3 at page 4 of Item 14 which is to be found at document 107 of Vol.5 of the Bundle of Documentsbefore this Court. Chan Kung Wo said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"After Sokarno gave me the bill of lading of Kowloon Godowns in his room at the Indonesian Bank at about 2 p.m. on October 22nd Iat once went with Mr. Wong of Leung Yau Co. to Kowloon Godowns across the harbour On arrival at Kowloon Godowns I found that I hadto go to the Preventive Service Department to complete the formalities first. I then returned to Hong Kong and went to the PreventiveService Department on the Waterfront. An inspector, surnamed Ip, interviewed me and told me that I should bring along the invoicefor the batch of oil (meaning the 160 drums of oil) from Singapore and the package bills. As it was about 4.30 p.m. it was too lateto get them from the Indonesian Bank, and I returned to my company. As the bank had closed I had to wait until the next day October23rd. At about 10 a.m. some friends came to the company to visit me. I asked them to assist me in writing out a chit in Chinese becausemy friend also do not understand English. The chit was written to Iu Wing Nin. As far as I can remember its contents read like this:'Please give the bearer the invoice and the package bills for the 160 drums of nutmeg oil because the Preventive Service of D.C. &amp;I wants to examine them before the oil can be taken delivery of and removed. To O/C Iu. Signed by me.' This was written on a memoform of Nam Hoi Co. As it was a chit I did not keep a copy of it, This letter was delivered to O./C. Iu at the Indonesian Bank byFung Tak Kwong who was an employee of my company O/C Iu gave Fung Tak-kwong an invoice and a package bill for him to take back toNam Hoi Co. and give to me. For proof these two bills should be together with the BL.

In this statement Soekarno said to the Police as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I have been shown a Delivery Order, by Inspector Strachan, dated the 22nd October 1968. It was never given to me by Mr. Chan KungWo. I first saw a photostat copy of this Delivery Order when Mr. Bokhary of Kowloon Godowns came to see me on the 20th of Novemberin the afternoon. I have closely examined the signature on the reverse side of this Delivery Order and it is not one, which is usedby this Bank to endorse any Delivery Order. The chop is similar to one used by the Bank. However, in the word "BRANCH", the 'C' lookslike a 'G'. I therefore believe that the signature in question is a forgery."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> I view all these statements with certain reservations. They were made after the goods were lost. Both Chan Kung Wo and Soekarno hadan interest to exculpate themselves and blamed the other people. This is particularly true of Chan Kung Wo who then had to face twocriminal charges at the time when the statements were made. He said that he knew no English and a very little written Chinese, Heclaimed that the documents were typed for his signature. Yet from his statement it appears to me that he knew the contents and thegeneral purport of every document he signed. Despite the nolle prosequi entered in his favour I am of the opinion that he knew farmore than he admitted he did and that he exaggerated in certain aspects as to the culpability of Soekarno and as to himself beingan innocent agent. He might be uneducated but he was certainly not a fool. The office boy Fung Tak Kwong was not called to give evidence.Anyway his statements were not available. In the face of these contradictory statements I find, on probability, that Soekarno mighthave given Chan Kung Wo the bill of lading in order to obtain the Delivery Order for the goods and that Iu Wing Nin gave Chan theweight note and the packing lists and invoices. However, I do not find that Soekarno instructed Chan to take delivery. This is apparentin the document in the form of a letter signed by Chan Kung Wo for and on behalf of Nam Hoi to Bank Negara Indonesia which is recordedin Document 116 of Vol.2 of the bundle of document which reads:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">We are informed by the shipping company that s/s 'Var' has arrived Hong Kong and that the goods have been discharged to the warehouse.</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">In this connection, we shall be obliged if you will arrange to have the goods stored with Companion Godown Co., Ltd.

Thus the place of storage to start with was not in Shaukiwan but with the Companion Godowns Co.Ltd. Even if I were to take that Soekarno intended that Chan Kung Wo should take delivery of the goods on behalf of the plaintiffthen the stamp and the endorsement on the Delivery Order should be the proper stamp of the plaintiff and the genuine signature ofSoekarno. Fraud apart, there was no reason to give the Delivery Order to Chan Kung Wo with a forged endorsement. Yet fraud has notbeen pleaded in the present case. The question then is whether the plaintiff by leaving the Delivery Order in Chan's hand for a longtime may be regarded as having misrepresented to the defendant that Chan Kung Wo had authority to take delivery. On this point, however,I observed that the mandate of the Delivery Order was to deliver the goods to the order of the plaintiff. The plaintiff never endorsedthe Delivery Order. Further, the counter-clerk of the defendant never compared the purported endorsement with the authorised listof signatures in possession of the defendant. As such there was no representation to the defendant who never acted upon any authorisation.This is not a proper case that the plaintiff should be estopped from alleging that the endorsement was a forgery. Nor do I find thatthe plaintiff should be estopped from pursuing their claim against the defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Even if my assessment of Soekarno's evidence is wrong in saying that Soekarno was not one of the co-conspirators, the defendant couldhardly escape liability in this issue for its failure to compare the signatures on the endorsement. No argument had been advancedthat the plaintiff could be bound by the criminal act of its servants. Nor do I hold that the plaintiff is so bound. For this reasonon the second issue the defendant must fail.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The third issue depends very much on whether the plaintiff is bound by the Conditions of Business. In this connection I find thatthe plaintiff and the defendant had long dealings over the years. As early as 1963 the Conditions of Business governing the termsof storage were made known to the plaintiff. The relevant clauses in the Conditions of Business are as follows:</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Clause 3 of the Conditions of Business reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Weight, Measurement and Ad Valorem Rates -</p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">The Scale of Rates and Charges is applicable to pieces and packages, not exceeding one ton in weight, except where otherwise stated,or under 40 feet in length.

It is contended by the plaintiff that because of a fundamental breach of contract or a breach of the fundamental termsin the contract the defendants were not entitled to rely on these exclusions or limitation clauses for their protection. In thisconnection a long list of authorities has been cited in support of the plaintiff's as well as the defendant's contentions. The propositionthat where there has been a fundamental breach or breach of a fundamental term the guilty party cannot successfully rely on the provisionsin the contract signed for their protection in the performance of the contract is well supported by the high authorities. In thecase of <u>Suisse Atlantique Societe D'armement Maritime S.A.</u> v. <u>N.V. Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale</u> (1967)A.C.361 Viscount Dilhorne said at page 393 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "I think that the legal position was most clearly and accurately stated by Pearson L.J. in U.G.S. Finance Ltd. He said:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          'As to the question of 'fundamental breach', I think there is a rule of construction that normally an exception or exclusionclause or similar provision in a contract should be construed as not applying to a situation created by a fundamental breach of contract.This is not an independent rule of law imposed by the court on the parties willy-nilly in disregard of their contractual intention.On the contrary it is a rule of construction based on the presumed intention of the contracting parties. It involves the implicationof a term to give to the contract that business efficacy which the parties as reasonable men must have intended it to have. Thisrule of construction is not new in principle but it has become prominent in recent years in consequence of the tendency to have standardforms of contract containing exceptions clauses drawn in extravagantly wide terms, which would produce absurd results if appliedliterally.'</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          Although the terms are sometimes used as if their meaning was the same, a fundamental breach differs from a breach of afundamental term. In Smeaton Hanscemb v. Sassoon I. Setty, Son &amp; Co. (No.1), Devlin J. said that he thought a fundamental termwas 'something which underlies the whole contract so that, if it is not complied with the performance becomes something totally differentfrom that which the contract contemplates."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Having examined a series of the cases of carriage by sea in reference to this subject matter Lord Upjohn at page 424 of the samecase said as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "The warehouse cases and cases of carriage by land have developed on parallel lines.

Doubleday is the best illustration, that if you undertake to do a thingin a certain way, or to keep a thing in a certain place, with certain conditions protecting it, and have broken the contract by notdoing the thing contracted for in the way contracted for, or not keeping the article in the place in which you have contracted tokeep it, you cannot rely on the conditions which were only intended to protect you if you carried out the contract in the way inwhich you had contracted to do it."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Then at page 425 he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "If I am right in drawing this conclusion then the necessary result, in my opinion, is that the principle upon which oneparty to a contract cannot rely on the clauses of exception or limitation of liability inserted for his sole protection, is not becausethey are regarded as subject to any special rule of law applicable to such clauses as being in general opposed to the policy of thelaw or for some other reason but, just as in the deviation cases, it is the consequence of the application of the ordinary rulesapplicable to all contracts, that if there is a fundamental breach accepted by the innocent party the contract is at an end; theguilty party cannot rely on any special terms in the contract. If not so accepted the clauses of exception or limitation remain inforce like all the other clauses of the contract."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> And finally at page 427 Lord Upjohn said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "But where there is a breach of a fundamental term the law has taken an even firmer line for there is a strong, though rebuttable,presumption that in inserting a clause of exclusion or limitation in their contract the parties are not contemplating breaches offundamental terms and such clauses do not apply to relieve a party from the consequences of such a breach even where the contractcontinues in force. This result has been achieved by a robust use of a well-known canon of construction, that wide words which takenin isolation would bear one meaning must be so construed as to give business efficacy to the contract and the presumed intentionof the parties, upon the footing that both parties are intending to carry out the contract fundamentally."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> Other authorities have been cited by learned counsel for both parties. Some of them are of assistance to illustrate the principleof law concerning fundamental breach or breach of a fundamental term. I shall refer to some of them. Great reliance is placed bylearned counsel for the defendant on the case of <u>The China State Bank, Ltd.</u> v. <u>The Dairy Farm, Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co. Ltd.</u> in (1967) H.K.L.R. page 95 the facts of which were somewhat similar to the present case. The difference is that in the China StateBank case deliveries were made by means of warehouse warrants. No endorsement was required of the China State Bank of by the defendantin that case and therefore there was no signature to be compared. The learned trial judge, on the evidence, came to the conclusionthat loss was due to dishonesty or negligence but he said at page 106:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">          "However, there is no evidence of this at all before me.

In the case of <u>Alderslade</u> v. <u>Hendon Lanundry, Ltd.</u> in (1945) 1 K.B.189 the essence of the contract was one of laundering handkerchiefs. The exercise of due care relating to the safecustody and to redelivery were held to be ancillary obligations. Again there was no question of any fundamental breach. Lord Greenssaid at page 194:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "In the present case all that we know about the goods is that they are lost. There seems to me to be no case of lost goodsin respect of which it would be necessary to limit liability, unless it be a case where the goods are lost by negligence. Goods sentto the laundry will not be lost in the act of washing them. On the other hand, they may be lost while they are in the custody ofthe defendants before washing or after washing has been completed. They may be lost in the process of returning them to the customerafter they have been washed, but in each of those two cases, if my view is right, the obligation of the defendants is an obligationto take reasonable care and nothing else. Therefore, the claim of a customer that the defendants are liable to him in respect ofarticles that have been lost must, I think depend on the issue of due care on their part. If that be right, to construe this clause,so far as it relates to loss, in such a way as to exclude loss occasioned by lack of proper care, would be to leave the clause sofar as loss is concerned I say nothing about damage without any content at all. The result is in my opinion is that the clause mustbe construed as applying to" the case of loss through negligence."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The duty of a bailee is candidly put by Lord Denning in <u>Spurling Ltd.</u> v. <u>Bradshaw</u> in (1956) 1 W.L.R. page 461 where he said at page 456:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "The essence of the contract by a warehouseman is that he will store the goods in the contractual place and deliver themon demand to the bailor or his order. If he stores them in a different place, or if he consumes or destroys them instead of storingthem, or if he sells them, or delivers them without excuse to somebody else, he is guilty of a breach which goes to the root or thecontract and he cannot rely on the exempting clause. But if he should happen to damage them by some momentary piece of inadvertence,then he is able to rely on the exempting clause: because negligence by itself, without more, is not a breach which goes to the rootof the contract (see Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd. v. France Fenwick Tyne and Wear Co. Ltd., The Albion), any more thannon-payment by itself is such a breach: see Mersey Steel &amp; Iron Co. v. Naylor, Benzon &amp; Co. I would not like to say, however,that negligence can never go to the root of the contract. If a warehouseman were to handle the goods so roughly as to warrant theinference that he was reckless and indifferent to their safety, he would, I think, be guilty of a breach going to the root of thecontract and could not rely on the exempting clause. He cannot be allowed to escape from his obligation by saying to himself: 'Iam not going to trouble about these goods because I am covered by an exempting clause."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The decision in the case of <u>Karl Widenman</u> v. <u>Banque De L'Indochine</u> in (1974) H.K.L.R.97 was one of mine. It was not contended in that case that the defendants or their sub-agents diverted from thecontract or committed a breach in a radical aspect. It was founded on negligence which I found proved but that such negligence wasalso covered by the exempting clause. I said at page 109:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "The principle, as I can gather from these authorities, is that where the words in an exemption is so wide as to be capableof exempting from all liabilities they will be construed as exempting liabilities for causes other than those for negligence unlessthey refer, expressly or by implication, to acts for negligence, Further, in aid of the construction of an exemption clause, it isnecessary to consider the nature of the contract and the parties thereto. The words in the exemption clause in this case are:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          'You shall not be responsible for any act, omission, default, suspension, insolvency or bankruptcy of any such correspondent,agent or sub-agent.'</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">While the wards 'act or default' may be interpreted , as wilful or deliberate act of non-feasance the word 'omission' clearly refersto and includes acts of negligence.

This case again is of no assistance.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> The case of <u>Kenyon Son &amp; Craven</u> v. <u>Baxter, Hoare &amp; Co.</u> in (1971) 1 L1.L.R.232 only serves to reiterate the principle laid down in the Suisse Atlantique case where Mr. Justice Donaldsonsaid at page 242:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "As I understand Suisse Atlantique it is only in cases in which the performance is non-contractual in the sense that itis totally different from that which the contract contemplated, that one can ignore the construction of the exception clause or treatit as inapplicable notwithstanding that, as a matter of construction, it covers the loss which, has occurred If, of course, the innocentparty affirms the contract with knowledge of the breach, or is deemed to have done so by reason of a failure to disaffirm, the performanceis taken out of that class and becomes a contractual, albeit wrongful, performance to which the exception clauses apply or do notapply as a matter of construction. In all other cases it is a problem of construction whether the exception clauses apply to thebreach which has occurred and whether the breach, viewed in the light of all the terms of the contract, is or is not one which givesthe innocent party a right to treat the contract, as not being binding upon him after the breach. If the innocent party can and doestreat the contract as no longer binding upon him, the exception clauses obviously cannot protect the wrongdoer thereafter."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> The learned judge found in that case that the defendant had not deviated from the performance of the contract, and that the defendant'snegligence did riot amount to wilful neglect or breach of a fundamental term. For this reason it was held that, the limitation clauseswere applicable.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> The two decisions in the cases of <u>Woolmer</u> v. <u>Delmer Price Ltd.</u> in (1955) 1 Q.B.291 and <u>Levison</u> v. <u>Patent Gar pet Cleaning (C.A.) i</u>n (1977) 3 W.L.R.91 in which the defendants were held not entitled to rely on the limitation clauses seemed to rest on the burdenof proof. In both cases the defendants failed to show cause how the loss occurred. As such it was held that the clauses to the effectthat all merchandise were accepted at the owner's risk, on true constructions, were not wide enough to protect the bailee.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> The case of <u>Harbutt's Plasticine Ltd.</u> v. <u>Wayne Tank And Pump Co. Ltd.</u> (1970) 2 W.L.R.198 is the authority for the proposition that to determine whether a fundamental breach of contract occurred it isnot only the breach itself which counts but the event resulting from the breach must also be taken into consideration. Thus at page211 Denning M.R. said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "The one question in this case is, therefore: Were the defendants guilty of a fundamental breach which, brought the contractto an end? for, if so, they cannot rely on the limitation clause. It was suggested that, in order to determine whether a breach isfundamental or not, you must look at the quality of it, and not at the results, I do not accept this suggestion. It is not the breachitself which counts so much, but the event resulting from it. A serious breach may have slight consequences. A trivial breach graveones. Take this very case. The specification of durapipe was, no doubt, a serious breach; but it would not have done much harm ifit had been discovered in time and replaced by stainless steel. In that event the plasticine company could not repudiate the contractor treat it as at an end. But id did, in fact, do great harm because of the consequences. The results were so grave as to bring thecontract to an end. You must, therefore, look not only at the breach but also at the results of it."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Lord Justice Widgery as he then was, having applied Lord Justice Diplock's analysis in the case of <u>Hongkong Fir Shipping Co. Ltd.</u> v. <u>Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd.</u> in (1962) 2 Q.B.26, said at page 216 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "Now, adopting this analysis, it follows that the first step is to see whether an 'event' has occurred which has deprivedthe plaintiffs, of substantially the whole benefit which they were to obtain under the contract. The fire was such an event becausenot only did it destroy the equipment installed by the defendants, but it also destroyed the factory, thus making replacement impracticable.The fire was caused by the defendants' breach of contract and the plaintiffs say that the contract is at an end on this account.It appears to follow from Diplock L.J.'s reasoning that if the event which occurs as a result of the defendants' breach is an eventwhich would have frustrated the contract had it occurred without the fault of either party, then the breach is a fundamental breachfor present purposes. In the present case the plaintiffs must be treated as having accepted the breach as a repudiation of the contract,since they had no alternative but to do so. In my judgment, therefore, the defendants are not entitled to rely on the limit of liabilityin clause 15."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> The same proposition finds support in the judgment of Lord Justice Stephenson in <u>Wathes</u> v. <u>Austins</u> (1976) Vol. L1. Law Report 15 at page 23 he said:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="8%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="90%" class="quote">          "The appellants contend that on that finding of fact the Judge was wrong in law in holding that the respondents were infundamental breach of the agreement.</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="2%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="8%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="90%" class="quote">          I would agree with that if that were all the Judge decided or the respondents contended before him. But the Judge addedthe cryptic sentence which suggests that the appellants could rely oh the limitation clause if they abated the nuisance, and we aretold that the respondents were allowed without amendment to argue their counterclaim on the alternative basis that if the term wasnot fundamental the breach was. I agree, therefore, that we have to consider whether the serious potential consequences of the noisemade it a fundamental breach of contract. That involves a consideration of the steps taken to abate it, how long they took, how cheaplyor easily it could be done so that the machine could be used not only efficiently but without infringing the legal rights of others.For there can be no material distinction between the physical impossibility of performing a contract at all and the legal impossibilityof performing it lawfully. The consequences of each may be equally serious. A breach of contract will be fundamental if its consequencesamount to impossibility of performance in either sense. But if the breach can be remedied those consequences can be averted and itmay no be fundamental."</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="2%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> If I understand these authorities correctly the position appears to be that whenever loss is alleged to have been caused by a fundamentalbreach or breach of a fundamental term the first step is to construe the contract to find put the essence of it. "The next step isto find out the nature of the breach namely how the loss was caused, If the nature of the breach takes the form of deviation fromthe performance of the contract there is a fundamental breach and that is the end of the contract. None of the protective or limitationor exclusion clauses in the contract can exempt the party in breach from liability. If the nature of the breach is not in deviationbut only a breach of a term, however fundamental, one must then look at the contract as a whole and find out whether the limitation,protective or exclusion clauses are wide enough to exempt the guilty party from liability. In this connection, the burden is alwayson the party in breach to account for how the loss was caused so that it can be ascertained, whether the limitation clauses willbe wide enough to exempt the guilty party. Further, in deciding, whether the breach is fundamental regard must be had not only tothe nature of the act in breach but also to its consequences. If the loss occasioned by the breach of a fundamental term of the contractis such as to render further performance of the contract utterly impossible then the contract is again at an end. No protective clausecan apply to protect the party in breach.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> In the present case the goods were accepted by the defendant for storage to be redelivered to the order of the plaintiff.

The forgery on the back of theDelivery Order was such a bad one that even a casual comparison would have revealed it, The signature was so different from the listof signatures supplied and even on the bankchop there was a misspelling of the word 'Branch'. A forged endorsement is the same asno endorsement. To release the goods without endorsement is a deviation from the performance of contract. Further and in the alternative,as a result of the defendant's breach, of a fundamental term to compare the signatures the goods were completely lost and a furtherperformance of the contract was rendered utterly impossible.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> Finally, in a similar case of <u>Burwill Trading Ltd.</u> v. <u>The Hongkong and Kowloon Wharf and Godown Co.

I findin the present case that the defendants had committed a breach of a fundamental term of the contract by failing to compare the signatures.As a result of this breach there was a total loss. As such, further performance of the contract was utterly impossible. For thisreason, none of the limitation clauses 21or 42 of the Conditions of Business can be relied upon by the defendant for its protection.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> In summary, I find as a fact that the goods were 32 tons of genuine nutmeg oil contain in 160 steel drums. Alternatively, for reasonsgiven, they must be presumed to be genuine nutmeg oil. I also find that the plaintiff never authorised Chan Kung Wo to take deliveryof the goods in the circumstances as alleged by the defendant nor can the plaintiff be estopped from claiming against the defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> Thirdly, I find that there had been a breach on the part of the defendant of a fundamental term of the contract of bailment. As aresult of that further performance of the contract is impossible. For this reason the defendant is not entitled to rely on the limitationand exclusion clauses of the contract. Accordingly judgment must be entered in favour of the plaintiff for the amount claimed withcosts.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">H.
