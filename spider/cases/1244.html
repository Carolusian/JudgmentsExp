class="heading"><b><u>The action</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a> The plaintiffs in these two consolidated actions sued the defendant for damages for breach of contract.  The plaintiffs claimed tobe buyers of selenium metal powder (âthe goodsâ) of which the defendant was the seller.  The defendant had failed to deliverthe goods to the plaintiffs. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The defendant consisted of two partners trading under the name of Concord Enterprises (âConcordâ).  They denied that Concordwas the seller of the goods.  They claimed that the goods were to be sold by a company in Germany namely, Concret Orgachem GMBH ChemischeProdukte (âCOâ).  They claimed Concord was an agent of CO.  Further they claimed that the plaintiffs had repudiated their contractsby failing to provide the necessary letter of credit within time.  Concord lodged a counterclaim for damages for breach of contractby the plaintiffs. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The case was heard by Deputy High Court Judge To.  He found for the plaintiffs and awarded them damages.  He dismissed the defendantâscounterclaim.  The defendant now appeals against the decision. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>The facts</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The relevant facts of this case are as follows :</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Mr. Nelson Ho (âNelsonâ) was the general manager of China Rare Metal Industries Inc. (âChina Rareâ) in China and the generalmanager of Leva International Trading Company (âLevaâ) in Hong Kong.  In July 2003 he enquired with the defendant whether Concordwas able to provide the goods. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The defendant enquired with its supplier CO in Germany for the price of the goods.  On 22 July 2003 the defendant obtained an offerfrom CO to sell the goods at Euro 12.40 per kg inclusive of 2% commission for the defendant. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> On 28 July 2003 Nelson made a bid on behalf of China Rare for 20 metric tons of the goods at US$14.50 per kg. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Eventually the defendant managed to ask CO to sell the goods at Euro 12.40 per kg.  However at the same time it also informed Nelsonthat the price of the goods was Euro 12.60 per kg.  By then the defendant was aware that the buyer of the goods would be Leva. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> On 31 July 2003 CO issued a document entitled Confirmation COR 729/03 to the defendant for the sale of 20 metric tons of the goodsat Euro 12.40 per kg C&amp;F Nan Gang, Nan Hai via Hong Kong. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> By a fax dated 2 August 2003 Leva wrote to the defendant the following :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">â This is to confirm our purchased of 20 Mt Se 99.9%, 325 mesh, at Euro 12.6/kg C&amp;F Nan Gang, Nan Hai, Guangdong, China.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">Please prepare a sales contract between Leva and Concret Orgachem so we can proceed LC application.

Please sign &amp; chop for sales confirmation at below.  Thank you.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The defendant countersigned on the fax by imposing its chop and signature and faxed it back to Leva on 2 August 2003. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> There was a dispute whether the defendant had provided Leva with a copy of the Confirmation COR 729/03 by CO.  The defendant claimedthat it had faxed the document to Nelson by a fax dated 2 August 2003.  In that fax the defendant asked Nelson to open a letter ofcredit at Euro 12.60 per kg C&amp;F.  Nelson denied that he had received from the defendant that fax or the Confirmation from CO. The judge accepted the evidence of Nelson and rejected the evidence of the defendant on this issue. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Later on 4 August 2003 Nelson requested the defendant to separate the 20 metric tons agreement into two contracts of 10 metric tonseach with Leva and another company namely, Bowlstar (Hong Kong) Limited (âBowlstarâ) as the buyers of the goods. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> On the same day the defendant faxed two sales confirmations, each for 10 metric tons of the goods, one with Leva and one with Bowlstarto Nelson.  These two documents bore the name of Concord in Chinese and English with details of its address and contact numbers atthe top of the page.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The sales confirmation to Leva stated that the price of the goods was Euro 12.60 per kg C&amp;F Nan Gang, Nan Hai via Hong Kong. The shipment date to Leva was September.  Payment was by way of the irrevocable letters of credit at sight in favour of CO.  Therewas a remark which stated that âAll refer Concret Orgachem Chemische Produkte Confirmation COR 729/03â.  The bottom of this salesconfirmation had the following words : âFor and on behalf of Concord Enterprisesâ followed by the chop of Concord together witha signature above the line with the words âAuthorised Signature(s)â below. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> In respect of the sales confirmation issued by the defendant to Bowlstar the contents were identical save that the shipment dateof September was changed to August. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Leva and Bowlstar eventually issued the letters of credit in favour of CO. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Subsequently CO requested the name of the beneficiaries to be changed from CO to Alfa Aesar Johnson Matthey (Deutschland). </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Neither CO nor Alfa Aesar delivered the goods to Leva or Bowlstar. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Issues in this appeal</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> We are not concerned in this appeal with whether Bowlstar had failed to open the letter of credit in favour of CO within time.  Thequestion of damages is also not an issue.  The main issue was whether the defendant was an agent for CO and hence was not liableto the plaintiffs for non delivery of the goods.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>The judgeâs finding</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The judge found that the defendant was not an agent but was a contracting party with the plaintiffs.  At paragraph 18 of the judgmentthe judge stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â18.  Continuing from where I had left, upon receipt of Nelsonâs fax dated 2 August 2003, Paul signed the fax, impressed it withthe chop of Concord Enterprises and fax it back to Nelson.  Pausing here at this stage, it would appear that Leva anticipated contractingwith Concret Orgachem through Concord Enterprises as agent.  Hence it requested for a contract between Leva and Concret Orgachem. Levaâs request to Concord Enterprises for signature and confirmation must be for Concord Enterprises to sign as agent of ConcretOrgachem.  But this finding is unnecessary as events took a turn from here.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Although the judge said he did not need to make the finding on this issue it is apparent from his judgment later on that he did makea finding on this particular issue and this can be seen from the following paragraphs of his judgment :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â38.   On my finding of fact, Nelson had been liaising with Paul of Concord Enterprises about the purchase of 20 metric tons ofselenium.  He had no knowledge that the ultimate supplier was Concret Orgachem until 2 August 2003 when Paul informed Nelson overthe telephone to issue a letter of credit in favour of Concret Orgachem.  It was in that setting that Nelson asked Paul to preparea sale contract between Leva and Concret Orgachem.  On these facts, there were two possibilities.  Firstly, it is open to infer thatNelson intended to trade with Concret Orgachem as principal through Concord Enterprises as its agent.  This inference would havebeen reinforced by Paulâs fax dated 2 August 2003 in which he informed Nelson that he had received a sales confirmation from itsprincipal.  But I have rejected this evidence from Paul.  The second possibility is that Concord Enterprises was trading as principalon its own right in a sub-sale from Concret Orgachem.  In a commercial transaction, there is nothing unusual for a sub-purchaserto pay the first seller.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">39.    However, the first possibility is excluded by two facts.  Firstly, Paul responded to Nelsonâs request to prepare a contractbetween Leva and Concret Orgachem by signing the sale confirmation for and on behalf of Concord Enterprises.  He never indicatedthat Concord Enterprises did so as agent of Concret Orgachem.  Secondly and more importantly, there is no dispute that Concord Enterpriseswas to make a profit of Euro 0.20 per kg out of the transaction in addition to the 2% commission it would receive from Concret Orgachem. Even though Concret Orgachem was aware of the profit as it agreed with Concord Enterprises to refund the price difference to ConcordEnterprises, the arrangement was more consistent with a sub-sale than with an agency agreement.  This contract did not materialiseas Nelson requested to split the contract into two, one with Leva and the other with Bowlstar on 4 August 2003.  That was the settingin which the subsequent contracts came into existence.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">40.    On 4 August 2003, Concord Enterprises issued two sales confirmations instead of arranging for them to be issued by ConcretOrgachem.  The parties stated on the sales confirmations were Leva and Concord Enterprises in one contract and Bowlstar and ConcordEnterprises in the other.  These sales confirmations were signed by Paul for and on behalf of Concord Enterprises.  The formula âforand on behalf ofâ is a well-known one indicating agency.  But the context in which this formula was used indicated that Paul wassigning as agent of Concord Enterprises and not as agent of Concret Orgachem.  There is a very strong presumption that if a contractis signed by an agent in his own name without qualification, he is deemed to have contracted personally: see <i>Transcontinental Underwriting Agencies SRL v Grand Union Insurance Co Ltd</i> [1987] 2 Lloydâs Rep 409.  This presumption would be displaced if contrary intention plainly appears from the other parts of thedocument: see <i>Concordia Chemische Fabrik auf</i> <i>A</i><i>ctien v Squire</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281876%29%2034%20LT%20824" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1876) 34 LT 824.</a>  The absence of any indication on the two sales confirmations that Concord Enterprises was acting for and on behalf of the ultimateseller or of Concret Orgachem must give rise to a very strong inference that it was entering into the contract in its own capacityas principal and not for and on behalf of another.  Thus on the face, these two sales confirmations are contracts in which ConcordEnterprises entered into as principal.  This is so despite the background that it was known to Nelson that Concret Orgachem was theultimate supplier of the selenium and despite that Concret Orgachem was named as the beneficiary of the letters of credit.  Furthermore,there is of course the very important inference that could be drawn from the profit which Concord Enterprises was to make.  The wholearrangement was, in my view, a sale between Concret Orgachem and Concord Enterprises and a sub-sale between the latter and Leva andBowlstar respectively.  In view of this conclusion, it is not necessary for me to consider the second issue.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>The actions taken by the defendant</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The evidence of the defendant was that after it had secured the agreement from CO and Nelson to sell and buy the goods at Euro 12.40per kg, it wrote to CO asking it to issue a sales confirmation for the goods at an inflated price of Euro 12.60 per kg and to refundthe defendant the difference of Euro 0.20 per kg plus a 2% commission.  However, CO only issued a sales confirmation at the priceof Euro 12.40.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> After receiving the signed confirmations from Leva and Bowlstar the defendant wrote to CO and requested CO to issue two separatesales confirmations, each for 10 metric tons to Leva and Bowlstar and quoting the price of Euro 12.60 per kg.  The defendant alsosent two commission agreements to CO for its execution, one for each of the sale.  The commission agreement provided for paymentby CO of 2% commission on the total invoice price and the refund of the price difference of Euro 0.20 per kg between the contractprice quoted in the sales confirmations with Leva and Bowlstar and the price as agreed between CO and the defendant.  CO did notrespond or sign the commission agreement. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> In the appeal bundle there were two documents disclosed by the defendant.  They were two confirmations issued by CO to the defendant. The first was confirmation COR 729/03/1 in which the customer was stated to be Bowlstar.  The second was confirmation COR 729/03/2in which the customer was stated to be Leva.  The terms of the confirmation were identical namely, 10 metric tons of the goods atEuro 12.60 per kg C&amp;F Nan Gang, Nan Hai via Hong Kong.  Both confirmations were dated 4 August 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> While the judge in his judgment did not deal with these two confirmations, at the same time, there was no allegation from the defendantthat it had supplied Leva and Bowlstar with copies of these two confirmations from CO.  There was also no explanation from the defendantwhy it did not do so. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>The request for contract</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Mr. Alfred Chan, counsel for the defendant, argued that when Leva on 2 August 2003 asked for a sales contract between Leva and COthis showed that Leva had intended to contract with CO and not with the defendant. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> In my view this request was obviously a relevant factor to be considered in deciding who were the contracting parties.  However thiscannot be the only evidence to be considered.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Non disclosure of Confirmation</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> In this case despite the fact that the defendant had received Confirmation COR 729/03 from CO agreeing to supply 20 metric tons ofthe goods at Euro 12.40 per kg, it had not disclosed this confirmation to Leva.  The judge rejected the defendantâs evidence thatit had by a fax dated 2 August 2003 supplied this confirmation to Leva. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The defendant might well have a motive in not disclosing this confirmation to Leva because of the price difference.  Nelson had statedin evidence that if he was aware of this confirmation he could have dealt with directly with CO instead.  The judge found Nelsonto be a truthful witness.  This is a finding of fact which the judge was entitled to make.  I would have thought that at the veryleast if Nelson had indeed received this confirmation he would have raised with the defendant about the difference in price.  Itwould be most odd for a buyer not to be concerned with an apparent price difference or to raise it if he knew that the price quotedby the supplier was less than the price that he was asked to pay in the first place.  By not disclosing this confirmation to Nelsonand by signing on the fax of 2 August 2003 from Leva the judge was entitled to conclude, in the light of this and other evidencein this case, that the defendant was the contracting party. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>The two sales confirmations</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> The subsequent two sales confirmations signed by the defendant clearly reinforced the plaintiffsâ case that the defendant was acontracting party. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Mr. Alfred Chan argued that it was wrong to rely on these two sales confirmations because they were merely a continuation of theoriginal arrangement in which the defendant was merely acting as an agent for CO. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> I disagree.  In these two sales confirmations the defendant did not express any qualification that it was merely acting in the capacityas an agent for and on behalf of CO. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Further the silence of the defendant on its case concerning Confirmation COR 729/3/1 and Confirmation COR 729/3/2 to Leva and Bowlstarfrom CO further damaged its case that it was merely acting as an agent for CO.  It would have made commercial sense to provide theplaintiffs with these documents if the defendant was only an agent for CO.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Stanley Yeung Kai Yung</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The judge also relied on the case of <i>Stanley</i> <i>Yeung Kai Yung and another v. The</i> <i>Hong Kong</i> <i>and</i> <i>Shanghai Banking Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20AC%20787" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] AC 787.</a>  In that case the plaintiff was a shareholder of the defendant.  His shares were stolen from him without his knowledge.  A firm ofstockbrokers was instructed to present share transfer deeds with the stolen share certificates to have the transfers registered toone Mr. Wong.  The signature of the plaintiff was forged in the share transfer deeds.  The defendant registered the transfer to Mr.Wong.  Mr. Wong then sold the shares.  The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for his name to be restored to the register. The defendant brought third party proceedings against the stockbrokers for indemnity.  The stockbrokers argued that it was merelyacting as a âconduit pipeâ for Mr. Wong and they were not the true requester but rather Mr. Wong.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Lord Scarman delivering the judgment of the Privy Council rejected this argument.  He held that the request by the stockbrokers tothe defendant was the request of the stockbrokers notwithstanding the fact that the request was written on behalf of Mr. Wong.  Heheld that the stockbrokers made the request to the defendant and</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âthe fact that the request, by the law of agency, was also Mr. Wongâs request in the sense that it was made with his authoritydoes not necessarily prevent it from being a request made by the brokers (i.e. âthe plaintiffâ).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> He further held that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIt is not the law that, if a principal is liable, his agent cannot be.  The true principle of the law is that a person is liablefor his engagements (as for his torts) even though he is acting for another, unless he can show that by the law of agency he is tobe held to have expressly or impliedly negatived his personal liability.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> In my view the judge had correctly applied the statement of law by Lord Scarman.  In this case when the defendant signed the twosales confirmations in favour of the plaintiffs, it did not in any way qualify itself as merely acting as an agent for CO.  On theface of it the sales confirmations were documents confirming that the defendant would supply the goods to the plaintiffs personally. The defendant certainly had not expressed any qualification which might negative their personal liability. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Other matter</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Mr. Chan also attempted to challenge the finding of fact by the judge on whether the defendant had supplied COâs confirmation toLeva.  In my view the judge was clearly entitled to reach a finding that it had not done so.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>C</u></b><b><u>onclusion</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> In my view the judge was correct in his judgment.
