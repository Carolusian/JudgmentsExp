INTRODUCTION</p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  ECT Delta Terminal applies to set aside an Interlocutory Judgment for liability with damages to be assessed.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The Judgment was made in the Plaintiffsâ favour against ECT on 19 November 2009.  The Judgment was entered in default of ECT givingnotice to defend despite service of the Writ on ECT in the Netherlands.  ECT contends that the Judgment should be set aside becauseservice was irregular or because ECT has a defence with a real prospect of success on the question of liability.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  As a separate matter, ECT applies for a stay to arbitration of all outstanding issues (whether as to liability or quantum) betweenitself and the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p class="heading">II.  BACKGROUND</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  On 9 August 2007 the Plaintiffs consigned 11 containers (including Container HLXU 506006-7) to Transpac (operating as Blue AnchorLine) for carriage from Shanghai to Tilburg via Rotterdam.  The contract of carriage is evidenced by an Express Cargo Bill of Lading(ECB).  The containers were stuffed with Sony Play Stations.  I shall refer to Container HLXU 506006-7 as Container X.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Transpac sub-contracted the sea carriage of the goods from Shanghai to Rotterdam to Hapag-Lloyd.  The containers having arrivedin Rotterdam on 3 September 2007, they were stored at ECTâs terminal there pending customs clearance.  Such storage with ECT waseffected by Hapag-Lloyd pursuant to a pre-existing Terminal Contract between (among other lines) Hapag-Lloyd and ECT.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In the meantime, Transpacâs Rotterdam agents (various Kuehne &amp; Nagel companies) cleared the consignment through customs andobtained the requisite customs clearance document (known as âthe Sagittaâ).  The agents also arranged for the containers to becarried from Rotterdam to Tilburg by barge through inland waterways.  As a result, the containers (including Container X) becameregistered in ECTâs barge system.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On 5 September 2007 Nico (Gierrosâ truck driver) arrived at ECTâs Rotterdam terminal, presented a copy of the Sagitta, gavethe release number for Container X, and asked for Container X to be released to him for on-carriage by truck.  Gierros had obtainedthe copy of the Sagitta from (and had been instructed to collect Container X from ECT by) unknown criminals claiming to act for anon-existent company (i-Tronics).</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The ECT employee handling Nicoâs request was a trainee named Jimmy Timmas.  When Jimmy attempted to comply with Nicoâs request,he discovered that Container X was registered for delivery via ECTâs barge system and not ECTâs trucking system.  At that stage,ECTâs internal procedures required Jimmy to check with others whether Container X had in fact been re-routed from the barge tothe trucking system.  However, Jimmy did not carry out any checks.  Instead, he re-routed Container X to the trucking system himself. He then issued Nico with the data card needed to obtain release of Container X from ECTâs terminal.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Nico drove Container X to the persons who had instructed Gierros.  The latter unloaded Container X from Nicoâs lorry and disappearedwith the contents of Container X.  Container X was later found abandoned.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  By a Writ issued on 10 July 2008 the Plaintiffs claimed the value of the lost goods from the 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> Defendants.  On 4 September 2008 the Plaintiffs applied to amend the Writ to include the 6<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup> Defendants (including ECT) as parties to the action.  Stone J gave leave for the Writ to be amended on 5 September 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  On 1 October 2008 the Plaintiffs obtained leave to serve the Amended Writ on (among others) ECT and MTC Havenservice in the Netherlands.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  ECT was served with the Amended Writ and supporting documents on 22 May 2009.  This was done pursuant to Article 5 of the HagueConvention 1965.  Paragraph 4 of Article 5 allows a document to be served âby delivery to an addressee who accepts it voluntarilyâ.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In this case, ECT was served by courier delivery of the relevant packet of documents to ECTâs post department.  The packet wasaccepted by G. Kuipers, an employee working in ECTâs post department.  It appears that (through some mix-up) the packet includeda cover sheet which was addressed to MTC rather than ECT.  The cover sheet meant for ECT wrongly found its way into a similar packetsent to MTC.</p>    <p class="heading">III. DISCUSSION</p>    <p class="heading">A.  Alleged improper service</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mr. Russell Coleman SC (appearing for ECT) argues that service on ECT was improper and so should be set aside as of right.  Mr.Coleman submits that service was irregular because of the error in the cover sheet and because, Kuipers having accepted the packetfrom the courrier delivery person without any opportunity of examining the contents of the packet, Kuipers cannot be said to haveâvoluntarilyâ accepted service of the documents on ECTâs behalf.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In my view, service was regular and there is nothing in the improper service argument.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  First, the mistaken cover sheet was a trivial error.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  There could have been no doubt in ECTâs mind (once it looked through the documents) that it was being sued by the Plaintiffs inHong Kong in connection with the matters set out in the Amended Writ.  The cover sheet could not have misled ECT in any way.  ECTâsown evidence establishes that, having examined the documents, it was under no illusion as to what was happening.  On the contrary,ECT straightaway requested its lawyers (Schipper Noordam) to advise on what to do.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Second, Kuipers accepted the packet without complaint or protest.  He then forwarded it to the appropriate ECT person for consideration. On any view, Kuipers accepted delivery âvoluntarilyâ in the sense that he did what he did without coercion and of his own freewill or choice.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  I add (as Mr. Edward Alder (appearing for the Plaintiffs) notes) that there is nothing in the evidence adduced by ECT supportingMr. Colemanâs bare allegation that Kuipers had no opportunity to inspect the contents of the packet before acceptance.</p>    <p class="heading">B.  Alleged real prospect of success</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Mr. Coleman submits that the Plaintiffsâ suit against ECT is time-barred.  For this he relies on clause 3 of the ECB.  Clause3 provides that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe Carrier shall be discharged of all liability under this Document unless suit is brought within 9 months after:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i)  the delivery of the Goods or,</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(ii) the date when the Goods should have been delivered,</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">unless international Conventions of statutory regulations compulsorily applicable in the individual case are stipulating a longerterm of prescription.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Mr. Coleman argues that, although not a party to the ECB, ECT is entitled to rely on clause 3 by reason of clause 17(C) of the ECB. Clause 17(C) is a Himalaya clause which (Mr. Coleman says) extends the benefits of exemption and limitation clauses in the ECB (suchas clause 3) to sub-contractors and sub-sub-contractors of Transpac.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Clause 3 does not provide ECT with an arguable defence.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Assume (without necessarily accepting) that clause 17(C) enables ECT to rely on clause 3.  There would remain the question whetherclause 3 applies to the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Mr. Coleman accepts that the situation here does not fall under limb (i) of clause 3.  It is true that, in a manner of speaking,Container X and its contents were âdeliveredâ to Nico on 5 September 2007.  But plainly the word âdeliveryâ in limb (i) mustmean âdelivery in accordance with the terms of the ECBâ.  Otherwise, one would have the absurd result where ECT could just âdeliverâthe goods to a stranger and claim that time for suit began to run from the date of such wrongful release.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Mr. Coleman must then establish that limb (ii) of clause 3 is applicable.  But what is the date âwhen the Goods should have beendeliveredâ?  Mr. Coleman says that 5 September 2007 or thereabouts is the relevant date for limb (ii).  But I do not think thatis right.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  By analogy with the way in which âdeliveryâ is used in limb (i), the word âdeliveredâ in limb (ii) must have the sense ofâwhen the Goods should have been delivered in accordance with the terms of the ECBâ.  See <i>Cheong Yuk Fai v. China International Freight Forwarders (HK) Co. Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%204%20HKLRD%20544" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 4 HKLRD 544</a> (at para. 58 <i>per</i> Yuen JA).  That means on the facts of the present case that limb (ii) refers either to a reasonable time:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a) after the Plaintiffs demand that Transpac (or its agent) deliver Container X and its contents to the Plaintiffs in Tilburg; or,</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b)    after Transpac (or its agent) notifies the Plaintiffs that Container X and its contents are at the Plaintiffsâ disposal andavailable for collection in Tilburg.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Neither eventuality materialised.  Container X never reached Tilburg.  Transpac (or its agent) never notified the Plaintiffs thatContainer X had reached Tilburg and never called upon the Plaintiffs to take delivery of Container X in Tilburg.  The Plaintiffs,on the other hand, never demanded that Transpac (or its agent) deliver up Container X to the Plaintiffs in Tilburg.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  It follows that, on the facts, limb (ii) is as inapposite as limb (i).  The 9 month limit was never triggered.  On its true construction,clause 3 affords no defence for ECT.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Mr. Coleman faintly suggests that ECT has a defence because ECT was not negligent in releasing Container X to Nico.  But ECTâsnegligence or lack of it is not a relevant issue.  Conversion is a tort of strict liability.  A person X converts Yâs goods byhanding those goods to a person Z who is not entitled to possession of the same.  This is regardless of whether X was or was notnegligent in handing the goods to Z.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In any event, for what it is worth, it seems to me negligent for a bailee or sub-bailee in ECTâs position to have released ContainerX to Nico without following ECTâs own internal procedures.  In accordance with those procedures, Jimmy ought to have checked whetherContainer X had been re-routed from the barge to the trucking system.  He did not do so, apparently because the volume of cargoesbeing processed at the time was such that there would be massive delay in ECTâs operations if he had checked.  Jimmy took a short-cut. In that case, Jimmy may have been reckless (not just negligent) as to the risks involved and the possible adverse consequences ofnot checking.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  For those reasons, ECT has no real prospect of success on the question of liability.</p>    <p class="heading">C.  Stay to arbitration</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Mr. Coleman relies for this on clause 7.4.3 of the Terminal Contract between Hapag-Lloyd and ECT.  That provides:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âParties shall attempt to resolve any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Terminal Contract through an AlternativeDispute Resolution (ADR) procedure recommended to the Parties by the Nederlands Mediation Instituut (NMI) in Rotterdam.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">If the matter has not been resolved by an ADR procedure within 6 (six) months after the initiation of the procedure, the Parties shallrefer the dispute to Arbitration in Rotterdam in accordance with the Rules of the Nederlands Arbitrage Instituut (NAI) in Rotterdam.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A dispute shall be deemed to exist if one of the Parties declares this to be the case.  The Terminal Operator is entitled to waivethe provisions of this clause in respect of claims for unpaid and undisputed invoices, in which event the competent civil court ofRotterdam shall have jurisdiction.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Mr. Coleman submits that he is entitled to rely on clause 7.4.3 by application of the doctrine of âsub-bailment on termsâ. In short, the ECB authorised Transpac to engage bailees and sub-bailees as necessary in carrying out the requisite carriage fromShanghai to Tilburg.  Container X having been sub-bailed by HapagâLloyd to ECT on the terms of the Terminal Contract, it must bepresumed that the Plaintiffs are also bound by terms in the Terminal Contract.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Assume (without necessarily accepting) that there has been a sub-bailment with ECT on terms set out in the Terminal Contract.  Evenon that assumption, I do not see why clause 7.4.3 should be applicable to the current dispute between the Plaintiffs and ECT.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  On its own terms, clause 7.4.3 is explicit.  It does not apply to everyone.  It is restricted in its application to âthe Partiesâ. The latter is a precisely defined term.  According to clause 2.1 of the Terminal Contract, the expression refers to âthe signatoryLines to this Terminal Contract, which are the constituent members of the Grand Alliance and the Terminal Operatorâ.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  None of the Plaintiffs are âsignatory Linesâ.  None of the Plaintiffs are members of âthe Grand Allianceâ.  Obviously, noneof the Plaintiffs are ECT, âthe Terminal Operatorâ.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Mr. Coleman suggests that the word âPartiesâ must be understood to include all those to whom the terms of the Terminal Contractmight apply by reason of the âsub-bailment on termsâ doctrine.  But why should such an understanding be imported here?  The convolutedgloss on âPartiesâ advocated by Mr. Coleman is not so necessary for the commercial efficacy of the Terminal Contract that itshould be read in as self-evident.  Nor is there anything in the Terminal Contract expressly indicating that, despite clause 2.1,âPartiesâ should be given some wider meaning in a particular context.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  On the contrary, the specificity of clause 2.1 suggests that as far as clause 7.4.3 is concerned, the signatories to the TerminalContract intended the arbitration requirement to apply to themselves alone.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  A stay to arbitration of the dispute between the Plaintiffs and the ECT is accordingly refused.</p>    <p class="heading">IV. CONCLUSION</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  ECTâs application to set aside the Interlocutory Judgment is refused.  ECTâs application for a stay to arbitration is likewisedismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  There will be an Order Nisi that ECT pay the Plaintiffsâ costs, such costs are to be taxed (if not agreed) in any event.</p>    <p>   </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(A.
