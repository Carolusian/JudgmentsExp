Labour Tribunal made against them on 17 May 2003. Bythat award, the Presiding Officer held that the 5th and 6th Defendants were to be jointly and severally liable together with the1st, 3rd and 4th Defendants in respect of annual leave payments, holiday payments, severance payments (or in the case of the 6thClaimant, long service payment), payment in lieu of notice and annual bonus due to the Claimants.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Although leave to appeal was sought on behalf of 2nd to 6th Defendants, I only granted leave to the 5th and 6th Defendants. Hence,the validity of the award vis-Ã -vis the 1st, 3rd and 4th Defendants would not be affected by whatever this court is going to decidein this appeal. In other words, the Claimants can still enforce the award against the 1st, 3rd and 4th Defendants irrespective ofthe outcome of this appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The relationships between the parties were summarized by the Presiding Officer as follows in Paragraphs 5 to 7 of his careful anddetail Reasons for Decision of 12 August 2003.

The jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal is prescribed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a> and the Schedule thereto. Paragraph 3 of the Schedule provides that the tribunal shall not have jurisdiction to hear and determinea claim for a sum of money, or otherwise in respect of a cause of action, founded in tort. Hence, the Labour Tribunal does not haveany jurisdiction to entertain any claims in tort. Mr Ma has no quarrel with that proposition.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The Presiding Officer did not explain clearly in Paragraph 72 of his Reasons for Decision whether he held the 5th or 6th Defendantliable on account of contract or tort. He observed that the conducts of the 5th and 6th Defendants could constitute conspiracy todefraud or to injure the economic interests of the Claimants. He also referred to fraudulent misrepresentations by these defendants.All these are indicative of the Presiding Officer having tortious liabilities in his mind. The last sentence of that paragraph referredback to piecing of corporate veil of the 3rd Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> It must be remembered that the doctrine of piecing the corporate veil does not by itself provide a cause of action. It is a doctrinethat can be relied upon to ignore the separate legal personality of a company to attach liabilities to those behind that company.Such liabilities can be liabilities in contract or liabilities in tort or for that matter, any other kinds of liabilities.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> As far as the Labour Tribunal is concerned, its jurisdiction does not extend to tortious liabilities. Hence, insofar as the referencesto those tortuous elements by the Presiding Officer are meant to be read as holding the 5th and 6th Defendants liable on accountof tort, he was acting outside jurisdiction. Therefore the award cannot be maintained on the ground of liabilities stemming fromthe torts of misrepresentation or conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> In the present context, the primary obligation to pay annual leave payments, holiday payments, severance payments (or in the caseof the 6th Claimant, long service payment), payment in lieu of notice and annual bonus to the Claimants must stem from their contractsof employment. Although the claims are governed by the statutory provisions, they arose from the underlying contracts of employment.Hence, the crucial question is who was the party to the contract of employment, viz. who was the employer of these Claimants.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> On the Presiding Officer's own findings in Paragraphs 42(6)(a) and (b) and 72(1), the 3rd Defendant was set up as a faÃ§ade to concealthe identity of the real employer who was the 4th Defendant. Hence, insofar as the contracts of employment are concerned, the piecingof the corporate veil rendered the 4th Defendant liable as the real employer of these Claimants.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> However, the Presiding Officer did not stop there. He went on to hold that as the 5th and 6th Defendants were those behind this schemeof evading the 4th Defendant's liability as the real employer, the effect of the piercing of corporate veil is to render these twogentlemen personally liable as well. Now this is a step which I have immense difficulty in adopting. Was the Presiding Officer sayingthat by virtue of what they did, the 5th and 6th Defendants somehow became the employers of these Claimants? If that was what thePresiding Officer meant to hold, how could that sit with his own finding that the real employer was the 4th Defendant? I do not thinkthere is any evidence to suggest that the 5th or 6th Defendants had personally undertaken any dealings with these Claimants thatcould remotely suggest to the latter that the former were their employers. As a matter of fact, the 5th and 6th Defendants were joinedas parties to the case on the Tribunal's own motion. The only matter referred to by the Presiding Officer was the 5th and 6th Defendants'involvement in this scheme of concealment.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> I have read the Reasons for Decision of the Presiding Officer several times. As I said, the Presiding Officer went to great lengthin giving reasons for his decision and analyzing each and every issue carefully. I commend him for that. However, with respect, Ithink he confused liability for tort with liability under the contract of employment in holding the 5th and 6th Defendants liable.On a fair reading of his Reasons for Decision, I do not think he came anywhere near to holding the 5th and 6th Defendants liable<em>as employers</em> of the Claimants. What he did was to hold that because they were the masterminds behind this dishonest scheme of concealment, theyshould be liable as well as the 3rd and 4th Defendants. Unfortunately, in so doing, he unconsciously treaded beyond the realm ofliabilities as employers (which is properly within his jurisdiction) to the realm of tortious liabilities (which is outside his jurisdiction).If the Presiding Officer had asked himself at all time whose liabilities as employer had been concealed, he would have realized thataccording to his own findings, it must be that of the 4th Defendant. There is no question of the 5th and 6th Defendants being jointlyand severally liable with the 4th Defendant as co-employers. This analysis is consistent with the approach adopted by the court in<strong>Yukong Line Ltd v Rendsbury Investments</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20BCLC%20485" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 BCLC 485</a> regarding the personal liability of a director involving in a scheme of hiving off the assets of a company to evade liability. Itwas held in that case that the doctrine of piecing of corporate veil cannot be utilized in such circumstances to render the directorpersonally liable as party to the original transaction.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Once the focus is placed on the real issue that could properly be determined in the Labour Tribunal, viz. who was the real employerof these Claimants, it can readily be seen that the award against the 5th and 6th Defendants cannot be sustained.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Mr Ma however contended that the liabilities of the 5th and 6th Defendants could be upheld on the doctrine of undisclosed principal.He contended that since the finding of the Presiding Officer was that the real employer was the 4th Defendant, the 3rd Defendantcould only be held liable as the agent for the 4th Defendant on account of the doctrine of undisclosed principal. He relied on Para.9-002 of <em>Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency</em>, 17th Edn. Mr Ma argued that on the facts of the present case, by failing to disclose to the Claimants that the 4th Defendant wasthe real employer, the 3rd Defendant was in the position of an agent under an undisclosed principal scenario.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> That may or may not be correct. However, I fail to see how that could lead to the conclusion that the 5th and 6th Defendants couldbe rendered liable as employers of the Claimants. They acted neither as agents nor principals in respect of the employment of theClaimants.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> It might be possible to argue that since the Presiding Officer held that the 3rd Defendant was the <em>alter ego</em> of the 5th and 6th Defendants (see Paragraph 7 of his Reasons for Decision), insofar as the 3rd Defendant participated in a fraudulentscheme to defraud the Claimants, the 5th and 6th Defendants were liable as joint tortfeasors. But that would be within the provinceof tortious claims which the Labour Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon. Hence, the award cannot be sustained on thisground. It might also be possible to argue that a director would be liable on account of constructive trust if a scheme of corporatestructures is employed to strip a company that owed primary obligations to some creditors of its asset to evade liability when thecourt could properly find that the receipt by the transferee should be treated as the receipt by the director personally (see <strong>Trustor AB v Smallbone</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%201%20WLR%201177" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 1 WLR 1177).</a> However, that would again be a claim outside the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Mr Ma relied on the case of <strong>Creasey v Breachwood Motors Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20BCLC%20480" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] BCLC 480</a> where the court held that the principle of lifting of corporate veil can be evoked so that a transferee of a business could be liablefor the liability of the transferor if the purpose of the transfer was a deliberate shifting of the assets of the transferor intothe transferee in total disregard of the transferor's duties to protected creditors. It is to be noted that in that case, both thetransferor and the transferee were limited companies and their shareholders and directors were the same. However, the court did nothold that directors involved would be personally liable.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Hence, even if <strong>Creasey</strong> is good law, its application in the present context could not assist the Claimants vis-Ã -vis the 5th and 6th Defendants. At themost, it could be applied to render the 4th Defendant liable.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Further, <strong>Creasey</strong> was disapproved by the English Court of Appeal in <strong>Ord v Belhaven Pubs</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20BCC%20607" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] BCC 607</a> at p. 616. There is also a very interesting discussion in an article in the Company Lawyer by Mr Damiel Bromilow, <strong>Creasey v Breachwood Motors: mistaken identity leads to untimely death</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2019%20Company%20Lawyer%20198" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 19 Co Law 198.</a> Mr Ma referred to <strong>HKSAR v Leung Yat Ming</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%202%20HKLRD%20402" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 2 HKLRD 402</a> at p. 406 where Mayo JA (as he then was) appeared to cite <strong>Creasey</strong> as authority for the wide proposition that where the justice of case requires it, it is permissible to go behind the corporate veilparticularly where it is a cloak of deception. There are also two recent cases in Hong Kong on the topic: <strong>Liu Hon Ying v. Hua Xin State Enterprise (Hong Kong) Limited</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%203%20HKLRD%20347" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 3 HKLRD 347</a>; <strong>Lee Sow Keng Janet v Kelly McKenzie Ltd</strong> DCCJ 2303 of 2002, Judge HC Wong, 29 July 2003. Since it is unnecessary for me to reach a final conclusion on the point and counseldid not address me on all the relevant authorities, I will leave it for decision in the future.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> It follows that the appeal by the 5th and 6th Defendants must be allowed and the award against them set aside. I order accordingly.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> It is apparent from the above that I do not find it necessary to consider at length the other grounds raised by Mr Yip. Even assumingthat there is evidence justifying the factual conclusions of the Presiding Officer, he should not have held the 5th and 6th Defendantsto be liable as employers. I therefore need not discuss whether there was evidence before the Presiding Officer to justify thosefactual conclusions. Mr Yip said there was no evidence and the Presiding Officer had misdirected himself by failing to consider somehighly relevant matters. Mr Ma contended otherwise.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> As regards costs, I will make a costs order nisi that the 4th and 6th Claimants shall bear the costs of the 5th and 6th Defendantsin relation to this appeal. I make no order as to costs vis-Ã -vis the other Claimants since they only played a very passive rolein the appeal and the joinder of the 5th and 6th Defendants were not their ideas.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(M H Lam)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Simon S M Yip, instructed by Messrs Philip S W Chan &amp; Co., for the Defendants</p>        <p>Mr Stanley Ma, assigned by Department of Legal Aid, for the 4th and 6th Claimants</p>        <p>1st - 3rd, 5th, 7th - 10th Defendants, in person</p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2004/92.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
