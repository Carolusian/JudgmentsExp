Alternatively, it was argued that the Judge must have found the evidence of P.W.3 above quoted so vague and unsatisfactorythat he disregarded it.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> We reject both these arguments. We think it inconceivable that, had the Judge had in mind the deceased's probable earnings at thedate of trial, he would not have made reference to and made some finding on P.W.3's aforementioned evidence. Moreover, as he hadalready accepted part of his evidence, we see no reason to believe he would have rejected the other part.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> That the Judge should have assessed the wages position as at the date of trial is clear. In our judgment he failed to do so. Thisis the task we must now attempt, on the evidence before us.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> It was argued before us that we should reject P.W.3's evidence as being so vague and unsatisfactory as to be worthless; alternativelythat it tans not evidence as such, since P.W. 3's factory had closed about one month before the trial. We disagree. Courts frequentlyin cases of this nature have to assess damages on somewhat flimsy material, and we see no reason why one manufacturer cannot giveevidence as to what other manufacturers pay their employees.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In our judgment the probability is that, had he lived, the deceased at the date of trial would have been earning $2,000 per monthby way of basic salary. We do not think, however, that there would have been any increase in his commission, as business was bad,and so we award $1,000 per month by way of commission, making a total of $3,000 per month from metal brokerage. To this sum mustbe added $1,000 per month which the deceased would have earned as a jade broker - there being no challenge as to the Judge's findingon this point. Thus the deceased's total income, in our judgment, at the date of trial should have been assessed at $4,000 per month.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The Respondents, however, challenge the Judge's finding that only $500 per month should be deducted from the lost years earningsaward in respect of the deceased's own living expenses. To assess this argument it is necessary to look at the Pleading.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Paragraph 7(d)(iv) of the original Statement of Claim reads:</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The sum of $600 approximately was retained by the deceased for his own use."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> At the date of the trial this figure of $600 was amended to $l,500 (and other figures claimed were also substantially increased).</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> It was argued by Counsel for the Respondent that this amended figure constituted an admission by the Plaintiffs from which they couldresile only with leave of the Court and that no application had been made so to do. We disagree. We do not consider that an allegationof this kind contained in a Statement of Claim was an admission. On the other hand, it was the Plaintiff's pleaded case that thedeceased's living expenses were $l,500 per month, and when the 1st Plaintiff gave evidence she testified that they were $2,000 -$3,000. The Judge held that her evidence as to figures was grossly exaggerated and he did hot accept it. Even so, we see no reasonwhy the Plaintiffs should be allowed to depart from their pleaded case as to what had to be deducted from the deceased's notionalincome. In our judgment, the Judge should therefore have deducted from the $4,000 total monthly income a figure of $l,500 per month,leaving a net sum of $2,500 per month.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The Judge's multiplier of 7 has not been challenged. It follows that we too have arrived at a figure of $210,000 on the basis offull liability, the seine sum as that awarded by the Judge, though we have done so by a different route.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The second ground of Appeal concerned the funeral expenses. These were claimed in the sum of $13,000. Of this amount the sum of $7,522(for which receipts had been produced) was agreed. The balance (for which no receipts were produced but it was not challenged thatthe suns clamed had been expended) consisted of two items.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The first eras the sum of between $2,000 - $3,000 is respect of three dinners for mourners. Counsel for the Appellants relied ontwo cases; <u>Lee ping Tim v. Wong Kin Foon</u><sup>(1)</sup> and <u>Chu Che-Ping v. along Kam-Shee</u><sup>(2)</sup>, in both of which the costs of such dinners were held to be recoverable. In neither of those cases, however, were the respectiveJudges referred to the case of <u>Wong Kam Ying v. Man Chi Tai</u><sup>(3)</sup>, in which Huggins J. (as he then was) said at p. 208:-</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Nevertheless, it seems to me that the burial of the dead with due ceremony is one thing and the entertainment of those who come topay their respects is another".</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p align="left">He therefore disallowed the cost of mourners' dinners.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> We are of the opinion that the view of Huggins J. is the correct one, and that therefore the trial Judge was right to disallow thisitem.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The second was a sum of $3,000 as the cost of two Buddhist ceremonies for the release of the spirit of the deceased. The trial Judgetotally disallowed this item. There was no evidence as to the religion of the deceased, unless the fact that one of the items inthe agreed figure related to a Taoist priest to lead the procession can be taken as some indication of it. But there was evidencethat the 1st Plaintiff was a Buddhist. The question we have to ask is, wens it reasonable in all the circumstances to hold theseceremonies. In arriving at our conclusion we have to consider the status, and financial position of the deceased and of his familyand also their religious beliefs. We see no reason to conclude that the holding of these ceremonies was unreasonable nor that thecost thereof was unreasonably high. We therefore increase the award of funeral expenses to $10,522 (on the basis of full liability).</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> It follows that in our judgment the net funeral expenses recoverable are $7,890, and to this extent we vary the trial Judge's orderand allow the Appeal.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><strong>Sir Alan Huggins, V.-P. :</strong></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> As we are disagreeing with the trial judge on the question of funeral expenses I will, out of respect to him, give my reasons. Hesaid about the dinners and the Buddhist ceremonies:</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The balance relates to the cost bï¿¡ funeral ceremonies for which no receipts were produced. I do not consider that the defendantsshould be saddled with these extra sums which I find are unreasonable."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> In a sense, of course, it is unreasonable to award anything at all in respect of funeral expenses since such expenses are not causedby the negligence of the defendant but merely hastened by it. However, the judge recognised that, illogical as it may be, such expensesnow form an accepted part of the damages in fatal accident cases.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Despite his mention of the absence of receipts I think it is clear that the judge was not questioning whether payment of the sumsclaimed had been made. It was common ground before us that these saws had been paid.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The judge did not say why he thought the sums were unreasonable, or, indeed, chat he meant by "unreasonable". I express no view asto the reasonableness of the amount claimed for tire dinners, but I adhere to the view I held in <u>Wong Kam-ying</u> v. <u>Man Chi-tai</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1967%20HKLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1967 H.K.L.R. 201</a> that, reasonable or not, such sum forms no part of the damages payable by the defendant. The dinners were quite separate and distinctfrom the disposal of the Deceased's mortal remains with customary ceremony, even though they may have been customary hospitalityon such an occasion. A line must be drawn some where and I think the courts should endeavour to restrict the expenses which are encompassedwithin the phrase "funeral expenses".</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The claim in respect of the Buddhist rites is of a different character. As the widow colds the Buddhist faith, it was reasonablethat she should the appropriate Buddhist ceremonies to be performed, even though the Deceased had been buried with Taoist rites.The question remains whether the sum of $3000 for prayers for the release of the spirit of the Deceased was reasonable. I confessthat the sum appears to me to be high, even if one disregards the financial status of the Deceased and his family. Nevertheless owemast bear in mind that the Chinese do expend large sums on such ceremonies, even where that involves running themselves heavily intodebt. No evidence has been led to suggest that the fees charged were not those normally charged for this service and, not withoutconsiderable reluctance, I agree that the award in respect of funeral expenses should be increased  (on the basis of 75% liability)to $7,890.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p>(1)     H. C. Action No. 143 of 192</p>    <p>(2)    H.C.

Whilst dinners are almost invariably given by the family of the deceased, they do not form part of the funeral ceremonies.Also it is not uncommon for Chinese to follow two religious riles if the surviving spouse and the deceased belong to two differentfaiths.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>6th July 1982</p>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Sakhrani, Q.C. &amp; Sujanani (D.L.A.) for Appellants.</p>        <p>Mills-Owens, Q.C. &amp; Ducting (H.A.
