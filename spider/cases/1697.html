However, there is no issue that the material terms of the Contract had already been agreed on inthe e-mail correspondence.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The garments were to be exported to Long Art's overseas customer American Public Company Inc ("APC") in the USA. The parties to theContract took advantage of the "Outward Processing Arrangement" ("OPA") permitted by the Trade and Industry Department. Accordingto the publication of the Trade and Industry Department, OPA:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"enables manufacturers registered with the Trade and Industry Department to subcontract outside Hong Kong the subsidiary or minorfinishing processes without affecting the eligibility of such goods for attaining Hong Kong origin status."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> A prerequisite for participation in the OPA is that the goods concerned must have undergone the principal manufacturing processes("principal processes") in Hong Kong which are sufficient to qualify them as of Hong Kong origin.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The connection between "principal processes" and "Hong Kong origin" is further spelt out in the standard conditions of export licenceapplied for by Long Art:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Goods covered by this licence must be of Hong Kong origin. Goods claiming Hong Kong origin must have undergone principal processesin Hong Kong. These are processes which permanently and substantially change the nature, shape, form and utility of the raw materialsused, as laid down by the Director-General of Trade and Industry in Certificate of Origin Circulars."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Under the OPA, the Hong Kong manufacturer engaged by the exporter to perform the "principal processes" had to submit to the Tradeand Industry Department a "Production Notification" ("PN"). The PN contained particulars of the processes to be carried out, at whatplace and during what period such processes would be carried out. Obviously, this was to ensure the garments produced truly had HongKong as the "Country of Origin".</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Under the Contract, Long Art was responsible for supplying fabrics and accessories for the garment production. It was also responsiblefor engaging other contractors to do the embroidery and studding processes. At all material times, the persons handling the Contracton Long Art's side were, <em>inter alia</em>, its senior merchandiser Chang Kam Lung also known as Charles Chang ("Charles") and its production manager Wan Ping Hung also knownas Joe Wan ("Joe").</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Starting from early August 2000, Long Art delivered the necessary fabrics and accessories to the factory belonging to Hung Kiu WearIndustry (Hui Zhou) Limited in the Mainland ("Hung Kiu"), which was the factory undertaking the manufacturing processes other thanthe principal processes.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Shortly after the delivery of the fabrics to Hung Kiu, it was discovered that they suffered from certain yarn slubs problems (i.e.lumps caused by knots of threads). After discussion, and by an e-mail dated 28 August 2000 to Long Art, Raymond of Harbour Fair suggestedthe delivery date be extended to 8 October 2000, as opposed to 25 September 2000 previously indicated by Long Art. He also soughtconfirmation of a surcharge of HK$8,000.00 for the defective fabrics, which was duly confirmed by Long Art.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> There was further delay caused by Long Art's late supply of care labels. As a result, the delivery date was further postponed to10 October 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> By a letter dated 28 September 2000 to, <em>inter alia</em>, Kam and Wu Tat Ching ("Wu") who was the production manager of Hung Kiu, Joe of Long Art noted that the delivery date for all thegarments had been postponed to 10 October 2000, stated that garments sent after 5 October 2000 would have to be sent by air to LongArt's detriment, and warned that any further delay might result in the cancellation of the order by their overseas customer. Thisletter was initialed by Wu.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> By a letter dated 13 October 2000, Long Art referred to Harbour Fair's failure to meet the extended delivery date of 10 October 2000,and to the request by its customer to deliver goods by air if the garments could not be delivered by early October. It also mentionedthat Harbour Fair had not completed the PNs for the delivery of the garments.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> As regards the PNs, I should mention that back on or about 15 September 2000 Harbour Fair sought and Long Art provided the "PO numbers"of the Long Art Purchase Orders apparently for Harbour Fair to prepare the PNs. In early October 2000, Harbour Fair filed a numberof PNs with the Trade and Industry Department which referred to the PO numbers of the Long Art Purchase Orders.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> By a number of documents called "purchase contract amendments" dated 13 October 2000, Long Art purported to cancel most of the ordersplaced by the Long Art Purchase Orders due to late shipment.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> On or about 18 October 2000, Harbour Fair faxed to Long Art information of one Wai Lung Garment Factory ("Wai Lung"). Wai Lung wassubsequently engaged to provide the PNs in place of Harbour Fair. There is a dispute as to whether it was Long Art itself or HarbourFair who procured Wai Lung to provide the PNs. In the export licences issued on 20 and 21 October 2000, Long Art as the exporterdeclared, <em>inter alia</em>, that Wai Lung was the manufacturer of the subject garments.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Since late September 2000, Long Art had been pleading with Harbour Fair repeatedly to confirm the delivery date, stressing the importanceof such confirmation vis-Ã -vis its overseas customer. There was no written reply by e-mail or otherwise.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> On or about 6 November 2000, 494 pieces of garments were delivered to Long Art. There is no dispute that Long Art had not paid forthe 494 pieces. However, no contemporaneous invoice had been issued by Harbour Fair or Wai Lung in respect of this delivery. Therelevant invoice produced was one issued by Wai Lung dated 25 November 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Long Art sent numerous letters chasing Harbour Fair for the delivery of the balance but there was still no response from HarbourFair. A meeting was held on 13 November 2000. Eventually Long Art engaged Messrs Ko &amp; Co. to help pursue the matter. By a letterdated 13 November 2000, Messrs Ko &amp; Co. imposed a deadline of 5:00 p.m. of 14 November 2000 for Harbour Fair to deliver the balanceof the garments.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> On either 14 or 15 November 2000, only 1,974 pieces of garments were delivered. These 1,974 pieces were paid for by Long Art by acheque dated 15 November 2000 for the sum of HK$72,656.00 payable to Wai Lung.

I find him a truthful witness who tried his best to give a full account of hisrecollection of events. He was confident, meticulous and careful in giving evidence. For example, his answers as to whom he met andwhat happened at meetings were consistent despite vigorous cross-examination.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Joe was the second witness. Although he was not as careful as Charles and at times appeared confused and uncertain when confrontedwith certain documentary evidence, I find him a truthful witness on the whole.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> For Harbour Fair, the only witness called was Monica, who held the post of Assistant Director. Kam chose not to give evidence althoughhe had filed two witness statements. I am not at all impressed by Monica's credibility as a witness. She is a clever lady who wasaware of the difficulties in the defence case and came prepared. However, she was too zealous to plug the holes and many of her explanationsare plainly incredible. She was evasive when cornered, and was quick to pass the blame on "her colleagues" when things did not appearconsistent with the defence case. Insofar as there are conflicts in the oral testimonies, I prefer those given by Long Art's witnesses.</p>    <p class="heading">The Agency</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Harbour Fair argued that to the knowledge of Long Art, Harbour Fair was only an agent or liaison representative of Hung Kiu in HongKong. On this basis, Harbour Fair did not incur personal liability on the Contract.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> On the evidence before me, I am satisfied that Harbour Fair did contract with Long Art as principal as opposed to agent for HungKiu.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> First, Charles and Joe of Long Art both said they had never been told that Harbour Fair was only contracting as agent for Hung Kiu.I accept Joe's evidence that Kam told him Hung Kiu was Kam's own factory. Kam and Raymond did not give evidence to support the claimon agency. Monica did not deal with Long Art directly at the time when the Contract was entered into.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Second, in none of the correspondence including in particular the e-mails constituting the Contract was there any express or impliedsuggestion that Harbour Fair was just acting as agent for Hung Kiu. Instead, the name cards of Kam and Raymond were so designed asto give the impression that Hung Kiu was a Mainland company belonging to or was operated by Harbour Fair.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Third, the nature of the Contract including in particular that the obligation to procure the "Hong Kong country of origin" for thegarments pointed strongly to Harbour Fair, a Hong Kong company, being a party to the Contract as principal. I shall elaborate onthis point in connection with the role of Wai Lung below.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Fourth, Harbour Fair has failed to satisfy me that the so-called "Authorization Letter" dated 1 August 1997 was a genuine document.Monica's evidence on this document only made it more suspicious. The document did not serve any practical purpose at all. Monicaalso admitted the company undertaking the functions of transporting fabrics and accessories as well as clearing customs (as mentionedin the said Authorization Letter) should be Harbour Fair Trading Company, which was another sole proprietorship of Kam. AlthoughHung Kiu appeared to a be a joint venture company with a Mainland entity, there can be little doubt that Kam, as its Chairman andManager, was very much in control of Hung Kiu. Should there be a genuine agency agreement in place since 1997, Harbour Fair shouldhave no difficulty in producing documents evidencing the payment of agency commission, which Monica said Hung Kiu had to and didpay Harbour Fair. None was produced.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Fifth, if indeed Hung Kiu and not Harbour Fair were the contracting party, it is difficult to understand why Hung Kiu did not joinin as a defendant to counterclaim against Long Art for damages in breach of contract.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Sixth, even if, contrary to my finding, Harbour Fair did act as an agent for Hung Kiu, there is no direct evidence to substantiateHarbour Fair's allegation that Long Art <em>knew</em> about it.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Seventh, and in any event, even if Harbour Fair did to the knowledge of Long Art describe itself as agent for Hung Kiu, it does not<em>pe se</em> follow that Harbour Fair assumed no personal contractual liability. As Lord Scarman said in <strong>Yeung Kai Yung v. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20AC%20787" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] AC 787</a>, at p. 795C-D:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is not the law that, if a principal is liable, his agent cannot be. The true principle of law is that a person is liable for hisengagements (as for his torts) even though he is acting for another, unless he can show that by the law of agency he is to be heldto have expressly or impliedly negatived his personal liability."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Far from showing that its personal liability had been negatived, Harbour Fair had clearly conducted itself in a way affirming itspersonal liability on the Contract. This can be illustrated by reference to the terms of the Contract and the procurement of WaiLung as dealt with below.</p>    <p class="heading">Procurement of Wai Lung</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Wai Lung was the local manufacturer who eventually filed the PNs with the Trade and Industry Department to enable Long Art to exportthe garments to APC.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> According to Monica, Harbour Fair rejected the Long Art Purchase Orders as they contained unacceptable terms. Thereafter, Long Artproceeded to engage another local manufacturer, namely, Wai Lung, to carry out the principal processes in Hong Kong. She said theprincipal processes were indeed performed by Wai Lung, who separately reached an agreement with Hung Kiu. It is however noteworthythat Wai Lung did not join in as a defendant to pursue any counter-claim against Long Art for loss of profit.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> According to Charles, in about mid October 2000, Harbour Fair informed Long Art that it had difficulty in applying for the PNs andhence requested Long Art to use Wai Lung to apply for the PNs. Wai Lung was introduced by Harbour Fair. Charles said under thesecircumstances, Long Art had no realistic choice other than to comply with Harbour Fair's request.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> On the undisputed documentary evidence before me, I have no doubt that it was Harbour Fair, not Long Art, who first procured WaiLung to participate in this deal. It was Harbour Fair who faxed over to Long Art the name and details of Wai Lung on or about 18October 2000. All the production and packing details were sent to Harbour Fair, not to Wai Lung. Long Art had never correspondeddirectly with Wai Lung. Furthermore, it is clear that Wai Lung was at Harbour Fair's disposal. Monica gave evidence that HarbourFair could direct Wai Lung whether or not to release the garments to Long Art. It was also Monica who signed the two invoices ofWai Lung dated 15 November 2000 for the delivery of the 1,974 pieces. In this connection, I find Monica's story about meeting Charleson 15 November 2000 at the lift lobby where Charles demanded her to sign the Wai Lung invoices most bizarre. It was plainly madeup by her to explain why her signatures so appeared.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> In my view, it was after Harbour Fair encountered a problem with filing the PNs with the Trade and Industry Department for whateverreason that it decided to procure Wai Lung to file the PNs. I have no doubt that Harbour Fair procured Wai Lung to file the PNs inorder to discharge its own <em>express obligation</em> under the Contract with Long Art.</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(1)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">In its Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim, Harbour Fair admitted that under the Contract, the price <em>included</em> "Hong Kong Country of Origin". However, pursuant to an oral agreement made between Joe of Long Art and Kam in or about early August2000, the price <em>excluded</em> the supply of Hong Kong Country of Origin.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(2)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">There is no evidence adduced on the alleged oral agreement at all. Without the oral agreement, it is the pleaded case of Harbour Fairthat it had to supply the "Hong Kong Country of Origin" pursuant to the Contract.

To supply"Hong Kong Country of Origin" in the context of the OPA must mean that Harbour Fair was responsible for satisfying the Trade andIndustry Department that the principal processes were carried out in Hong Kong by submission of the necessary PNs.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(4)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">It is a fact that on 11 October 2000 Harbour Fair did itself file three PNs to enable Long Art to secure the export licence. I haveno hesitation in rejecting the suggestion by Monica that these PNs were filed as a result of a mistake by their shipping clerk "AhShan", who was not called to give evidence. What Monica said in this regard is plainly untrue and demonstrates she was not a crediblewitness at all. These PNs filed also referred to the numbers of the Long Art Purchase Orders, which fact also militates against Monica'sevidence that the purchase orders were rejected right away as the terms were found to be unacceptable.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(5)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">Monica agreed that only a local manufacturer could apply for "Hong Kong Country of Origin" and thus discharge the obligation underthe Contract. Hung Kiu was not able to do that. Harbour Fair also took it upon itself to procure Wai Lung to file the PNs. All thesereinforce the conclusion that Harbour Fair was contracting with Long Art in his own capacity not as an agent.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading">The Illegality</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> When Long Art applied for the export licences, Long Art acceded to Harbour Fair's request to let Wai Lung file the PNs, and declaredin the export licences that Wai Lung was the local manufacturer.

Nor did Mr Hung apply to amend the Amended Defence and Counterclaim to properlyplead the point. However, Mr Hung relied on <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>, 28th edition, para. 17-196:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>Pleading of illegality</em>. Where a contract is ex facie illegal, the court will not enforce it, whether the illegality is pleaded or not; secondly, where thecontract is not ex facie illegal, evidence of extraneous circumstances tending to show that it has an illegal object should not beadmitted unless the circumstances relied on are pleaded; thirdly, where unpleaded facts, which, taken by themselves, show an illegalobject, have been put in evidence (because, perhaps, no objection was raised or because they were adduced for some other purpose),the court should not act on them unless it is satisfied that the whole of the relevant circumstances are before it; but fourthly,where the court is satisfied that all the relevant facts are before it and it can clearly see from them that the contract had anillegal object, it may not enforce the contract, whether the facts were pleaded or not. It has been said that counsel is not actingimproperly in inviting the court to consider the possible, though unpleaded, illegality of a transaction but that on the contrarycounsel's duty is to prevent the court from enforcing illegal transactions."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> As regards counsel's duty, Mr Hung also referred me to the case of <strong>Mercantile Credit Co.

John Stephenson J held that it was counsel's duty, however embarrassing, to prevent the court from enforcing illegal transactions.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Although I agree the Court should take cognizance of illegality even though it had not been pleaded, I find it unsatisfactory thatthe defence of illegality was not properly raised at an earlier stage of this trial. I do not think this point was triggered offonly by the Closing submission of Long Art's counsel, which was filed and served prior to the hearing of oral closing submissions.<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60/s6d.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6D</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60" class="autolink_findacts">Import and Export Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60">Cap. 60</a> was included in the Defendant's List of Authorities submitted to the court before commencement of the trial. Further, thepenalty for making false declaration in the application for export licence was also touched on in the cross-examination of Charles.However, without illegality being raised as an issue, the questions appeared to be directed at the credibility of the witness. Inmy view, this illegality defence ought to have been raised much earlier by way of an application to amend the pleadings.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> Be that as it may, Mr William Wong, Counsel for Long Art, did not take any pleading point but went on to make objections and submissionson other grounds. Both Mr Hung and Mr Wong filed further written submissions on the construction of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60/s6d.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 6D</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">36</a> on 25 September 2003 and 29 August 2003 respectively.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> For the following reasons, I reject Mr Hung's contention based on illegality of the Contract.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> First, as regards <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60/s6d.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6D</a>, I agree with Mr Wong that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60/s6d.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6D</a> is irrelevant as the offence therein is exporting restricted goods <em>without any</em> export licence at all, which is not applicable to the present case where the relevant export licences were never revoked or cancelledby the authorities. Accordingly, whether the offence under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60/s6d.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6D</a> is one of strict liability (relying on <strong>AG of Hong Kong v Tse Hung Lit</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%201%20AC%20876" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 1 AC 876</a>, at 885) is immaterial.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Second, as regards <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 36</a>, the burden of proof is on Harbour Fair to satisfy me that such an offence had in fact been committed by Long Art. The illegalitypoint was not in issue when the witnesses of Long Art were examined. Neither Charles nor Joe was properly examined as to whetherthey "knew" or "had any reason to believe" that the statement or information in the export licence declaration was false or misleading.In these circumstances, I do not think <em>all the relevant facts</em> are before me so that it is fair or safe to draw any inference or come to any finding on such a serious allegation as to whethera criminal offence had been committed under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 36.</a></p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Third, even if I were wrong and Long Art did in fact commit an offence under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 36</a>, such an illegality could not have the effect of rendering the Contract unenforceable as submitted by Mr Hung. Long Art is suingHarbour Fair for breach of the Contract entered into back in July 2000. In pursuing this action, Long Art does not have to rely onor make reference to the export licence or the arrangement involving Wai Lung at all.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> In <strong>Pye Ltd v BG Transport Service Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 2 Lloyd's Rep 300</a>, the plaintiffs claimed on a contract of carriage for the loss of their goods which were stolen in Stepney. The plaintiffs had agreedwith their buyers, one Lapman Co. Ltd, that the goods, which were to be shipped to Persia, would be invoiced at less than the trueprice in order to deceive the Persian customs authorities. The carrier raised the defence of illegality but failed. At p. 309, BrowneJ said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Plaintiffs do not have to rely on their contract with Lapman Company Ltd to establish or support their cause of action againstthe defendants, and it is quite irrelevant for that purpose. The measure of damages is prima facie the market value of the goodsat that time of their loss.

The enforceability of the Contract could be impeached only where performance of the obligations thereunder was intendedto involve or would "necessarily" involve the doing of an act which is unlawful under the laws of Hong Kong. Here, at the time whenthe Contract was entered into in July 2000, and at all times up to mid October 2000, it was always intended that Harbour Fair wouldbe, and would be declared in the export licence as, the local manufacturer carrying out the principal processes. It was never theobject of the Contract or the intention of the parties to engage Wai Lung to file the PNs at the outset. It was never part of theContract to commit an offence under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60" class="autolink_findacts">Import and Export Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60">Cap. 60</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> As Browne-Wilkinson J said in <strong>Coral Leisure Group Ltd v Barnett</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20ICR%20503" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] ICR 503</a>, at 509:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The fact that a party has in the course of performing a contract committed an unlawful or immoral act will not by itself preventhim from further enforcing the contract unless the contract was entered into with the purpose of doing that unlawful or immoral actor the contract itself (as opposed to the mode of ... performance) is prohibited by law."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Non-delivery of the balance 6,046 pieces</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> In its Defence and by Monica's witness statement, Harbour Fair alleged that by about <em>20 November 2000</em>, the remaining garments under the Contract had been completed and delivered to Wai Lung. They were ready for onward delivery to LongArt but Long Art refused to pay the price to Wai Lung or Hung Kiu, as a result of which Wai Lung refused to allow Long Art to takedelivery of the goods.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> By reference to a number of export manifests, Monica gave evidence that all the garments in question (totalling 8,514 pieces) hadalready arrived in Hong Kong between 5 and 12 November 2000. (This is contrary to what she said in her witness statement where shesaid the balance of the garments were delivered in batches on or about 4, 15 and 20 November 2000). However, because Long Art refusedto pay for the garments by a 30-day post-dated cheque, the said goods were not delivered to Long Art.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> In her witness statement, Monica said that on or about 20 November 2000, Long Art attempted to take delivery of the remaining garmentsfrom Wai Lung but they did not pay Wai Lung by a 30-day post-dated cheque for the price of the remaining garments. The request fordelivery was made again to Monica on the same day and on 25 November 2000 but since Long Art was refusing to deliver a post-datedcheque, the delivery was refused.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> In the closing submissions, Mr Hung put forward a further suggestion: Long Art was adopting a wait and see attitude, reserving itsposition whether to rescind the Contract by reference to the deadline of 14 November 2000, depending on APC's decision whether toaccept late shipment.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> For the reasons given below, I find that the balance of the garments, namely, the 6,046 pieces, were never delivered. I reject HarbourFair's contention that all the garments (not just the 1,974 pieces) were already delivered to Hong Kong by 12 November 2000 or even20 November 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> First, Monica's story that the garments were not delivered to Long Art because Long Art refused to give Wai Lung or Harbour Faira 30-day post-dated cheque is wholly incredible.</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(1)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">It simply does not make sense that after chasing for the delivery of the garments so desperately for so long, and seeing that allthe garments were already delivered to Hong Kong by 12 November 2000 (i.e. still before the deadline of 14 November 2000), Long Artwould have obstructed itself from getting release of the goods by refusing to issue a 30-day postdated cheque, as required underthe Contract.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(2)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">This is rendered even more incredible as on 13 November 2000, in order to obtain the 1,974 pieces of goods for urgent air shipment,Long Art did not insist on its contractual right to pay by 30-day postdated cheque, but had agreed to pay by a cheque for immediatepayment, which it did by a cheque dated 15 November 2000 for the sum of HK$72,656.00.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> Second, any suggestion that Harbour Fair or Wai Lung refused to deliver the balance of the garments by reason of Long Art's earlierfailure to pay for the 494 pieces delivered back on or 4 or 6 November 2000 is totally unbelievable. Long Art had paid for the 1,974pieces by a cheque for immediate payment; there was no reason why it should withhold payment of the 494 pieces thereby causing HarbourFair to refuse delivery of the balance of the goods. The evidence shows that by a letter dated 13 November 2000 to Harbour Fair,Long Art requested Harbour Fair to submit the invoice to arrange payment. However, no invoice was sent immediately. The relevantinvoice adduced in evidence was one dated 25 November 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> Third, if indeed it was because of such unreasonable behaviour of Long Art that the deal turned sour, it is inexplicable why therewould be no trace of any e-mail or letter coming from Harbour Fair to chase Long Art to take delivery and to effect payment. Thiscontention did not feature in the first version of the Defence at all.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> Fourth, I am not satisfied that the garments featured in the export manifests were the subject matter of the Contract. There werenumerous discrepancies. The subject matters of the export manifests were all 100% cotton denim male shirts. However, of the 8,514pieces under the Contract, almost 85% were made of 50% cotton and 50% polyester; and they comprised shirts, vests and jackets. Further,the total number covered by the export manifests did not match the number of outstanding garments under the Contract.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Fifth, if indeed the export manifests documented the delivery of the balance of the garments, Harbour Fair could not have given somany different versions of the dates of their delivery: 4, 15 and 20 November 2000 (Monica's statement) and 5 to 27 November 2000(Monica's chronology).</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Sixth, Harbour Fair's counterclaim for storage costs of the fabrics is so dubious that it casts further doubt as to the alleged deliveryof the garments to Hong Kong. Harbour Fair produced a tenancy agreement in respect of a unit in Kowloon with rental of HK$9,000.00as opposed to HK$12,400.00 counterclaimed by Harbour Fair. The period claimed was from November 2000 to November 2001 (per closingsubmissions as opposed to Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim). However, the claim was wholly contradicted by Monica's evidence.She said the garments were initially stored by Wai Lung who returned them only in about Chinese New Year of 2001, when Harbour Fairreturned them to Hung Kiu in the Mainland.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> I find that by 14 or 15 November 2000, as Charles said, the best that Harbour Fair could have done was to deliver 1,974 pieces andnothing more.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> Mr Hung referred me to Long Art's letter dated 13 November 2000 to APC, which stated Long Art intended to fly 1,974 pieces and ship3,560 pieces to APC, and invited me to draw the inference that at least another 3,560 pieces were to the knowledge of Long Art availableon 13 November 2000. However, in the letter to APC, Long Art did not say the 3,560 pieces were immediately available. Instead, itasked for an extended shipment date to 18 December 2000. Furthermore, 3,560 is the figure referred to in the letter of 8 November2000 (Annex B), being the sum which Long Art requested Harbour Fair to deliver by 10 November 2000. This figure bears no connectionwith any figures in the export manifests which Mr Hung invited me to consider. Furthermore, what Long Art said to APC with a viewto salvage an order should be considered in its own context. In view of the other circumstances mentioned above, I am unable to agreewith Mr Hung on this point.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> That Harbour Fair and Hung Kiu had encountered problems in manpower can be seen from the contemporaneous documents. According tothe progress report dated 16 October 2000, Hung Kiu was unable to arrange sufficient manpower to perform Long Art's order. Accordingto another progress report dated 23 October 2000, the work of the factory was suspended. These contemporaneous records were not challenged.Nor did Monica try to explain the lack of manpower and suspension of work.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> Such documentary evidence corroborates the oral testimonies given by Long Art's witnesses, which I accept. According to Joe, in October2000, Long Art's quality controller reported that the Mainland factory had not put in sufficient manpower to produce the Long Art'sorder. Similarly, Charles also said Long Art's inspectors discovered that the production progress in Hung Kiu's factory was veryslow, with only a few workers involved, resulting in the lapse of delivery date as required by Long Art.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> In this connection, whether the fabrics for Style J001, which made up the bulk of Long Art's order, had been sufficiently cut wasmade a specific issue at the trial.</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(1)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">Joe said he gathered from the progress reports that by mid October Hung Kiu had only cut 4,950 pieces of J001, which was not sufficientto meet the order of 6,144 pieces of J001 as required under the Contract.

Furthermore, if my finding on non-delivery of the balance werewrong, and Harbour Fair was merely late, then whether Long Art could and did rescind the Contract upon Harbour Fair's failure tomeet the deadline on 14 November 2000 would be a material question.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> The argument, which Mr Hung placed heavy emphasis on in the course of his closing submission, is that irrespective of the rightsand wrongs between the parties, Long Art was not entitled to rescind the Contract for late delivery. As the Contract was not rescinded,Long Art cannot claim damages, as it seeks to do, on the basis of rescission.

In the letter of APC dated15 November 2000, what APC told Long Art about the balance of the lot (i.e. apart from the 1,974 pieces) was not that they were nolonger needed. Instead, APC said the balance could not be sent by sea but "must come by air to arrive" New York on 16 November 2000.Furthermore, if indeed "the rest" (i.e. other than 1,974 pieces) were available for delivery on 14 November 2000, it is inconceivablethat Long Art would not have taken them and sent as many of them as possible by air together with the 1,974 pieces.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> In these circumstances, Long Art's claim for damages for late delivery of the 2,468 pieces and for non-delivery of the 6,046 piecesis not in any way undermined.</p>    <p class="heading">Implied term contended by Long Art</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> Long Art alleged that it was an implied term of the Contract that Harbour Fair as manufacturer and seller was to provide Long Artas buyer with duly completed application forms for the purpose of obtaining valid export licences from the Trade and Industry Departmentin order to export the garments from Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> As explained above, in the context of the OPA, the stipulation that Harbour Fair was responsible for the Hong Kong Certificate ofOrigin was intended to mean that Harbour Fair had to provide the PNs which was a prerequisite for Long Art to obtain the necessaryexport licence. I do not think Long Art needs to rely on an implied term to establish that obligation; it was in my view alreadyexpressly stated in the e-mails, albeit in an abbreviated form.</p>    <p class="heading">Implied terms contended by Harbour Fair</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> In the Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim, Harbour Fair raised a number of implied terms.

He further expressly abandoned any reliance on "tradepractices" on which Harbour Fair had called no evidence.

(see <strong>B P Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v President, Councilors and Ratepayers of Shire of Hastings</strong> [1978] AJLR 20, at 26, cited with approval by the CFA in <strong>Kensland Realty Ltd v Whale View Investment Ltd and Another</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282001%29%204%20HKCFAR%20381" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2001) 4 HKCFAR 381</a> at 392).</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> Words like "in good time" and "of good quality" are admittedly ambiguous. However, if they mean "in reasonable time" and "of reasonablequality", I am satisfied that terms (1) and (2) can be implied.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> However, implied terms (3) and (4) were couched in such loose language and capable of giving rise to such varied meanings that Ido not believe the strict necessity test can be satisfied. In <strong>North Sea Energy Holdings NV v PTT</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 2 Lloyd's Rep 418</a>, Thomas J said at p. 430:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Although the Court will often readily imply a term that the parties should co-operate to ensure performance of their bargain, itis clear that such a term must satisfy the test for implication and that implication is not inevitable. ... what is made clear inall the cases is that a duty to co-operate will only arise if a term can be implied to that effect. Thus the issue is whether theimplied term for which MSH contend satisfies the legal test of <em>strict necessity</em>. In doing so, it is useful to apply the "officious bystander: or the "business efficacy" tests as an aid in this task (see <em>Society of Lloyd's v Clementson</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%20LRLR%20307" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] LRLR 307</a>, at p. 330). I must also have in mind the consideration that the law can enforce co-operation only in a limited degree and to theextent that is necessary to make the contract workable: see <em>Mona Oil Equipment and Supply Co. Ltd v Rhodesia Railways Ltd</em> (1949) 83 Ll L Rep 178 at 187)."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> As to implied term (5), I have no hesitation in rejecting it as an implied term as the involvement of Wai Lung was not envisagedat all at the time when the Contract was entered into.</p>    <p class="heading">Breach of contract by Long Art</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> Harbour Fair alleged that Long Art was itself in breach of the implied terms of the Contract and delayed the manufacturing processin the following ways:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) by delivering defective fabrics;</p>        <p>(2) by delivering Care Labels late;</p>        <p>(3) by defective studding work;</p>        <p>(4) by defective embroidery work;</p>        <p>(5) by delivering various other accessories, repacking instructions, etc late.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Defective fabrics</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> Based on the contemporaneous correspondence (in particular, the e-mail from Raymond dated 30 August 2000), the fabrics problem wasnot a serious one and Harbour Fair was content to resolve it by adding a surcharge of only HK$8,000.00. Further, even with the fabricsproblem, Raymond believed the delivery date need only be postponed to 8 October 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> There is no evidence to show that Raymond was wrong in his assessment and the fabrics problem turned out to be far more serious.In fact, as mentioned, Wu had initialed the letter dated 28 September 2000 which referred to the extended date of delivery of allgarments at 10 October 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> There was no complaint whatsoever about the fabrics problem made by Harbour Fair or Hung Kiu by e-mail or letter at all. Instead,Harbour Fair was content to send a debit note of HK$8,000.00 on 28 September 2000 as "charge for our worker separate cutting piece"and nothing more. In the various progress reports produced, there was no mention of defective fabrics or that defective fabrics hadcaused suspension or delay of work.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> In the light of such documentary evidence, I have no hesitation in accepting the evidence of Long Art's witnesses that the fabricsproblem was settled by the payment of HK$8,000.00 and that it only led to an extension of the delivery date to early October 2000.I accept their evidence that the slubs problems only affected a small percentage of the fabrics delivered and could be repaired byworkers.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> Monica's suggestion that the fabrics delivered by Long Art were all sub-standard is plainly inconsistent with the contemporaneousdocuments and Harbour Fair's very conduct at the material time. It also demonstrates the length she was prepared to go in tailoringher evidence to suit the defence argument.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> Monica also attempted to make a story out of the 200 additional yards of fabrics delivered by Long Art. I accept Joe's evidence thatthese additional fabrics were delivered out of caution in case some of the defective fabrics could not be remedied manually. I alsoaccept Mr Wong's submission that the fact that only 200 yards were delivered for this purpose goes to show the problem could nothave been a serious one.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> Notwithstanding these breaches, Harbour Fair still alleged they managed to complete and deliver the balance of the garments between5 and 12 November 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> For these reasons, I reject the defence suggestion that the late delivery of the 2,468 pieces and the non-delivery of the balancewas caused by the fabrics problem discovered in early August 2000.</p>    <p class="heading">Care Labels</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> It is significant to note that it has never been pleaded or mentioned in Monica's witness statement that Long Art's delay in deliveringcare labels had resulted in Harbour Fair's failure to deliver the garments on schedule. This argument cropped up for the first timewhen Monica gave evidence in chief.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> According to Monica, the late delivery of care labels had held up the production and although it was possible to sew the care labelsonto the main labels at a later time, it was inefficient to do so to the detriment of the workers' earnings.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> I have examined the shirts and jackets exhibited at this trial, although it might not be the most convenient way to do it, I am notconvinced that the care labels could not have been sewn onto the main labels at a subsequent stage of the manufacturing process.I further accept Joe's evidence that he had told Ah Yiu of Harbour Fair that the care labels could be subsequently sewn onto themain label.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> There is no dispute that the care labels were all delivered on or about 22 September 2000 albeit later than planned. Even if thecare labels were indeed delivered late and caused some delay in the production, this could be remedied within a short time.</p>    <p class="heading">Studding Work</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> Monica accepted that only about 600 pieces of garments required studding work and thus delay in the completion of studding work shouldnot hold up the production of the bulk of the garments.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> The contractor for studding work was one Shenzhen Mao Ling Embroidery Fashion House ("Mao Ling"). According to Mao Ling's records,only about 200 pieces were outstanding as at 3 October 2000, and only 70 pieces were outstanding as at 11 October 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> Sometimes studding work was found to be defective and garments were sent back to Mao Ling for re-studding. There were records betweenMao Ling and Hung Kiu showing that as at late October and early November there were still some garments requiring re-studding work.However, the number involved was at the most 131 pieces. Such a small number of shortfall could not possibly contribute to the latedelivery of the 2,468 pieces and the non-delivery of the 6,046 pieces.</p>    <p class="heading">Embroidery Work</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> As to embroidery work, the documentary evidence shows and Monica accepted that the majority of the embroidered garments had beendelivered on 8 September 2000 and that the last delivery (of just 68 pieces) were delivered on 14 October 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> Further, the majority of the embroidery work would be done on the component parts, and work on other parts could proceed simultaneously.Hence any delay on embroidery work need not result in any suspension of work.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> Thus, I do not think any delay in the completion of the embroidery work could have materially contributed to the late delivery ofthe 2,468 pieces and the non-delivery of the 6,046 pieces.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> It is worth repeating that had any defective studding or embroidery work been the cause of the delay, it is inconceivable that therewould have been no correspondence between Harbour Fair, Hung Kiu and Long Art covering the same. Further, it is Monica's assertionthat, despite the alleged delay in the completion of the studding and embroidery work, all the garments required by the Contractwere delivered to Hong Kong by 12 November 2000.</p>    <p class="heading">Accessories and re-packing instructions, etc</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> Mr Hung in his closing submissions said by 30 September 2000 Long Art was still revising the packing instructions and there werestill accessories being delivered well into October 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> However, it is not disputed the bulk of accessories had in fact been delivered by the end of September 2000. Those delivered in October2000 were confined to two items (shank buttons and pocket lining) and were of very small quantities. There is no evidence showingthat the late delivery of 2,468 pieces and the non-delivery of the remaining were caused by the late delivery of these small quantitiesof accessories.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> The effect of any instruction to re-pack the garments had been exaggerated. I cannot see how re-packing could have held up the deliveryin any significant way. The instructions to re-pack in November 2000 apparently was part of the expedient measure of delivery byinstalments necessitated by Harbour Fair's delay. I cannot see how Harbour Fair could have used it as a ground of complaint againstLong Art. In any event, according to Charles, the re-packing work would take just one to two days.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> There was never any complaint by Harbour Fair that the production or delivery was held up by reason of the late delivery of accessoriesor instructions to re-pack garments. Monica's evidence about difficulty in packaging was exaggerated and unreliable. Her allegationthat there were still accessories being delivered on as late as 24 November 2000 was absolutely empty and subsequently withdrawn.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> For the reasons given above, Long Art has made out it case and none of the defences raised by Harbour Fair avails. In the premises,the Counterclaim is dismissed. I now turn to the quantum of Long Art's claim.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> Of Long Art's three heads of claim, the air freight charges are clearly documented and beyond dispute. HK$28,093.30 was in respectof the 494 pieces and HK$109,137.70 in respect of the 1,974 pieces.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> As to the cost of materials, Mr Hung said Long Art has not produced any evidence that the suppliers of the fabrics and accessorieswere actually paid. I do not think Long Art has to produce such evidence in order to succeed. First, there is no reason for me todoubt that any of such materials had not been paid. Second, even if any of these materials had not been paid, the liability to paythem would be sufficient to buttress Long Art's claim in this regard.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> As to the claim for US$72,552.00 as a penalty imposed by APC for Long Art's inability to deliver the garments in accordance withthe order, the sum of US$72,552.00 was calculated on the basis that the APC order was for full sets of garments, i.e. matching shirts/jacketsand trousers, less the quantity delivered. The deduction of this sum was borne out in the inter-company reconciliation accounts anda payment advice dated 2 January 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> From the correspondence, Harbour Fair was clearly aware they were manufacturing only parts of the APC order, and Long Art had engagedother manufacturers to produce the matching trousers.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> Mr Hung cast doubt on this claim by arguing that Long Art's shareholders were somehow related to the APC and by attacking the documentation.However, for Mr Hung to succeed in this argument, he would have to prove a conspiracy between APC and Long Art to fabricate the claim,which he had expressly refrained from so doing. In my view, none of the allegations raised by Mr Hung in this regard can affect therecovery of this sum.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> Lastly, in his closing submission, Mr Wong made a concession that if judgment was entered in favour of Long Art, it was preparedto give credit for the sum of HK$22,735.00 in respect of the 494 pieces of garments which were delivered and unpaid.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> Accordingly, judgment is entered in favour of Long Art as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(1)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">HK$740,231.37, comprising HK$137,231.00 air freight charges and HK$625,735.37 cost of materials, less the sum of HK$22,735.00 whichLong Art agreed to deduct;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(2)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">US$72,552.00 being the penalty payment charged by APC; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(3)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">Interests on the two sums at the rate of 1% above prime from the date of writ to the date of this judgment and at judgment rate thereafteruntil payment.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> The Counterclaim is dismissed.
