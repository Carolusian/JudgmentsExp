On 6 January 2003, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants consented to judgment with costs of the action, such costs to encompass the plaintiffsâ costs against the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants, being entered against them by Sakhrani J for, inter alia, permanent injunctions to restrain each of them from furtherinfringing the plaintiffsâ copyright subsisting in three kitchen utensils.  The three products and the packaging copied were theMulti-Mixer (Model no. KS 2008), the Quick Chopper (Model no. 3003) and the 5-in-1 Grater (Model no. 3007).  The action was discontinuedagainst the remaining defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Pursuant to the consent judgment of Sakhrani J, the plaintiffs were entitled to apply for an inquiry as to damages, such to includeadditional damages, in respect of the infringement of copyright by the defendants.  The defendants were also ordered to pay all damagesfound to be due with interest.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The plaintiffs now seek damages to be quantified under the following heads, namely, loss of profits, price reduction, damage to reputationand additional damages under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528" class="autolink_findacts">Copyright Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528">Cap. 528</a>.</p>    <p>The evidence</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff Mr. Wong Yan Kwong (Mr. Wong), the sole live witness in these proceedings was extensively cross-examined.  Although clearlyexasperated at times by the experience and deeply frustrated by the blatant piracy of the defendants and its impact upon his business,he nonetheless came across as a truthful and reliable witness not given to exaggeration in any way.  His four affirmations, adoptedas his evidence in chief and expanded upon in evidence, provided the factual matrix of the case.  He was taken through copious documentssome of which he explained or elaborated upon in considerable detail.  I had no difficulty accepting his evidence and acting thereon. I also accepted as truthful and reliable the affirmation evidence of Tsang Yau Choo and Mui Ho Chow Eddie filed on the plaintiffsâbehalf for present purposes.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The defence essentially relied on the affirmed evidence of Wong Kai On, a production manager employed by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and on a number of documentary exhibits (D1a-d and D2a-p) adduced during the cross-examination of Mr. Wong.  It is patentfrom the evidence of Wong Kai On that despite having agreed to judgment, the defendants maintained denial that their three products,namely the Manual Food Processor model no. 2888 first offered for sale in Hong Kong in about November 1992, the Manual Food Processormodel no. 4888 first available for purchase in October 1997 and the revamped 6-in-1 Kitchen Grater model no. 2112 were copies ofthe plaintiffsâ products.  Instead, they were said to be of original designs albeit with input from similar products generallyavailable in the market.  Such assertion, however, runs contrary to the body of evidence.  That the 3 offending products and theirpackaging designs bore more than striking similarity to the plaintiffsâ goods is obvious even from a cursory visual comparison. That they were deliberately manufactured and packaged to look alike and offered for sale demonstrated, in my considered view, amanifest intention to compete unfairly in the same market place.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Mr. Wongâs evidence disclosed that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, a company incorporated in Hong Kong in March 1993 has been carrying on the business of design, manufacture and sale ofhousehold appliances.  Mr. Wong was principally concerned with designing and creating new products, a task for which he was suitablyqualified.  Being intimately involved in the running of the business, he was well placed to speak to the financial consequences ofthe defendantsâ infringement.  The 3 infringed products were among the companyâs best sellers, contributing significantly tobusiness turnovers in the years after incorporation to about 1997.  Business increased exponentially according to the unaudited accountsfrom a little over $12 million in 1994 to nearly $40 million by September 1997.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs products were widely advertised in the print and television media and were successfully marketed and sold in the Americas,Europe, Australia, Japan and the Middle East.  Quality designs, multi-functions, safety and other value-added features distinguishedthe 3 products in question from other knock-offs or appliances sold with generally similar functions.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> In early October 1995, the plaintiffs discovered that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant Hung Sang Metal Plastic Factory Ltd., (Hung Sang) had offered for sale by catalogue food processors that were almost identicalto the plaintiffsâ Quick Chopper.  A warning letter via solicitors dated 16 October 1995 was sent to Hung Sang in these terms:</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> <span>It has come to our clientsâ attention that the catalogue of one of your companyâs food processors advertising the classic modelNo. 4888 now for sale or offered for sale is substantially similar and/or identical to our clientsâ food processor protected underthe abovementioned Patents for Design and Registered Design, thereby constitutes an act of infringement and has caused substantialdamage to our clientâs interests.</span></p>    <p><span><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Our clients take a serious view on this matter and would not tolerate any further infringements of their registered and patenteddesign by you.  In the circumstances, we are instructed to give you warning notice that unless you undertake not to sell or offerfor sale the said model forthwith and execute an undertaking letter in our clientsâ favour and agree to reimburse our clientsâlegal costs within fourteen days (14 days) from the date hereof, legal proceedings shall be instituted against you without any furthernotice.</span></p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> This elicited a written response from Hung Sangâs lawyers.  The letter dated 26 October 1995 stated:</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> <span>We refer to our letter of today and advise that we are instructed by our client to inform you that one of its customers brought asample as advertised in our clientâs model No. 4888.  As our client liked the said sample, so our client placed it in our clientâssaid catalogue.</span></p>    <p><span><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> We are further instructed that our client had never reproduced or commenced work on the said model.</span></p>    <p><span><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Notwithstanding our client does not know what your clientâs Design is, our client agrees not to reproduce the said food processor,however, it is not prepared to pay your costs.</span></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The plaintiffs took no further action at the time.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> With the benefit of hindsight, it is plain on the evidence that the assurance was not worth the paper it was written on.  Wong KaiOn admitted that the defendants had photographed and advertised the food processor in question in the trade journal Hong Kong Enterpriseostensibly to test the market.  Albeit the evidence was silent on the public response, it must have been sufficiently encouragingto the defendants for them to have eventually proceeded to manufacture and market their model no. 4888, an illegal copy of the plaintiffsâQuick Chopper.  They said that only occurred in October 1997, two years after the exchange of solicitorsâ letters.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Mr. Chow, counsel for the defence submitted that the trade advertisement was no more than an invitation to treat.  As a matter ofcontract law that must be right.  Even though the evidence did not prove that infringement had begun from about October 1995 norwas it the plaintiffsâ case on their pleadings that it had, it demonstrated a cavalier attitude towards and a lack of respect forthe intellectual property rights of the plaintiffs on the part of the defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Unusually hard bargaining by an Italian customer in October 1997 soon alerted the plaintiffs to the defendantsâ infringement. The buyer had rejected out of hand the plaintiffsâ quoted price for the Multi-Mixer citing the availability of a much cheaper similarproduct from Central World, a customer of the plaintiffs.  Discussions with Central World ensued and it was eventually discoveredthat the supply source was none other than the defendants.  Legal advice was obtained and Fact Finders Ltd was engaged in early November1997 to conduct an enquiry into the activities of the defendants and of others suspected to have been offering products infringingthe plaintiffsâ copyright.  This exercise resulted in probative proof of the defendantsâ flagrant abuse for profit of the plaintiffâsintellectual property rights in the three kitchen gadgets, the subject of the ensuing proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The execution of an Anton Piller order in January 1998 resulted in the seizure of a plethora of documentation detailing the defendantsâpiracy of the plaintiffsâ 3 products.  The evidence retrieved included Sales Invoices, Purchase Orders by the defendantsâ customers,Vouchers, Contract Book, etc.  Such material offered compelling evidence of the defendantsâ systematic and profitable exploitationof the plaintiffsâ intellectual property.  It was, therefore, no surprise that the assessment exercise drew heavily from this material.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> I turn then to address the various heads of claim.</p>    <p>Loss Of Profits</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> It is trite law that the burden of proof rests entirely on the plaintiffs to establish their claim under all heads of damages pursuedeven where, as here, the defence has made no attempt to put forward a contrary case on quantum.  The defendants led no evidence onthe issue and was content simply to challenge the case put forward on quantum.  Even as to this, much of the evidence adduced bythe plaintiffs remained unquestioned.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> To begin, it is in order to visit the legal principles touching on quantification under this head of damage.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> As to loss of profitable sales, reference is made to The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. para 39.40.  It reads:</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> <span>A successful claimant in an infringement action is entitled to compensation for any harm caused to him which flows directly and naturallyfrom the tortious act.  In order for any particular head of damage to be recoverable, it must be shown that the infringement is theeffective cause of the loss. This has to be decided by the application of the courtâs common sense.  Although the onus is uponthe claimant to show what damage has been suffered, it is not necessary to prove any particular damage in order to succeed sincethe court will normally assume that the defendantâs wrongful acts have caused harm and if the quantification of it is difficult,or not susceptible of mathematical accuracy, a fair figure for compensation will be awarded.  In a case where the claimant is inthe business of reproducing and selling articles protected by the right he will obtain compensation for the profits he would havemade on any of the defendantâs sales which would otherwise have been made by him.</span></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Damages for infringement are to be liberally assessed as is apparent from the observation of Litton PJ in Oriental Press Group Ltd&amp; Anr v Apple Daily Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20HKLRD%20976" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 HKLRD 976</a>, 980:</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> <span>Damages under this head are compensatory: the award is intended to put the injured party in the same position as if the wrong hadnot occurred.  Copyright gives to the owner the exclusive right to control and exploit the subject matter, and use by the tortfeasorwithout licence represents an invasion of those rights.  Where such invasion is by a rival in business â one who competes in thesame market -- (the plaintiffs have so labeled the defendants in the instant case) the consequences are obviously more serious anddamages should, as a matter of common sense, be liberally assessed. (parenthesis mine)</span></p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The matter was further expanded upon by Lord Cooke of Thorndon at p.987E of the judgment.  He remarked:</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> <span>(T)he copyright owner is entitled to damages representing the harm done by the invasion of his right, it does not in itself providemuch guidance as to how to go about the task of assessment.  The aim is, as confirmed by Lord Wilberforce in the leading case of<i>General Tire and Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20RPC%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) RPC 197</a> at p. 212, to find the sum of money which will put the injured party in the same position as he would have been if he had not sustainedthe wrong.  That was a patent case, but the principle applied in it are equally applicable in copyright cases, subject only to anyquestion of additional damages and any problem that may arise in cases where the statutory right to conversion damages still applies.</span></p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> In Meters Ltd v Metropolitan Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281911%29%20RPC%20157" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1911) RPC 157</a> (a patent case), Fletcher Moulton LJ stated at p. 164:</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> <span>In the assessment of damages every instrument that is manufactured or sold, which infringes the rights of the patentee, is a wrongto him and I do not think that there is any case, nor do I think that there is any rule of law which says that the patentee is notentitled to recover in respect of each one of those wrongs.  The mode of assessing damages, which I admit is sometimes very convenient,whereby you calculate how many of the orders the plaintiff probably would have got, and then take the full manufacturing profit oneach article, and multiply the two together, does not contradict what I have said.  You may estimate the damage by taking the wholeof the infringing articles, and making an allowance in respect of each one, or you may consider how many he would have sold, andmake a full allowance in regard to those.  They are both, in proper cases, reasonable methods of ascertaining what he has lost. The latter is certainly only a rough practical method which, in some cases, may be efficient.  It rests on no theoretical basis,because in the eye of the law each article is a wrong.</span></p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The defendants have contended that it would neither be fair nor just to calculate damages simply by equating the defendantsâ salesof infringing articles with the plaintiffsâ loss.  I am sympathetic with this position as not all sales made by the defendantswould or must necessarily have been achievable by the plaintiffs.  It is a question of evidence and inference, common sense, andabove-all, supply and demand.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> I wholly accept that the 3 kitchen utensils were an important and lucrative part of the plaintiffsâ sales inventory.  They werenew products generating significant income for the plaintiffs even when discounts had been offered.  They were described as bestsellers.  The impact of the defendantsâ infringing products on the plaintiffsâ business was monumental as Mr. Wong described. The infringement deleteriously affected pricing, discount and annual business turnovers.  Mr. Wong described Hung Sang as a keyplayer, competitor and latterly leading infringer in the same market.  Whilst it is obvious that there had been cheaper productsin the market for a number of years prior to the malfeasance of the defendants with the consequential pressure on the plaintiffsto offer some discounting on sales, these products were generally similar only in respect of functions.  The products displayed inthe Trade Development Council catalogues produced by the defence fall within such description.  They are by and large inexpensivecommon garden-variety kitchen utensils, hardly products that can be viewed as serious contenders for the plaintiffsâ high-end qualitygoods.  If any serious comparison is to be undertaken, it is only right that like be compared with like.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The defendants had taken great pains to market products bearing striking resemblance to the plaintiffsâ products in functions,designs and packaging.  A compelling inference must be that they were obviously targeting the same consumers.  They were after thesame piece of pie.  Were it otherwise, why one may ask did they bother to copy the packaging designs as well?</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> In attempting to minimize damage, the defendants drew attention to suits brought by the plaintiffs against other infringers.  Thisis a material consideration and will be taken on board.  However, the fact that there were other infringers before, during and afterthe defendantsâ tort in no way lessens the gravity of their conduct.  It of course bears upon the issue whether all sales madeby them should be attributed to the plaintiffs as loss of profit.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Mr. Sakhrani, counsel for the plaintiffs provided very helpful submissions and calculations at the closing stage of the proceedings. I have checked his figures by reference to the relevant exhibits and they are found to be correct.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Mr. Wong was painstakingly taken through the defendantsâ Pro Forma Invoices, Purchase Orders, Debit Notes and Contract Book fromwhich a tabulated summary of the defendantsâ infringement was compiled.  The tables exhibited in affirmation as WYK-56 and producedat Bundle 1 page 335 details the sales made by the defendants and the profit loss suffered in consequence by the plaintiffs.  Theplaintiffsâ calculation was based on all invoices exhibited and can safely be relied upon.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Mr. Chow submitted that not all entries in the Contract Book should be equated with actual sales by the defendants.  I do not agree. Where a transaction has been cancelled, the document would say so as much.  The Contract Book as indeed the documents taken followingthe execution of the Anton Piller order are primary evidence of the extent of the defendantsâ tortious acts.  They speak for themselvesand may be qualified, explained or even challenged by other evidence which the defence chose not to lead.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Mr. Wong clearly explained the mechanics employed by the plaintiffs to establish Unit Price, Actual Selling Price, Discounting, ProfitMargin, Gross Profit Margin and Annual Turnovers.  There was nothing vague about his evidence in this regard.  I wholly accept hisevidence.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Premised upon the tables, it was submitted that the plaintiffsâ loss of profits amounted to $2,543,312.19.  The defence producedtheir own calculations which are wholly understated in my view and does not sit squarely with the evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Realistically, it will be impossible to conclude that the plaintiffs would have sold the same number of products but for the tortpractised by the defendants.  The plaintiffs offered a 10% reduction.  The defence argued that there was no evidence of an unsatisfieddemand for the plaintiffsâ genuine articles.  Perhaps this is strictly true.  But it must be a matter of inference.  The mere factthat the defendants were copying and selling near identical products must give rise to an inference that there must have been a lucrativemarket for the plaintiffsâ goods.  The defendants took the risk because it must have been perceived to be profitable.  No one inhis right mind would have done otherwise, seasoned businessmen particularly.  </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Bearing in mind the presence of other infringers (see exh. D1) and the fact that the plaintiffs was able to continue sales of the3 utensils at a time when the defendants were busily selling copies, I consider that a discount in the region of 30% would be fairand proper.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Accordingly, for loss of profits, I award $2,543,312.19 less 30% or $1,780,318.53.</p>    <p>Price Reduction</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Where a plaintiff has been forced to lower prices in the face of infringement, he is entitled to be suitably compensated: per CozensHardy MR in the Meters case, supra.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Price discounting is a normal feature of commercial trade with competition being one of the most salient causes.  Mr. Wong acceptedthat customers have on occasions requested a lowering of price.  He would accede to or reject the requests as circumstances dictated. It would be the result of a commercial decision being taken.  It is quite another matter where he felt there was little option todo otherwise in the face of unwarranted and unfair competition as he described.  To stay in business and hopefully to profit at thesame time, prices were in fact reduced on account of the defendantsâ breach of copyright.  Hung Sang had plainly made businessmost difficult for the plaintiffs on the evidence which I have accepted.  At one stage, Mr. Wong testified that the very survivalof the business was at stake.  It was his evidence that a minimum profit margin of 25% was needed to see any profit at all.  Creating,designing and testing new products were time consuming and costly.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The defendants contended that in the presence of other infringers and the absence of any evidence of their impact upon the plaintiffs,they should not be held accountable for any price reduction suffered.  Alternately, damages should be considerably reduced as pertheir tables submitted in final submissions.  However, one must not lose sight of the fact that they represented a most significantthreat to the plaintiffs, having chosen to target the same market for quality kitchenwares.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The plaintiffs took as a starting point the unit prices of the 3 infringed products for 1997 to demonstrate the effect of pricingover that year and 1998.  A one-year timeline was adopted with which the defence took issue.  It is thoroughly unrealistic to suggestthat price reduction would end immediately upon cessation of infringement following the issue of the permanent injunctions.  Theconsequence and effect of the defendantsâ illegal activities do not end overnight.  Prices need time to recover.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> A most detailed tabulated summary for the 3 products was handed up at the close of proceedings.  It was helpfully explained.  I amsatisfied that the summary properly reflected the evidence on price reduction for the period in question.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Under this head of damages, the plaintiffs granted a discount of 50% which seems fair and justified in all the circumstances.  Thenet amount claimed is $1,863,200.53.  This is the amount I shall award under this section.</p>    <p>Damage To Reputation</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> The plaintiffsâ turnovers for the three products for 1997 and 1998 after conversion to Hong Kong Dollars at the rate of HK$ 7.8to the US Dollar came to $24, 951,943.06 and $34,253,316.86.  When these two figures are averaged, the average turnover for the twoyears was $29,602,629.96.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> One Price Trading Co Ltd v Leung Chui Mui (unrep., HCA 2327 of 1997), a decision of Master B. Kwan is illustrative of the properapproach to assessment under this head of claim.  The learned Master had this to say in relation to the guiding principles:</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> <span>In assessing the award for damage to reputation, the authorities clearly establish that the court must consider all the circumstancesof the case and try its best to arrive at a fair and temperate sum for the injury (see Draper v Trist which was applied in the HongKong case of Xiang Si Hu v Bailey Record Co Ltd).  In this respect, it is, as Goddard LJ in Draper v Trist said, similar to an actionfor libel.  In my view, in making an assessment, the court is entitled to take into consideration the following circumstances: Plaintiffâsreputation or goodwill; the conduct of the defendant, whether, for example, the passing-off is fraudulent or deliberate; the circulationof the passing-off items or goods; the publicity given by the defendant to his items or goods; the fact that the defendant has madea gain out of the passing-off; and the effect on the plaintiff or loss to himâ¦</span></p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> (Having reviewed the evidence before her, the master concluded)</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> <span>â¦I find that a figure representing one to two percent of the plaintiffâs turnover at the time the defendant ceased buying fromthe plaintiff to be a fair and temperate sum for the injuryâ¦</span></p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> In the instant case, there was undoubtedly a deliberate and fraudulent interference with the plaintiffsâ copyright and for goodprofit.  The infringing goods were on close examination of poorer quality and construction.  The materials used to fashion them wereof a lower standard.  The Plaintiffs have over a considerable number of years at much cost and time painstakingly built up a localand international reputation for quality products that were safe to use and of impeccable designs.  The defendantsâ by coming alongwith cheap imitations have assailed that reputation in my view.  An award under this head is clearly called for.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> A temperate and fair sum on the plaintiffsâ calculations of $444,039.45 being an average of between 1% and 2% of the average turnoverfor the period seems the right recompense.  I award this sum as well.</p>    <p>Additional Damages</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> This claim is premised on s. 17(3) of the Copyright Act 1956 and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 108(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528" class="autolink_findacts">Copyright Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528">Cap 528</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Where appropriate, the court is permitted to award such additional damages as the justice of the case warrants.  In considering whetheror not to exercise such jurisdiction, the following matters need to be examined.  They are the flagrancy of the infringement (whichis only too obvious in this case as the defendants must have been aware of the rights of the plaintiffs at all material times), anybenefit accruing to the defendant by reason of the infringement (the defendants have made considerable gain by selling the knock-offswithout any costs incurred for design), and the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the defendantâs business accounts andrecords (this factor obtains in the present litigation).</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> I was invited to make an award representing 10% of the assessed damages on the authority of Microsoft Corp v Able System DevelopmentLtd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%203%20HKLRD%20515" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 3 HKLRD 515.</a>  The request is eminently justified on the evidence and I shall do so accordingly.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Previously assessed damages under the different heads aggregate at $4,087,558.51.  10% thereof comes to $408,755.85.
