The third defendant is their son. I will refer tothe Plaintiff as the <u>husband</u> and the first defendant as the <u>wife</u>. This case is concerned with property rights in four premises which belong beneficially to the husband and wife in common, but wereregistered in the name of the wife alone. They are:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(a)    Ground floor shop and cockloft No.2 Fat Tseung Street, Kowloon ('Fat Tseung Street');</p>            <p>(b)    Flat F 2nd floor, 78 Un Chau Street, Kowloon ('Un Chau Street');</p>            <p>(c)    Flat C 3rd floor and flat roof, South Ocean Building, 286-300 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon ('Cheung Sha Wan Road');</p>            <p>(d)    Workshop C 8th floor, Wah Wing Industrial Building, 14-20 Wing Yip Street, Kwai Chung ('Wing Yip Street').</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Fat Tseung Street comprises a ground floor shop with a frontage of about 14 feet, measuring about 800 square feet in area, with acockloft of the same dimension (the cockloft is in effect a mezzanine floor) and a rear yard of about 290 square feet.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Un Chau Street is a domestic flat on the second floor of a multi-storied building in Sham Shui Po, measuring about 670 square feetwith an enclosed balcony of about 140 square feet.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Cheung Sha Wan Road is a flat on the third floor of a multi-storied building, measuring about 370 square feet together with a flatroof of about 84 square feet.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Wing Yip street is a unit on the eight floor of a flatted factory building in Kwai Chung, measuring about 2,680 square feet.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> On 16 December 1983, in proceedings taken out under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/182" class="autolink_findacts">Married Persons Status Ordinance</a>, Mr Justice Power after a hotly contested hearing lasting 6 days made an order in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>That Wing Yip Street be sold and that the proceeds be divided equally between the husband and the wife, the sale to be left in abeyancewith liberty to apply. The wife was ordered to pay the husband's costs.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Later, on 12 March 1984, Mr Justice Power, upon the conclusion of further proceedings between the husband and wife (taken out inthe divorce jurisdiction of the High Court) made an order that the wife do transfer a half-interest to the husband in each of thefollowing properties:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(a)    Fat Tseung Street</p>            <p>(b)    Un Chau Street and</p>            <p>(c)    Cheung Sha Wan Road</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Further orders for costs were made against the wife.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> I will refer to the three properties the subject of the order of 12 March 1984 as 'the three premises'.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The wife appealed against Mr Justice Power's order of 12 March 1984, but the prosecution of the appeal was much delayed. On 14 February1986 (nearly two years after the order for transfer of a half-share in the three premises) Master Wooley dismissed the wife's applicationto set the appeal down for hearing, and on 7 April 1986 Mr Justice Rhind dismissed the wife's appeal against Master Wooley's order.Further orders for costs were made against the wife.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> There were thereafter further proceedings and on 28 July 1986 Mr Justice Power made an order in the consolidated proceedings (HighCourt M.P. No.726 of 1979 and High Court D.J. No.35 of 1981) that one half of each of the three premises be <u>transferred forthwith</u> to the husband.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> One would have expected that after such delay the implementation of Mr Justice Power's order of 28 July 1986 would have been immediate.Nothing of the kind. The wife could not have been in doubt as to her legal position, for she was during all that time under the adviceof solicitors - Messrs Kwan and Kwan. She must have known that, under the order of 16 December 1983, she held an undivided half-sharein Wing Yip Street in trust for her husband, and that pending the sale of Wing Yip Street she was accountable to the husband as toone half of the rents and profits from Wing Yip Street. The wife must also have known that, under the order of 12 March 1984, sheheld the legal estate in the three premises in trust for herself and the husband in equal shares and that, being a trustee, she wasliable to account to the husband for half of the rents and profits of the three premises. She might not have liked the orders: presumably,that was why she incurred the expenses of an appeal. But so long as the orders of the Court stood, her legal liabilities were clear.She was a trustee of the premises as to half-share.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Following Mr Justice Power's order of 28 July 1986, there was protracted correspondence between the Legal Aid Department acting forthe husband and Messrs Kwan and Kwan the solicitors for the wife. The correspondence dealt with the machinery for effecting the saleof Wing Yip Street and also dealt with the question of transfer of a half-interest in the three premises. Whilst there might havebeen difficulties regarding the details of the sale of Wing Yip Street (the order of 16 December 1983, unfortunately, providing nomachinery for that purpose) nothing could have been simpler as regards the transfer of a half-interest in the three premises to thehusband. But the months passed. The wife did not comply with the order of 28 July 1986. The conclusion is quite inevitable that thewife had formed the firm intention to do whatever she could to frustrate the execution of the orders of the Court, and to depriveher former husband of what the Court had, in those proceedings, adjudicated were the lawful entitlements of the husband. Eventually,a half-share in the three premises was transferred to the husband, but not by the wife, as the order of 28 July 1986 required. On23 January 1987, pursuant to an order made under Order 45 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/182/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 8</a> of the RSC the Registrar of the Supreme Court executed the assignment of the half-shares in favour of the husband in the name ofthe wife.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> In today's terms, the four premises, if offered for sale on the open market with vacant possession, are liable to fetch about $4million. And yet, the husband is destitute. He has not received any benefit whatever from these properties and because the husband'scosts in the previous and protracted proceedings have never been paid by the wife, as ordered by the court, the wife's share of thefour premises is likely to be charged with heavy liability for costs.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> With what I have just said by way of background and introduction, I move on now to examine the transactions which have given riseto the present proceedings.</p>    <p><u>The Tenancies</u></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> It will be recalled that in February 1986 Master Wooley had dismissed the wife's application to set the appeal down for hearing.The wife must have realised, by about that time, that the game was up as far as delays in court proceedings were concerned, and thatthe implementation of the order of 12 March 1984 could not be further postponed. What happened then was as follows: the wife, incollaboration with her son, the 3rd defendant, purported to grant tenancies of the four premises upon terms which, they must haveknown, were extremely disadvantageous to the husband, if such terms were to take effect. I will now go into the details of thesetenancies.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> These tenancies have the following common features:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(1)    Each was for three years, with an option to renew for another three years, at an increased rent of 20%.</p>            <p>(2)    Each was in standard form, in Chinese, the handwritten part of each being filled in by D3.</p>            <p>(3)    The purported rent was as follows:</p>            <p><u>Fat Tseung Street</u>                              $3,000 per month</p>            <p><u>Un Chau Street</u>                                  $1,000 per month</p>            <p><u>Cheung Sha Wan Road</u>                      $1,000 per month</p>            <p><u>Wing Yip Street</u>                                 $2,000 per month</p>            <p>(4)    The purported tenants and dates of the tenacies were as follows:</p>            <p><u>Premises</u>                                          <u>Tenant</u>                                      <u>Date</u></p>            <p>Fat Tseung Street                             D2                                           1 4 86</p>            <p>Un Chau Street                                 D3                                          15 4 86</p>            <p>Cheung Sha Wan Road                     D4                                          1 5 86</p>            <p>Wing Yip Street                                 D4                                         1 8 86</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> I will now go into the details concerning these premises.</p>    <p><u>Fat Tseung Street</u></p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> These are valuable premises (a ground floor shop and cockloft, with a rear yard) located near a market in Sham Shui Po. The two expertwitnesses called by the Plaintiff to give evidence as to value were both impressive witnesses: they were Miss Wong Sin-yee of MessrsA G Wilkinson, chartered surveyors, and Mr Ian Cullen of Messrs Ian Cullen &amp; Associates, chartered surveyors. They made independentvaluations, without prior consultation with each other. Miss Wong's report is dated 15 November 1988 and Mr Cullen's report is dated8 July 1988. Property values in Sham Shui Po have been rising rapidly from 1986 and, given the fact that the two valuations werenot made at the same time, differences in valuation become quite inevitable. Moreover, many factors go into the computation beforean opinion as to value can be formed; I would not therefore have expected Miss Wong and Mr Cullen to have arrived at identical figures,assuming that the valuations had been done at the same time. There were a considerable number of comparable sales of shop premisesin the Sham Shui Po area near the market. But, of course, some degree of fine tuning was necessary in order to adjust for differencesin locality, the age of the building, the time of the transaction etc. Moreover, a shop with a wider street frontage tends to bemore valuable than one with a narrower frontage. Further, the fact that the mezzanine floor of Fat Tseung Street is, in effect, acockloft (with a very low ceiling height) tends to have a depreciating effect. Having taken into account all relevant factors, theopinions of Miss Wong and Mr Cullen as regards the present day capital value of Fat Tseung Street, with vacant possession, is asfollows:</p>    <p>Miss Wong (Messrs A G Wilkinson)                                                              $2.3 million</p>    <p>Mr Cullen (Messrs Tan Cullen &amp; Associates)                                                  $1.9 million</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> It would be reasonably safe to conclude that the value of Fat Tseung Street, with vacant possession, is approximately $2 million.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> In 1978 Fat Tseung Street had been let by the wife to tenants for four years (expiring 15 February 1982) at a monthly rental of $4,500.This tenancy (dated 17 January 1978) was registered in the Land Office. On 19 January 1982 a further tenancy for three years wasentered into between the wife as lessor and the same lessees for a further three years at a monthly rental of $11,000 commencingon 15 February 1982. This tenancy was likewise registered. The name of one of the two joint tenants is Chor Yee.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> The evidence regarding the actual occupiers of Fat Tseung Street is obscure. The wife elected to give no evidence in these proceedings.There is some evidence to the effect that there is a sub-tenant occupying part of the Fat Tseung Street premises; his name is LeungKam Hoi and an attempt was made to secure his attendance in court as a witness by subpoena. Leung Kam Hoi did, in fact, attend courtin response to the subpoena and a Legal Aid officer was able to obtain a statement from him outside court. However, for reasons whichhave never been explained, Leung Kam Hoi left the precincts of the court before he was called as a witness and attempts to securehis attendance by proceedings taken out under Order 52 were unsuccessful. In these circumstances, I permitted the written statementmade by the Legal Aid officer to be put in evidence and, from this, it appears that Leung Kam Hoi is the sub-tenant of Chor Yee,paying a monthly rent of $9,100 for part of the premises. I assume that Leung Kam Hoi is a sub-tenant of only a <u>part</u> of Fat Tseung Street because, in a rent receipt dated 15 October 1988, signed by Chor Yee which was also put in evidence (exhibitP10) the rent of $9,100 a month was said to relate to the ground floor and <u>rear</u> cockloft of Fat Tseung Street.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> One thing seems reasonably clear: at all times from early 1978 and, in all probabilities, continuing up to today, the principal tenantof Fat Tseung Street has been Chor Yee (or, perhaps more accurately Chor Yee and a co-tenant named Kwan Bing Hang). In accounts purportedlyrendered by the wife to the husband regarding Fat Tseung Street the wife admitted that the rental income which she had derived fromFat Tseung Street was $6,000 per month. I do not, for a moment, believe that the monthly rental income was only $6,000. Accordingto the tenancy which she executed with her own hand, and dated 19 January 1982, the monthly rental was $11,000. But whether it beonly $6,000, as upon her own admission, or $11,000 (as the concrete documentary evidence indicates) the tenancy for three years infavour of the second defendant, at a monthly rent of $3,000, commencing from 1 April 1986, with an option to renew for a furtherthree years at an increased rental of 20%, is so grossly disadvantageous to the owners of the property that I am inclined to hold,without examination of the surrounding circumstances, that the purported tenancy is a sham.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> But the surrounding circumstances reek of fraud. The tenancy agreement is made out in a standard form in the Chinese language: aform easily purchased in the streets. The handwritten parts of the form were filled in by the son, the third defendant. There isno signature of the tenant; there is only a Chinese chop with the name 'Yuen Fung Kiu' and a purported Identity Card number. Thethird defendant who gave evidence in these proceedings said that this letting of Fat Tseung Street was obtained by his mother, thefirst defendant, through brokers. I was, at one time, inclined to doubt whether such a person known as Yuen Fung Kiu ever existed,but as an acknowledgement of service has been lodged on behalf of the second defendant of that name, I assume that there is sucha person. However, what is clear is that there was no arms-length transaction between the wife (D1) and D2, as D3 in his testimonywould have me believe. The defence filed on behalf of D2 is a bare denial of the allegations of the plaintiff. It is clear from allthe evidence that a rental of $3,000 per month in respect of the shop and cockloft at Fat Tseung Street is an extremely favourabledeal for the tenant. If D2 had entered into the transaction innocently, without notice of the wife's attempt to overreach the husband'sinterests, one would have expected D2 to have come forward to defend her position. After all, according to the tenancy, she has aright of renewal for three years from April 1989 at an extremely favourable rent. And yet, D2 has not appeared in Court to defendthe claims against her.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Given all the circumstances of the case, I have no hesitation whatever in holding, which I do, that the purported tenancy agreementin relation to Fat Tseung Street is a sham. It is a device concocted by D1 and D3, in a most clumsy fashion, to defeat the husband'sbeneficial interest in the property. D2 lent her name to the transaction and became a party to the fraudulent scheme. There was putin evidence by the first defendant a valuation report for Fat Tseung Street made by a Mr Laurence Pang Ho-chuen dated 9 September1987 who expressed the view that the open market rental value of Fat Tseung Street, as at 1 April 1986, was the sum of $8,000 permonth. This was a bare expression of opinion, not backed up by any comparable transactions, and the report is presented in such away as to render it impossible for the court to test the basis of that opinion. Mr Pang was not called as a witness in these proceedings.In these circumstances, I place little reliance upon Mr Pang's report except to say that it goes to reinforce, once again, the viewthat the purported rental of $3,000 per month paid by the second defendant is way below the market rent.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Nothing in the evidence remotely supports the proposition that the Fat Tseung Street premises were ever let to D2.</p>    <p><u>Un Chau Street</u></p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> There were many comparable transactions of domestic flats in Sham Shui Po which enabled the valuers to reach a very close approximationof the present day value of Un Chau Street. Miss Wong estimated the present day value of Un Chau Street, with vacant possession,at $620,000; Mr Cullen at $590,000. In my judgment, $600,000 would be about right.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> By the purported tenancy of 15 April 1986 the Un Chau Street flat was purportedly let to the third defendant at $1,000 per month.If genuine, this would have been a gross under-value: as D3 virtually admitted in the witness box when he said that he did not leasethe <u>entire</u> flat from his mother Dl: he only rented a cubicle at $1,000 per month. And yet, the tenancy agreement purports to be a grant of possessionto the whole flat for three years, with an option to renew for a further three years. Miss Wong and Mr Cullen, in their respectivereports, arrived at the figure of $3,800 as the monthly market rental for the flat in April 1986. I have no doubt that they are correctin their valuation. The valuation of Mr Laurence Pang Ho-chuen, put in by Dl, put the market value of the flat as at 15 April 1986at $3,100. Again, there are no comparables to justify this valuation, nor any assessment of the capital value of the flat againstwhich the figure of $3,7.00 per month can be assessed. I reject Mr Pang's valuation in favour of the valuations of Miss Wong andMr Cullen.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> It can be seen that even at Mr Laurence Pang's valuation, the figure of $1,000 per month appearing in the Un Chau Street tenancyis derisory. I have no hesitation in holding that the tenancy is a sham and represents a clumsy attempt by D1 and D3 to overreachthe beneficial interest of the husband in the flat.</p>    <p><u>Cheung Sha Wan Road</u></p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Valuation of the Cheung Sha Wan flat was made difficult by the fact that the use of the flat has been in breach of the terms of theoccupation permit. The flat (370 square feet together with an 84 square foot flat roof) is on the third floor of a 12-storey compositebuilding. There are eight domestic units on the third floor, but the flat in question appears to have been used at all material timesunlawfully for commercial purposes. For this reason, there is a considerable variance between the capital value put on the flat byMiss Wong and by Mr Cullen. Miss Wong gives the present capital value, with vacant possession, at $440,000, Mr Cullen at $300,000.I am inclined to adopt the lower of these figures.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> As regards the rental value of Cheung Sha Wan Road on 1 August 1986 (the date of the purported tenancy in favour of D4) Miss Wongputs it at $2,900 and Mr Cullen at $2,500.</p>    <p>Whichever figure is taken, it is plain that the purported tenancy in favour of D4 at a figure of $1,000 per month is way below themarket value.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Similar to D2, D4 never appeared before the Court in these proceedings. Her defence is a bare denial. D3, in the witness box, alsoclaims that his mother D1 had secured this tenancy through brokers. I have no doubt whatever that this was not an arms-length commercialtransaction. A Legal Aid officer who visited the Cheung Sha Wan premises in 1987 found that it was being used as the premises ofYin Tak Silverware Company. A subpoena addressed to a Mr Lui, proprietor of Yin Tak Silverware Company, failed to secure the attendanceof Mr Lui as a witness in these proceedings. In these circumstances, I permitted counsel to adduce heresay evidence to the effectthat Mr Lui looked to D1 as his landlady. There is no suggestion whatsoever that D4 had any interest in these premises.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> I have no hesitation in holding that the purported tenancy in favour of D4 was a sham, concocted between D1 and D3 in order to overreachthe interests of the husband, to which D4 was a party. If she were an innocent third party who had entered into a commercial tenancyagreement with D1 at $1,000 per month in respect of these premises, it would be extraordinary that she did not come forward to defendher interest. Even according to Mr Laurence Pang Ho-chuen, the open market rental value of these premises at 1 August 1986 wouldhave been $2,600 per month. In my judgment D4 did not come forward to defend her interest because she had no interest to defend:she was used as a tool by D1, and she knew it.</p>    <p><u>Wing Yip Street</u></p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The open market value of this workshop on the 8th floor of Wah Wing Industrial Building, with vacant possession, as of today, wasestimated as follows:</p>    <p>Miss Wong (A G Wilkinson)                                                           $1.4 million</p>    <p>Mr Cullen (Ian Cullen &amp; Associates)                                                $1.13 million</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> I put the present day market value of Cheung Sha Wan Road at about $1.2 million.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> As regards the open market rental value of Cheung Shan Wan Road as at 1 May 1986, Miss Wong puts it at $7,600 per month and Mr Cullenat $6,500 per month. It is plain therefore that a tenancy in favour of D4 at $2,000 per month is a gross undervalue.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> There is, in fact, strong and direct evidence of an attempt to overreach as regards Wing Yip Street. An employee of a company calledOmnichem Trading Company, a Miss Yip, was called to give evidence. Her evidence was to this effect. The company is presently thetenant of the Cheung Sha Wan Road premises; the current tenancy is for three years from 1 July 1987 at a rent of $7,000 per month;although the 'landlord' under that tenancy was purportedly Yim Chui Ling, D4, in fact Miss Yip who primarily dealt with the paymentof rent had never come across Yim Chui Ling. However, she recognised D1 and D3 in court and said that it was D3 who generally wentto collect the rent and that when the tenancy agreement (exhibit P6) was being prepared, it was D1 who negotiated with her. She (MissYip) thought that Dl was the 'landlady of the unit on the 8th floor'. The rent was paid by means of cheques and it was Dl and D3who asked Miss Yip, in making out the cheques, not to cross out the 'bearer' on the cheque.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Mr Laurence Pang Ho-chuen put the open market rental value of Wing Yip Street as at 1 May 1986 at $4,500 per month. No comparablefigures were produced to justify this valuation, nor was there any material put before the Court by which a comparison with the capitalvalue could be made. I do not accept Mr Pang's valuation but, as can be seen, even on his figures, the purported rent of $2,000 permonth in favour of D4 is a gross undervalue.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> I have no hesitation in concluding that the purported tenancy of Wing Yip Street was concocted by Dl and D3 in order to overreachthe interest of the husband, to which D4 was a knowing party.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> As regards Wing Yip Street, this attempt to overreach was particularly serious. It will be recalled that as early as December 1983there was an order for the sale of Wing Yip Street, the proceeds to be divided evenly between the husband and D1. Eventually, on23 March 1987, the property was put up for auction. The problem was that, as at that time, the premises were apparently encumberedwith the tenancy in favour of D4, with an option to renew from 1 May 1989 for three years at the rent of $2,400 per month. The highestprice bid for the premises was $400,000, and the premises were accordingly withdrawn from the market unsold. It can be seen thatthe purported tenancy in favour of D4 has had a severely depreciating effect on the value of the Wing Yip Street premises.</p>    <p><u>Assignments of Half-Interest</u></p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> The wife, instead of obeying the order of 28 July 1986 (requiring her <u>forthwith</u> to transfer a half-share in the three premises to the husband) executed assignments of half shares as follows:</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Premises                                      <u>Assignee</u>                                      <u>Date</u></p>    <p>Fat Tseung Street                              3rd defendant                              1 October 1986</p>    <p>Un Chau Street                                 4th defendant                               1 October 1986</p>    <p>Cheung Sha Wan Road                     3rd defendant                              3 November 1986</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> The solicitor who prepared all three assignments and acted for both assignor and assignee was Mr L H Kwan, whose offices were inthe same building as the offices of the wife's solicitors, Messrs Kwan and Kwan. In the assignment of the half-share in favour ofD4, she was described as a 'spinster of Flat F, third floor, 78 Un Chau Street, Kowloon' and purportedly purchased the half sharefor $70,000. There is no evidence as to who 'Yim Chui Ling' was, beyond the fact that, earlier, she had become allegedly the tenantof the Wing Yip Street and Cheung Sha Wan Road properties. According to D3, she was a total stranger prior to these transactions,as far as he was concerned. And yet, according to the assignment, she apparently paid $70,000 for an undivided half-share of theUn Chau Street flat. Why anyone would have wanted to pay $70,000 for an undivided half-share in the flat has never been explained:particularly someone who, if she had inspected the Land Office register, would have known that there was the order of 12 March 1984affecting the property.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> As regards the transfers of half-shares in Fat Tseung Street and Cheung Sha Wan Road by the wife to D3, D3 said that he paid 'cash'at the solicitors offices to his mother and that he regarded these transactions as pure investments in real estate. The solicitor,Mr L H Kwan, who apparently witnessed the execution of the assignments, was never called as a witness. I reject D3's evidence onthis point. I do not believe for a moment that he paid any money to his mother as alleged and it was certainly not an investmentin real estate as he alleged.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> The wife is an old and illiterate woman. To what extent she fully appreciated that what she was doing was in wilful and in deliberatecontempt of court is not something which I need to adjudicate upon in this case. But D3 is an intelligent young man and his participationin this clumsy scheme with his mother to injure the interests of the plaintiff, by taking an assignment of a half-interest from themother in two of the three properties, is unworthy of him. What purpose he thought he was achieving by this clumsy device I do notknow. The outcome is that he is now the registered co-owner together with the husband in respect of the Fat Tseung Street propertyand the Cheung Sha Wan Road property, and unless he consents to a sale of these premises there will simply be further proceedingsunder the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352" class="autolink_findacts">Partition Ordinance</a> and, inevitably, an order for sale by the Court: the premises being in the meanwhile yet further charged with legal costs. If thereever was a self-defeating exercise in futility, then what the mother and son have done in this case is a prime example of it.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> I should add that if reinforcement of my conclusion that D2, D3 and D4 were knowing participants in breaches of trust be necessary,this can be found in the following facts: on 28 January 1987 Messrs P H Sin &amp; Co wrote to 'the tenant' of the three premisesgiving notice that the assignment of the half-shares had been made by the Regisrar, and requiring the tenant to account for halfthe rent to the Plaintiff. This was followed by letters of 9 February 1987 addressed to each of D2, D3 and D4 requiring them to payhalf the rent to the Plaintiff under the purported tenancy agreements. Not surprisingly, these letters have been totally ignored.</p>    <p><u>Legal Liability of the Parties</u></p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> The wife was, at all material times, a trustee. From the time that the High Court adjudicated upon the rights of the husband andwife in the four premises, the wife was fixed with the liabilities of a trustee, holding the legal estate in respect of the fourpremises in trust for herself and the husband in equal shares. As regards Wing Yip Street, this was from 16 December 1983, when MrJustice Power made the order of that date. As regards the three other premises, this was from 12 March 1984 when Mr Justice Powerordered the wife to transfer a half-interest in the premises to the husband. From those dates onwards, the wife was under a liabilityto account to the husband for a half-share of the rents and profits and to exercise care so that the husband's interest in the propertiesshould not be damaged. The wife failed totally in the discharge of those duties. She failed to account and, from about the time whenshe realised that her delaying tactics in court would fail, she did everything possible to impede and frustrate the implementationof the court orders.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> D1 is plainly liable in damages to the husband. In the writ in this case there is an alternative claim for accounts and enquiriesbut I do not see what purpose would be served if I were to make an order in those terms. Assume that I made an order that the defendantshould, within, say, 21 days, make an affirmation and file the same in court stating the details of what rents and profits she hasreceived from the four properties since the dates mentioned above, what is the likely effect? Almost certainly, given the historyof this unfortunate matter, it would lead to further acts of contempt of court. There would then have to be contempt proceedings,and the court's punitive powers invoked. There would be further expense and delay. What the Plaintiff seeks is not the punishmentof his former wife; he requires effective remedies so that he would receive at least something from these properties which he owns,before their value is wholly swallowed up by legal costs. It must follow that the sensible and just course is for me to assess thedamages now, arising from the breaches of trust by Dl and the knowing participation in those acts by D2, D3 and D4.</p>    <p><u>Claim for Damages</u></p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> The accounts which the wife has purported to render in relation to the four premises are based upon: (i) the purported rent payableunder the four imputed tenancies and (ii) certain outgoings and expenses, including expenditures of a capital nature such as repairs.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> As regards the imputed tenancies, I have already concluded that they were shams and must therefore be set aside by the Court. Asregards the outgoings and repairs, the material which has been put before me is wholly inadequate. There are documents in the Defendant'sbundle which could be construed as <u>estimates</u> or as <u>receipts</u>, but no witness has been called to substantiate any of these matters. I am not therefore prepared to act upon these bare photocopybits of paper as proof of any substantial expenditure made by the wife in relation to any of the premises. On the other hand, theremust, from time to time, be a certain amount of expenditure by way of outgoings and repairs for which the landlord would be responsible,and it seems sensible to make some allowance for this fact in any computation of damages.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> Counsel for the plaintiff have put before me schedules with sophisticated computations for the deduction of rates and of propertytax based upon certain putative receipts. Such an approach gives a semblance of exactitude in the computation, but as the wife hastotally failed to render proper accounts, this approach is simply another way of attempting broadly to arrive at the truth. In thesecircumstances, it seems to me that the fairest approach is to view the matter broadly: that is to say, to take a reasonably conservativefigure for the rent which these premises might have been expected to have yielded, with, perhaps, a small allowance for the factthat premises do not necessarily become tenanted over the entirety of a long period of time. There will be occasions when premisesbecome untenanted - though I do not accept, for a moment, the so-called accounts of the wife which purport to show that for the wholeof the calendar year 1985 the <u>Wing Yip Street</u> premises were unoccupied.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> As regards <u>Un Chau Street</u>, it appears that at all material times this flat was occupied by the wife. It is quite possible that during at least part of theperiod (that is, from the date of Mr Justice Power's order of 12 March 1984 until today), it might have been occupied also by theson. There is, as regards Un Chau Street, no question of the wife having to account for actual rent received (though I note thatD4 was described as living at that address and could therefore have been paying some sort of rent) and the fairest way of dealingwith Un Chau Street is to attribute a rental value to those premises and, after deductions, to make an order for payment againstthe wife as to one half by way of damages.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> My approach, therefore, broadly is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(i)    to take a reasonably conservative figure by way of rental yield, with some allowance for the possibility that the premisesmay not be tenanted for the whole of the period in question;</p>            <p>(ii)    to make a deduction from the gross figure computed on the basis of (i) above for outgoings such as property tax, repairs and,in the case of Un Chau Street for the payment of rates as well.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><u>Fat Tseung Street</u></p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> Adopting the approach as outlined above, I compute the gross rental yield from Fat Tseung Street for the period from <u>12 March 1984 to l April 1986</u> (the date of the impugned tenancy agreement) at $250,000. With a deduction of 20% for property tax and other outgoings, I reach anet figure of $200,000. Therefore, the amount of damages for which the wife is liable to pay for this period is <u>$100,000</u>.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> Using the same approach, and having regard to the increase in rental value for the period from <u>1 April 1986 until today</u>, I compute the gross rental yield at the figure of $400,000 and, after deducting 20% for property tax and other outgoings, the netrental yield is $320,000. The damages which the wife is liable to pay in this regard is therefore <u>$160,000</u>. I should add that, as from 23 January 1987, the wife was in the position of a trustee <u>de son tort</u>: she no longer held the legal estate, but continued in receipt of the income from the property and continued therefore liable toaccount as a trustee.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> As D2 had, upon the findings as I have made above, knowingly assisted the wife in depriving the husband of his entitlement to a half-share,D2 is jointly liable to pay the damages of $160,000 with the wife.</p>    <p><u>Un Chau Street</u></p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> For the period from <u>12 March 1984 until 15 April 1986</u> (the date of the impugned tenancy agreement) the gross rental income which this flat might reasonably have been expected to haveyielded would have been the sum of $40,000. With a deduction of 20% for rates, property tax and outgoings, the net benefit whichthe wife has received, in money terms, from the possession of the flat to the exclusion of the husband can be put at a figure of$30,000. The damages would therefore work out for this period to the figure of <u>$15,000</u>.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> For the period from <u>15 April 1986 to today's date</u>, the Un Chau Street flat could reasonably have been expected to have yielded a further $100,000 and, with the same deductions foroutgoings as stated above, the net yield can be put at the figure of $75,000. Accordingly, the damages work out to the sum of <u>$37,500</u> for which the wife and the third defendant are jointly responsible to pay.</p>    <p><u>Cheung Sha Wan Road</u></p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> For the period from <u>12 March 1984 to 1 August 1986</u>, adopting the approach as indicated above, this flat could reasonably have yielded the gross sum of $60,000. With a deduction of20% for property tax and other outgoings, the gross yield is $48,000. Accordingly, the damages for which the wife is liable to payis the figure of <u>$24,000</u>.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> As regards the period from <u>1 August 1986 (the date of the impugned tenancy agreement to today's date</u>, these premises could reasonably have yielded a gross figure of $80,000 and, with a 20% deduction, it works out to a figure of $64,000.Accordingly, the wife and the fourth defendant are jointly liable to pay to the husband the sum of <u>$32,000</u> by way of damages.</p>    <p><u>Wing Yip Street</u></p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> From the date of the order for sale (<u>16 December 1983) to 1 May 1986</u> (the date of the impugned tenancy agreement) the Wing Yip Street premises might reasonably have yielded a gross rental income of$100,000 and, with a deduction of 20% for property tax and other outgoings the net yield for this period would be $80,000. The damagesfor which the wife is liable to pay are therefore the sum of <u>$40</u> <u>000</u>.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> For the period from <u>1 May 1986 until today's date</u>, the Wing Yip Street premises could reasonably have yielded a further $200,000 and, with a 20% deduction it works out at a figureof $160,000. Accordingly, the damages which the wife and D4 are liable to pay is the sum of <u>$80,000</u>.</p>    <p>Damages : Generally</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> There will therefore be judgment for damages as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>As against Dl :                       $488,500</p>            <p>As against D2 :                      $160,000</p>            <p>As against D3 :                      $ 37,500</p>            <p>As against D4 :                      $112,000</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> But, of course, in so far as Dl satisfies the judgment for damages against her, then the liability of D2, D3 and D4 would, to thatextent, be discharged in accordance with this judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> The money judgment against the wife can, of course, be charged against her half-share in the Wing Yip Street premises and be satisfiedout of the proceeds of sale. Likewise, the money judgments against D3 and D4 can be charged against their respective half-sharesin the three premises under Order 50 of the RSC, and orders for sale can be made, with the concurrence of the Plaintiff, by way ofequitable execution. It may not therefore be necessary for the Plaintiff to embark upon any further forensic adventure in this case.</p>    <p><u>Sale</u></p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> Mr Mills-Ovens Q.C., counsel for the plaintiff, submits (tentatively) that I should make an order for the sale of the three premises(upon the assumption that the impugned tenancies are set aside by order of the Court) so that the premises can be sold at today'srelatively high prices, and the proceeds distributed. The only provision of law to which Mr Mills-Owens has directed me, empoweringa court to order sale (apart from the provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352" class="autolink_findacts">Partition Ordinance</a>) is <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/29/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 56</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/29" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Ordinance</a>. I do not see how <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/29/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 56</a> can assist in this regard. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/29/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 56</a> deals with a situation where a trustee, vested with trust property, lacks the power of sale and, in these circumstances, the Court'may by order confer upon the trustee, either generally or in any particular instance, the necessary power for the purpose'.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> I cannot see how <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/29/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 56</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/29" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Ordinance</a> can apply as things stand today. In the Land Office register, the registered owners of the premises are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p><u>Premises</u>                                                <u>Owner</u></p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>Fat Tseung Street                                              Plaintiff and D3</p>    <p>Un Chau Street                                                 Plaintiff and D4</p>    <p>Cheung Sha Wan Road                                     Plaintiff and D3</p>    <p>Wing Yip Street                                                the wife.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> There is already an order for sale as far as Wing Yip Street is concerned. As far as the other three premises are concerned, no oneis now holding a half-share in trust for the plaintiff. The reality is that the plaintiff has found himself a co-owner with D3 inrespect of the Fat Tseung Street and Cheung Sha Wan Road premises, and with D4 in respect of the Un Chau Street premises. If it werewithin my power to order a sale (in lieu of physical partition of these flats, under the provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352" class="autolink_findacts">Partition Ordinance</a>), I would have no hesitation in so doing. Counsel representing the plaintiff might wish to consider what application they can makefor an amendment of the Statement of Claim so that the necessary orders under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352" class="autolink_findacts">Partition Ordinance</a> can be made. But, as I have indicated above, this might not be necessary since, in satisfaction of a charge on an interest in land,a court has plainly a power of sale under Order 50 of rule 9A of the RSC.</p>    <p><u>Appointment of Receiver</u></p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> The Court has power, under Section 21L of the Supreme Court Ordinace, to appoint a receiver whenever it considers it just or convenientto do so. It is difficult to think of circumstances more appropriate than the present case for this relief to be granted: expensivethough it may turn out to be for the parties involved. A receiver has already been appointed in respect of Wing Yip Street; I accedeto the application in respect of the three premises.</p>    <p><u>Conclusion</u></p>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> I express the hope that this judgment will, at last, bring to an end the unfortunate litigation between the husband and wife whichgoes back to 1983. The outrageous behaviour of the wife might, perhaps, be partially explained by ignorance, infirmity of mind andold age (she has put in a psychiatric report in her bundle of documents concerning her mental condition). But D3 has no such excuse.He is now registered as a co-owner of Fat Tseung Street and Cheung Sha Wan Road with the Plaintiff. D3 ought to know that any attemptshereafter by him to frustrate the execution of lawful orders of the Court will result in harsh punishment. As regards the behaviourof Dl's former solicitors, and the solicitor who effected the assignment of half-shares, that is something the Court may have tolook into upon the conclusion of these proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> I will now hear counsel as to the terms of the orders I should make. I should add that the formal orders must be carefully drawnup, so as to leave nothing to be implied if acts are required to be done by anybody hereafter. There is also the question of interestand costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">H Litton Q.C.</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">High Court Deputy Judge</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr R Mills-Owens Q.C. and Mr R Spicer (D.L.A.) for Plaintiff.</p>        <p>Dl    CHAN Tang-lan in person</p>        <p>D3    CHAN Ying-lung in person</p>        <p>D2    YUEN Fung-kiu &amp; D4 YIM Chui-ling absent.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/1989/426.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
