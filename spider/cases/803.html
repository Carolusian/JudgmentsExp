The main issues are whether the plaintiff has proved sufficient goodwill in the words âOrientalLogisticsâ, whether there is any actionable misrepresentation by the defendant in using âOriental Logisticsâ as its companyname and whether the plaintiff has suffered or is likely to suffer any damage as a result of misrepresentation by the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Much of the facts in this case is not in dispute and can be simply put.</p>    <p class="heading">The plaintiff</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The plaintiff is a Hong Kong company incorporated on 21 November 1996.  Its name in English and Chinese are âOriental LogisticsCompany Limitedâ and âæ±æ¹å²éæéå¬å¸â. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The company was founded by Mr Lau Wai Kwong Gilbert, who previously had many years of experience working in large warehousing company. Mr Lau also engages actively in a number of public duties in Hong Kong and China, including acting as the president of the HongKong Logistics Association from 1997 to 1999.  Mr Lau is one of the three plaintiff witnesses.  The witness statement of Miss MargaretLau, the plaintiffâs executive director, was agreed for admission.  The third witness is Mr Wong Foo Wah, the president of theHong Kong Logistics Association.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  As its name suggests, the plaintiff is engaged in the provision of logistics services.  It started as third party logistics providerof physical cargo distribution and public warehousing.  By 1999, it had moved on to provide other services, including e-commercelogistics, third party warehousing, total logistics, inventory management and freight forwarding management through partnership withmajor shipping lines and air freight companies.  The plaintiff, however, never issued bill of ladings in its own name.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The plaintiff is now part of a group of companies.  The holding company is Oriental Logistics Holding Company Limited, incorporatedin 2002.  Apart from the plaintiff and the holding company, the group now has four Hong Kong companies, three of which were incorporatedbefore 2003. The group also has three PRC companies incorporated in 2002, 2004 and 2005.  Apart from one Hong Kong company calledEastern Investment Holdings Limited, all companies in the plaintiffâs group of companies have included in their English names theword âorientalâ.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The plaintiff focuses mainly on the provision of industrial logistics services.  Its clients include US Fortune 500 companies andwell-known international corporations and brand names. The plaintiff prides itself in being able to provide one-stop full logisticsservices.  It is common ground that logistics services or management is about the geographical repositioning of raw materials.  Accordingto the plaintiffâs expert, Mr Wong Foo Wah, who has been in the logistics trade for 30 years, integrated logistics services shouldcomprise five stages, being warehousing, physical distribution (transportation), inventory management, freight forwarding and import/export.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  According to Mr Lau, the plaintiff has a fleet of 24 container trucks and lorries and six warehouses in Hong Kong. It has branchoffices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Taiwan.  It also has agents and warehouses in eight cities in China. The plaintiff, throughalliance service agreements, is connected to a sea/ air freight worldwide forwarding network and is further in partnership with anumber of companies engaged in logistics services, transportation and freight forwarding services.  It provides services in SoutheastAsia and also Europe and the USA.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Mr Lau says that the plaintiff is one of the few companies in Hong Kong that offers comprehensive and integrated third party logisticsservices.  Most of the other logistics companies in Hong Kong, however, only focus on services for one or some of the five stagesidentified by Mr Wong. </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  It is Mr Lauâs evidence that the plaintiff had between its incorporation and 2007, spent about HK$ 1.44 million on advertisingand promoting its business and promoting the business name of âOriental Logisticsâ.  The plaintiffâs annual business turnoverhad grown since its incorporation, from about HK$ 8 million in 1997 to over HK$ 66 million in the year ending 31 March 2004.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Over the years, the plaintiff had also received various awards and recognitions in connection with its business performance andmanagement quality. It had also promoted the study of logistics in Hong Kong by sponsoring scholarships and academic exchanges atvocational institute and universities. </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Both Mr Lau and Mr Wong say that the plaintiff is an established and reputable logistics service provider in Hong Kong.</p>    <p class="heading">The defendant</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The defendant was incorporated in Hong Kong on 3 March 2004.  Its English and Chinese names are âOriental Logistics Group Limitedâand âè¶æ·åéç©æµæéå¬å¸â.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The defendant is a subsidiary of a Taiwan company called Oriental Logistics Group Limited (è¶æ·åéç©æµè¡ä»½æéå¬å¸)(âOLGâ).  OLG was incorporated in Taiwan in March 2000 and before changing to its present name in 2005, it was known as OrientalLogistics Company Limited (è¶æ·åéæéå¬å¸).  The majority shareholder of OLG is Mr Tsou Yun Lien who has been in logisticsbusiness since 1987 and has held responsible positions with various logistics and freight forwarding trade organizations in Taiwan.He is the only witness called by the defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  OLG is a Taiwan based logistics company. It has branches or subsidiaries in Taichung and Kaoshoung in Taiwan, Shanghai, Xiamen,Fouzhou and Shenzhen (since 2006) in China and also Hong Kong (i.e. the defendant).  The core business of OLG is international freightforwarding services with the majority of its customers being based in Taiwan, mainland China and Hong Kong.  </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  According to Mr Tsou, OLG was initially named âOriental Logistics Company Limitedâ because the word âorientalâ means andrefers to the East and East Asia region and signifies that OLG is founded and based in the East and East Asia. These are also theareas on which OLG focuses its logistics services.  As for the words âLogistics Company Limitedâ, they were chosen to reflectthat the nature of the company business is in logistics services and is a company limited by shares.  OLG was subsequently renamedâOriental Logistics Group Limitedâ to reflect the development and the expanded scale of the company. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The two words âè¶æ·â in the Chinese name of OLG carry the meanings of âgoing beyondâ (or surpassing) and âspeed andvictoryâ.  Mr Tsou explained that they were chosen to reflect the companyâs aim to surpass its past and to provide speedy andconvenient logistics services for its customers.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Mr Tsouâs evidence shows that before the incorporation of the defendant, OLG was already engaged in transportation and deliveryof cargoes to Hong Kong.  The relevant bills of lading were all issued in the name of OLG and carried its trademark. The decisionto set up the defendant in 2004 was to provide end-to-end services to the customers of OLG and to handle the business in Hong Kongthrough a subsidiary.  Accordingly, it was decided that the defendant was to have the same Chinese and English names as well as thesame mark as OLG, which already enjoyed a certain level of popularity in Hong Kong. And as OLG was then in the process of changingits English name, the defendant adopted the new English name of Oriental Logistics Group Limited. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The incorporation of the defendant was arranged by an accounting and secretarial company.  Mr Tsouâs evidence is that neitherhe nor OLG was aware of the existence of the plaintiff at the time the defendant was set up and named.  When cross-examined, he acceptedthat they did not ask for a search to be done as they had entrusted the work to the accountant and relied on his professional expertiseand advice.  </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The defendantâs logo, which is also the trademark of OLG and used by the other group companies, is registered as a trademark inHong Kong on 8 February 2005, with a date of priority of 27 July 2004.  The evidence of Mr Tsou is that the mark is always used togetherwith the Chinese and English names of the defendant or of OLG on the business documentation (such as invoices, bills of lading orother shipping documents) and advertisements and promotion materials.  </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Since incorporation in Hong Kong, the core business of the defendant is the provision of ocean freight and airfreight forwardingservices.  It is registered with the Hong Kong Marine Department and the freight forwarding liaison team of Hong Kong airlines. The defendant advertises regularly in the Hong Kong Shipping Gazette (published weekly), which is a key trade magazine and also shippingnewspapers.  Within the first year of its incorporation, the defendant had a business turnover of over HK$ 47 million.  Most of thecustomers at the time were from Taiwan.  Since then, the defendantâs clientele had developed and expanded.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In cross-examination, Mr Tsou stated that since about 2006 or 2007, the defendant also offers transportation services for its seafreight-forwarding customers.  At about the same time, the defendant also started to offer warehousing services to provide temporaryand short-term storage service to its freight-forwarding customers.</p>    <p class="heading">The dispute</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In July 2004, it came to the attention of the plaintiff that in an online directory known as âHong Kong Shipping Companies andFreight Agencies Listâ, the plaintiffâs website was mistakably stated to be that of the defendant.  At about the same time, HSBCalso mistakably sent to the plaintiff bills of ladings relating to shipments handled by the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  By letter dated 15 July 2004, the plaintiff through its solicitors demanded the defendant to cease using in the course of tradethe name âOriental Logisticsâ and to change its company name to a name different from  âOriental Logisticsâ.  The defendantâssolicitors replied by letter dated 19 July 2004, refusing to comply with the demand.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Thereafter, the plaintiff continued to receive from HSBC, bills of lading of the defendant and other correspondences intended forthe defendant.  The plaintiff also received the defendantâs bills of ladings from another bank, Liu Chong Hing Bank.  Both bankshave dealings with the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The plaintiff has also over the years received emails and letters from entities with whom it has no business dealing, that wereintended for a company called âOriental Logisticsâ.  The evidence of Miss Margaret Lau also refers to an incident in 2007, inwhich one of the plaintiffâs long standing business partners had mistakably transferred payments to the defendantâs account.  </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The documents before the court show that some time before May 2005, the plaintiff had written to the Company Registrar to objectto the defendantâs name under section 22A of the Companies Ordinance (namely, the name gives a misleading indication of the natureof its activities as to be likely to cause harm to the public).  After receiving representations of the defendant made through itssolicitors, the Company Registrar advised by letter dated 19 May 2005 that he did not consider it appropriate to exercise his powerunder section 22A to direct the defendant to change its name.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  On 15 September 2005, the plaintiff issued the Writ herein.</p>    <p class="heading">The plaintiffâs claim</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The plaintiffâs case is that when the defendant was incorporated in 2004, it was already well established in Hong Kong as a logisticsservices provider, with substantial and valuable goodwill and reputation in its name âOriental Logisticsâ.  It is said that asubstantial number of members of the public in Hong Kong and traders from the Mainland identify âOriental Logisticsâ when usedin relation to the provision of logistics services as indicating a business of or connected with the plaintiff. </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The acts of passing off pleaded in the Statement of Claim are: (i) the registration of the name âOriental Logistics Group Limitedâon the register of the Company Registry in Hong Kong; and (ii) the provision by the defendant of logistics services similar to thoseprovided by the plaintiff under and by reference to the name âOriental Logisticsâ.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  As to deceit or intention to cause confusion in the trade and members of the public in Hong Kong, the plaintiff relied on specificinstances of confusion.  The instances of confusion pleaded are: (i) two bills of ladings of the defendant that were mistakably sentby HSBC to it, (ii) a letter from Toplis and Harding (Recoveries) Ltd intended for the defendant was sent to it by mistake; and (iii)the name of the defendant as well as that of the defendant will show up in the results of Internet searches on the term âOrientalLogisticsâ.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  A number of relief was pleaded. At the trial, however, the plaintiff only pursues items (1) to (4) and costs.  The other pleadedrelief of orders for delivery up of offending articles, inquiry as to damages and, alternatively, an account of profit are not pursued.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The principal relief sought is an injunction.  Although the pleading also sought to restrain the use of the name of âOrientalLogistics Group Limitedâ, Mr Harris SC indicated in his closing submission that the plaintiff is confining the scope of the injunctionto the trading style or name of âOriental Logisticsâ.  The plaintiff also seeks orders directing the defendant: (i) to take stepsto remove from the Register of Companies the registration for the company name of âOriental Logistics Group Limitedâ or to changeits name to another name that does not include the words âOriental Logisticsâ; and (ii) to remove or obliterate references toâOriental Logisticsâ in the signs of the defendant.</p>    <p class="heading">The defence case</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The defendantâs case is that it has based on its parent companyâs existing goodwill, built up its goodwill and reputation inHong Kong. </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The defendant disputes the claim of passing off on a number of grounds.  First, it disputes that the name or words âOriental Logisticsâare distinctive of the plaintiffâs services and business.  It also does not accept that the plaintiffâs goodwill and reputationextends to freight forwarding services. Second, it denies the English name of the defendant was chosen with the object of causingdeception or confusion to the public. Third, it is said that there are sufficient differences between the plaintiff and the defendanthaving regard to the fact that: (i) the defendant advertises and provides services under both its English and Chinese names togetherwith its logo, the latter two are very different from those of the plaintiff; and (ii) the specific services of the plaintiff (i.e.warehousing, inventory management, local physical transportation and repacking services) and those of the defendant (i.e. ocean freightand air freight forwarding services) are different.  Fourth, the defendant also denies that the plaintiff has suffered loss or damage.  </p>    <p class="heading">The issues</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  There are three broad issues for determination in this trial. They are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  Whether at the time of the incorporation of the defendant, the plaintiff had acquired substantial goodwill in Hong Kong in thename or words âOriental Logisticsâ in relation to its logistics services.  This in turn entails considerations of whether thename is descriptive or of common use and in turn whether the name has acquired a secondary meaning so as to become distinctive ofthe plaintiffâs services.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)  Whether there is any actionable misrepresentation on the defendantâs part. This in turn involves questions of whether the adoptionof the English name by the defendant and the offer or provision of services under its English name was calculated to confuse or misleadthe public into believing that the defendantâs business is, or is connected to, the plaintiffâs business, and whether there aredifferences between the trading name and style of the plaintiff and that of the defendant that would avert confusion.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)  Whether the plaintiff has suffered or likely to suffer loss and damage as a result of the defendantâs misrepresentation thatwould found and support the claim and relief sought.   </p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The law</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The applicable principles are not in dispute.

This is particularly the case of a plaintiff who adopts words in common use for his trade name for, in such a case,some risk of confusion is inevitable.  It is important to consider the nature and cause of the confusion: <i>Office Cleaning Services, Ld v.

If the confusion is caused not by misrepresentation on the defendantâs part, but merely because the word inquestion is descriptive or of common use, then the plaintiff has no claim in passing off:  <i>Land Power International Holdings Ltd v.

Where there is no loss or division of business or reasonable likelihood of such loss resulting from aconfusion of names, there is no cause of action in passing off: <i>Halsburyâs Laws of England</i>, Fourth Edition (2007 Reissue) vol.48 para.335, <i>Jet Aviation (Singapore) Pte Ltd v. Jet Maintenance Pte Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%203%20SLR%20287" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 3 SLR 287.</a></p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  With these principles in mind, I turn to the issues between the parties.</p>    <p class="heading">The plaintiffâs goodwill</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The first question in the context of the plaintiffâs goodwill is whether the name âOriental Logisticsâ are common words inordinary usage and descriptive.  As I understand it, Mr Harris SC does not dispute the word âlogisticsâ is descriptive of thebusiness and services offered by the plaintiff.  He, however, does not accept that the word âorientalâ is a descriptive word.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The <i>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</i>, Sixth edition, Volume 2 gives the meaning of âorientalâ as, <i>inter alia</i>,  âbelonging to or situated in the eastern part of the sky or (formerly) of a specified country or region;â and âbelongingto, occurring in, or characteristics of, the countries east of the Mediterranean, especially those of eastern Asiaâ.  In my view,âorientalâ is both a common English word and a geographically descriptive word, describing and referring to the East and EastAsia region.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  The main thrust of Mr Harris SCâs closing submission, however, is that the combination of âorientalâ and âlogisticsâ doesnot make up a descriptive term.  It is said that the two-word term does not describe a particular kind of logistics service.  Whileacknowledging that âorientalâ is a word popularly used in Hong Kong to form part of company or business names, he argued thatthe word is conceptually a fancy word and as no definite meaning could be attributed to the word when it is combined with the wordâlogisticsâ, the two-word term is not a descriptive term.   </p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  I do not agree.  âOrientalâ and âlogisticsâ are common English words. The former is a geographical expression while thelatter is the most natural word to describe the business of a logistics services provider.  As Mr Wong for the defendant observed,logistics businesses attach importance to their geographical location, network and scope of services.  Logistics is after all aboutthe geographical repositioning of raw materials and products. This point is best illustrated by the evidence of Mr Lau and Mr Tsou. Mr Lau testified that the plaintiff chose the name âoriental logisticsâ because âorientalâ carries the meaning of mainlandChina and the two-word term signifies that the plaintiff provides China-related services.  He stated that the plaintiff used theGreater China as its base, from where it sets off to develop the whole Asian market.  Admittedly, âoriental logisticsâ is regardedas a name indicative of the network and scope of the plaintiffâs business, being China-related logistics services.  In the samevein, Mr Tsou said that OLG adopted the two-word term as its name because it is descriptive of the East and East Asian region fromwhich it originated and operated.  The term âoriental logisticsâ, objectively viewed, is a natural and descriptive term to denotethe business of the plaintiff, namely, it is based and operated or specialized in China and the Eastern or Asian region.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  It follows that the plaintiff has to show that âoriental logisticsâ has acquired secondary meaning and the public recognizesand associates the name as denoting its services and none other.  The relevant time is March 2004 when the defendant was incorporated. This is a heavy burden as trade name that describes the service rendered is jealously safeguarded by the court: <i>Cellular Clothing Co Ltd v. Maxton and Murray</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1899%5d%20AC%20326" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1899] AC 326</a>; <i>Office Cleaning Services, Ld v.

Mr Lau testified that the plaintiff had throughoutthe years incurred about HK$1.7 million on advertising and promoting the business of the plaintiff.  Mr Wong for the defendant pointedout that the plaintiff had not adduced primary documents to support the assertion.  I accept this is not entirely satisfactory. However, the other objective evidence, including the various awards and prizes received by the plaintiff after its incorporation,indicates that the plaintiff had enjoyed recognition and approval for its business and services. This would not have come about ifthe plaintiff had not been actively promoting its business and services. I am prepared to accept Mr Lauâs testimony that the plaintiffhad incurred not insubstantial expenses on promoting its business. </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The evidence also shows that the plaintiffâs annual business turnover had grown steadily and was fairly substantial by 2004. Itis also said that the plaintiff had a wide range of clientele and a good business network.  Mr Wong for the defendant is correctto say that the evidence does not show that the plaintiffâs present clientele is exactly the same as that in 2004.  However, theobjective evidence is that the plaintiffâs business was already quite sizable in 2004.  As Mr Harris SC submitted, it is unlikelythat the profile of the plaintiffâs clientele would undergo fundamental or substantial changes within a short period of time. Notwithstanding the shortcomings identified by the defence, I am prepared to accept that the plaintiff did have a sizeable volumeof business and clientele by 2004.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  I am also prepared to accept Mr Lauâs and Mr Wongâs evidence that the plaintiff was a reputable logistics services providerin Hong Kong.  However, that is not conclusive of the issue.  What has to be proved is that the term âoriental logisticsâ hadby 2004 lost its primary descriptive meaning and had acquired a secondary meaning as indicating the services of the plaintiff andno other.  In this connection, the plaintiffâs witness, Mr Wong had stated in his witness statement (at para.15) that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe plaintiff is among the most reputable and established logistics services providers in Hong Kong.  As a consequence of the extensiveuse and substantial reputation of the name âOriental Logisticsâ, I am of the view that a substantial number of members of thepublic in Hong Kong, traders from the PRC, and customers worldwide would have come to identify the names âOriental Logisticsâ,whenever used in relation to the provision of logistics services, as indicating a business of or connected in the course of tradewith the plaintiff and their sister companies and none other.â  </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Mr Wongâs reference to the reputation of the plaintiffâs sister companies is irrelevant as these companies are not joined inthese proceedings.  As to his statement on the plaintiffâs reputation, Mr Wong was twice asked in re-examination to explain thebasis for it.  Despite giving a long answer, he did not really elucidate the reasons for his view that âOriental Logisticsâ wasdistinctive of the plaintiffâs business and none other.  Neither did Mr Wong elaborate on what led him to say and what was he referringto when he said there was extensive use of the name âOriental Logisticsâ. </p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  No doubt, he can only speak to what he knows of the logistics trade and market in Hong Kong.  His evidence is that he was not awareof other companies in the trade using the name âorientalâ and he had not previously heard of the defendant.  He however readilyaccepted that it is quite possible that the Hong Kong Logistics Association, of which he is the president, has members bearing thename âorientalâ.  As demonstrated to him during cross-examination, there are indeed other companies in the logistics field usingthe name âorientalâ. </p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Looking at Mr Wongâs evidence in the round, there is no objective and convincing basis for his view that a substantial numberof members of the public in Hong Kong, traders from the PRC, and customers worldwide would identify the name âOriental Logisticsâ,when used in relation to logistics services, as indicating the plaintiff and none other.  Neither can the court come to that conclusionon the basis of his evidence.  </p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  In my view, the totality of the evidence before the court is insufficient to make out a case that at the time of the incorporationof the defendant, the name âOriental Logisticsâ had acquired a secondary meaning that is distinctive of the plaintiffâs services. The fact that the plaintiff was one of the early logistics services companies in Hong Kong and had consequently enjoyed a factualmonopoly over the use of the name âorientalâ for a certain period of time, does not automatically lead to the conclusion thatthe name has acquired a secondary meaning as indicating the plaintiffâs services.  It is also relevant to note that the plaintiffdoes not only trade or use the English name of âOriental Logistics Company Limitedâ.  Instead, it has in the course of tradeused the English name in conjunction with its Chinese name.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The defendant has challenged whether the plaintiffâs goodwill extended to freight forwarding business.  While it is clear thatthe plaintiff is not the actual freight forwarder and never issues airway bills and bills of lading in its name, it is Mr Lauâsevidence that the plaintiff did arrange freight forwarding services for its customers.  I accept that by 2004, freight forwardingwas among the services the plaintiff would offer and procure for its customers.  Hence, if I were to find that the name âOrientalLogisticsâ had become indicative of the plaintiff, I would be prepared to accept that the plaintiffâs goodwill also extendedto freight forwarding services.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  For the reasons above, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has proved sufficient goodwill in the name âOriental Logisticsâto found the action of passing off.</p>    <p class="heading">Misrepresentation</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  I move next to consider whether there was any misrepresentation by the defendant, which is an essential element of the tort. </p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Paragraph 11 of the Statement of Claim pleads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe said acts of the defendant are calculated to deceive and to cause confusion and to lead members in the trade and members ofthe public in Hong Kong into the belief that the defendantâs business is the business of the plaintiff or otherwise endorsed byor howsoever connected or associated with the plaintiff which is contrary to the fact.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Despite these wide terms, the particulars given are confined to incidents of confusion by HSBC and Toplis and Harding (Recoveries)Ltd and the results of Internet searches (see para.31 above).  Insofar as Mr Harris SC had in his submissions commented on differencesin the quality of the services of the plaintiff and of the defendant, this is not part of the pleaded case.  Allegation of disparityin quality of goods and services of the parties is fact sensitive. If a plaintiff seeks to rely on it to build a case of misrepresentation,this should be pleaded and properly particularized so that the defendant is afforded a proper opportunity to meet the claim.  Inthe present case, because the matter was only raised in counselâs submissions, the defendant was not given a proper opportunityto adduce evidence on the quality and standard of its services.  It is therefore not permissible for the plaintiff to base its caseof misrepresentation on inferior quality of services.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Turning to confusion, the authorities have established that mere confusion is not sufficient to support an action of passing off. Confusion arising from the defendantâs use of âoriental logisticsâ as part of its trade name does not necessarily mean thatthere is an actionable misrepresentation. Because of the use of the descriptive words in their business name and as the plaintiffand the defendant are both in the logistics field, <i>albeit</i> the focus of their services is different, blunders by members of the public, hence some confusion, are inevitable.  But confusionarising from that very fact and/or the adoption of the descriptive name is to be disregarded for the purpose of determining whetherthere is a misrepresentation.  It is therefore important to show the confusion was the result of deception by the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Miss Lau had in appendix 2 of her witness statement set out a series of incidents of confusion.  The evidence before the court doesnot show that the confusions are the acts of or caused by the defendant.  There is no evidence as to how the mistake in the websiteaddress in the online directory referred to by Miss Lau came about.  Mr Harris SC was mistaken when he suggested in the cross-examinationof Mr Tsou that this was an advertisement placed by the defendant.  There is in short no evidence of actual deception or representationby the defendant that its business is that of or is associated or connected with the business of the plaintiff. </p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  In my view, the incidents of confusion at the most serve to show that staff of the two banks and certain members of the public wereunder the impression that the two companies are the same or connected.  They only show confusions had taken place but do not explainwhy they had taken place. The court cannot readily infer that the operating cause of the confusions is deception or misrepresentationby the defendant.  The position is Oliver LJ said in <i>My Kinda Town Ltd v. Soll &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20RPC%20407" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] RPC 407</a>, 424: âwhere inherent in the factual situation in which the parties are operating that there is some risk of confusion in any eventfrom the mere fact that the parties are conducting the same trade and using in it descriptive titles of which neither can claim anylegitimate monopoly â¦ a closer analysis <i>[of the operative cause of the confusion]</i> is essential, as the simple fact of confusion does not by itself prove the plaintiffâs case for him.â </p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  On the other hand, Mr Tsouâs uncontroverted evidence is that the defendant was building on the goodwill and clientele of its parentcompany, OLG.  At the same time, there are notable differences between the names and style under which the plaintiff and the defendantcarry out their business.  First, there is the difference between âcompany limitedâ and âgroup limitedâ in their Englishnames.  This may appear to be a small difference, but in the context of descriptive names and where there is no actual evidence ofdeception, this is sufficient to avert confusion.  Mr Harris SC contended that the inclusion of the word âgroupâ in the defendantâsname serves to confuse rather than elucidate because the plaintiff is in a group of companies.  But as Mr Wong for the defendantpointed out, this case is not concerned with the goodwill of the other companies in the plaintiffâs group or of the group as awhole. There is also no evidence of the goodwill of the group or the extent of it.  As for the Chinese names of the plaintiff andthe defendant, they are entirely different. In addition, the logos or trademarks of the parties are also distinctive and very different.The evidence shows that the Chinese and English names of the defendant usually appear together and in conjunction with its logo,especially on stationary and shipping documentation.  The same is true of the plaintiff.  In light of all these, I am of the viewthat there are sufficient differences between the partiesâ names and in the circumstances of the use of the name âoriental logisticsâas to avoid deception.  </p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Further, the confusions or risk of confusion is something that must be tolerated by a trader who uses descriptive words in its name. As acknowledged by Miss Lau, the incidents of confusions she alluded to are âadministrative inconvenienceâ (para.16 of her witnessstatement).  Likewise, the appearance of both the plaintiff and the defendant in results of Internet search, one of the particularsof confusion relied on by the plaintiff, is also an inconvenience.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  There is therefore no passing off by the defendant.</p>    <p class="heading">Damages</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  I move finally to the issue of damages.  The question is, assuming that misrepresentation is proved, whether a case has been madeout that the plaintiff has suffered or is likely to suffer damages as a result of the misrepresentation of the defendant.   </p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  There is no evidence before the court that the plaintiff has suffered any loss of business as a result of the activities of thedefendant complained of.  The only evidence of loss comes from Miss Lau (at paras.16 to 18 of her witness statement).  They includeadministrative inconvenience and consumption of time and human resources arising from the correspondences that were intended forthe defendant.  This is insufficient to sustain an action in passing off.  Further, as found above, these are what the plaintiffhas to put up with for using descriptive words in its name. </p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Miss Lau also suggests that the mistaken reference to the plaintiffâs website as that of the defendant in the online directorywould bring about loss of business opportunities to the plaintiff.  Her reasoning is not apparent.  And she has not elaborated onthe point.  It would appear any loss of business opportunities should be to the defendant instead of the plaintiff because customerswho were looking for the defendant would be linked to the plaintiff.  There is no evidential basis for suggesting that the conversewould happen as a result of the mistake in the online directory.  Mr Wong for the defendant also took the objection, a proper onein my view, that this was not part of the pleaded case. </p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Relying on Russell LJâs statement in <i>Annabelâs (Berkeley Square) Ltd v. G Schock</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20RPC%20838" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] RPC 838</a>,844 (27-35), Mr Harris SC argues that it is rare to have actual evidence of confusion and loss of business, and that in the presentcase, because of the similarity of the names of the plaintiff and the defendant and the overlap in their fields of activity, commonsense suggests that confusion and loss of custom is bound to happen.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  The case of <i>Annabel</i> does not concern a descriptive name. The name âAnnabelâ is a fancy word. The parties had used the same name and their fieldsof activity overlapped.  Accordingly, the court was ready to infer a probability that some members of the public would associatethe defendantâs escort agency with the plaintiffâs high-class nightclub and was further prepared to accept that there would belikelihood of harm to the plaintiffâs goodwill. And an interlocutory injunction was therefore granted.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The present case is however rather different. It has been more than four years since the defendantâs incorporation, yet thereis no actual evidence of confusion among the plaintiffâs customers or of loss or division of business.  There are at the same timea good deal of differences between their full names and logos.  In these circumstances, it is difficult for the court to infer thatthere must be some loss of business by reason of the similarity in the English names of the plaintiff and the defendant.  </p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  In short, the plaintiff has failed to make out a case of damage or likelihood of damage as would support the claim and relief sought.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  For the above reasons, the plaintiffâs claim is dismissed.
