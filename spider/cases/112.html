Cargo owners from Taiwan, Indonesia and Singapore launched proceedings in rem in Hong Kong and arrested a sister ship.  Shipownerssought a stay of these proceedings upon the basis that the Court of Jakarta, Indonesia was the more convenient forum.  On appealfrom a refusal of Power J. to grant a stay held:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)    On application for a stay on the basis of forum non conveniens the single question now is:  Is there some other available forum,having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, i.e., in which the case may be tried moresuitably for the interests of all the parties and the end of justice.  <u>Spiliada Maritime Corp. v Cansulex Ltd</u>.<a>(1)</a>. But it may still be convenient to approach this question in three stages.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)    The question at stage I is:  Is Hong Kong not the natural or appropriate forum for the trial and is the available forum inIndonesia clearly or distinctly more appropriate.  The answer here was yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)    The question at Stage II is whether the plaintiffs have shown the existence in Hong Kong of any personal or juridical advantageswhich would not be available in the Indonesian forum.  The answers were:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)    shipâs limits of liability.  If the action proceeded in Hong Kong a court would apply the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 limit,s.503 for two reasons:</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(i)  necessity â the application of Hong Kong procedures:  <u>The Penelope II</u><a>(2)</a></p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(ii)        Choice, as the governing law of the tort would be that of Hong Kong, and the law of the lex loci delicti would be relevantonly to see whether civil liability existed in that location had not been excluded:  <u>Phillips</u> v <u>Eyre</u><a>(3)</a> and <u>Boys</u> v <u>Chaplin</u><a>(4)</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">By contrast if the action was remitted to Indonesia the probabilities were that the Indonesian Court would apply Indonesian limitswhich were quite uncertain and possibly derisory.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(5)    The undertakings offered by the defendant were ineffective to offset the procedural advantages the plaintiff would enjoy inHong Kong in relation to time limits, Japanese law, interest and costs.  Observations upon the use and acceptability of undertakings.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(6)    In the balancing process at Stage III the Court had objectively to assess the justice of Hong Kong and Indonesian law in relationto this casualty, and ask whether it was just to allow the plaintiffs to exploit their Hong Kong advantage or unjust to confine theplaintiffs to their remedies in Indonesia.  <u>De Dampierre</u> v <u>De Dampierre</u><a>(5)</a></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(7)    In balance it would be unjust to deprive the plaintiffs of their Hong Kong advantages and confine them to their remedies inIndonesia.

On 15<sup>th</sup> November 1981 shortly after leaving port the vessel ran aground on Chi Lung Island just north of the breakwater of Keelung Harbourin the territorial waters of Taiwan.  She was eventually declared a constructive total loss and abandoned.  Three actions followed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> On 12th November 1982 the plaintiffs issued a writ in the Admiralty jurisdiction (Folio 319 of 1982) as owners of cargo lately ladenon board the vessel âAdhiguna Merantiâ against the defendants as the owners of âAdhiguna Harapanâ and other sister shipsof âAdhiguna Merantiâ.  The claim was for:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âDamages for breach of contract and/or duty and/or negligence in or about the loading, stowage, handling, custody, care and dischargeof the plaintiffsâ cargo and the carriage thereof on board the defendantsâ ship or vessel âAdhiguna Merantiâ in the year1981â and for further declaratory relief in relation to general average and salvage.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The endorsement of the writ gave addresses for 77 plaintiffs, 39 of which were in Taiwan and 38 in Indonesia.  On 13<sup>th</sup> November 1982 a second writ (Folio 321 of 1982) was issued in identical terms.  Addresses for 4 plaintiffs were endorsed, one inTaiwan, one in Indonesia and two in Singapore. On 1<sup>st</sup> June 1982 a third writ in identical terms were issued with two plaintiffsâ addresses endorsed thereon, one in Taiwan and one inIndonesia.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> At the hearing, we were informed that the plaintiffsâ intent was to name all shippers and receivers of the cargo because untila very careful and prolonged examination of the documents took place, it was not possible to tell in whom any particular propertywas vested when the casualty occurred.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">In June 1983 âAdhiguna Nugrahaâ one of the sister ships named in the writs was arrested in Hong Kong.  It was thereafter releasedupon security being provided by the defendants without prejudice to any application the defendants might make for a stay of proceedings. By notices of motion dated 4th August 1983 the defendants applied for each action to be stayed upon the ground that the court ofJakarta, Indonesia was the most natural and convenient forum for the resolution of the disputes between the parties.  On 13th December1985 these motions were dismissed by Power, J.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20HKLR%20487" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) H.K.L.R. 487.</a>  The defendants now appeal to this Court.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><u>Applicable principles</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Since Power, J. gave his decision, these principles had been restated by the House of Lords in <u>Spiliada Maritime Corp. v. Cansulex Ltd</u>.<a>(1) </a> in the speech of Lord. Goff.  The court has now to answer a single question namely : âIs there some other available forum, havingcompetent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, i.e., in which the case may be tried more suitablyfor the interests of all the parties and the ends of justiceâ p. 985G.  Although this may no longer be necessary, per Slade L.J.in <u>Charm Maritime Inc. v. Kyriakou</u><a>(2)</a>, we still think it convenient for the purposes of analysis to view the problem at three separate stages namely</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(I) Is it shown that âHong Kong is not only not the natural or appropriate forum for the trial, but that there is another availableforum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Hong Kongâ p. 986H.  The evidential burden is here upon the applicant. The emphasis is upon âappropriateâ rather than âconvenientâ because this is not simply a matter of practical convenience. The purpose is to identify the forum âwith which the action has the most real and substantial connectionâ per Lord Keith inthe <u>Abidin Daver</u><a>(3)</a>.  The principal factors are enumerated at p. 987D.  Failure by the application at this stage is normally fatal.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(II) If the answer to (I) is yes, will a trial at this other forum deprive the plaintiff of any âlegitimate personal or juridicaladvantagesâ p. 987F, 991-3.  The evidential burden here lies upon the plaintiff p. 986A, 987G.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(III) If the answer to (II) is yes, a court has to balance the advantages of (I) against the disadvantages of (II), Abidin Daver perLord Brandon p. 419.  Deprivation of one or more personal or juridical advantages will not necessarily be fatal to the applicantprovided that the court is satisfied that notwithstanding such loss âsubstantial formâ p. 991H.  The court must try to be objective,p. 991F.  Proof of this, which can fairly be called the ultimate burden of persuasion, rests upon the applicant for the stay.  Bythese means he establishes that on balance the other forum is more suitable âfor the interests of all the parties and the endsof justiceâ.  This may be another way of saying that the plaintiffsâ choice of forum has been shown to be so inappropriate asto deserve the pejorative description of âforum-shoppingâ and to be restrained accordingly; cp. Lord Reid in <u>Atlantic Star</u><a>(4)</a>.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Power, J., not having the benefit of this decision, could not ask himself the single question there put.  He founded upon his ownformulation in <u>The Palawan</u><a>(5)</a>, which in turn was based upon a combination of the first part of the rule stated by Scott, L.J. in <u>Re St. Pierre</u><a>(6)</a> (St. Pierre v. South American Stores (Gath &amp; Chaves) Ltd. <i>[</i>1936<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20KB%20382" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 K.B. 382</a>, 398) and the second part of this rule as restated by Lord Diplock in <u>MacShannon v. Rockware Glass Ltd</u>.<a>(7)</a> Such formulation does not expressly include any reference to the balancing exercise at what we have called stage III.  Although thejudge sought to distinguish the decision in <u>The Abidin Daver</u><a>(3)</a><b><sup> </sup></b>upon the basis that no other lis existed, he cited Lord Brandonâs reference at p. 419 for the need for the court to perform suchbalancing exercise.  But he does not appear to have done this or to have reached what we have called Stage III.  Having put uponthe applicants the onus of negativing all personal or juridical advantages at Stage II, he seems to have regarded their failure toachieve this as fatal to the application.  In these circumstances, we are unable to see any escape from the conclusion that the judgemisdirected himself as to the applicable principles and that this court must reconsider the problem for itself.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Stage I</u>:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Is Hong Kong not only not the natural or appropriate forum for the trial and is the available forum in Indonesia clearly or distinctlymore appropriate?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The main cause of action which the plaintiffs wish to pursue is the cause of action in tort against the defendants as the ownersof âAdhiguna Merantiâ and its sister ships.  The plaintiffs are entitled to pursue this claim in this jurisdiction through theirclaim in rem and by the arrest of a sister ship under the provisions of Section 1 &amp; 3 (iv) of the Administration of Justice Act1956 applied to Hong Kong by the Admiralty Jurisdiction (Hong Kong) Order in council 1962 S. 1 No. 1547, and:  the <u>Fehmarn</u><a>(8)</a>.  So much is common ground.  But that summary also gives the sum total of the Hong Kong connection with this casualty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Power, J. concluded âthat justice could be done between the parties at substantially less inconvenienceâ in the available Indonesianforum.  This was largely because the vessel, the defendants, and some of the plaintiffs were Indonesian;  the crew were residentthere;  most of the witnesses and the documents were probably to be found there;  and many of the documents were written in the Indonesianlanguage.  Although this conclusion may have been based more upon practical convenience than upon the broader grounds enunciatedin <u>Spiliada</u><a>(</a>1),<b><sup> </sup></b>it was not and cannot seriously be disputed.  It is sufficient to say that we accept and agree with it and that it is not necessaryat this stage to examine further whether the Indonesian court would be likely to regard the law of Indonesia (the flag) or the lawof Taiwan (the lex loci delicti) as the governing law of the tort.  The only substantive difference between these two laws whichemerged on the evidence related to the limitation of a shipâs liability.  We shall consider this in detail hereafter.  We thereforeanswer this first question in the affirmative.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Stage II</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify">Have the plaintiffs shown the existence in Hong Kong of any personal or juridical advantages which would not be available in the Indonesianforum?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> This is the heart of the controversy.  Both before this court and below, 5 actual or potential advantages were considered, namely:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) Shipâs limits of liability</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) Time bar</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) âThe Grieshiemâ</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) interest</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5) costs</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Of these, (1) was revealed as the real bone of contention between the parties.  The remainder were acknowledged to give rise to somepotential difficulty or advantage to the plaintiffs, and the debate centred upon their significance (if any) and how far or effectivelyany significance could be neutralized by the undertakings offered by the defendants to the court.</p>    <p class="heading">(1)  <u>Shipâs limits of liability</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> We are now free to have regard to the realities, per Lord Goff, <u>Spiliada</u> p. 995F.  This is that underwriters are dominus litis on both sides.  Cargo underwriters, the underlying plaintiffs, have causedthe present proceedings to be issued in Hong Kong to obtain the benefit of the Hong Kong limitation upon a ship ownerâs liabilityarising under s. 503 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 (âN.S.A.â) extended to Hong Kong by S. 509. Adapting the language of LordSimon in <u>Atlantic Star</u><b><sup> </sup></b><sup>(<a>4</a>)</sup>:  they have chosen the forum in which they think their case âcan be most favourably presentedâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Marine underwriters, the underlying defendants, contend that this Hong Kong limit is unfairly high in relation to a venture whichat least in retrospect can be seen to have been basically Taiwanese or Indonesian.  Marine underwriters argue first that the Taiwaneselimitation should be applied as the lex loci delicti.  Alternatively, they argue that the Indonesian connections with this casualtypredominate, so that Indonesian limitation should be applied as the proper law of that issue.  The application of any other limitation,and especially the Hong Kong limitation, would operate unjustly to them.  This they argue is not legitimate forum selection but ablatant case of âforum-shoppingâ.  That is the basis of the application to stay.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Hong Kong Law</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> At the outset here, it is necessary to determine what law of limitation the Hong Kong court would apply if the actions continue inthis jurisdiction.  The plaintiffs assert that this court would apply that M.S.A. limit for two reasons:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)    <u>Necessity</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">Because there is a significant element of the procedural law of the lex fori involved in the application of the M.S.A. limit and theHong Kong court must apply its own rules of procedure.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)    <u>Choice</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">If the court is free to choose, the property application of the choice of law/rule stated in <u>Phillips v. Eyre</u><a>(9)</a>would lead to the choice of Hong Kong law.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>In answer, the defendants:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)     deny any necessity.  Ship ownerâs limits are questions of substance in the laws of Hong Kong, Taiwan and Indonesia. Thephraseology of S. 503 of the âM.S.A.â  ânot be liable beyondâ excludes higher, but not lower substantive limits.  The HongKong court is therefore free to apply a lower foreign limit if the choice of law/rule so requires.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)     In the light of the reconsideration of the rule in <u>Philipps v. Eyre</u><sup>(9)</sup><b><sup> </sup></b>in <u>Boys v. Chaplin</u><a>(10)</a>, the true choice of law/rule points to the application of Indonesian or Taiwanese law.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(i) <u>Necessity</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Power, J. was persuaded that the Hong Kong Court would apply the section 503 limit because principally on the authority of <u>Cope v. Doherty<a>(11)</a></u>, <u>The Amalia</u><a>(12)</a> and <u>The Kronprinz Olav</u><a>(13)</a>, the M.S.A. should be regarded as an overriding statute.  Before us this argument was abandoned, as we think rightly.  These authoritiesseem to us to go no further than to hold that the Merchant Shipping Acts constitute the law prima facie applicable to all suitors,Hong Kong and Foreign, in the Hong Kong court, by reason of section 509.  In Lord Chelmsfordâs words in <u>The Amalia<sup>(</sup></u><sup>12)</sup>, they constitute âthe law which the court would be bound to administerâ.  These words were specifically used in relation to âallsuitors having recourse to our courtsâ.  But we can see no difference between those who resort voluntarily and those who are properlybrought before the Court and are within its jurisdiction: The <u>Kronprinz Olav<sup>(</sup></u><sup>13)</sup>.  The authorities do not directly go to the question whether the terminology of section 503 is such as necessarily to exclude lowersubstantive foreign limits.  We also think that the description âoverriding statuteâ used in Dicey and Morris Conflict of Laws10<sup>th</sup> edn. Vol. 1 p. 19 more properly applies to those statutes which restrict or exclude a partyâs choice of contractual proper law. The real question here in our judgment is whether, if this action proceeded in the Hong Kong Courts, the defendants could maintaina substantive defence of Indonesian or Taiwanese limits without necessarily becoming involved in Hong Kong procedures.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> It is common ground that Hong Kong can only apply its own procedural rules : Dicey Rule 209 p. 1175.  Both parties also accept BrandonL.J.âs analysis of the position in <u>The Penelope II</u><a>(14)</a> where he says:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âSection 503 is the substantive provision by which the right to limit is given and the amount of the limit â¦â¦â¦..is prescribed. Section 504 is procedural and procedural only.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Can therefore, the defendants sustain a limitation defence without invoking section 504?  They assert that they can and that the mattercan be tested by claims arising under foreign contracts where the court could readily apply appropriate lower foreign limits.  Acasualty might for example give rise to three groups of cargo claims namely:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) Governed by the proper law of country A;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) Governed by the proper law of country B;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) Governed by the law of Hong Kong.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">These claims would all have to be assessed by the substantive provisions governing both liability and quantum under their respectiveproper laws.  So much is common ground.  It is what follows which is contentious.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The plaintiffs contend that the totals of claims (a), (b) and (c) thus assessed on a 100% basis, would have to be related to thetotal of a single Hong Kong limitation fund so that each claimant would receive his rateable proportion of <u>that</u> fund.  In arguing for the application of lower foreign substantive limits, the defendants, in effect, have to contend that the abovetotalling process has to be performed three times.  The total of claims (a), (b) and (c) has first to be related to a total limitationfund calculated in accordance with the proper law of country A, so that (a)âs rateable proportion of <u>that</u> fund is ascertained.  The process has then to be repeated in relation to a limitation fund calculated in relation to the proper lawof country B in order to ascertain (b)âs rateable proportion of that fund.  Finally the same process has to be repeated in relationto (c) and Hong Kong law.  There are two inevitable consequences of this.  First if only for calculation purposes, at each stage,two of the groups of claims have to be subjected to the provisions of a non-applicable proper law and limitation fund.  Secondly,since the limitation provisions in countries A and B are lower, the whole process must throw up a surplus, the application of whichis shrouded in mystery.  It is self evident that only a rateable apportionment of a single fund will avoid a surplus.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> We reject the defendantsâ submission. First we do not see how the defendants can advance a limitation defence other than undersection 503, and escape the provisions of section 504.  As Brandon L.J. pointed out in the Penelope II, this is a very special jurisdiction. He said at p. 21:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âWhere there are several claims made or apprehended (the case here) the question of limitation, cannot be dealt with as betweenthe owner and any one of the claimants, but must rather be dealt with as between the owner and <u>all</u> the claimants and also as between the different claimants inter se.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">For this latter purpose, it is necessary that special proceedings should be instituted to which the owner on the one hand, and allactual or potential claimants on the other hand are made parties.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">This is the essential procedural step.  The defendants cannot succeed simply by pleading limitation by way of defence.  In order tobring all the claimants together, they would have to launch a separate process or at least try to achieve the same result by counterclaimin and consolidation of the existing proceedings.  This in turn seems to us necessarily to invoke the Courtâs special powers undersection 504.  Under this section, the courtâs jurisdiction is specifically to determine the amount of the ownerâs liability whichis âlimited under section 503â and to distribute âthat amount rateably among several claimantsâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Secondly in the absence of clear or any supporting authority or practice, we are not persuaded that any court could or should everembark upon the sort of multiple limitation calculations above described with their inevitable consequences.  We do not regard thedicta of <u>Page Wood v. C.</u> at the end of his judgment in <u>Cope v. Doherty</u><a>(11)</a> as of assistance to the defendants as they are both obiter and observations in relation to a possible application of identical funds.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(ii) <u>Choice of Law</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The rule stated by Willes, J. in <u>Phillips v. Eyre<sup>(<a>9</a></sup></u><sup>)</sup> is:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âAs a general rule, in order to found a suit in England for a wrong alleged to have been committed abroad, two conditions must befulfilled.  First, the wrong must be of such a character that it would have been actionable if committed in Englandâ¦â¦â¦â¦Secondly,the act must not have been justifiable by the law of the place where it was done.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The plaintiffs argued that this still substantially represents the laws of Hong Kong so that the only relevant limitation defenceis that arising under Hong Kong law, namely S. 503.  The defendants argue this approach does not sufficiently reflect the decisionin <u>Boys v. Chaplin</u><a>(10)</a>.  First they contend that the overruling of <u>Machado v. Fontes</u><a>(15)</a> properly results in the restatement of Rule 172(1)(b) in Dicey p. 935 in terms of double actionability:  âactionable accordingto the law of the foreign country where it was doneâ.  The necessary concommitant of double actionability is double defence : theavailability to the defendant of defences arising under both systems.  In Lord Pearsonâs phrase in <u>Boys</u> p. 405, the plaintiff, they say, âhas the worst of both lawsâ.  Since the casualty occurred in Taiwanese territorial waters,this would permit the defendants to rely upon Taiwanese limits.  Alternatively the defendants invite the court to follow Lord Wilberforcein <u>Boys</u> and Diceyâs newly formulated, Rule 172(2) p. 936;  conclude that the issue of limitation is much more closely connected with Indonesiathan with either Hong Kong or Taiwan;  and hold that the applicable proper law of such issue is Indonesian law.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Having regard to the problem of determining the true ratio of <u>Boys</u>, we think it convenient to consider first how this point would have been dealt with, had it come before the Hong Kong court in 1970. We have little doubt that the court would have applied the âgeneral ruleâ in <u>Phillips v. Eyre</u><a>(9)</a><b><sup> </sup></b>in the practice terms of Willes, J.âs formulation.  We think the court would have been persuaded to that conclusion first by thespeech of Lord Macnaghten in <u>Carr v. Fracis Times &amp; Co</u>.<a>(16)</a>, and more especially by the three decisions of the Privy Council in <u>Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parent</u><a>(17)</a>:  <u>Walpole v Canadian Northern Railway</u><a>(18)</a>; and <u>McMillan v. Canadian Northern Railway</u><a>(19)</a>.  We think the court might have declined precisely to follow <u>Machado v. Fontes</u><a>(15)</a>in equating âjustifiableâ with âinnocentâ.  Viscount Haldane in <u>Parent</u> had declined to endorse this view, p. 205.  Further conduct which gives rise to a valid claim for Workmenâs Compensation may beneither âactionable nor punishableâ per Viscount Cave in <u>Walpole</u> p. 19, but it can scarcely be described as âinnocentâ.  The court, we think, would have concluded that conduct was âjustifiableâby the lex loci delicti if it there gave rise to no cause of action as in <u>Parent<sup>(</sup></u><sup>17)</sup>:  or if a complete defence existed in that forum, such as common employment, as in <u>McMillan<sup>(</sup></u><sup>19)</sup>:  or contributory negligence at common Law if that can properly be regarded as substantial and not procedural, see <u>Anderson v. Eric Anderson</u><a>(20)</a>, per Windeyer, J. p. 41 and <u>Kolksy v. Mayne Nickles Ltd</u>.<a>(21)</a>.  But we can see no ground for concluding that the court would have been prepared to re-write the rule by substituting âmust nothave been <u>partially</u> justifiableâ to let in a partial defence under the lex loci delicti which is what limitation is.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> We next turn to consider the impact of <u>Boys v. Chaplin</u><a>(10)</a>.  We cannot fault the analysis of the speeches in <u>Dicey</u> pps. 941-2 or extract from them for ourselves any convincing ratio decidendi.  We find it more helpful and profitable to look formajority opinion on particular issues.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> First we think that a majority emphatically reaffirmed the first part of the rules and the dominance of the lex fori. This most clearlyemerges from the speeches of Lord Wilberforce and Lord Pearson:  but this conclusion also carries the support of Lord Donovan (whoapproved Lord Upjohn) p. 383 and Lord Hodson pps. 374-7.  Lord Wilberforce particularly considered this aspect and concluded:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe first part of the rule is laying down, not a test of jurisdiction, but what we now call a rule of choice of law:  is sayingin effect that actions on foreign torts are brought in English courts in accordance with English law.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Then having quoted from <u>The Halley</u><a>(22)</a> he went on : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe judgment states explicitly that it is basically the lex fori which is applied and enforced.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Lord Pearson concluded his analysis of both rules on p. 398 with these words:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe substantive law of (the forum) plays the dominant role, determining the cause of action, whereas the law of the place in whichthe act was committed plays a subordinate role, in that it may provide a justification for the act and so defeat the cause of action,but it does not in itself determine the cause of action.â  These are powerful pointers to the conclusion that defences availablein the forum only are relevant.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The second part of the Willes, J. rule and particularly the word âjustifiableâ produced much more basic disagreement, in particularas to the extent to which, and the means by which, greater flexibility ought or might be introduced.  But it seems to us here thattwo majority opinions can be said to emerge.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> First, <u>Machado v. Fontes</u><a>(15)</a>was overruled, expressly by Lord Hodson, p. 377 and Lord Wilberforce p. 388, and by necessary inference by Lord Guest p. 381.  Butthe effect of this was to substitute the existence of civil liability for any innocence test.  âThe broad principleâ said LordWilberforce p. 389, âShould surely be that a person should not be permitted to claim in England in respect of a matter for whichcivil liability <u>does not exist or is excluded</u>, under the law of the place where the wrong was committed (emphasis supplied)  I wouldâ¦â¦â¦.restate the basic rule of Englishlaw with regard to foreign torts as requiring actionability as a tort according to English law, subject to the condition that civilliability in respect of the foreign claim exists as between the actual parties under the law of the foreign country where the actwas doneâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> This careful formulation does not add materially in its result to the decisions in <u>Parent</u><a>(17)</a><b><sup> </sup></b>and <u>McMillan</u><a>(19)</a>.  In contrast to Lord Guestâs double actionability test at p. 381, it is not expressed in those terms but in the terms of existenceof civil liability.  We think that Diceyâs revised formulation of Rule 172 (1)(b) must be seen in this light.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> We emphasise this because secondly we can see no majority opinion in favour of what might be called a full double actionability test,i.e. one which would introduce all available defences open under both the lex fori and the lex loci delicti.  This may have beenthe intention of Lord Guest and may represent Scotâs law.  But Lord Donovan was equally emphatic against, p. 383.  So was LordPearson : âDouble actionability is not requiredâ p. 398.  He used the phrase âthe worst of both lawsâ to describe the effectof a possible relaxation of the rule which did not have his approval.  We find the quotation of this phrase as apparently representativeof his opinion in Cheshire and North Private International Law 10<sup>th</sup> edition p. 278 somewhat surprising.  We also think that Lord Wilberforce was of the same opinion.  First, his restatement was inthe form we have emphasised not in the form of double actionability.  Secondly, the relaxation of the rule he favoured and whichwould let in partial defences, such as limitation, was special not general : âthe general rule must apply unless clear and satisfyinggrounds are shownâ p. 391 : and applies only to particular issues after special enquiry.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Upon our reading of the speeches in <u>Boys v. Chaplin</u><a>(10)</a><b><sup> </sup></b>therefore in a claim in Hong Kong based upon a tort committed abroad:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)        the governing law is that of Hong Kong;  and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)        the law of the lex loci delicti is relevant only to see whether civil liability for such tort there exists and has notbeen excluded.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">This conclusion, we think, has the support of Goff, L.J. giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in England in <u>Coupland v. Arabian Gulf Petroleum Co</u>.<a>(23)</a>. The case concerned personal injury to the English plaintiff in Libya whilst in the defendantâs employ.  Goff, L.J. pointed outthat the trial judge had held the claim to be âactionable under the lex loci delictiâ.  He went on:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIt follows in my judgment that for the claim in tort, Libyan law falls out of the picture <u>as being irrelevant</u>, so for that purpose the trial can proceed on the basis of the ordinary principles of Common Law negligenceâ p. 229.  (emphasissupplied).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The defendantâs alternative formulation is based upon the new sub-rule (2) to Diceyâs rule 172.  Diceyâs hopes here have notyet been fulfilled.  The formulation still has the support only of Lord Wilberforce and has not been adopted since in England.  InAustralia it was rejected in <u>Kolksy v. Mayne Nickles</u><a>(21)</a> for reasons which carry conviction with us.  We do not think that it can yet be regarded as part of the law of Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Finally, we notice that a majority of the Lords in <u>Boys v. Chaplin</u><a>(10)</a><b><sup> </sup></b>expressed their concern about âforum-shoppingâ;  the possible encouragement which could be given to it by the English rule;  andthe need to discourage it as a matter of public policy, Lord Hodson p. 378:  Lord Donovan p. 383:  and Lord Pearson p. 406.  Althoughwe note that in <u>MacShannon v. Rockware Glass</u><a>(7)</a>, Lord Salmon p. 822, Lord Russell p. 823 and Lord Keith p. 833, all denied the relevance of public policy to the exercise of thejurisdiction to stay proceedings, we think that the proper exercise of this jurisdiction does provide a more convenient answer toforum-shopping than some uncertain relaxation of the substantive law.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Our answer to the first question posed therefore is that the Hong Kong court would apply the M.S.A. limit both by necessity and bychoice.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Indonesian Law</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The next question is what law would the Indonesian courts apply?  The only difference which emerged on the evidence between the applicableTaiwanese and Indonesian laws of negligence was that different limitation provisions applied.  So the first question here is wouldthe Indonesian court apply Taiwanese or Indonesian substantive law, i.e., limitation?  And secondly if it is to be applied, whatis the Indonesian limitation?  No ready answer to either question emerged from the expert evidence of three Indonesian lawyers placedbefore Power, J.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In two main respects, this expert evidence was consistent, namely in showing that in this field, Indonesian law is developing andvery uncertain.  The lawyers were discussing concepts of some sophistication, which after several centuries of development in Europestill occasion considerable debate.  It is therefore not surprising that there was substantial disagreement between them.  We thinkthat a court should approach such evidence with hesitation and within the limits of the possible. It cannot purport to resolve suchdisputes on affidavit evidence.  It can make firm findings only when the evidence is clear.  Where it is in conflict, it can do nomore than reach such tentative conclusions as are necessary for the exercise of this discretionary jurisdiction, upon the balanceof probabilities, making full allowance for the risk that an Indonesian court on very different and much more extensive materialmight take another view.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> In relation to applicable law, the conflicting evidence came from a Mr Lubis and a Mr Sumowidjojo.  Mr Lubisâ argument proceededthus:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) There were no decided cases on which to rely.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) He submitted that pre-independence jurisprudence supported by the works of two named scholars led to the conclusion that Taiwaneselaw should apply.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) If the court was to follow this, it would apply Taiwanese law and Taiwanese limitation.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4) But since the Courts frequently disregarded partiesâ express choices of law:  âin my opinion and respectful submission, wherethere is no choice of law provision, the possibility that the Indonesian court would apply Indonesian law is very high.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">Mr Sumowidjojo argued thus:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) He asserted the âtraditional conflict of laws ruleâ in Indonesia to be that the court could choose either the lex loci delictior the law of the shipâs flag.  He cited no particular authority for this traditional rule, mentioning only that there was equalauthority in favour of the law of the flag.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) In making its choice, the court would consider which law had the greater connection with the facts, subject matter and parties.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) The Indonesian aspects substantially outweighed the Taiwanese aspects, and this led him to conclude that Indonesian law wouldbe applied.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The judge accepted Lubis and rejected Sumowidjojo upon the basis that the former named authority whereas the latter did not.  Hethus felt able to find that the Indonesian court would apply Taiwanese law and Taiwanese limitation.  We cannot agree with this readingof the affirmations.  We do not think that it is a necessary inference from Sumowidjojoâs failure to name authority for his viewpoint that none in fact exists.  Having carefully read the evidence as a whole, we think the probabilities point beyond the âveryhigh possibilityâ spoken of by Lubis to a likelihood of Indonesian law being applied.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> It is equally difficult upon the evidence to come to any firm conclusion as to what the Indonesian limit of a ship ownerâs liabilityin fact is.  Article 474 of the Indonesian civil code goes back to 1848 and in the original Dutch provided for a limitation of aâsum of 50 Guilders per cubic metre net volume of the vesselâ.  There is no official translation of the code into Indonesianbut many translations are used which substitute Rupiahs for Guilders in this article.  This would produce a derisory figure of $2,541. Mr Lubis feared that the courts would apply the code so translated.  Mr Nugroho disagreed and advanced the view that the court woulddeal with the matter âon a case by case basisâ.  But he admitted that he was ânot entirely certain how the Indonesian courtswould determine these limitsâ;  and beyond adverting to the possibility of the court receiving evidence from the department ofthe Director General of Sea Communications, gave no indication as to what he meant by case by case basis and what such evidence andthe courtâs approach would be.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Mr Sumowidjojo expressed his general agreement with Mr Nugroho in this regard.  But he also relied upon a 1968 decision of the Courtof Appeal in Indonesia in a case concerning Garuda Airways where the Court in construing a 1939 Ordinance, admitted evidence fromthe State Bank as to the relative variations in values of Rupiahs and Dutch Florins between 1939 and the day of trial.  This resultedin a conversion rate of 38.12 Rupiahs to 1 Dutch Florin.  This was a decision on a different Ordinance in different circumstances. If it had been a regular practice to adjust between 1848 and 1939, or if it had become a regular practice to adjust in some waysince 1945, we cannot believe that such practice would have escaped the attention of all the lawyers.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The only findings open to the Court on such evidence, which are substantially those made by the judge, are we think:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) That Indonesian law is so uncertain that no finding can be made.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) The possibility of the court basing its calculation upon 1 Rupiah to 1 Guilder cannot be excluded.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) It is perhaps more likely that the court would make some adjustment in some way to reflect current values but the probabilitiesare that any such adjustment would produce a figure very much less than the limitation figures for Hong Kong and Taiwan appropriateto this casualty which are respectively $1,276,103 and $607,135.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> In summary, therefore, if a stay is granted, the plaintiff would lose the certainty of the Hong Kong limit of $1.27m and face theuncertainty of an unknown limit which could be as low as $2,541 but is more likely to be adjusted upwards from that figure to someunascertainable amount.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Other Advantages</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> In relation to these, there was some but much less significant disagreement as to Indonesian law.  The position can be summarizedas follows:-</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(2)  <u>Time limit</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> It was agreed that article 741 of the Commercial Code imposed a time limit of 1 year.  The issue was whether this was mandatory orcould effectively be waived by a party.  Mr Lubisâ view was that the court âmay not and is not obligatedâ to give effect toany agreement or waiver, citing a case where the court had taken the limitation point of its own motion.  Mr Nugroho was of the opinionthat the court would uphold an agreement to waive the time bar, citing post-independence Dutch authority in support.  On this evidence,it was uncertain whether the Indonesian court would uphold a unilateral waiver and not raise limitation of its own motion.</p>    <p class="heading">(3)  <u>âThe Griesheimâ</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> In this case, the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in August 1984, upon the basis of the evidence of Japanese law placed before it, concludedthat under the Japanese Carriage of Goods by Sea Act ship owners were not parties to bills of lading issued by charterers.  It wascommon ground that the chartererâs bills of lading issued in this case were indistinguishable.  It was not seriously disputed beforeus that this decision accordingly gave the plaintiffs an evidential advantage in relation to this finding on Japanese law under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s59.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.59</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a>.  They would not enjoy this advantage in Indonesia.</p>    <p class="heading">(4)  <u>Interest</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> The general rule in Indonesia is that interest is awarded only from the date of the commencement of proceedings and at a rate of6% in the absence of express agreement to the contrary.  Mr Lubisâ view that interest would be subject to the overall limit ofliability under article 474 was not expressly disputed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(5)  <u>Costs</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Apart from court fees, no legal costs are recoverable in Indonesia in the absence of express written agreement, and there are nofacilities or procedure for taxation of costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> In these circumstances, a letter in the following terms was addressed by the defendantsâ solicitors to the plaintiffsâ solicitorsand handed in on the third day of the hearing below:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âWe are instructed by the defendants that they are prepared as a condition of a stay to offer the following undertakings:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(1) Before the Courts of Indonesia, they will waive any defence of time bar against all plaintiffs included in the writs in the aboveHong Kong proceedings.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(2) Before the Courts of Indonesia, they will admit that they are not contractual parties to the bills of lading under which the plaintiffsâcargo were shipped.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(3) They will pay interest on any judgment the plaintiffs may obtain in the District Court of Jakarta, Indonesia from the date ofthe stranding of the above vessel until payment at the Hong Kong judgment interest rates prevailing during that period.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(4) In the event that the plaintiffs are successful before the Indonesian court, the defendants will pay the plaintiffs reasonablecosts, on a basis equivalent to party and party costs before the Hong Kong courts, which, if not agreed amicably, will be assessedby an independent costs clerk sitting as sole arbitrator in Hong Kong.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">These undertakings will of course be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of Hong Kong.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Undertaking (2) was intended to deal with âthe Griesheimâ point.  When it was pointed out in the course of argument before ussuch an undertaking would not prevent the defendants from seeking to rely indirectly upon the terms of the bills of lading throughthe medium of a âbailment upon termsâ argument;  the defendant orally added an undertaking not to raise any doctrine of Japaneselaw in relation to âbailment on termsâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Undertakings Generally</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> These undertakings seem to have originated from Lord Diplockâs phraseology in <u>MacShannon v. Rockware Glass</u><a>(7)</a> that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe stay must not deprive the plaintiff of a legitimate, personal or juridical advantage.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> One reading of this, and it seems to have been that adopted by the judge, is that any deprivation would be fatal.  The <u>Spiliada</u> test is more flexible.  Expressly, the loss of one advantage is not necessarily fatal, if in balance âsubstantial justice willstill be doneâ  Lord Goff 991.  Whilst not seeking to withdraw these undertakings, the defendants stated in argument that since<u>Spiliada</u> they have not needed to offer and would not have offered them.  We think there is force in this, and particularly have serious reservationsabout the utility and appropriateness of these procedures.  Our objections arise under 2 heads â comity and splitting the judicialprocess.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> âJudicial chauvinism has been replaced by judicial comityâ said Lord Diplock in <u>Abidin Daver</u><a>(3)</a>.  We seriously question how far comity will be promoted by, and how far a foreign tribunal will tamely accept the consequences of,a Hong Kong court:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(i)  Telling the foreign forum that it is more suitable so long as we in Hong Kong retain the right to meet specific deficienciesby exercising some supplemental jurisdiction.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(ii)  Attempting to impose procedural requirements upon the foreign forum to improve it in our image, e.g. discovery or cross-examination.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(iii)  Attempting to impose substantive restrictions upon the conduct of the case in that forum which may run counter to its civilinquisitorial system, without clear evidence that such restrictions would be binding upon and acceptable to both the court and theparties in such forum.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(iv)  Going beyond accepting wholly unilateral undertakings from a party as to a particular aspect of the conduct of the litigationin the foreign forum, where such party is clearly dominus litis in that matter e.g. limitation in English law, and where such positionwould clearly be recognized and accepted by the court in such forum.  Under this head, we have particularly in mind such mattersas the transfer of security and time bars.  Security is simple and in an appropriate form international.  Time bars are also specialas their expiry can be influenced by the time taken by the proceedings sought to be stayed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> We have four observations to make in respect of the spitting of the judicial process which Power, J. rightly criticized, namely:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  We read the Spiliada decision as supporting the need for a clean break.  If it is necessary to tinker with or supplement proceduresin the other forum, it is hard to see how it could be âclearly and distinctly more appropriateâ notwithstanding the loss of oneor more advantages.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  The giving of undertakings to the Hong Kong Court, to be governed by Hong Kong law, necessarily results in the imposition uponthe parties of two legal systems:  two differing and possibly conflicting jurisdictions:  and at least the threat of two lawsuits. But one of the fundamental purposes of this particular jurisdiction is to avoid this: <u>Abidin Daver</u><a>(3)</a>.  The argument that if the plaintiffs are reasonable, these undertakings would give rise to no serious problems so the risk of litigationwould not harden into a reality is we think specious.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)  Anything the court does to encourage this process is, we think, calculated to encourage forum bargaining.  Two locations maybe available to a plaintiff â Hong Kong and another.  The other may be the more natural forum, but Hong Kong may have proceduraladvantages.  If this process be right, the plaintiff could at once sue in Hong Kong, and attempt to preserve those advantages asthe price of a stay.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)  Lastly and fundamentally, we think acceptance by the court of undertakings such as these, and of any residual jurisdiction, mustnecessarily imply a capacity to resolve residual problems.  If, as we think, the courtâs capacity is very limited, then by acceptanceit is putting itself in a false position.  Basically, we think, a court should only accept undertakings which are so clear and precisethat an alleged breach would give rise to a straight forward question of fact, so that on proof of this the court would feel freeto impose the serious penalties associated with contempt.  These undertakings do not all satisfy this test.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> We take by way of example the undertaking as to costs.  Who is to determine whether âthe plaintiffs are successfulâ.  The firstsuggestion in argument was the Indonesian court.  But it cannot be expected, and still less required, to exercise an unknown jurisdiction. The Hong Kong court?  We do not see how this court could entertain a construction summons on the meaning of an undertaking, or ifit could, how and by what criteria it could measure success.  The arbitrator?  The task would apparently fall to him.  But whereis this jurisdiction to come from?  Arbitration is consensual:  there must be a submission : and this undertaking is purely unilateral. This, we think, probably explains why the defendants in reply complained of the plaintiffsâ unreasonable failure to enter intoan agreement.  An agreement would give the Hong Kong court something to construe.  An agreement would give jurisdiction to the arbitrator. But this submission seems to us to run counter to the whole concept of contractual autonomy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> The residual means of enforcement relied upon by the defendants is equally uncertain.  This was the courtâs ability to remove thestay and allow the action again to proceed in Hong Kong.  It could well be too late or ineffective.  If the proceedings in Indonesiahad reached or nearly reached judgment, the Hong Kong court would probably be powerless to prevent an effective judgment being giventhere, which could neither be set aside nor neutralized by Hong Kong proceedings.  We are minded to think that occasions are notdifficult to envisage where the courtâs power of enforcement of an undertaking as such would be inadequate, and that the most effectivemeans of enforcing the purpose behind the undertaking would be to insist upon a parallel undertaking in damages fortified by securityso that in the event of breach, the court would have both the power and the means of awarding damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> In these circumstances, our conclusions upon the undertakings offered by the defendants are as follows:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(1)  <u>Time Bar</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> The evidence of Indonesian law leaves it quite uncertain whether the Indonesian courts would regard themselves as bound by the defendantsâwaiver and not raise limitation for themselves.  Equally uncertain in terms of comity is their attitude to an undertaking apparentlyâextractedâ from one party in order to have the case tried in Indonesia at all.  We are not satisfied that this undertaking iseffective to fulfill its intended purpose.</p>    <p class="heading">(2)  <u>The âGriesheimâ</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> We have two problems here.  First, the Indonesian court would have the bills of lading in front of it.  Will they meekly accept thisadmission as to the effect of Japanese law:  or will they require evidence of Japanese law or perhaps in default apply Indonesianlaw upon the assumption that it is the same?  Will they accept this restriction upon what appears to be their normal inquisitorialrole?  These questions are not answered on the evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> Secondly, the âbailment upon termsâ concept can best be described as developing in English law.  We have no evidence about Japaneselaw in relation to it, and indeed whether it has any and if so, what meaning in Japan.  It seems to us that a Hong Kong judge wouldhave the utmost difficulty hereafter in determining whether any particular argument advanced in Indonesia under Japanese law (orIndonesian if they are treated as the same) did or did not constitute a breach of this undertaking.  We therefore do not regard thisundertaking as effective or acceptable.</p>    <p class="heading">(3)  <u>Interest</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> This seems to be a typical example of a juridical advantage which would be lost, and the loss of which has to be brought into accountin the balancing process.  Our doubts as to its effectiveness arise under Indonesian law.  Mr Lubis said, without apparent contradictions,that the Indonesian ship ownersâ limit covers both capital and interest.  Is the Indonesian court going to be happy with a resultwhereby it gives so many Rupiahs to cover capital and interest, knowing that the defendant has to pay a calculable additional sumin Hong Kong dollars?  Or is it going to decline to witness this breach of its own substantive provisions as a result of externalpressures, and therefore to make a corresponding reduction in its original award?  We do not know.</p>    <p class="heading">(4)  <u>Costs</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> The problems of comprehension and enforcement render this undertaking unacceptable in our judgment. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> In our judgment therefore, the undertakings offered are all either ineffective or unacceptable and all these procedural advantagesmust be regarded as lost for the purposes of stage 3.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Stage III â the balancing process</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> This case bears no resemblance on its facts to all but one of the recent House of Lordsâ decisions.  The plaintiffs found uponthe courtâs Admiralty jurisdiction in respect of which Lord Reid said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âI would not regard a foreigner who arrests a ship in England as necessarily forum-shopping.  The right to arrest a ship is an ancientand often a necessary right.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">Atlantic Star, p. 474</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">But the Hong Kong connection here is not significantly greater than was the Scottish connection in <u>Societe du Gaz de Paris v. Armateurs francais</u><a>(24)</a> where the House of Lords had no hesitation in upholding the grant of a stay.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> The major difference is that a stay would result in the loss to the plaintiffs of the crucial advantage of the Hong Kong shipâslimit, together with the more minor but still significant other procedural advantages.  No comparable balancing exercise had to beperformed in the recent House of Lordâs cases prior to <u>de Dampierre v. de Dampierre</u><a>(25)</a>.  Until then, only in <u>Trendtex Trading Corp. v. Credit Suisse</u><a>(26)</a> had it been acknowledged that any procedural advantage existed, namely discovery, which was loss by the grant of the stay.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> It is necessary first to measure the impact of Lord Goffâs emphasis on objectivity : âsimply to give the plaintiff his advantageat the expense of the defendant, is not consistent with the objective approach inherent in Lord Kinnearâs statement of principlein <u>Sim v. Robinow</u> 19 R. 665, 668â <u>Spiliada</u><a>(1)</a>. Do these words bring about an important difference in approach, or no more than a shift of emphasis?  If the test is not injusticeto the plaintiff, but substantive justice to both parties, is the court now required to place the substantive provisions of the rivaljurisdictions in the scales of justice, with a view to determining objectively which operates the more justly in the particular circumstances? Or is the court being reminded that when in the balancing process, it is considering injustice to the plaintiff, it must not ignorethe other partyâs position, and that not all lost advantages necessarily lead to such injustice?  For two reasons, we at one timeinclined to the latter view.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> First, precedent and construction seemed to support it.  Two of the tests suggested in <u>Abidin Daver</u><a>(3)</a> appeared to emphasise the need to consider the position of the plaintiff alone.  Lord Diplock spoke of :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âSome personal or juridical advantage that would be available to him only in the (existing) action that is of such importance thatit would cause injustice <u>to him</u> to deprive him of it.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">p. 412</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">Lord Keith said :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âA stay will not be granted unless the court concludes that to refuse it would involve injustice to the defendant and the grantwould involve no injustice <u>to the plaintiff.â</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">p. 416.  (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">This view seemed to have the support of Lord Templeman in his speech in <u>Spiliada</u><a>(1)</a> where he said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âBut whatever reasons may be advanced in favour of a foreign forum, the plaintiff will be allowed to pursue an action which theEnglish court has jurisdiction to entertain, if it would be unjust to the plaintiff to confine him to remedies elsewhere.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>p. 975</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Lord Templeman also agreed with Lord Goff;  and both Lord Griffiths and Lord Mackay, agreed with both.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> Secondly, we are concerned with an Imperial Statute drawn about as widely as it could be.  It operates in the United Kingdom, inâthe whole of Her Majestyâs Dominionsâ; and equally in all these locations to foreign ship owners.  In the ordinary course,the court has no power to question the fairness of such a piece of legislation;  and still less to decline to apply it on the groundthat it operates unfairly between particular parties or particular foreigners.  We recognize that the Admiralty Jurisdiction of thecourt âdoes not affect â¦â¦â¦.. the courtâs power inherent or statutory to stay proceedings.  It leaves the court master ofits own procedureâ in the words of Lord Wilberforce in <u>Atlantic Star</u> p. 463.  But if in the exercise of this procedural jurisdiction, we have objectively to consider the justice of the Hong Kong limit,we would be pronouncing upon the justice of this particular application of Parliamentâs intention to these foreigners.  We wereconcerned whether, the direct route being closed, this court could by any procedural path indirectly so pronounce upon a statute,whether such path was labelled âstay and the avoidance of injusticeâ or âpolicy and the avoidance of forum-shoppingâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> The decision in <u>de Dampierre</u><a>(25)</a><b><sup> </sup></b>has resolved our doubts.  This makes it clear that it is the first view which is correct : that the test is now not injustice to theplaintiff but justice to both parties:  and that our jurisdictional doubts were ill-founded.  We must consider, per Lord Templeman,whether it is âjustâ that the plaintiffs âshould be allowed to exploit their Hong Kong advantageâ and we should âonly refusea stay if it would be unjust to confine the plaintiffsâ to their remedies in Indonesia.  We must consider, per Lord Goff, âthebalance of fairness between the partiesâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> We have not found this novel task easy.  The defendantsâ invitation to adopt an off-shore viewpoint seemed somewhat unreal.  Theplaintiffâs invitation to adopt an international viewpoint, to apply the international standards of the 1957 Brusselâs Convention,the International Convention relating to the limitation of liability of owners of sea-going ships, was somewhat more attractive. But a glance at the list of ratifying countries shows that the Convention has been much more widely adopted in Europe than in thispart of the world.  This emphasizes the wide differences between conditions and attitudes in Europe and in Southeast Asia, whichare perhaps no less than those affecting policy considerations here and in London.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> Although we recognize the comparatively tenuous connection between Hong Kong and this casualty, we think it would be unjust to theplaintiffs to deprive them of the Hong Kong limit which reflects international public policy, and confine them to the at best uncertain,and at worst derisory, level of the Indonesian limit.  Nor ware the other procedural advantages which will be lost in Indonesia trivialmatters.  Conversely, we see no good reason of policy or otherwise for condemning the plaintiffsâ choice of a Hong Kong forum asâforum-shoppingâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> For these reasons, we reach the same conclusion as Power, J. and dismiss this appeal.
