The tenant is Winstar International Investments Limited and operating arestaurant named âSatay Kingâ (âthe Tenantâ) at the Plaintiffâs premises.  The Plaintiffâs Premises are still let tothe Tenant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Plaintiffâs claim is that since in or about March 2002, the Defendant wrongfully caused or permitted water to escape, seepand/or leak from the Defendantâs Premises into the Plaintiffâs Premises.  Water was dripping from the ceiling of the PlaintiffâsPremises (âthe Leakagesâ).  As a result thereof, a certain part of the ceilings of the Plaintiffâs Premises became defectivethat there have been water stains and peeling paint from the ceiling (âthe affected areaâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The area of water seepage had extended and water dripping became serious especially during rainy days. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In this action the Plaintiff claims loss and damage from the Defendant arising from the said water seepage as well as:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)  A mandatory injunction that the Defendant by herself, her tenants, licensees, servants, agents or otherwise do forthwith carryout repair work on the Defendantâs Premises;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)  An injunction to restrain the Defendant by herself, her tenants, licensees, servants, agents or otherwise from repeating or continuingthe Leakages from the Defendantâs Premises thereby causing damage to the Plaintiffâs Premises or the said nuisance or any nuisanceof a like kind.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Plaintiff pleads that the leakages are caused by the negligence of the Defendant.   The particulars of negligence are pleadedas follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)  Failing to inspect or to provide maintenance or repair to the Defendantâs Premises so that the Leakages would not occur.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)  Failing to take any or any sufficient steps and/or measures to prevent the Leakages from occurrence or at all.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)  Permitting the water to escape, seep and/or lead from the Defendantâs Premises into the Plaintiffâs Premises.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Plaintiff relies on the Deed of Mutual Covenant dated 24<sup>th</sup> October 1980 and registered in the Tsuen Wan New Territories Land Registry by Memorial No. 202525 (âthe DMCâ).  In the DMC, theDefendant has covenanted with the Plaintiff and the other owners of the building of which the Plaintiffâs Premises and the Defendant'sPremises form part, in Paragraph (a) of the Second Schedule, inter alia, that as an owner, he will âkeep the interior of his ownportion of the said building in good repair and condition and to maintain the same in a manner so as to avoid any loss damage nuisanceor annoyance to the owners or occupiers of any other portions of the said building.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The Plaintiff pleads that the Defendant has failed to perform the aforesaid covenant of the DMC.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  It is the Plaintiffâs case that despite repeated requests and demands, and, in particular by letters from the solicitors for thePlaintiff addressed to the Defendant dated 10<sup>th</sup> October 2003 and 4<sup>th</sup> February 2004, demanding the Defendant to be responsible for the loss and damage suffered by the Plaintiff and to carry out repairworks on the Defendantâs Premises, the Defendant has failed and/or refused to pay for the loss and damage suffered by the Plaintiffand to carry out such repair works on the Defendant's Premises to prevent further water leakages to the Plaintiff's Premises.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Defendant in her defence states that the leakage is caused by a hole on the floor slab in the room which houses the lift motor(hereinafter referred to as âLift Motor Roomâ) which is situated on the flat roof of the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor and adjourns Flat A on the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor of the said Chau Hop Shing Building.   The Plaintiff made this hole in about 1998.  The Lift Motor Room is shown on the floorplan at page 51 of the Bundle of Documents (âBDâ).    Further the Defendant pleads that the hole in the floor slab of the LiftMotor Room has caused grave security risk to the Defendantâs premises.   She states that the hole has a stepladder, which reachesthis hole from the Satay King on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor.   Hence it poses a security risk to the Defendantâs Premises as the Lift Motor Room opens onto the flat roof of the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor which is part of the Defendantâs Premises.  Further the hole has caused the water seepage this fact is evident because thehole is close to the areas of water seepage on the third floor.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Defence pleads that since the hole was made in 1998, the walls in the premises owned by the Defendantâs husband namely inFlat A on the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor of the same building started to crack.   In 2000 the crack became increasingly wider and deeper.   At present many areas ofthe said Flat A have large cracks.   The damaged condition of the said Flat A has become worse.  It is noted that as Flat A is notowned by the Defendant the complaints related to Flat A could not become part of her case against the Plaintiff.  However she pleadsthat the hole has an effect on the structure of the premises and is the cause of the water seepage.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Defendant counterclaims that as a result of the security risk posed by the hole, the Defendant and her husband are not ableto sell their premises.   She counterclaims for the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(i)      Payment of the mortgage loan repayments made by her since 1998, together with rates and management fees since then paid inrespect of the Defendant's Premises.   </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(ii)     Costs</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(iii)    Were the Flat Roof of Flat B found to be leaking, the Plaintiff should be responsible to repair it.  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(iv)    Damages for inconvenience and discomfort</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">The Issues</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">1. Whether the water seepage is caused by the state of disrepair of the Defendant's Premises.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">2. Whether the Defendant should be responsible to repair it. </p>        <p style="text-align:justify">3. Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to the damages, and the mandatory injunction and injunction sought. </p>        <p style="text-align:justify">4.

He confirmed that the Plaintiff is the registeredowner of the Plaintiffâs premises and these same premises has been let to the Tenant for the operation of the Satay King.  He statesthat since in or about March 2000, the Tenant noted that water was dripping from the ceilings of the Plaintiff's Premises and reportedthe matter to the Plaintiff.  The affected area was immediately underneath the Flat Roof of the Defendant's Premises.  He allegesthat water escaped, seeped and/or leaked from the Defendant's Premises to the Plaintiff's Premises.  As a result thereof, a certainpart of the ceiling of the Plaintiff's Premises has been affected and there are water stains on it.  There is also peeling paintworkon the ceiling.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The Plaintiff reported the water leakage to the Management Office and/or the Owners Incorporation of Chau Hop Shing Building inwhich the Plaintiffâs Premises and the Defendant's Premises form part.  However, no remedial work has been taken out by eitherthe Management Office or the Owners Incorporation.  The Defendant has failed and/or refused to respond and/or to make repair to theLeakages to the Plaintiff's Premises as the Defendant's Premises were left vacant for quite a long time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  To minimize loss and nuisance already suffered by the Plaintiff and/or the Tenant, the Plaintiff had in or about September 2002instructed a contractor to carry out minimal remedial repairs to stop the continual Leakages from the Defendantâs Premises.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  However, no sooner had the remedial repairs been completed, the Leakages had reappeared.  The area of water stains and peeling paintworkon the ceiling of the Plaintiff's Premises became larger and more extensive.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The Plaintiff sought and obtained a Court Order dated 31 May 2004 under HCMP No. 1051 of 2004 authorizing it to enter the DefendantâsPremises for the purpose of inspection of the Defendant's Premises to find out the cause of the Leakages.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The Plaintiff instructed Dudley Surveyors Limited to carry out inspection at the Defendantâs Premises on 29<sup>th</sup> June 2004 and a Surveyorâs Report was prepared by them.  During the inspection he accompanied the surveyors to carry out the inspection.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  When he went into the Defendantâs Premises he found that it was in an awful state.  The Defendant's Premises had been unoccupiedfor a long time.  The interior decorations, plumbing and drainage, doors and windows were all in a condition of disrepair.  The Defendant'sPremises were unhygienic and a health hazard to its neighbours and nearby occupants.  The Surveyorâs Report concluded that varioustypes of aging defects like open joints, cracked surfaces, on the flat roof had caused the Leakages.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  It is clear from the condition of the Plaintiffâs Premises with dripping from the ceiling and peeling paintwork from the ceilinghas caused inconvenience and discomfort to the Tenant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  As a temporary measure to alleviate the condition suffered by the Tenant, the Plaintiff on about 24<sup>th</sup> August 2003 instructed a contractor transliterated as Ho Kwong Decoration Company to conduct remedial work on the ceiling of thePlaintiff's Premises by installing drain pipes and metal trays at various locations underneath the ceiling of the Plaintiff's Premisesfor collection of water dripping and/or seeping.  The cost spent on the said remedial work was $1,500.  The Plaintiff referred toa copy of the quotation issued by Ho Kwong Decoration Company dated 24<sup>th</sup> August 2003 bearing the paid chop showing the date of 27<sup>th</sup> October 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The Plaintiff called Mr. Albert Chan Kwok Wai, (hereinafter referred to as âMr.Chanâ) a Building Consultant in Dudley SurveyorsLimited to give evidence.   There is no doubt that Mr. Albert Chan is an expert in his field as can be seen in his Curriculum Vitaeproduced marked Exh P1.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  He confirmed that the contents of his Survey Report at page 182 to 185 of the Bundle of Documents (âBDâ) is correct.    He locatedthe three major areas within the Restaurant that is seriously affected by the Leakages after heavy rainfall.   They are at locationA, B and C as shown in the Floor Plan at Appendix A attached to the Survey Report at page 187 of BD and these locations are shownin Photos 2, 3 and 4 respectively in the Survey Report at pages 189 and 190 of BD.   He lifted the false ceiling panels at theseareas for inspection and for close examination.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  He stated at paragraphs 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 of his Survey Report as follows: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â3.3.

They were at locations A, B and C (see Photos. 2, 3 &amp; 4 respectively and FloorPlan for indication at Appendix A).  The false ceiling panels to these areas were lifted up for inspection and close examination.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">3.4 We noted that metal trays for water collection and drain pipes were suspended from the ceiling to protect the decoration and seatingarea underneath.  When the plastered ceiling surfaces were touched, we felt the moist substrate.  Our Protimeter (Moisture Meter)test recorded all high readings to the reported leakage areas and their vicinity (average over 80%).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">3.5 As could be observed, the ceiling surfaces were generally stained by water marks.  Bubbling and peeled-off paintwork were notedto scatter around near the spots.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  He described the interior of the Defendantâs Premises at paragraphs 4.2 to4.4 of his Survey Report.    Paragraph 4.2 states,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â4.2 Interior of the Flat gave out an awful bad smell.  The Flat was vacant, without any furniture and generally very badly maintained. All the timber doors were in dilapidated condition including the main entrance door which could hardly be closed.  The timber flooringwas lifted up; metal windows were rusty and in disrepair; concrete spalling, debonded and cracked plastering were commonly notedon the wall and ceiling surfaces (Photos. 5-9).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The photographs show all.   The condition is so dilapidated that it seems that it must have been left unattended and unoccupiedfor many years.   Mr. Chan described the awful smell emitting from the unhygienic condition of the premises wherein were found catand dogâs waste, and broken glass panes.   There was detached plastering, wet staining and generally peeled-off paintwork.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In relation to the hole on the floor slab of the Lift Motor Room housing the lift motor of the lift servicing the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> floors of Chau Hop Shing Building, he stated in paragraph 4.7 of his Survey Report that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â4.7 Access was gained to the open Roof on 4<sup>th</sup> Floor through Flat B on 4<sup>th</sup> Floor (Photo. 16).

There were various types of aging defects like open joints, cracking, fracturedsurfaces gradually developed on the top membrance causing water leakage again.  Coupled with the fact that the open Roof is unattended,the rainwater rested on top of the roofing membrane due to the packed debris, blocked drains and drain paths further accelerate thechance of water ponding and leakages.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  He further concluded that the hole on the floor slab of the Lift Motor Room has no causal connection to the Leakages of at the ceilingof the Plaintiffâs Premises.   The hole is located inside the Lift Motor Room which is enclosed and has a roof.   Under the roof,water could not get into the hole or anywhere around the hole.   Further he stated in oral evidence that there is a ledge about 8inches high.  The door opening into the Lift Motor Room as can be seen in Photo 28 in his Survey Report sits above this ledge.  He states that because of that, it is unlikely that rainwater could go through the bottom of the door into the Lift Motor Room.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Further, he says that the hole in the Lift Motor Room is about a distance of 10 feet away from position A, the nearest locationwhere there is water seepage into the Plaintiffâs Premises.  The two areas are shown on the floor plan at Appendix A of the Reportat page 187 of the BD.   He states that it is not likely that the hole has anything to do with the water seepage.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  He came to his finding on the state of disrepair of the flat roof through observation with his eyes.   He is experienced and wouldbe able to come to a clear assessment of the condition of the roof and its membrane from observation.    He was informed by the staffof the Tenant, Satay King that whenever there is heavy rain, the water would drip into the water collection trays such as that shownin Photo 2 of his Survey Report, above the false ceiling.    Further, the area of water seepage corresponds to the area where thereis break and defect in the water repellent membrane on the roof surface.   These confirm his view that the water seepage is causedby the aging defects of the roof surface and the roofing membrane.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  He proposes two solutions to ensure the condition of the roof is restored to become impermeable to water.   First is to do a thoroughwork to carry out a complete re-roofing of the area.  This will ensure that the condition of the roof will be waterproof for 5 â10 years.   A specialist-roofing contractor with a proprietary system should carry out this work.  This will cost around HK$250,000.00.  The other is a temporary measure, which would last 2 â 3 years.   It is by injection of epoxy grouting into the cracked areas. The epoxy would expand and fill the cracks.   It is like glue.  It will solidify as it fills in the cracks.   This is a cheapermethod of repair.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The Defendant has no legal representation.  She applied for her husband to represent her in the proceedings.  The PlaintiffâsCounsel did not object.  Both she and her husband are elderly.  The Defendant called her husband Mr. Chan Sik Chan to give evidenceon her behalf.   He adduced his witness statement into evidence as his evidence in chief and confirmed its content to be true.  Hereferred to his complaint to the Buildings Department related to the hole on the floor slab of the Lift Motor Room in October 1998.  He stated that the Buildings Department registered an Order on 2 August 2000 in the Land Office related to the illegal constructionin the hole and required its rectification within 60 days.   The Buildings Department did not enforce the Order but stated that theywere investigating as regards whether the hole would cause any danger to the structural integrity of the building.   He stated howeverthat his own property, which is Flat A on the 4th Floor, was affected by the said hole and the paint started to peel off and thewall started to crack.  However this is not an issue relevant to this trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Subsequently he received a letter dated 23 July 2003 from the Buildings Department wherein he was informed that the Plaintiff hademployed an Authorized Person to remake the hole in the Lift Motor Room.  It stated that the work required in the Order registeredin the registry of the Land Office has been performed and the hole has become a legal structure.   He takes issue with the BuildingsDepartment on a number of points.   However, all these do not have any direct relevance to the First Issue.   The Defendantâs complaintagainst the Buildings Department are not an issue of this trial but is stated here merely for completeness.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The witness states that after the hole was made in 1998, from March 2002 onwards, complaints about water seepage in the PlaintiffâsPremises were received until now.   He states that according to the Plaintiff the water seepage was in the vicinity of the hole ofin the floor slab in the Lift Motor Room.   From August 2000 to 2 May 2003, this hole was still an illegal structure.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  He admits that on 10 October 2003 and on 4 February 2004 the Defendant received demands for payment of the charges for renovationon 5 September 2002 for repair of the flat roof of Unit B in the sum of $4,200 and legal costs in the sum of $2,400.   On the 31May 2004 the Plaintiff had instituted HCMP 1051 of 2004 in relation to the claim for damages arising from water seepage.   The Defendantrequested for a copy of the judgment related to these proceedings.   At the trial, it became clear that there is no judgment in HCMP1051 of 2004 as the application was made under Order 29 Rule 7A, to obtain a pre-action order to enter premises for an inspectionto be conducted by a surveyor.   The Order is at pages 172 to 173 of the BD.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  He states that it seems that the report of Dudley Surveyors Limited also mentions that the area of water seepage is near the hole. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  In cross-examination, he stated that the flat roof on the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor adjourning Flat B belonged to the Defendant.  He stated that he purchased Flat A unit on the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor and his wife the Defendant purchased Flat B unit on the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor in 1993 from the previous owner who operated a restaurant on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor.  The said Flat A and Flat B were used by the restaurant owner as quarters for its staff.  After purchase he and his wife letFlat A and Flat B units under a tenancy to the restaurant for occupation by its staff respectively.   The restaurant was closed in1996.  He and his wife recovered possession of the Flat A and Flat B units respectively then.   The condition of the Defendantâspremises was in a slightly better state of repair than now.   After they recovered possession they did not do any decoration workin the premises but only cleared the rubbish.   Since then the said Flat A and Flat B had been left vacant.   He and his wife, theDefendant, tried to sell the two premises since 1996 but without success.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  He stated that the reason why his premises in Flat A and Flat B had been left vacant was because there was the door leading to theLift Motor Room.   Every potential buyer who looked at the door of the Lift Motor Room and came to know of the hole on the floorslab within the Lift Motor Room would be put off by it.  He received no offer price from any potential buyer.  Hence the premiseswere left vacant and he had to pay management fees and rates.  The Defendantâs Premises has this litigation pending.   It was putto him that the reason why Flat A and Flat B could not be sold was because of their dilapidated state.   He disagreed and said thatthere could be a discounting of this by a reduction on the offer price by the potential buyer but the Defendant did not even havean offer.   Subsequently he stated that he had an offer to buy at $800,000 for both Flat A and Flat B on the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor but it went no further. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  It was put to him in cross-examination that the Plaintiff had for many years tried to enter into the flat roof of the DefendantâsPremises in order to gain access to the Lift Motor Room to repair the lift motor but could not gain access.   The Defendant saidthat if he had left the keys of Flat A and Flat B with the Management Office, there would not have been this litigation.   He admittedthat he and his wife only went to Flat A and Flat B about three times a year.   They had an agent who went there more frequentlyto pay the management fees.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  He admits that Photo 5 at page 191 showed the entrance to Flat B.   He states that the two photos at page 192 shows the DefendantâsPremises.   He admits that Photo 12, 13, 14 showed the Defendantâs Premises and Photo 15 showed the door to the Defendantâs Premises.  He admits that Photos 16, 17 and 26 on pages 196, 197 and 201 represents the flat roof of the Defendantâs property.   He agreedthat Photo 22 showed the gutter of the flat roof of the Defendantâs Premises.   He stated that Photo 27 and the right side of photo28 showed the Defendantâs premises (however the orange door is the door leading to the Lift Motor Room).  He agreed that the Defendanthas exclusive possession of the flat roof adjourning the Defendantâs Premises.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In cross-examination he was shown the photographs which showed the water tray above the false ceiling of Satay King.   He said thathe went to Satay King as a customer but did not see the water seepage. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  He stated that he has not read the terms of the Deed of Mutual Covenant.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The Defendant called Mr. Wong Cheuk Ki, Eric (âMr. Wongâ) of the Buildings Department to give evidence related to the lettersdated 22 July 2003 written by him on behalf of the Buildings Department.   Mr. Wong explained that according to records, they issuedthe Order at page 151 of BD to remove the illegal structure namely the hole on the floor slab of the Lift Motor Room.  However theydiscovered that there is no way of going into the Lift Motor Room for repair of the lift motor because access could not be gainedthrough the Defendant's Premises because it was unoccupied.  This would cause danger and they therefore stayed the execution of theOrder.   The Plaintiff instructed an Authorised Person and he designed a means of making the hole safe.  He stated that they discoveredthat the hole had not caused any danger to the building structure and did not cause the crack of plaster in the walls of the FlatA unit.   He further stated that he made no investigation as regards whether the hole had any relevance to the water seepage.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Having heard evidence from the parties it is clear from the evidence of Mr. Chan of Dudley Surveyors Limited that the cause of thewater seepage is caused by the poor condition of the flat roof of the Defendantâs Premises namely Flat B unit.   The areas of waterseepage corresponds to the areas where Mr. Chan found cracks or defects in the roofing membrane on the roof.    Further the staffof Satay King found that whenever it rained, water dripped into the water trays above the false ceiling of Satay King.   He statedthat the area of water seepage is not near to the hole on the floor slab of the Lift Motor Room.    He stated that the water seepageis not due to the hole on the floor slab of the Lift Motor Room.    I have considered the evidence of the Defendantâs husband andI find that there is nothing to substantiate his allegation that the water seepage is due to the hole on the floor slab of the LiftMotor Room.  The Defendant herself did not give evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  I find that the Plaintiff has established that the water seepage into the ceiling of the Plaintiffâs Premises is due to the defectof the flat roof surface of the Defendantâs Premises as a result of aging.  </p>    <p><u>The Second Issue</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  It is clear that the cause of the water seepage is because the Defendant has failed to keep the flat roof in good repair.   It isclear that she is the owner of the flat roof attached to the Defendantâs Premises.   Clause 3 at page 2 of the DMC, sets out theundivided equal parts of shares of each individual Flat of each floor of the building.  It shows that Flat A on 4<sup>th</sup> Floor does not have any Flat Roof attached to it and Flat B 4<sup>th</sup> Floor, has a Flat Roof attached.  The Assignment of the Defendantâs Premises at page 94 of BD states clearly that the Defendantis the owner of Flat B on 4<sup>th</sup> Floor together with the Flat Roof of No. 6 Chung On Street, Tsuen Wan, New Territories.   The Flat Roof of the Defendantâs Premisesis an area where access thereto could be gained from the door opening out into it in the Defendantâs Premises as shown on the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor Plan at page 187 and page 97 of the BD.   This same Flat Roof is the area where the corresponding locations of water seepageon the ceiling in the Plaintiffâs Premises are found as marked A, B and C on the plan at page 187.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The Defendantâs husband in evidence referred to photos 16, 17, 22, 26, 27 and 28 in the Survey Report at pages 196, 197, 199,201 and 203 as depicting parts of the flat roof of the Defendantâs Premises.   He agreed that Flat Roof B is the flat roof theDefendant has exclusive possession of.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  The Plaintiffâs Counsel in final submission referred to Paragraph (a) of the Second Schedule of the DMC which states that eachowner covenants âTo keep the interior of his own portion of the said building in good repair and condition and to maintain thesame in a manner so as to avoid any loss damage nuisance or annoyance to the owners or occupiers of any other portions of the saidbuildingâ.   He submits that this clause imposes on the Defendant an obligation to keep the flat roof of the Defendantâs Premisesin good repair.   He submits that even were she not so obliged under the aforesaid clause in the Deed of Mutual Covenant, she isobliged to do so under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s34h.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 34H</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a>.   That Section states,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â(1)  Where a person owns any part of a building, has the right to the exclusive possession of any part of a building or has theexclusive right to the use, occupation or enjoyment of that part, as the case may be, but the deed of mutual covenant in respectof the building does not impose an obligation on that person to maintain the part in good repair and condition, that person shallmaintain that part in good repair and condition.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"> (2)  The obligation in subsection (1) shall be deemed to be an obligation owed to all owners of the building under the deed of mutualcovenant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The Plaintiffâs Counsel also referred to Uniland Investment Enterprises Ltd v. Incorporated Owners of Sea View Estate  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%204%20HKC%20141" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 4 HKC 141.</a>   Deputy Judge Anthony To stated that he agreed with Mr. Chan SCâs submission that the inclusion of the words âbut the deed ofmutual covenant does not impose on that person to maintainâ¦â is specifically aimed at redressing the situation where a developercreates for itself, its successor, or anybody, in the DMC a right to exclusive possession of any part of the building without a correspondingobligation to maintain that part of the building.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  It seems clear from the DMC and the Assignment of the Defendant's Premises that the Defendant has exclusive possession of the FlatRoof of the Defendantâs Premises.   The Flat Roof is clearly a part of the premises assigned to the Defendant by the Assignment. In para (a) of the Schedule to the Assignment at page 94 of the BD it states that the Defendant is âto have the sole and exclusiveright and privilege to hold use occupy and enjoy All That Flat B and Flat Roof on the Fourth Floor of the Buildingâ </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  I therefore find that the Defendant has the obligation to repair the flat roof of the Defendantâs Premises but has failed to doso despite requests from the Plaintiff.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>The 3rd Issue</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  That being the case, I find that the Plaintiff is entitled to the items of claim.  The Plaintiff has expended $1,500 to installdrainpipes and metal trays to collect water under the ceiling.  The receipt of this work is at page 171 of the BD.  The Plaintiffhas submitted a quotation for the repair of the ceiling of the Plaintiffâs Premises at $3,000.   This has yet to be done.   I findthat the Plaintiff is entitled to judgement for the sum of $4,500 being the total of these sums.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The Plaintiffâs Counsel also submitted that the Defendant should be held liable for nuisance.   He submits that nuisance is anact or omission, which is an interference with, disturbance of or annoyance to, a person in the exercise or enjoyment of his ownershipor occupation of land.   With reference to para 19-01 of Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Tort 18<sup>th</sup> Edition at page 973, he submits that by omitting to keep the flat roof in good repair and condition, the Defendant has caused interferencewith and annoyance to the Plaintiffâs enjoyment of his ownership of its premises on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor.  The Defendantâs Counsel refers to para 19-30 of Clerk &amp; Lindsell, which states that many cases of nuisance are concernedwith the remedy of injunction.  Reference is made to the judgment of Lord Denning M.R. in Miller v. Jackson,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20QB%20966" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] Q.B. 966</a> at page 980 where it is stated,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âif the plaintiff seeks a remedy in damages for injury done to him or his property, he can lay his claim either in negligence ornuisance.  But if he seeks an injunction to stop the playing of cricket altogether, I think he must make his claim in nuisance.  The books are full of cases where an injunction has been granted to restrain the continuance of a nuisance. . .â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  The Plaintiffâs claim for a mandatory injunction and injunction is based on nuisance.  In my view, the Plaintiff has establishedthat that continuance of water seepage from the flat roof of the Defendantâs Premises has caused nuisance to the Plaintiff.   ThePlaintiff is entitled to a mandatory injunction requiring the Defendant to repair the flat roof of the Defendantâs Premises tomake it watertight.   The Plaintiff is also entitled to an injunction restraining the Defendant from repeating or allowing the continuanceof the water seepage from the Defendantâs Premises to the Plaintiffâs Premises thereby causing nuisance to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>The 4th Issue</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  This is a troubling case in view of a number of factors.    Firstly, the floor plan of the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor of the Building was designed with 4 domestic units as well as a Lift Motor Room.   The unfortunate feature is that the LiftMotor Room has no access except through Flat B of the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor.  Paragraph (g)(i) of the Second Schedule to the DMC imposes on the owner of the Flat Roof to give access to and from the FlatRoof for the purpose of repair of the motor in the Lift Motor Room.   It is not difficult to imagine that there could be emergencysituations where access to the Lift Motor Room has to be at short notice, such as a situation where the lift has stalled with passengersinside.  This floor plan design of the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor which encumbered the Defendantâs Premises with a right of access through it to the Lift Machine Room is an unfortunate featureof the Defendantâs Premises.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  According to the Defendantâs husband he has never read the Deed of Mutual Covenant and it is not clear as regards whether he orthe Defendant knows of this right of access or that the Defendant had to give access if necessary at short notice for the repairof the lift.   They are not legally represented so that it is not clear if they understand what their legal rights vis a vis otherowners of the Building as stated in the DMC, particularly when they face the situation of the hole on the floor slab of the LiftMotor Room. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Another troubling feature is the dilapidated condition of the Defendantâs Premises and from the description of Mr. Chan it seemsto me to be in such condition that it is almost uninhabitable without complete renovation and cleaning.   How it got to that state,the Defendantâs husband states is because they did not have money to renovate and the said premises which was left in a state ofdisrepair by the last tenants.  Although the condition left by the tenants must be better from that as found by Mr. Chan 9 yearslater.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  The Defendantâs husband stated that he and the Defendant purchased Flat A and Flat B respectively on the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor of the Building in 1993.  They purchased the two properties from their owner who was the operator of the restaurant on the3<sup>rd</sup> Floor, who owed them money.  Prior to its sale the staff of the said restaurant had occupied the said Flat A and Flat B.    Afterpurchase by the Defendant and himself of these properties respectively he and the Defendant continued to lease the said Flat A andFlat B to the restaurant owner for occupation by its staff.     In 1996, the restaurant closed and the staff of the restaurant vacatedFlat A and Flat B.   He and the Defendant respectively obtained vacant possession of the said Flat A and Flat B.   They did not decoratethe said premises but put the two properties on the market for lease and for sale.   The Defendant and himself have not renovatedthe said Flat A and Flat B units since they fell vacant.  No potential purchaser showed any interest in the properties.  Later inhis evidence, the Defendantâs husband referred to one offer in the sum of $800,000.00 for both properties but no real interestwas shown. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  The Defendantâs husband gave evidence that the Defendant could not sell the Defendantâs Premises because of the hole on thefloor slab in the Lift Motor Room.  He stated that he told those who viewed the Defendantâs Premises about the hole on the floorslab in the Lift Motor Room because they would ask what is behind the door of the Lift Motor Room.   They would notice that thereis a third door on the Flat Roof apart from the doors that lead into Flats A and B and ask what is behind that door.    Invariablythey will know about the hole on the floor slab in the Lift Motor Room.   They would be deterred from purchase of the Defendant'sPremises because of the security risk.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  It is a matter of common sense that there must be a security issue for any occupant of the Defendantâs Premises posed by the holeopening from the Satay King into the Lift Motor Room.   Although there is no evidence whether the hole can be easily seen insidethe Satay King premises or not, there is a ladder that leads to it immediately as shown in Photo 1 in the Surveyorâs Report atpage 189.  This ladder would attract the attention of any customer of the restaurant. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  If the Lift Motor Room is a common area of the building, as seems to be the case, then the making of a hole on the floor slab thereofmust be a contravention of the rights of the other owners of the building affected thereby.  Further there is no provision in theDMC granting access from the Plaintiffâs Premises to the Lift Motor Room through a hole on the floor slab of the Lift Motor Room.  Again, making a hole in the ceiling of the Plaintiffâs Premises to the Lift Motor Room seems to me to be a contravention of theDMC (see para (b) to the Second Schedule of the DMC).  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The Plaintiff explains the necessity of the making of the hole because the Defendant did not occupy the Defendantâs Premises andit was not possible to gain access through it to get to the Lift Motor Room in an emergency, for instance, where the lift has stalledwith people inside.   Further the Defendant has the obligation under the DMC to give access through the Defendantâs Premises toother owners of the building to the Lift Motor Room and her failure to do so is a contravention of the DMC.  The lift which is operatedby the motor in the Lift Motor Room is one which services the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> commercial floors of the building and its maintenance is the responsibility of the owners of premises of the commercial floors, itseems.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  The Plaintiffâs Counsel submits that the reason why the Defendantâs Premises has not been sold is the dilapidated conditionof the said premises and not because of the hole in the Lift Motor Room.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  There is some support for this.    It was only in 1998 that the hole was made on the floor slab of the Lift Motor Room.   Even beforethen, according to the Defendantâs husband, no interest was shown by any potential purchaser to purchase the Defendantâs Premises.  It is common knowledge that in 1996, the property market was still buoyant.   It was only after July 1997 that the property marketstarted to be affected by the economic downturn.  It is possible that the state of disrepair of the Defendantâs Premises couldbe one of the reasons why no interest has been shown in the purchase of the Defendantâs Premises along with other reasons.   Withoutthe help of an expert on this matter one can only hazard a guess based on common sense as regards the reasons why there was no interestto purchase the Defendantâs Premises.  The Defendantâs husband stated that the Defendantâs Premises, namely Flat B on the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor has to be sold together with Flat A because of the layout of the two properties being next to one another and both openingout onto the flat roof adjourning Flat B on the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor.   This would rule out the sale to potential purchasers who only want to purchase one property rather than two.    Hence, thehole on the floor slab in the Lift Motor Room and the security risk posed by it could not be the only adverse feature to the DefendantâsPremises, which deters potential purchasers from making an offer to purchase.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The security risk posed by the hole in the lift Motor Room is not impossible to overcome for security measures could be put intothe Defendantâs Property such as a security metal gate and window bars.  However such measures would require expenditure and itseems that the Defendant and her husband did not even have the money to renovate the said Flat A and B.   To further minimize theeffect of the hole on the floor slab of the Lift Motor Room, the Plaintiffâs Counsel had suggested the addition of a lock or padlockon the Flat Roof side of the door to the Lift Motor Room with the key to be kept by the Management Office.   This would enable workmenworking in the Lift Motor Room to be able to open the door of the Lift Motor Room when doing repairs were it necessary.    </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  It is not possible to assess the extent to which the hole in the Lift Motor Room contributed to the difficulty to sell the DefendantâsPremises.   There is no expert guidance.   I find that it causes a security risk that would be an additional feature to cause deterrenceany potential purchaser from the purchase of the Defendantâs Premises but is a factor that could not be ignored.   However as thesecurity risk posed by the hole in the Lift Motor Room could not be the main reason for the failure to sell the Defendantâs PremisesI find that the Counterclaim in respect of all the Defendantâs mortgage repayments and rates and management fees in respect ofthe Defendantâs Premises since 1998 could not be established.   On the other hand, the Defendant has suffered loss through thehole in the Lift Motor Room in that it has brought to the Defendantâs Premises a security risk that adds a serious adverse featureto the Defendantâs Premises.   I have to balance a number of factors when considering the Defendantâs Counterclaim.  These includethe Plaintiffâs breach of the DMC infringing the rights of other owners principally that of the Defendant in making the hole onthe floor slab of the lift Motor Room (referred to aforesaid) as against that of the Defendantâs breach of the DMC (referred toaforesaid) that caused the Plaintiff take this drastic measure.  There is also the fact of the unfortunate design of the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor plan, which encumbered the Defendantâs Premises with the right of access through it to enter the Lift Lobby Room.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  On that basis I am of the view it would be just to award the Defendant a nominal sum to compensate her for the security risk posedby the hole on the floor slab of the Lift Motor Room and to enable her if she wished to pay for a security gate and window bars orany other measure to render her said premises secure.    I have no guidance of any expert of an appropriate sum hence I award a nominalsum which in all the circumstances, I feel would be appropriate having regard to the type of property and its condition and age.  I am of the view that this sum should be in the sum of $50,000.    </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  I give judgment for the Plaintiff against the Defendant in the sum of $4,500.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  I grant a mandatory injunction that the Defendant by herself, her tenants, licensees, servants, agents or otherwise do forthwithcarry out repair work on the flat roof of the Defendantâs Premises to make it water proof.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  I further grant an injunction to restrain the Defendant by herself, her tenants, licensees, servants, agents or otherwise from allowingthe continuance of water seepage from her Premises to the Plaintiffâs Premises thereby causing nuisance or damage of any kind.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  In respect of the Counterclaim I order that the Plaintiff do pay the Defendant a nominal sum of $50,000.00 to compensate the securityrisk posed by the hole on the floor slab of the Lift Motor Room and to enable her to install a security gate and window bars andother security measures in the Defendantâs Premises if she so wished.   I grant an order nisi for costs of the claim to be paidby the Defendant to the Plaintiff to be taxed if not agreed with Certificate for Counsel with no order as to costs of the Counterclaim.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> ( C.
