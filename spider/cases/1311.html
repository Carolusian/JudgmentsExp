As a result Frankie Chung went to the ICAC office atabout 9.30 am together with a barrister (not Egan).  They were told to wait.  It was about 6 pm that day when they were able to seeDerek.  They returned to the ICAC the next morning and attended a video recording interview with Derek.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Becky was given bail at 10.38 pm on 10 July 2004.  Prior to her being admitted to bail, she had given 2 non-prejudicial statements(âNPSâ).  The first from 00.25 am to 4.10 am and the second from 10.56 am to 10.30 pm.  The second NPS contained matters incriminatingDerek.  At 10.38 pm, Becky was given bail until 5 pm the following day on her own recognizance.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The learned judge recorded that Becky had signed a note dated 10 July 2004 stating that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1)   she was voluntarily giving information to assist the ICAC;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)     she understood that she was still a subject of investigation herself; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)     she consented to the ICAC officers accompanying her and staying the night at her home.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On the night of 10 July 2004, Becky stayed at her home, accompanied by 2 female ICAC officers.  Beckyâs mobile phone had beentaken from her when she was arrested but it was returned to her when she was released on bail.  When she turned it on, Dale Ko, anICAC officer, saw a list of missed calls appearing and Becky told him that some of the calls were from Mandy. </p>    <p class="heading">Sunday, 11 July 2004</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>   Between 1.35 pm and 4.15 pm, Becky went to the ICAC to discuss the Witness Protection Programme (âWPPâ) for the first time. At 4.55 pm, she was given bail to 16 July 2004.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>   At about 1.15 pm, there was a telephone conversation between Becky and Mandy, which had been monitored by the ICAC.  The learnedjudge found that during this conversation, Becky said to Mandy that âshe was safe and soundâ âå¹³å®ç¡äºâ (literally meaningâsafe and no incidentâ).â</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>   At 6.15 pm, Becky and the ICAC officers arrived at an ICAC safe house.  ICAC officers gave Becky another mobile phone SIM Card(âICAC SIM cardâ).  She was advised to use the ICAC SIM card to contact her family and friends, and not to use her own SIM cardto avoid contact with people involved in the case.  Becky inserted the ICAC SIM card into her mobile phone and called her familymembers.  Although Beckyâs own SIM card was monitored by the ICAC, the ICAC SIM card was not monitored.  Sometime between 6.15pm and 7.29 pm on 11 July 2004, Becky forwarded incoming calls to her own SIM card to the ICAC SIM card.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>   At 7.29 pm, Beckyâs phone rang and she saw Derekâs name on the caller display.  She said ICAC officers also saw the callerdisplay and she was embarrassed and she switched off the phone without answering because the ICAC officers had advised her not tospeak to people involved in the case.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>   Becky then inserted her own SIM card back into the phone in order to cancel the call-forwarding to the ICAC SIM card.  Becky saidthat she had voluntarily surrendered her own SIM card to the ICAC officers later in the night of 11 July 2004.  She said she didso because she was embarrassed when the ICAC saw Derekâs name on the caller display.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>   After Derek was released on bail, between 4.00 pm and 8 pm on 11 July 2004, he spoke to Frankie Chung on the telephone.  He toldFrankie Chung that two of his employees namely William Lau and Becky had been arrested by ICAC and he was very worried about them. He asked Frankie Chung to see them.  Frankie Chung said that he would ask another solicitor, Peter Lai to go and see William Lauand Becky.  The ICAC had standing instructions regarding visits by lawyers claiming to represent a person in ICAC custody which requiredICAC officers first to inform the person that a lawyer was present and then ask whether that person wanted to see the lawyer.  PeterLai was able to see William Lau but not Becky.  In fact, Becky was not told by the ICAC officers that Peter Lai was there to seeher because the ICAC officers did not think they were obliged so to inform her as the standing instructions only applied to detainedpersons.  Presumably, Peter Lai was able to see William Lau because he was a detained person and the standing instructions appliedto him.</p>    <p class="heading">Monday, 12 July 2004</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>   Between 7 am and 8 am on 12 July 2004, Becky went back to the Semtech office to collect her belongings.  When doing so, she tooka spare stored valued SIM card (âSemtech SIM cardâ) without telling the ICAC officers who were waiting for her at the lift lobby. She said she took the Semtech SIM card because she wanted to call Mandy to find out about Derek and Mandy.  She was concerned aboutMandy as a friend.  She felt the ICAC SIM card number might be tapped, so she wanted to use the Semtech SIM card instead.  She saidshe did not tell the ICAC officers about the Semtech SIM card because it never crossed her mind to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>   At about 2.30 pm on 12 July 2004, Derek went to Frankie Chungâs office.  According to Frankie Chung, at that meeting he toldDerek that as Becky had been with the ICAC for 48 hours, it was possible that Becky was in the process of becoming a prosecutionwitness.  According to Frankie Chung, Derek said he needed to look for a âfamous barristerâ to defend him.  Derek mentioned MrLawrence Lok, SC.  He even mentioned Lam but Frankie Chung told him that Lam was not a barrister and C K Mok &amp; Company couldnot therefore engagehim.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>   William Lau was released in the afternoon of 12 July 2004.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>   At about 4.30 pm on 12 July 2004, William Lau went to Frankie Chungâs office, Derek was there.  According to Frankie Chung, Derektold him that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âBecky Wong was a fragile person.  He worried that under pressure, anything that he or she did not do, he or she would say he orshe did.â  Transcript 340F.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>   In the evening of 12 July 2004 whilst at the ICAC safe house, Becky went to the toilet to call Mandy âwithout being tapped oroverheardâ.  Although there were a total of 9 calls between 10.31 am and 10.51 am, there were only 2 main conversations, the firstof which lasted 344 seconds and began at 10:40:46.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>   This is what the learned judge said about these two conversations:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â75.   In the first main conversation, Becky Wong said she told D2 that she was hiding in the toilet and she had to speak softlyas it was not convenient to talk. Becky Wong said in evidence that she talked secretly in the toilet because she had given two non-prejudicialstatements. D2 asked whether âtheyâ were still with her. D2 asked her whether she was OK and Becky Wong said she was OK. âç¡å¢â(literally meaning ânothingâ). And further she added she was safe and sound âå¹³å®ç¡äºâ (literally meaning âsafe andno incidentâ).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">76.    Becky Wong told D2 to tell D1 not to use his 2 mobile numbers starting with â6â and â9â as the ICAC had known aboutthem. Becky Wong agreed it was wrong for her to alert D1, but she did so out of kindness as she did not want D1 to get into biggerand bigger trouble (though she did not say this to D2).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">77.    Shortly after the 5- minutes call, Becky Wong called D2 again and D2 called back for 1 minute (Call 111A). This was the secondmain conversation. Becky Wong said the purpose of this call was to ask D2 to say sorry to the boss, that is, D1, on her behalf. D2then asked her what have she said to them. Becky Wong told D2 that she did not say anything that D1 could not explain himself away,except about market manipulation and illegal money, as she felt the ICAC had tapped the phones and there was no way but to say it.Becky Wong said she did not mean to tell D2 what she had told the ICAC, but as D2 had asked her, she told D2. Becky Wong said atthat time, she had not given it the thought whether it was unwise to do so.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">78.    Becky Wong said she did not hang up hurriedly. But after cross-examination on her witness statement, she agreed to the suggestion.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">79.    After the second main conversation with D2, Becky Wong inserted the ICAC SIM card back and hid the Semtech SIM card insidethe mobile phone. She said she did not intend to call D2 further as she had already found out the situation of D1 and D2.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>   On the same day, at 4.20 pm, there was an SMS message to the Semtech SIM card from Mandy.  The message was:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âB. request to call chung lawer at onec(<i>sic</i>.) 94918232. Mâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is significant that at this time, Derek was on the phone with Mandy.  The clear inference is that he was instrumental in the messagebeing sent.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>   However, Becky did not see this message until the midnight of 13 July 2004.</p>    <p class="heading">Tuesday, 13 July 2004</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>   Earlier, on 12 July 2004, a Witness Security Panel (âWSPâ) meeting had been convened to discuss the induction of Becky intothe WPP.  When dealing with the risk assessment, the minutes recorded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âBecky is a key witness who can give evidence against Wong (that is, D1) and his associates.  Soon after Wong was released on bail,he had asked his girlfriend Mandy to approach Becky.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>   At 2.25 pm on 13 July 2004, Becky went to the ICAC headquarters and signed the Memorandum of Understanding (âMOUâ) for theWPP.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>   On the same day, Derek and William Lau visited Lam at his office at about 4 pm.  Presumably, it was during that meeting that Lamwas retained by Derek to act for him in the Semtech investigation.  Mandy went to Lamâs office at 5.39 pm (according to the liftCCTV) and stayed there until they all went to the offices of Messrs Massie &amp; Clement at the Chekiang First Bank Building.  Thelift CCTV showed that they arrived there at 5.59 pm.  Mr Richard Clement, PW5 (âClementâ), a partner of Messrs Massie &amp; Clement,said that he saw the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> applicants and William Lau at about 6 pm.  He said Lam had referred Mandy to his firm as a client because of a potential conflictof interest.  According to the lift CCTV footage, Derek, Lam and William Lau left Messrs Massie &amp; Clementâs office at 6.08pm.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>   Clement said his partner Mr John Massie (âMassieâ) had spoken to him earlier and left him a brief note of the case.  Clementâsevidence was that Massie told him that the instructions had come from Lam.  Massie was due to go on a monthâs leave and could nottake up the case.  The CCTV footage showed that Massie went down the lift of his office at 6.07 pm.  The note was produced at trial,but Massie did not give evidence.  There was no evidence that Massie saw Derek, Mandy or Lam on 13 July 2004.  I will proceed onthe basis that Massie had been contacted by Lam on the telephone.  According to the learned judge:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â94.   The note of Mr Massie recorded the name of Becky Wong and âsecretary to chairmanâ, âput under protectionâ. Mr Clementsaid at that stage, he did not quite know the link of Becky Wong with the Chairman of Semtech as he did not realise the company wasSemtech. Mr Clement thought D2 was in some sort of relationship with D1 for them to turn up at his office together, but at that stage,he did not know that they were boyfriend and girlfriend.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">95.    Mr Clement said D3 left with D1 and the others after a few minutes. D3 never mentioned anything like protective witness. D3introduced D2 and let Massie &amp; Clement act independently. Mr Clement said he saw nothing sinister about the referral. The liftCCTV footage shows D1, D3 and William Lau went down the lift at 6.08 pm.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>   The note also included the statement âwrite to ICACâ so presumably it was Massieâs understanding that their firm was to writeto the ICAC.  Such instructions presumably were received between about 4 pm and 6 pm on 13 July 2004.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>   Mandy was interviewed by Clement and Raymond Lam (PW6), a trainee solicitor, who acted as interpreter between Mandy and Clement. According to the learned judge:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â98.   Mr Clement said D2 told him through Raymond Lam that her business partner and friend Becky Wong was arrested on Friday, andD2 had a number of calls with Becky Wong on Sunday morning (that is, 11 July) and Monday morning (that is, 12 July) and Becky Wongspoke in a quiet voice. D2 believed Becky Wong was in the custody of the ICAC, and D2 was concerned as she felt Becky Wong did notwant to be where she was. D2 asked him to gain access to Becky Wong, and if that proved impossible, to do whatever necessary to gether released from the ICAC, and if court action were involved, so be it. Mr Clement could not remember whether the subject of courtproceedings was first raised by D2 or himself, but he was pretty sure that there were instructions from D2 to initiate court proceedingsif the attempt to see Becky Wong at the ICAC failed.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">99.    Mr Clement wrote down âprotective custodyâ (in inverted commas) in his notes. He thought if Becky Wong were arrested onFriday (that is, 9 July), and there did not seem to be any charge by Tuesday (that is, 13 July), and if she were still with the ICAC,it would have to be protective custody. He was also influenced by the words âput under protectionâ in Massieâs notes. Howeverat that stage, Mr Clement thought Becky Wong had probably been released and no longer with the ICAC but she just did not want tosee anybody. Hence, he put âprotective custodyâ in inverted commas.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">100.  Mr Clement told D2 through Raymond Lam that he would draft a letter to send to the ICAC on the next day to request access toBecky Wong.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>   Clement then opened a file for Mandy in the matter of Becky.  He also drafted a letter to be sent to the ICAC.  That letter wasmoderate in tone.  After stating that Messrs Massie &amp; Clement had been approached by Mandy, âa friend of (Becky)â, it said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe are instructed that (Becky Wong) is now in âprotective custody.â  Ms Chui is of the view from talking to Ms Wong that shewishes to be released.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Can you please pass a copy of this letter to Ms Wong and ask her to contact our Mr Clement by telephone if she wishes to take legaladvice.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>   Clement then left for home.  Whilst he was on the MTR, he received a call from Egan from the Foreign Correspondentsâ Club (âFCCâ). This is what the learned judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â103. â¦ Mr Clement understood D4 to be saying that D3 was a bit agitated, as apparently, D2âs girlfriend was held by the ICAC,and Massie &amp; Clement should be down there hammering on the door of the ICAC, but all he proposed to do was to just write a letter.Mr Clement took it that his initial approach to write a letter was disagreed by D3. D4 told Mr Clement that he had instructions fromD2 to arrange for a legal visit to the ICAC that night to find out what was happening to Becky Wong. Mr Clement said he was on hisway home and he had to ring the office to see if that could be arranged. Having spoken to Raymond Lam on the phone, Mr Clement rangD4 back and said it was all right.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>   Then, at about 7.45 pm, Raymond Lam and Egan arrived at the ICAC reception.  Egan asked to see Becky.  Daphne Lim and Matchy Mak(PW30), Assistant Investigator, went to reception.  They overheard Eganâs speaking in his mobile phone:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAndrew, Iâm talking to the ICAC officers.  Donât call me.  Iâll call you.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p>After hanging up, Egan said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âItâs Andrew Lam Ping-cheung.  He is not patient.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â110. Daphne Lim said D4 requested immediate access to Becky Wong. D4 said he was acting on the instructions of D2, and D2 and BeckyWong were partners in a beauty salon with Becky Wong owning 30% shares, and D2 was not able to reach Becky Wong. D4 said Becky Wongwas arrested by the ICAC and she had been detained for over 48 hours. If he were not given immediate access to Becky Wong, he wouldmake a report to the police and to apply to the High Court for habeas corpus.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>   Daphne Lim then rang one of the officers who was accompanying Becky at the ICAC safe house and asked him whether Becky had requestedto see a lawyer and she was told that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â112. â¦ nothing about that was mentioned.  Daphne Lim said normally when a lawyer requested to see a detained person, the personwould be asked whether to see the lawyer.  However, she did not inform Stanley Wu or Becky Wong that D4 had come to see her, becauseBecky Wong was not a detained person, and she had the right to see any lawyer or to go at any time.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">115.  Then Daphne Lim and Matchy Mak went back to the reception. Daphne Lim said to D4: âBecky Wong is not in the ICAC. I do nothave Becky Wong with me. You can take whatever action you like.â When D4 heard this, he raised his voice and said: âOf courseBecky Wong is not here. She is in some other place. You have placed her in a safe house.â D4 then said D2 had received a phonecall from Becky Wong and Becky Wong told D2 that she was in the ICAC custody and she wanted to be released. Daphne Lim said at thatstage, she did not know that Becky Wong and D2 had made contact on the phone. She had no access to the telephone intelligence. Shesaid to D4 that she did not believe D2 had received phone call from Becky Wong.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>   What happened next is that Egan then wrote a letter of complaint to the Head of Operations of the ICAC, complaining that he hadbeen denied access to Becky.  In this letter (âEganâs complaint letterâ) Egan said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(Becky) was adamant that she was being detained against her will and that she wished to leave âprotective custodyââ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Eganâs evidence was that he used the expression âprotective custodyâ sarcastically.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>   Egan then went to the Central Police Station and made a report of false imprisonment.  That is highly unusual but might be explainedby Eganâs deep mistrust of the ICAC.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>   As noted earlier in para. 34 above, Becky saw the SMS message to call âChung lawyerâ at about midnight on 13 July 2004.  Shethen called Frankie Chung.  This is what the learned judge said about that conversation:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â133. Becky Wong said she asked for lawyer Chung and said D2 asked her to call. Frankie Chung was the person Becky Wong called.Becky Wong said lawyer Chung told her to say she knew him. In fact, she did not know any lawyer Chung but she did not respond. Shesaid lawyer Chung said she had the right to approach a lawyer. He told her to ring him during office hours the next day. He suggestedher to make a request to the ICAC to call him, and told her to pass this telephone number to the ICAC and she would be able to contacthim.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">134.  Becky Wong said she would not have called Frankie Chung if she had not got the SMS from D2. She never told lawyer Chung shewas kept by the ICAC. She never told him she wanted any help or lawyer. She never gave him any legal instruction nor asked him toapply for habeas corpus on her behalf. She never wanted to leave the ICAC. She never rang Lawyer Chung again.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">135.  According to Frankie Chung, he said he received a short call first at midnight of 13/14 July. A lady asked whether he was Ben,he said wrong number and she hung up. A few minutes later, the lady rang again. She asked whether he was Mr Chung and Frankie Chungsaid yes. The lady said Mandy asked her to ring him and she asked him whether he was from Mr Wongâs place. Then it dawned on himthat Mandy was D1âs friend, who had passed him the money for D1âs bail, and Mandy had been to his office on 13 July. FrankieChung asked the caller whether she was Wong Pui-see and she said yes. Frankie Chung asked âAre you with those people now?â (withoutmentioning ICAC) and she said no.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">136.  Frankie Chung said Becky Wong never told him she was safe and sound. Since she had called him at midnight, and her voice wasfaint and unsteady, and she spoke with hesitation, he thought she was frightened, and she needed to see a lawyer. Frankie Chung saidalthough Becky Wong did not say she was with the ICAC, he believed she was so, probably he was confused as D1 had said so. FrankieChung said: âDo you need me to see you tomorrow? It is not safe for you to see other people. It is safe to see me. If someone obstructsyou to see me, you just say you know me. If they donât allow you to see me, you just lodge a complaint.â Frankie Chung said hetaught her to lie to the ICAC that she knew him before so that she could see him. He told her that he would wait for her call thenext morning, and he would go and see her, and the lady said all right. Frankie Chung said to her: âNo matter what, I wait foryour call. As soon as I get your call, I would go to see you.â He said Becky Wong did not respond and said something neither herenor there.

Frankie Chung said that in fact he did not know Becky Wong, and had never met her, and his firm had never acted for her, buthe taught her to say she knew him because he thought that would help her. Frankie Chung said Becky Wong never asked him to go tosee her, and maybe he had misunderstood it because he said he was going to see her and she never refused, and when people rang himin the middle of the night, it was usually a request for legal visit.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Wednesday, 14 July 2004</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>   Shortly after his conversation with Becky, Frankie Chung told Derek of his conversation with Becky.  He told Derek that he hadtold Becky that he would go to see her at the ICAC provided that she gave him a call.  Frankie Chung and Derek met sometime after1 am.  This is the learned judgeâs summary of the evidence:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â139. Sometime after 1 am on 14 July, D1 arrived at the downstairs of Frankie Chungâs home.  D1 suspected his car was tapped,and they boarded Frankie Chungâs car.  Frankie Chung asked D1 why Becky Wong had called him.  D1 told him that Becky Wong had pickedup a SIM card during the search of the office, and she called D2 for help.  And when Becky Wong was having telephone conversation,her phone was snatched by the ICAC.  D1 also said D4 went to the Central Police Station to report the missing of Becky Wong.  D1said he had formed a legal team including D3, and D3 would hold a press conference for him, and it pleased D1 as he could vent hisgrievance against the ICAC.  Frankie Chung feared that the matter might get bigger and bigger.  He told D1 to be careful as the ICACpeople were narrow minded.  D1 told Frankie Chung that if Becky Wong rang him in the morning, he should go with D4 to see her.  D1gave Frankie Chung the name card of D4.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">140.  While inside the car, D1 asked if Frankie Chung could go to the High Court to apply for bail for Becky Wong.  Frankie Chungexplained generally that the procedure was habeas corpus, not bail.  D1 also asked Frankie Chung what was the specialization of Massie&amp; Clement, and he said personal injuries litigation.  D1 then said that they were no good.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">141.  D1 said he would be busy dealing with enquiries from the stock exchange.  He would hand the matter over to D2 to handle.  Afterthis meeting in the car, Frankie Chung said he never saw D1 again.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">142.

Frankie Chung said D1 called to ask him to accompany D4 to paylegal visit for Becky Wong.  Frankie Chung asked D1 why he did not ask D3 to do it.  Then D1 said:  âAs I ask you to do it, youjust do it.â  Frankie Chung told the court that he made excuses because he did not like the idea of a press conference, and hesuggested D3 to do it because D1 had told him that D3 was going to hold a press conference for him.

Egan told himthat Frankie Chung had spoken to Becky the night before and that Becky wanted to see Frankie Chung.  According to Clement, Egan alsosaid that with his going to the ICAC:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âhe thought that would probably be the end to it but if it needed an application to court then it was likely that we would be involvedagain.â  Clement, T503Q.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>If an application had to be made to the court, he asked whether Messrs Massie &amp; Clement would still have the instructions to moveahead.  Clement said that Egan did not specify the application but he assumed that it was <i>habeas corpus</i>.  He told Egan that on the basis of the conversation with Mandy the night before, the instructions were (1) to see Becky at the ICAC,and (2) if that did not work, to get her released from the ICAC.  The learned judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â153. Mr Clement said he was not concerned that C K Mok &amp; Company appeared as C K Mok &amp; Companyâs client was Becky Wong,and he was acting for D2. He thought the earlier conversation between Becky Wong and D2 was a bit equivocal. But now Becky Wong hadtold Frankie Chung that she wanted to see him, he thought that was the end of the matter for Massie &amp; Clement. As to why Massie&amp; Clement was asked to do the habeas corpus, he thought maybe his firm was more versed in administrative law list.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>   Egan and Frankie Chungâs visit to the ICAC on 14 July 2004 met with no success.

The record shows that D4âs mobile rang Mr Ryanâs office at 12.07 pm. Frankie Chung said D4 arguedon the phone, and then D4 hung up. After D4 rang Mr Ryan, Frankie Chung told D4 that Becky Wong was previously known to him, andshe wanted to get away from the ICAC. Frankie Chung explained to the court that he lied to D4 in order to appease the dispute betweenD4 and Mr Ryan. D4 then told him to go to Massie &amp; Clement to make an affirmation. Frankie Chung left the ICAC at 12.30 pm.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>According to Ryan:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â168. â¦ D4 told him on the phone that he was given the run around by the ICAC, and said he would likely be making an applicationfor <i>habeas corpus</i>.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Ryan told Egan:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â168. â¦ Rebecca Li was coming over to see him, and asked D4 to call back later.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The meeting between Ryan and Rebecca Lai and other ICAC officers lasted about 1Â½ to 2 hours.

D2 advised her to contact a lawyer Chung on a mobile number, at that stage there was no need and she did not do so at once.She did tell D2 that she was with âthemâ without saying who they were. She did not indicate to D2 that she did not wish to beaccompanied by them, and did not ask D2 to do anything for her. One day later, she suddenly remembered the telephone number of lawyerChung D2 gave her. Since she wanted to hear some advice from lawyer Chung, she called him late at night on 13 July and she gave anaccount of the conversation with lawyer Chung. She stated that she did not request lawyer Chung to represent her. So far, she understoodher rights, and did not have need to contact a solicitor yet.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">181.  Becky Wong said there were mistakes in her statement. She actually did not want to hear any advice from lawyer Chung. She madea mistake that she got the message about lawyer Chung during the phone call with D2 instead of through SMS, and she made no referenceto the SMS from D2 because at that time she was just talking about the contents of the conversations with D2 and lawyer Chung. Shedid not mention the call with D2 on 11 July as she was not asked about it. At that stage, the ICAC did not know about the SemtechSIM card yet.

This is the learned judgeâs summary of the proceedings beforeYam J:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â202.   D4 presented the case before Yam J as follows:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">9 persons were arrested last Friday (that is, 9 July) in relation to Semtech. Becky Wong and D1 and everyone else were released onbail. However, Becky Wong was persuaded to remain by ICAC to remain in their âprotective custodyâ (in inverted commas). She wasnot held by the ICAC under any lawful colour of right. She was alleged by the ICAC to be voluntarily staying with them. D4 said hehad instruction from her business partner, D2, the person in respect of whom the application was made. D2 had spoken to Becky Wongon Sunday (that is, 11 July) in circumstances he had set out, that is, the ICAC stopped Becky Wong from using her phone and tookaway the SIM card. She had a spare one. She went to the toilet to use it. She rang D2 and told her effectively she was being heldagainst her will by the ICAC. The ICAC were obviously holding her, hoping to obtain information from her to use against the personsarrested in the Semtech operation. D4 said he went to the ICAC the night before and tried to gain access to her. All he wanted was,with instructing solicitors, access to Becky Wong so that he could say to her, in the presence of ICAC officer, whether she wantedto stay with the ICAC or whether she wished to accompany him to leave the ICAC. If she wanted to stay with the ICAC, that was theend of it; if she elected to come with him, that was also the end of it. He then went to the Central Police Station to make a complaintof false imprisonment, which triggered an investigation by the Hong Kong Police who contacted the ICAC, which resulted in Becky Wongcalling the deponent of the affidavit before the court, that is, Frankie Chung. She had business with him on other occasions. Hesaid in the affidavit that she rang him at 1 oâclock in the morning and told him she wanted access to a lawyer, and as he deposed,she sounded frightened and she was being kept by ICAC people, unlawfully kept. That morning, he went with Frankie Chung to the ICACand were told they had no appointment.

Egan appeared for Becky and Ryan for the ICAC.  The hearing was in camera on Ryanâs application.

Yam J was shown Beckyâs statement of 14 July 2004, which said that she had not been unlawfully detained. At the conclusion of the hearing Yam J issued a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> addressed to the Commissioner of ICAC requiring him to bring Becky to court at 3.30 pm on the same day.  Yam J also made what hedescribed as a strictly tight-lipped order.  Yam J said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(3)   There should be no communication with any other person of my order issuing the habeas corpus now, today, and in particularwith members of the press, and anything that has transpired in this Chambers this morning, and I would like to have an undertakingfrom counsel and solicitors and all persons present in Chambers to that effect.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Egan gave the undertaking.  This is the learned judgeâs summary of the hearing before Yam J:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â219. While in camera, Mr Ryan applied for adjournment until 10 am the next day.

Hence, there was no urgency. Yam J said that was contrary to the Affirmation of Frankie Chungand therefore it was imperative that Becky Wong should be brought to the court to tell His Lordship her wish, and adjourning it tothe next day meant further detention of 24 hours. Mr Ryan then disclosed that Becky Wong was actually a participant in the WPP underthe <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564" class="autolink_findacts">Witness Protection Ordinance</a>.

Mr Ryan produced to the court the witness statement of Becky Wong to contradict the affirmationof Frankie Chung. D4 said he suspected that the witness statement was written by an ICAC officer. Yam J said it was in direct contradictionto para 4 of the Affirmation of Frankie Chung. Mr Ryan said he wished to have it reduced to affidavit form sworn by Becky Wong. YamJ said that it boiled down to one thing: if Becky Wong was voluntary, she could come to court to say so.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">223.  Mr Ryan said he had information that the whole application might well have come from one of the major parties involved in theinvestigation.

The issue in the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings was whether Becky was detained against her will.  That could be resolved without disclosing the fact that she was inthe WPP.  It is unfortunate that the disclosure was made.  Such a disclosure is potentially damaging to Becky.

In no way can one side prohibit the other side from seeing a witness of fact, from getting the facts from him and from callinghim to give evidence or from issuing him with a subpoena. That was laid down by the Law Society in 1944 and published in the âShortGuide to Professional Conduct and Etiquetteâ.

There were many of them and in each case they were lengthy and repetitive.The length of them is reflected in about 325 pages of transcript. The pattern of each was much the same, repeated questioning ingreat detail on the original story given, seeking, as more and more detail was extracted, to open up differences between the twoversions, those given originally and those given later in the interviews. Then, having opened up such differences, the police confrontedthe interviewees with them and with the contradictory statements of proposed prosecution witnesses. And in each case the interviewsculminated with suggestions from the police that the interviewees were lying and had been put up to it by the appellant, or by eachother, all of which they denied.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">25.

It concerned the conviction on the third and final trial of two persons formurder and causing grievous bodily harm on a person on 6 November 1994.  At the first trial in February 1999, the jury were unableto agree upon any verdicts and a retrial was ordered.  A second trial took place in June 1999 and the jury were discharged at a pointtowards the end of the prosecution case when it became clear that the prosecution were unable to call certain witnesses whose evidencehad been opened to the jury.  The third and final trial took place between 8 November 1999 and 15 December 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  One aspect of Evansâ defence was that a number of independent witnesses, neighbours and acquaintances of the deceased, had madestatements to the police to the effect that they had seen the deceased alive after 6 November 1994, or had heard his voice or seenor heard activity at his flat that tended to show that he was alive after 6 November 1994.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  As Waller LJ described it in the judgment of the court:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â39.   [The complaint] was these witnesses who had been revisited by the police after the arrest of Evans in April/May 1998.  Manyof them were told that their evidence had been proved to have been mistaken; that the deceased was definitely dead before their sightingsof him; or that they had âseen a ghostâ.  An application accordingly was made at the trial on behalf of Evans that this revisitingamounted to an abuse of process.  The judge concluded that on a number of occasions the police officers had behaved improperly inthe manner in which they had taken the new statements, but he declined to stay the proceedings.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Waller LJ went on to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â49.   â¦ first that these witnesses were revisited at all by the police â¦; second the way in which the witnesses were in factapproached. The complaint is that various of the witnesses were told, as if it was established as a fact, that the deceased had beenkilled on 6 November.  Mr Barrett submitted that the accurate way to put the matter was that it was being asserted that the deceasedhad been killed on 6 November and there was a body of evidence which supported the view that he had in fact not died on that date.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">50.    Mr Barrett suggested that there were two possible motives for the police revisiting these witnesses. The first would be a genuineconcern that the evidence of Reiss might be false and that the deceased was not killed on 6 November. The alternative was that thepolice intended to pursue the prosecution of Evans and Caffrey on the basis of the account of Reiss, and that knowing that they wouldbe obliged to disclose the statements of these witnesses, the police were embarking on a âdamage limitation exerciseâ to persuadethose witnesses that they might be mistaken. Mr Barrett invited the judge, as he invited us, to draw the inference that all the availableevidence showed that the motive behind the revisits was for the second motive, which he described as âan improper oneâ seekingto interfere with the evidence of the witnesses who might help the defence.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">51.    We have no doubt that the ruling of the judge on this aspect was right. There was nothing improper in the police revisitingthe witnesses. It would be quite improper for the police to put inaccurately the evidence in order to obtain a statement or a changein a statement from a witness. However, in this case it must be remembered it is not the statement which is important, it is theevidence which is ultimately given at the trial. In the circumstances of this case original statements had been obtained, the policehad revisited and possibly obtained changes in those statements, but, the defence solicitors were in a position to visit those witnessesthemselves and put to those witnesses any aspect on which they had been misled by the police. â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  It appears therefore that the English Court of Appeal saw nothing improper in the prosecution or the defence approaching and visitingwitnesses in order to put their version of the facts to them, including telling the witnesses that they had been misled by the otherside.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  In <i>Kwan Fung-kam v A-G</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20HKC%20577" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 HKC 577</a>, Cons VP delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ In no way can one side prohibit the other side from seeing a witness of fact, from getting the facts from him and from callinghim to give evidence or from issuing him with a subpoena.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  <i>Kwan Fung-kam v A-G</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20HKC%20577" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 HKC 577</a> was concerned with a summons taken out by the Director of Legal Aid for specific directions regarding the propriety of approachingpolice officers who were witnesses in a negligence claim against the police.

There, the applicant who was jointly charged with murder, wished to relyon the alibi evidence of several men who had no fixed abode.  His solicitor instructed an inquiry agent, who was provided with aphotograph of the applicant, to take immediate steps to find the men by inquiring at the hostel where the applicant had stayed. When he visited the hostel the inquiry agent was prevented by police officers from showing the photograph on the basis there waspossible prejudice to the proposed identification parade.  He was also prevented by the police from gaining access to staff or residents. The detective superintendent responsible for the police investigation told the solicitor that showing the photograph to potentialidentification witnesses would amount to obstructing the police in the exercise of their duty, contrary to the Police Act 1964, andthreatened to take action to prevent it.  On the motion to commit the detective superintendent for contempt of court, it was heldin the Divisional Court that, the detective superintendent was guilty of a clear contempt of court.  The court would have grantedinjunctive relief but for the undertaking, which was accepted, not to interfere with the applicantâs solicitors or their agentsin the proper course of their inquiries in connection with the preparation of the applicantâs defence to the charge of murder,and to send a letter of the manager of the hostel to correct any impression which the police might have given that the police hadthe right to prevent the applicantâs solicitors or their enquiry agents from interviewing and/or showing photographs to staff orresidents at the hostel.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  As there is no property in a witness, it is not improper to approach a witness for the prosecution (or a witness for the defenceby the police) unless improper means are used.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  In <i>Connolly</i>, the applicant applied for committal for contempt and the Divisional Court was prepared to grant immediate injunctive relief hadthat been necessary.  Say in <i>Connolly</i>, the alibi was false and Connolly knew it but his solicitors and the inquiry agent did not.  Could it be said that the solicitorsand the inquiry agent were guilty of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice because Connolly wanted to prejudice the proposedidentification parade?  I believe not.  I will deal later with the question whether the solicitorâs belief (as opposed to knowledge)in the truth or otherwise of the alibi is a relevant consideration.</p>    <p class="heading">Witness Protection Ordinance (âWPOâ), <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564">Cap. 564</a></p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  But is the principle that there is no property in a witness affected in any way by the witnessâs inclusion in the WPP?</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  The WPO came into force on 9 November 2000.  It is unnecessary for me to go through the WPO in any detail.  Under the WPO, a WPPcan be established by the approving authority.  The approving authority is:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ each of the Commissioner of Police and the Commissioner of the (ICAC)â.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  Inclusion in the WPP by the witness is voluntary and can be terminated by notice at any time by the witness Section 6(2)(a)(iv). Both the witness and the authority are required to sign a MOU but:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(3)   A witness becomes included in the witness protection programme when the approving authority signs the memorandum of understanding.â Section 6(3).</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In the present case, Becky was not formally within the WPP because at the material time the MOU had not been signed by the approvingauthority.  That is why the 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> charges were amended to one of attempt.  If a person is included in a WPP or is being assessed for inclusion, the approving authorityshall take such action as he considers necessary and reasonable to protect the witnessâs safety and welfare: section 7.  Undersection 8, the witness could be given a new identity, presumably, after he has ceased to be a witness.  Under section 19, membersof the public wishing to enter the courtroom where the witness is going to give evidence may be required to identify themselves tothe satisfaction of the officer and to undergo such search as the officer may require to protect the security or well being of thewitness.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  I believe the fact that a person has been included in the WPP does not in any way affect his position as a witness.  Nor would itbe legitimate to draw any adverse inference against the defence.  However, the danger that a jury might do so is a reason why thereshould be no unwarranted disclosure.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  Also, I believe the fact that Becky was in the WPP does not mean that she could not be contacted as a potential witness.  Mr Wilsondid not dispute that.  Her whereabouts might not be known.  But it would not be an offence to try to contact her.  Say, as in <i>Connolly</i>, inquiry agents were engaged to locate her.  That is prima facie lawful.  First, because it would not be known that she was in WPP. But, even if, for any reason, that fact has become known, I can see no reason why one might not attempt to locate and contact her. Suppose, in the Semtech prosecutions, she was a potential witness for one or more of the applicants, including Derek.  Why can noattempts be made to locate and contact her?  It would then be up to her to decide whether or not to help.  Of course, one must notcompromise the security of a person in the WPP or use improper means.  Section 17(1)(b).  But I can see no reason in principle whyone should not try to contact or enlist her as a witness. </p>    <p class="heading">Falsity or sham</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  Mr Wilson submitted that falsity or sham was not part of the offence charged.

Scarman LJ (as he then was) delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">         âIn our judgment, the question whether a person is to be treated as a witness or not can only be answered by having regardto the proceedings contemplated.

Can it make any difference that she is also thecomplainant â or that she has a right herself to initiate a prosecution? If the inducement is offered to her because she is a witnessand for the purpose either of dissuading her from giving evidence or of persuading her to alter her statement, the offence of conspiring,or, if there be only one offeror, attempting, to pervert the course of justice is established.

He had beentold that the prosecution case would be that the witness had seen two people near the community centre, one with a stocking maskedover his head.  The appellant said that this was not so.  His brother Brian was not there and âthe white guy didnât have a stockingover his faceâ.  The witness started to walk back to his house.  He felt irritated and annoyed, and he did not want to discussthe case further with the appellant.  At that point, the appellant said, âYouâre going to court to say you didnât see two people,one with a stocking mask over his headâ.

What the trial judge said in the summing up to the jurywas that the jury must be satisfied that the appellant actually intended that the witness should give evidence which differed fromthe evidence which the witness would otherwise have given.  It was in that context that the English Court of Appeal said the offenceof perverting the course of justice by interfering with a potential witness could be committed where there was no evidence of anybribe, threat, undue pressure or other unlawful means:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ The gist of the offence lies in telling a potential witness what he should or should not say with the intention of influencinghis evidence, not in the means adopted.â  Lloyd LJ at 368E.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is to be noted that the incidence took place two days before the witness gave evidence.  As Stephenson LJ said in <i>Kellett</i> at 392H:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ Pressure which may be permissible at one stage of the particular proceedings may be improper at another â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>However, Lloyd LJ went on to say at 370:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe can now summarise the position as follows. (1) In the great majority of cases of perverting the course of justice by interferingwith a witness the actus reus will be accompanied by unlawful means such as threats, bribery or improper pressure. (2) The use ofunlawful means is not however an essential ingredient in the offence. The ingredients are those set out by the judge in his summingup which we need not repeat. (3) In cases where the defendant might otherwise have a defence of lawful excuse, for example wherehis purpose is to persuade a false witness, or a witness he believes to be false, not to commit perjury, he will nevertheless beliable if he employs unlawful means.

Brennan J, Toohey J and McHugh J said in their joint judgment at 140:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ In <i>R v Toney</i> (26), Lloyd LJ, speaking for the Court of Appeal, held that the offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice might be committedby a person who seeks to secure a legitimate end (for example, the persuading of a false witness not to commit perjury) by unlawfulmeans and that âunlawful meansâ includes a threat to do an otherwise legal act or exercise a legal right. With respect, we donot think that observation is right in principle. If the conduct of the alleged offender is no more than a threat to do what he mightlawfully do in order to secure a legitimate end, we are unable to detect conduct which has a tendency to pervert the course of justice.But, accepting that that is so, it is not a legitimate end to persuade a person to plead guilty otherwise than in the exercise ofa free choice in his or her own interests.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  But, with respect, I am of the view that <i>Toney</i> was correctly decided on its facts.

Suppose Toney was the employer of thewitness, if he had told the witness that unless he should say in court that he:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ didnât see two people, one with a stocking mask over his headâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p>he would give him his contractual notice, that would be no more acceptable than if he had offered a raise to the witness.

The learned judge acquitted Egan because he was not satisfiedof his awareness of a sham.  Essentially, the judge was not satisfied that Egan was aware that Becky was not held against her will.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  The learned judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â611.     Since D4 had never spoken to Becky Wong, and as counsel he would normally act on instructions from client, be it D1 orD2, his knowledge or belief at the material time of Becky Wongâs status is essential.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">612.

As such, provided he did not know his instructions to befalse, he was obliged to act on them.  The Code of Conduct of the Bar provided that subject to provisions which are irrelevant forthe present purpose:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA barrister is under a duty to defend any accused person on whose behalf he is instructed irrespective of any belief or opinionhe may have formed as to the guilt or innocence of that person.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This principle applies to non-criminal work as well.  Insofar as particulars (b) and (c) relied on belief or lack of belief on thepart of Egan, I believe they are objectionable.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  The learned judge after saying that Egan had not been a truthful witness, concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â620.   In all the circumstances, I am sure that D4 must have known that and intended his acts would have the tendency of influencingBecky Wong, but I cannot be sure that D4 knew it was a sham.

I am sure D4 knew that D1 and D3 had an interest in the habeas corpus application.  D3 gave him the initial instructionsat the FCC, and the telephone contacts with D3 shows D3âs concern.  He wrote down D1âs name instead of D2âs name in his notebook,although he did not write down D1 was his client.  On the other hand, he would not have written down D1âs name unless he thoughtD1 was closely related to the case.  He effectively told D1 the outcome of the hearing before Yam J.  D4 tried to liken his mistrustof the ICAC to the queries by Yam J and Hartmann J.  With respect, their Lordships did not know about the background and involvementof D1 and D3.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">618.    But then was he misleading the court in not telling D1 was his client?  Legally speaking, D2 was his client.

I feel I am in a chicken and egg situation of lie and knowledge on the part of D4.  The report to the police, involvementof the press or speaking to Magdalene Chow, extraordinary they may be, do not lead me to a conclusion beyond doubt.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">619.    It was submitted that Frankie Chungâs lie to D4 was not of significance.  I can of course ignore his lie to D4 if D4 knewit was a sham all along.  Mr Wilson submitted that D4 was already committed in active steps of the agreement before D4 met FrankieChung.  The active steps were the legal visit and telling the ICAC he had instructions to apply for habeas corpus.  But what agreement: the brief or the conspiracy?â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  It is unclear what the learned judge meant when he asked:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â619.   â¦ But what agreement:  the brief or the conspiracy?  That again begs the question of knowledge.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  In para. 618, the learned judge asked:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â618.   .. was [the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant] misleading the court in not telling D1 was his client?â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  He came to the conclusion that he was unable to conclude beyond doubt that Egan was misleading the court.  The learned judge wasnot satisfied beyond doubt that Derek was his client.  If that be the case, there was no question of Egan not telling the court thatthat was so.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  If Egan acted properly on the instructions of Massie and Clement that Becky was not with the ICAC voluntarily and that the applicationfor <i>habeas corpus</i> was not a sham, it is difficult to understand why the learned judge thought:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â620.   [The 4<sup>th</sup> defendant] must have known that and intended his acts would have the tendency of influencing Becky Wong â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  I am unable to read this passage as saying that the learned judge found, as the question (3) of the Case Stated suggests that thelearned judge had found that Egan had sought access to Becky and used the media to publicise an allegation that she was being heldagainst her will with the intention of influencing Beckyâs provision of assistance or information to the ICAC.  With respect, thatwould be reading too much into the expression âhis acts would have the tendency of influencing Beckyâ.  In any event, the importantfinding in favour of Egan was that he was not aware of a sham (see paragraph 620 of the Reasons).  In my view, this clearly indicatedthat the judge held as a fact that Egan was unaware that the attempts to gain access to Becky (including the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings) were shams.  In other words, he was not satisfied that Egan knew Becky was being held voluntarily.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  Accordingly, the making of an application for <i>habeas corpus</i> when one believes there are good grounds for doing so is not an agreement to do an act which has the manifest tendency to pervertthe course of justice.  There will have to be proof of an intent to do an act which will have the effect of perverting the courseof justice.  Given the judgeâs findings, I can see no basis on which one could say that Egan was not entitled to proceed on thebasis of his instructions.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  Thus, insofar as the application for <i>habeas corpus</i> was properly made, that is not unlawful even if it might also have the tendency to influence Becky not to cooperate with the ICAC. I have already dealt with Mr Wilsonâs submission to the contrary from paras. 98 to 105 above.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  The above matters are relevant to the question of the requisite intention.  In <i>Meissner</i>, Brennan J, Toohey J and McHugh J said at 140:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA person is guilty of attempting to pervert the course of justice when that person engages in conduct that has the tendency topervert the course of justice and does so with the intention of perverting the course of justice.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In <i>R v Rogerson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=107%20ALR%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">107 ALR 225</a> Brennan J and Toohey J said at 232:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âOf course, where there is an agreement to do an act that has a manifest tendency to pervert the course of justice, proof of anagreement to do the act may suffice to prove the intent thereby to pervert the course of justice. But, if the act to be done is ofsuch a nature that its tendency to pervert the course of justice is not manifest, proof of an agreement that the act be done doesnot, without more, amount to proof of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice: in such a case, there has to be proof of anintent to do an act that will have the effect of perverting the course of justice. The state of an alleged conspiratorâs knowledgeof the nature of the relevant act is of critical importance. An act which is not known to have the tendency or is not intended tohave the effect of perverting the course of justice is not an act the doing of which attracts a liability to punishment as for anattempt to pervert, or a perverting of, the course of justice. An agreement that such an act be done made among persons who do notknow that the act has such a tendency and who do not intend it to have that effect is not a conspiracy to do an unlawful act. Toestablish a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, it is necessary to prove an agreement to do an act which the conspiratorseither know will have a manifest tendency to pervert the course of justice or which the conspirators intend to have such an effect.In this context, knowledge and intent relate to the acts and circumstances contemplated by the conspirators; the legal complexionof those acts and circumstances is a question of law.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  Accordingly, given the important finding that Egan was unaware of the sham, the requisite intention could not be established.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  I would answer the questions in the case stated as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  No</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)  No</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)  No</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)  No</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  I would reiterate in relation to question (3) that as the authorities show, intending merely to influence a potential witnessâprovision of assistance or information to the ICAC is not unlawful.  I can see no reason why a potential prosecution witness shouldnot be persuaded to give evidence for the defence and vice versa, provided no unlawful means were used.  Moreover, I agree with MrReynolds that the learned judge had not in the Reasons found that Egan:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âhad sought access to Becky Wong and used the media to publicise an allegation that she was being held against her will with theintention of influencing her â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  As for (4), as I have earlier said, the fact that a person has been included in the WPP does not mean that the person would no longerbe available to the defence.  In other words, the witness does not become the property of the prosecution by inclusion in the WPP.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  In my view, the learned judge was correct in his acquittal of Egan of the 1<sup>st</sup> charge.</p>    <p class="heading">Charges 4 and 5</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Belief</u></p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  Charges 4 and 5 are based on section 17 of the WPO.  Section 17, where relevant, provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1)   A person shall not, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, disclose information-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)  about the identity or location of a person who is or has been a participant or who has been considered for inclusion in the witnessprotection programme;â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The charges alleged disclosure of information that Becky was in the programme, rather than she had been considered for inclusion inthe programme.    They are framed as attempting the impossible, because as at the date of the offences, i.e, 15 July 2004, the ApprovingAuthority had not signed the MOU, and Becky was not legally a participant in the WPP.</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  The prosecution case was that these offences were committed during two conversations between Egan and Magdalene Chow, a reporteremployed by the SCMP, in the afternoon on 15 July 2004.  At 4.38 pm the hearing began before Hartmann J and concluded at 6.10 pm. Between 5.34 pm and 5.56 pm, there was a brief adjournment while Hartmann J considered his ruling.  The offence charged under the4<sup>th</sup> charge allegedly took place during this adjournment.  The 5<sup>th</sup> charge allegedly took place after 6.10 pm, when the hearing was adjourned to 16 July 2004 at 3 pm.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  I agree with the learned judge that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â469.

Mr Wilson submitted that a person is guilty of an attempt to commit an offenceunder section 17 of the WPO, if, on being told, though wrongly, that a person was in the WPP, the informant disclosed that informationto another person even if he did not believe that information.

If A believes the bolster tobe his enemy B and intends to kill him, his act is an attempt to murder B; if he knows the bolster is only a bolster, his act isinnocent. These considerations lead me to the conclusion that the distinction sought to be drawn in <i>Anderton v. Ryan</i> between innocent and guilty acts considered âobjectivelyâ and independently of the state of mind of the actor cannot be sensiblymaintained.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  Suppose A, a petty criminal, were to tell B, another petty criminal, that he was in the WPP, which B did not believe.  In fact,A was not in the WPP.  B then said to C, another petty criminal that A had boasted of being in the WPP.  In such circumstances, wouldB be guilty an attempt to commit a section 17 offence?  I think not.  Suppose the person who disclosed the fact was someone whomone would normally have regarded as reliable, that would only go to the likelihood of the informantâs belief or disbelief of theinformation.  The more reliable the source, the less likely the informant would not believe it.  But to be guilty, he had to believethat the information was true.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  I turn to the learned judgeâs finding that Egan believed that Becky was in the WPP.  The learned judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â674. â¦ With the disclosure of Becky Wong being in the WPP, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, D4 did believe that Becky Wong was in the WPP notwithstanding he had instruction that Becky Wong wanted to leave the ICAC.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  It is, of course, possible that Egan believed Ryan when he was told that Becky was in the WPP, but, with respect, I do not believeit followed necessarily as seemed to be implied by the expression âmutatis mutandisâ.  Earlier, the learned judge had said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â630. Granted Becky Wong was not asked whether she had contacted any lawyer until after the second legal visit by D4, but her positionwas and still is that she stayed with the ICAC voluntarily, and she did not want to leave.  <i>If D4 were told that, he would have disbelieved it, just as he did so on 15 July</i> â¦â (Emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Throughout his evidence, Egan said he did not believe that Becky was in protective custody voluntarily.  If she was detained againsther will that might throw doubt on whether she was indeed in the WPP.  The learned judge held that Frankie Chung had lied to Egan,telling him that he had spoken to Becky and that Becky wanted to leave the custody of the ICAC, and that Egan did not know that tobe a lie.  There is no evidence or finding that Egan knew that Becky was not telling the truth.  The learned judge said that he couldnot be sure that Egan knew that the application for <i>habeas corpus</i> was a sham.</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  In para. 617, although in a different context, the learned judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â617. â¦ D4 tried to liken his mistrust of the ICAC to the queries by Yam J and Hartmann J.  With respect, their Lordships didnot know about the background and involvement of D1 and D3.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>As I understand it, the learned judge was there referring to the fact that both Yam J and Hartmann J were not prepared to accept Ryanâsassertion that Becky was in the WPP.  The implication of the final sentence, however, is important.  The learned judge appeared tobe saying that he rejected Eganâs evidence of his mistrust of the ICAC, because of his knowledge of the involvement of Derek andLam.  Presumably because the knowledge of the involvement of Derek and Lam cast doubt on the reliability of the evidence that Beckywas held against her will.  But the judge has found that it had not been proved that Egan knew or believed that the application wassham.  Any imputation that Egan did not know or believe the genuineness of the application would contradict that.  If the learnedjudge has made contradictory findings, I should act on the finding which is in favour of the defence and reject that which is inconsistent. Accordingly, I conclude that Egan had proceeded and was entitled to proceed on the basis that the <i>habeas corpus</i> application was not a sham.  Insofar as the learned judge did cast doubt on his evidence on an inconsistent basis, such doubt isnot supportable.</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  In my view the learned judgeâs finding that Egan believed Becky was in the WPP cannot be supported.  On this basis alone, Eganâsconviction must be overturned.  Nevertheless, in case I am wrong in relation to Eganâs belief, I will now consider the rest ofthe evidence on the assumption that Egan did believe that Becky was in the WPP.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The evidence</u></p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  According to Magdalene Chow, as a result of certain conversations, an article appeared in the SCMP on 16 July 2004 under the by-lineof Magdalene Chow and Sara Bradford.  Sara Bradford, another SCMP reporter had covered the matter on 14 July 2004 but happened tobe unwell on 15 July 2004, and Magdalene Chow covered the case in the afternoon of 15 July 2004.</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  The article contained the statement:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA legal source said Ms Wong was in the ICAC witness protection programme.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  According to Magdalene Chow, that statement was not in her original draft but after she had emailed her original draft to the SCMP,she telephoned and added the statement that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA legal source said it was believed that Ms Wong was in the ICACâs witness protection programmeâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>She said âit was believedâ were edited out.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  Magdalene Chow was cross-examined extensively on her journalistâs notebook.  It was her evidence that pages 29 to 35 of her notesrelated exclusively to her conversation with Egan and page 36 related to Clement and that they did not contain what other journalistshad told her.</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  The learned judgeâs summary of Magdalene Chowâs evidence in relation to the first conversation is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â272. Magdalene Chow said she saw D4 and Mr Ryan come out of the court to the lobby during the break before a single judge.  Shesaid the reporters surrounded the lawyers and asked questions.  Mr Ryan said he was not allowed to say anything.  D4 was also askedquestions and initially he said he could not say anything and they were just having a break.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">273.  Magdalene Chow said she went over to D4 by herself.  There was a lady who was not a journalist with D4.  Other reporters weresomewhere nearby.  She had no idea whether Mr Clement was there.  Magdalene Chow asked D4 what protective custody meant, and D4 toldher to look up the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564" class="autolink_findacts">Witness Protection Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564">Cap.564</a>, and also the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/221" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Ordinance</a>.  Magdalene Chow had never heard of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564" class="autolink_findacts">Witness Protection Ordinance</a> and she heard it for the first time from D4.  She asked D4 whether he knew where Becky Wong was.  D4 said he did not know.  D4 saidhe had gone with a solicitor to the ICAC twice to look for Becky Wong, and an officer told D4 that he did not have an appointmentand Becky Wong was not with them, and D4 could do whatever he liked.  Then D4 and the others had to go back into the court.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  This is what the learned judge said about the second conversation:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â276. Magdalene Chow said when the people came out of the court again, she asked Mr Ryan what happened and he said he had to comeback the next day.  She went up to D4.  There were also other reporters there, but she did not know whether Mr Clement was there. D4 also said he had to come back at 3 pm the next day as he had to go to the District Court.  D4 said that Yam J granted the habeascorpus.  Then someone asked D4 a question, and D4 mentioned the WPP, and he also said the ICAC had authority to give certain witnessprotection, to change identity, to provide money and a flat to live in.  D4 also said:  âEric Yang, ICAC Chief Investigator, wasin charge of the WPP.â  Magdalene Chow said throughout that afternoon she noticed Eric Yang was outside court.  Eric Yang was knownto the journalists and herself to be a senior ICAC officer, but she did not know that Eric Yang was in charge of the WPP.  MagdaleneChow asked D4 whether one was allowed to refuse to be a witness.  D4 replied that if the ICAC were surrounding you, you could donothing else.  D4 said they had to come back the next day, and ICAC needed to bring Becky Wong to court to explain whether therewas legal basis for keeping her.  Magdalene Chow asked whether they could choose not to bring her.  D4 said the ICAC had better offera better explanation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  He concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â659.   Upon careful consideration, I have no doubt that Magdalene Chow is a credible witness.  She stood by her evidence firmly. I do not accept that she blamed D4 in order to save herself and the SCMP.  I accept her evidence of the two conversations with D4on 15 July, and her notes related to the gist of the conversation with D4, and she did not repeat everything in her evidence â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  The learned judge summarized the effect of the two conversations in paras. 661 to 662 of the judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"> â661.  In the first conversation which is the subject matter of the 4th charge, Magdalene Chow asked D4 about protective custodyandD4 mentioned the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564" class="autolink_findacts">Witness Protection Ordinance</a>.  Magdalene Chow further asked about Becky Wong and D4 spoke of his legal visit to the ICAC.  It must be borne in mind that the exparte hearing before Yam J was in open court, and the name Becky Wong and the term âprotective custodyâ <i>albeit</i> in inverted commas as well as some background of the case were mentioned in open court.  Hence, by mentioning the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564" class="autolink_findacts">Witness Protection Ordinance</a> in relation to protective custody, D4 was effectively linking Becky Wong to the WPP.  The only irresistible inference is Becky Wongwas a participant in the WPP.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">662.    In the second conversation which is the subject matter of the 5th charge which took place after the first conversation, D4explicitly mentioned that Eric Yang was the officer in charge of the WPP, the features of the WPP, and the ICAC had to bring BeckyWong to court to explain the legal basis of keeping her.  The only irresistible inference was Becky Wong was a participant in theWPP.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  The learned judge then concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â674. â¦ With the disclosure of Becky Wong being in the WPP, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, D4 did believe that Becky Wong was in the WPP notwithstanding he had instruction that Becky Wong wanted to leave the ICAC.

That was incorrect.</p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  So it was submitted on Eganâs behalf that her evidence that it was Egan who had spoken to her was unreliable.  But, it was Eganâsevidence that he had told Magdalene Chow when asked:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMr Egan, what is the witness protection scheme?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">There is an ordinance that covers this.

That being the case, I cannot agreethe learned judgeâs acceptance of Magdalene Chowâs evidence that it was Egan who had spoken to her can be faulted.</p>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a>  The learned judge was aware of her mistake regarding the adjournment to 3 pm.  This mistake relates to the second conversation.

In <i>Oriental Daily Publisher Ltd v Commissioner For Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%2d1998%5d%201%20HKCFAR%20279" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997-1998] 1 HKCFAR 279</a> at 290, the Chief Justice said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhere there is a duty to give reasons, it must be discharged by giving adequate reasons.  What would amount to adequate reasonsfor a decision would depend on the context in which the decision maker is operating and the circumstances of the case in question.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The Chief Justice further explained at 292, if the reasons given are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ conclusions rather than reasonsâ,</p>    </blockquote>    <p>they are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âinadequate to discharge the tribunalâs duty to give reasons â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a>  Mr Reynolds complained that the learned judge had failed to make specific findings as to the precise terms of the disclosures. He submitted the terms of such disclosures were critical on the two major elements of the offence, namely, intention and whetherthe act was merely preparatory.</p>    <p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a>  Ms Chowâs evidence was that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhen I asked him about protective custody, he told me to look up the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564" class="autolink_findacts">Witness Protection Ordinance</a> and also Criminal Procedure Ordinance.â T783J   </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a>  I have already quoted Eganâs evidence in para. 150 above.  He was not cross-examined on this.  The learned judge referred to thisevidence in para. 529 as part of his narrative of Eganâs evidence.  I should add that during cross-examination, Magdalene Chowdenied that was what she said.  She said she asked Egan what protective custody meant.  But the emphasis there was whether the referenceto âprotective custodyâ in her notes came from Eganâs complaint letter.</p>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  It appears that no significance was attached to the differences between Eganâs evidence and Magdalene Chowâs evidence.  Mr Wilsonin his final submission made no reference to it.</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 17</a> makes it an offence, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, to disclose information about the identity or location of a personwho is a participant in the WPP.  The point to note, is that the offence requires disclosure.</p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  In <i>AG v Associated Newspapers Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%202%20AC%20238" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 2 AC 238</a>, the House of Lords was concerned with section 8(1) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 which made it an offence âto â¦ discloseâdeliberations made by members of a jury in the course of legal proceedings.  An article was published in The Mail on Sunday newspaperwhich revealed the deliberations of a jury in the course of reaching their verdict in a criminal trial.  The article referred toaccounts of three of the jurors as to how they had reached their decisions.  The information had been given to a journalist by athird party who had been in direct contact with the jury members.   In that context, Lord Lowry said, in a speech which had the concurrenceof the other law lords, that in its plain and ordinary meaning:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ To disclose is to expose to view, make known or reveal and in its ordinary meaning the word aptly describes <i>both</i> the revelation by jurors of their deliberations <i>and</i> further disclosure by publication in a newspaper of the same deliberations, provided always â and this will raise a question offact â that the publication amounts to <i>disclosure</i> and is not a mere republication of already known facts.â [Emphasis added]</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  I believe disclosure under section 17 should be construed similarly.</p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  This is of particular importance when one comes to the fifth charge.  If Egan had disclosed the relevant matters during the firstconversation, the second conversation would simply be a republication of already known facts, and he could not be convicted on thefifth charge.</p>    <p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a>  Moreover, in deciding whether there had been relevant disclosure, one needs to consider whether Egan actually disclosed the factthat Becky was in the WPP and that he intended to do so.  I accept that disclosure can be made implicitly as well as explicitly (theânudge-nudge wink-winkâ situation canvassed at the hearing) but there must be cogent evidence of disclosure.</p>    <p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a>  If Magdalene Chow was already aware that Becky was in a witness protection scheme, but did not know under what law the scheme wasconstituted, it is doubtful whether the identification of the relevant legislation is a sufficient disclosure, though, dependingon the precise circumstances, I would not rule out the possibility.  Nor do I think that where A discloses to B that C was in a witnessprotection scheme, he can escape liability under section 17 merely because A did not know that the scheme or programme was constitutedunder the WPO.  More importantly, one needs to ask whether in identifying the legislation the person did and intended to disclosethe fact that a person was in the scheme.  In this context, I do not regard the fact that in the Ordinance, it was the WPP (âWitnessProtection Programmeâ) and not the witness protection âschemeâ a significant difference.</p>    <p><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a>  In respect of both the question of disclosure and intention, the evidence of both Magdalene Chow  and Egan is important.</p>    <p><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a>  In Mr Wilsonâs closing submission, he said that Magdalene Chow:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ said she was in no doubt that it was Mr Egan who mentioned the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564" class="autolink_findacts">Witness Protection Ordinance</a>, that Mr Egan identified Eric Yang as being in charge of the witness protection programmeâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr Wilson had not submitted that Eganâs evidence on the conversation quoted in para. 150 above should be rejected.  That may bebecause the requirement of disclosure was not properly appreciated at the time.  But any proper consideration of the fourth and fifthcharges requires a correct appreciation of the nature of these charges.</p>    <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a>  It is here that proper evaluation of the evidence is important.  Such evaluation must include a proper evaluation of Magdalene Chowâsknowledge.  Presumably, the learned judge proceeded on the basis that she knew Becky was in protective custody or in a witness protectionscheme.  I will assume that it is the latter, since Eganâs evidence was not challenged in cross-examination and had not been expresslyrejected by the learned judge.  If Magdalene Chow was already aware that Becky was in a witness protection scheme with the ICAC,I doubt the fact that Egan identified the legislation under which she was held would have amounted to a disclosure of information:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ about the identity of a participant in the witness protection programme;â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a>  If Magdalene Chow already knew that Becky was in a WPP or scheme but did not know the exact statutory provision under which theprogramme or scheme was constituted, would the supply of such information run foul of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17?</a>  One might ask: if Egan had said in reply to Magdalene Chowâs query that she should go to the library to look up the law, and shedid so and found the WPO, would that have been a disclosure under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17?</a>  Or, that he intended to do so?  I think not.  Also Eganâs state of knowledge of how much Magdalene Chow already knew might beimportant on the issue whether he intended to disclose the âidentityâ of Becky as a participant in the WPP.  Suppose MagdaleneChow, instead of asking Egan âwhat is the witness protection schemeâ went directly to the library and, after telling the librarian,that she had been covering an application for <i>habeas corpus</i> regarding Becky and understood that she was in the witness protection scheme of the ICAC, asked the librarian what was the relevantlegislation and was told that it was the WPO.  Would the librarian have committed an offence under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17?</a>  I think not and for several reasons, one of which is that he/she had not disclosed the identity of a participant in the WPP.  Supposealso, that Magdalene Chow, having solicited no response from Egan but wrote in her article that âThis reporter believes that (Becky)is in the ICACâs witness protective schemeâ.  She might have committed an offence under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a> although she was unaware of the WPO.  I will not multiply the examples.  I wish only to demonstrate the possibilities.</p>    <p><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a>  These are matters which required proper evaluation and decision by the learned judge.  In fairness, I must say that no such argumenthad been addressed to the learned judge, but the failure to appreciate the requirements of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a> is fatal to Eganâs conviction.</p>    <p class="heading">Lam, the 3<sup>rd</sup> applicant</p>    <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  I turn to consider Lamâs application for leave to appeal against conviction.  Lam was retained by Derek in the afternoon of 13July 2004.  The learned judge found that on 13 July 2004, Derek and William Lau visited Lam at his offices at about 4 pm.  Presumably,it was on that occasion that Derek retained Lam to act for him.  Mandy joined them at Lamâs office at 5.39 pm and they left forMessrs Massie &amp; Clementâs offices, arriving there at 5.59 pm.  William Lau was not called as a witness nor has it been suggestedthat he was a co-conspirator.  There is no evidence that Derek was already acquainted with Lam, although, according to Frankie Chung,in the afternoon of 12 July 2004, Derek said he needed to look for a famous barrister to defend him and in that context Derek mentionedthe names of Lawrence Lok SC and Lam.  Lam, Derek and William Lau left Messrs Massie &amp; Clement at 6.08 pm.  Mandy was left aloneto give instructions to Clement.  There is no direct evidence that he knew of the falsity or sham in the series of acts alleged.</p>    <p class="heading">Did the 3<sup>rd</sup> applicant know of the sham?</p>    <p><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a>  There was no direct evidence that Lam knew that Becky or Frankie Chung was untruthful.  In Frankie Chungâs affirmation he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â4.     â¦ [PW1] was scared and was uncomfortable with her situation.  That she didnât want to be there.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">7.      As matters stand Ms Wong has asked to see a lawyer.  I believe she is in the custody of the ICAC although I do not know where. I believe that she has been held in excess of 48 hours and thus any restraint without her consent is unlawful.  We have not beentold that she has been charged.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a>  Frankie Chung gave evidence under immunity.  It was not his evidence that he had told Lam that what he said in the affirmation wasuntrue.  The learned judge acquitted Egan because he was not aware that Frankie Chung was untruthful.  Lam did not meet Derek until4.12 pm on 13 July 2004, and he met Mandy for the first time at 5.59 pm, 17 minutes before he took her to consult Messrs Massie &amp;Clement.  Whilst at Messrs Massie &amp; Clement it appeared that after the making the introductions, he left Mandy with Clement. By 5.59 pm, instructions were taken from her by persons who were not alleged to be co-conspirators.  The instructions were givenwithout any intervention by Lam.  Thus, if Lam was party to an agreement that false representations were to be deployed, he wouldhave had to agree to that course of conduct some time between 4.12 pm and 5.59 pm on 13 July 2004.  It is to be noted that earlieron 11 July 2004, Peter Lai, a solicitor had been instructed to visit William Lau and Becky at the ICAC but that he was only ableto see William Lau but not Becky.  It appears therefore that the idea of retaining a lawyer to visit Becky at the ICAC was knownto Derek prior to the engagement of Lam.</p>    <p class="heading">Nattrass</p>    <p><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a>  Lamâs conviction essentially depended on the evidence of Aaron Patrick Nattrass (âNattrassâ) (PW7).  Apart from Nattrassâsevidence the case against Lam is substantially the same as the case against Egan.  Nattrass was the managing clerk of Messrs Massie&amp; Clement, and had been in that position for about ten years.  The prosecution relied heavily on Nattrassâs evidence on theconversation that he had with Lam on 30 August 2004 in which Lam allegedly made certain incriminating statements.  Both Lam and Nattrasswere at Eganâs flat for a buffet supper that evening and the conversation was supposed to have taken place at the dining tablewhilst the other guests were in the balcony.  The contents of the conversation were reported by Nattrass to Mr Bishop of the ICACon 7 September 2004.  There is a 40-page transcript (referred to in cross-examination but not produced) of that meeting.  Later on22 September 2004, a statement (also referred to in cross-examination but not produced) was taken from Nattrass by the ICAC whichhe had signed.  The learned judge relied on three incriminating statements which Lam had allegedly made in his conversation withNattrass.</p>    <p class="heading">The 1<sup>st</sup> incriminating statement</p>    <p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a>  It will be recalled that in Mandyâs affirmation she said Becky was her business partner and that she held 30% of the shares inEver Brilliant.  This was particular (a) in the perjury charge against Mandy.  The prosecution has conceded that this particularcannot be maintained.  According to Nattrass, he confronted Lam with the fact that as at the date of Mandyâs affirmation, Beckywas not registered as a shareholder in Ever Brilliant.  In response, Lam allegedly said she had forgotten her lines.</p>    <p><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a>  In para. 561, the learned judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â561. The fact remains that Becky Wong was not a 30% shareholder of Ever Brilliant formally because the transfer was not duly stampedand registered. â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>With respect, that is not correct.  The fact that it has not been stamped may affect its admissibility as evidence.  But the liabilityto pay stamp duty presupposed the transfer of the beneficial interest.  The learned judge went on to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â574. Granted that Becky Wong said she had signed the instrument of transfer in Ever Brilliant, but the shares transfer was notduly registered.  It is a fact that the company search did not reflect any shareholdings by Becky Wong.  D3 said Becky Wong was onlyrecently brought into the company and the annual return would not reflect that, and D2 had forgotten her lines.  There is no inconsistencybetween D2 might have regarded Becky Wong as a business partner and the company search did not reflect that Becky Wong was a 30%shareholder.  Seen in this light, it is not inherently improbable that D3 said D2 had forgotten her lines.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a>  But what were the âlinesâ which Mandy was supposed to have forgotten?  That Becky was only a 30% shareholder in equity but thatlegal title had not vested in her?  But legal title in shares (which are choses in action) does not depend on the filing of an annualreturn under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 107</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, under which particulars relating to members are required to be stated.  The transferee becomes a member of the company upon registrationin the companyâs register of members <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Section 28(2)</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>).  According to <i>Penningtonâs Company Law</i>, 8<sup>th</sup> Edition, at 416:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt has often been assumed in judicial reasoning that the legal title to registered shares does not pass to the transferee untilthe transfer is registered in the companyâs register of members.  When he has presented the transferorâs share certificate andthe instrument of transfer to himself for registration and has fulfilled any other conditions set out in the companyâs articlesof association or the terms of issues of the shares, the transferee has a legal right against the company to have the transfer registered,but until the transfer is actually registered, it has often been assumed judicially that the title to the shares is still inchoate,and that the legal title vested in his transferor.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The learned author then mentions another view that legal title passes from the transferor to the transferee by virtue of the executedshare transfer and the delivery of the transferorâs share certificate.  In the end, it does not matter which view is correct. It is sufficient for present purposes to say that the transfer of the legal title did not depend on the registration of the annualreturns under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 107.</a>  I should add registration of transfer of shares per se is not required, nor would the validity of the transfer depend on it.</p>    <p><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a>  It is highly improbable that Mandy would have been aware of such legal niceties, had told Lam that Becky was possibly only an equitableas opposed to a legal owner (assuming that legal title would only pass on registration in the companyâs register of members andthat had not taken place) and that Lam had advised her to say that Becky was only an equitable owner, hence, the forgotten line. With respect to the learned judge, he has failed to recognise the claim by Nattrass that Lam had said that Becky had forgotten herlines, far from being ânot inherently improbableâ, did not make sense.</p>    <p><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a>  Moreover, the learned judge has failed to weigh the possibility that this conversation was an invention of Nattrass.  Nattrass personallyattached great significance to the fact that Becky was not a registered shareholder of Ever Brilliant.  He had caused Messrs Massie&amp; Clement to search Ever Brilliant and passed the result to the ICAC.  According to Clement, he had this conversation with Nattrassin September:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.      Yes, there was a conversation, me and Massie was in my room, it was sometime in September, Nattrass came in announcingthat his, I think, friends at the ICAC could show that the clientâs affidavit wasnât true. I asked him why that should be so.â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.        Oh, yes, I mean he was just misreading it. And he bolstered that by saying that heâd made his own company search, butthe point was nonsense.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.       And did he, in that conversation, with words to this effect, âWell, anyway, the bitch or the bastards are going down ...â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.        âThe bitch is going down,â is what he said, yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q        â¦  or something of that nature.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.        âThe bitch is going down,â was the exact words he used.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><i>The 2<sup>nd</sup> incriminating statement</i></p>    <p><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> statement is that Lam told Nattrass to tell Massie not to worry because Mandy had been paid, and she would shut up and say nothingto the ICAC.  This is the critical statement in relation to which the learned judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â634. â¦ I have accepted Aaron Nattrass as a truthful witness.  D3 would not have told him that D2 had been paid and she wouldnot say anything to the ICAC unless it was true.  â¦ And as to the inference on D2 being paid and would not say anything to theICAC, why would a lawyer be told this unless he was in it together all along?  That is the only reasonable inference.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Ms Clare Montgomery, QC rightly submitted:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThis is the only evidence that the Judge identifies as justifying the inference that Lam believed âall alongâ that Becky wasnot illegally detained (assuming that is what is meant by âin it all alongâ). â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Unless it was true</p>    <p><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a>  But was it true?  If she had been paid, it is improbable that the payment would not have been traced.  It was the prosecution casethat she had been paid.  The prosecution adduced evidence to show that there had been payment in the form of a used Mercedes Benzcar.  But the learned judge rejected that and said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â204. â¦ However, according to PW15 Li Suk-lim, a car sales man, he agreed that around June 2004, Derek and Mandy went to visithim to look at a white car; they did not buy this car but looked at other cars as well. June 2004 predates the conspiracy charged,therefore any gift of a car from Derek to Mandy cannot have been causally connected to the conspiracy.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>So, there was no evidence that she had been paid.  Nor did the learned judge find otherwise.  That being the case, the learned judgeâsstatement that Lam would not have told Nattrass that Mandy had been paid unless it was true is puzzling.  If the statement attributedto Lam was untrue, or not to have been proved to be true, that should go to Nattrassâs reliability and the learned judge oughtto have realised that to be so.</p>    <p><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a>  It is also to be noted that Nattrass agreed in cross-examination that his allegation that Lam said Mandy had been told on her returnto answer bail to keep quiet and to shut up was not in his statement to the ICAC, which was based on the tape recorded meeting withMr Bishop of ICAC on 7 September 2004.</p>    <p><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a>  It is also not clear what Massie was supposed to have to worry about.  There was no suggestion that Massie was party to any conspiracy. Massieâs involvement in the matter was brief and clearly captured in his note to Clement.  He went on leave on 14 July 2004 andhis only contact with Lam was the telephone conversation when the case was referred to his firm by Lam.  Although Massie had givena statement to the prosecution, he was never called.  It was never suggested that Massie was aware that Mandy was<br />    Derekâs girlfriend.  Nor that Mandy had told either Massie or Clement she was Derekâs girlfriend.  So what was it that shemight have said to the ICAC (had she not be paid off) which might have incriminated either Massie or even Clement in relation tothat?  It was suggested that the learned judge had in mind that Massie might be worried for his firmâs sake, because if Clementwas in trouble, that might reflect on Massie and Clement.  The learned judge did not say so and I do not speculate on this.  Butagain there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that Mandy could incriminate Clement.  Clementâs draft letter was a model ofmoderation.  Nor could he be blamed in any way for the subsequent actions.  Moreover the conversation about the relationship betweenMandy and Derek was also not mentioned in his statement to the ICAC on 22 September 2004 (Transcript 695).  I regret to say Nattrassâsevidence was taken on its face value without sufficient regard to whether the alleged statement made sense or was inherently probable.</p>    <p class="heading">The 3<sup>rd</sup> incriminating statement</p>    <p><a name="p181" class="para" id="p181">181.</a>  The 3<sup>rd</sup> incriminating statement is that Lam had asked Nattrass to tell Massie to say nothing to the ICAC and in particular, not to say thathe had referred Mandy to Massie and Clement.  The gist of Nattrassâs evidence on this can be gathered from the following exchangeduring Nattrassâs evidence:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âCourt: So the question is, âDid Mr Lam say in his own mouth that âTell Massie not to say I have brought the case to Massie&amp; Clement.ââ I think thatâs the question, isnât it?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A: Yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Court: Did he say that?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A: Yes.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><i>ICAC letter to Massie</i></p>    <p><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a>  It is necessary to put this evidence in context.  According to Nattrass the conversation started with Lam asking him âabout theletter that the ICAC had written to Mr Massie on 26 Augustâ (Transcript 653).  The letter was referred to in cross-examinationand in the Reasons, though never formally produced.  But the learned judge proceeded on the basis that Lam was aware of the contentsof the letter.</p>    <p><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a>  The reasoning of the learned judge should be examined against this letter.  The letter was addressed to Massie personally and wasmarked âprivate and confidentialâ.  It is dated 26 August 2004.  It reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAs you know, the ICAC is currently conducting a criminal investigation into offences of conspiracy to pervert the course of publicjustice and breaches of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 17</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564" class="autolink_findacts">Witness Protection Ordinance</a>.

In that connection, I now enclose a list of the core questions in respect of which we would like answers from you.

As a consequence of any discussion(s) referred to above, did you instruct a barrister at law to act for Messrs Massie &amp;Clement in connection with the matter concerning Miss Mandy CHUI?

Is there anything you would like to add to your answers to the above questions?â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a>  As the letter of 26 August 2004 made clear, Clement had been âinterviewed and provided information to the ICAC â¦â.  He wouldhave told the ICAC that Lam went with Derek, Mandy and William Lau on 15 July 2004.  That was his evidence at trial.  Moreover, theletter clearly stated that it was understood that on 13 July 2004, Massie had spoken âto one or more individuals concerning (Mandy),which resulted in your later passing certain information to (Clement)â.  That being the case, what was the point in telling Massienot to say that Lam had referred the case to Clement and Massie?  Also given Lamâs experience as a criminal lawyer, he would havebeen aware that the ICAC would have obtained the CCTV recording of his offices as well as Massie and Clementâs offices.  The evidencewas that movement in and out of Lamâs and Massie &amp; Clementâs offices were captured on CCTV.  What was the point in tellingMassie not to tell the ICAC, if Clement had already told the ICAC and Lamâs presence was recorded on CCTV?</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion on the incriminating statements </p>    <p><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a>  The learned judge regarded these statements as not âinherently improbableâ.  He relied on them in convicting Lam.  I do notbelieve the learned judgeâs reliance on these statements is justified.  Since the learned judge relied heavily on such evidencein convicting Lam, on this ground alone, I would quash his conviction.</p>    <p class="heading">Reliability of Nattrass</p>    <p><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a>  In case I am wrong on my understanding of the âincriminatingâ statements I turn to consider Nattrassâs reliability as a witness. Having regard to the importance of Nattrass the learned judge devoted over three pages of his judgment on him starting from para.350 and concluding in para. 361.</p>    <p><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a>  It was Nattrassâs evidence that at T679:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA.    I donât have a role as a registered informant. What I said, and Iâve said along, itâs on a confidential basis. I inform(the ICAC) about things that they needed to know.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Also that, at the end of August 2004 or beginning of September, he was furnishing documents secretly to the ICAC that were taken fromthe firmâs files, e.g. 2 cheques relating to payment of fees by Mandy.  He had also supplied a copy of the company search on EverBrilliant.</p>    <p><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a>  In para. 571(8), the learned judge recorded the defence submission which included:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(8)   He had made a multiplicity of complaints and suits, even against the ICAC, and is in fact a vexatious litigant, and henceis unworthy of belief.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is not clear from the Reasons whether the learned judge accepted these criticisms of Nattrass.  Since the evidence came from Clement,whom the learned judge had regarded as a truthful witness, if the learned judge had rejected such evidence, I believe he would havesaid so.</p>    <p><a name="p189" class="para" id="p189">189.</a>  The evidence of Clement on Nattrass provides a useful insight into Nattrassâs character, I will quote the relevant evidence infull:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.

The learned judgeâs reference to Nattrassâs interest in pornography to the exclusionof other matters which bore directly on his reliability as a witness showed, with respect, insufficient appreciation of the importanceof this other evidence on his reliability.  In relation to these matters a proper evaluation of the evidence is essential.</p>    <p><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a>  The learned judge also regarded as important that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â578. â¦ â¦ apart from his concern for the reputation of Massie &amp; Clement, he had nothing to gain but everything to lose inbeing a witness in this case.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a>  Nattrass professed concern for the reputation of Messrs Massie &amp; Clement.  But the many complaints that he had made about themafter his employment throw doubt on whether he was ever genuinely concerned about the firm.  Moreover, it is difficult to understandhow his conduct could be explained by his alleged concern for the reputation of his employers.  As noted, he had supplied the firmâsdocuments in secret to the ICAC.  In other words, he was informing on the firmâs client.  The right to confidential legal adviceis a fundamental human right and is protected by legal professional privilege, <i>Regina (Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co Ltd) v. Special Commissioner of Income Tax and Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20AC%20563" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 AC 563.</a>  As was explained in <i>Solicitor v Law Society of Hong Kong</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%209%20HKCFAR%20175" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 9 HKCFAR 175</a>, legal professional privilege âis not the privilege of the lawyer but of his clientâ, and that in Hong Kong, it is a constitutionalright.  It is difficult to imagine a more gross breach of duty.  In the circumstances of this case, it is totally inexcusable andcannot be explained away by Nattrassâs alleged concern for the reputation of Messrs Massie &amp; Clement.  Such aberrant conducton the part of Nattrass cannot be so easily disregarded.</p>    <p><a name="p193" class="para" id="p193">193.</a>  The learned judge went on to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â578. â¦ He had no motive to lie against D3 and D4, other than it was suggested that he was not a normal person.  But as said before,he had been the managing clerk for Massie &amp; Clement for almost 10 years.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p194" class="para" id="p194">194.</a>  The fact that he had been a managing clerk for a number of years supports the view that he is a normal person.  But a normal managingclerk would not inform on the client of the firm or pass documents relating to the firmâs client to the ICAC in secret.  Nor, withrespect, is that a sufficient answer, having regard to the evidence about the unfounded complaints against all and sundry that hewas in the habit of making.</p>    <p><a name="p195" class="para" id="p195">195.</a>  The learned judgeâs conclusion on Nattrass can be found at paras. 578 to 580:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â578. It was suggested that Nattrass combined and embellished evidence from different sources.  He has been reminded not to mixwhat he heard with what he thought.  He was subject to strenuous cross-examination and he stood by his evidence on the conversationswith D3 and D4.  It is important to note that apart from his concern for the reputation of Massie &amp; Clement, he had nothing togain but everything to lose in being a witness in this case.  He had no motive to lie against D3 and D4, other than it was suggestedthat he was not a normal person.  But as said before, he had been the managing clerk for Massie &amp; Clement for almost 10 years.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">579.  Nattrass admitted he was no saint when being cross-examined on pornography.  I dare say if he were a saint, it would hardlybe inherently probable that anyone would have told him things in the nature of what he had given in evidence.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">580.  I bear in mind that Nattrass had been feeding the ICAC with information when the conversations with D3 and D4 took place.  Ialso bear in mind his character and treatment by the ICAC as a witness in this case.  I am left in no doubt that Nattrass has beentelling the truth about the conversations with D3 and D4.  Although his witness statement was taken some time later, I did not haveany doubt as to his reliability to recount the events.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p196" class="para" id="p196">196.</a>  With respect to the learned judge, for whom I have the upmost respect, I do not believe that he has sufficiently evaluated Nattrassâsreliability.  The conclusionary remarks in para. 580 are not an adequate substitute for a proper evaluation.  So even if my analysisof the âincriminating statementsâ is not correct, I would quash Lamâs conviction since it was based on unreliable evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">Other adverse inferences</p>    <p><a name="p197" class="para" id="p197">197.</a>  The learned judge appeared to have drawn inferences adverse to Lam on the basis of his own analysis that the possibility of conflictof interest was not a tenable explanation for Lamâs decision not to act in the application for <i>habeas corpus</i>.  With respect, whilst it is possible to say that technically speaking, if the 3<sup>rd</sup> applicant had acted in the application, there would be no conflict of interest in the application itself, the potential for conflictis obvious.  Suppose on gaining access to Becky, she asked, âThe ICAC has offered me the chance of being an immunised witness. Should I accept?âthe 3<sup>rd</sup> applicant would have been in an impossible position of conflict.  It is not fanciful to think that a person in a position of Beckywould want to know whether it will be in her interest to cooperate with the ICAC, and if she were to do so, what would be the bestterm that she could get from such cooperation?  It will be recalled Frankie Chung visited Derek on 10 July 2004 and attended Derekâsinterview by the ICAC on 11 July 2004.</p>    <p><a name="p198" class="para" id="p198">198.</a>  There is also force in Ms Montgomeryâs submission that if Lam were a conspirator, it is much more likely that he would have soughtto act in the case in order to keep control of it.  Indeed, if he had conspired with Derek so as to influence Becky, it made no sensefor Lam to manufacture a situation where it was not him but Egan or Messrs Massie &amp; Clement who would gain access to Becky. That might provide Becky with access to independent legal advice, but it would provide no opportunity to the conspirators to threaten,bribe or otherwise influence her.  Nor should one ignore the positive impact which Eganâs acquittal should have on Lam.  As I havesaid, apart from Nattrassâs evidence, there is no substantial difference between Egan and Lam.</p>    <p><a name="p199" class="para" id="p199">199.</a>  The prosecution suggested that the conspirators might have wanted Lam to act behind the scenes to avoid the application for accessbeing connected to Derek.  But, Frankie Chung filed an affirmation in the <i>habeas corpus</i> and instructed Egan to visit the ICAC on 14 July 2004.  Also Frankie Chung had visited Derek on 10 July 2004 and accompanied himwhen he was interviewed by the ICAC on 11 July 2004.  The evidence also shows quite clearly that the ICAC officers Lim and MatchyMak heard Eganâs mobile rang and heard him say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAndrew, Iâm talking to the ICAC officers. Donât call me. Iâll call you.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>And that after hanging up, Egan said,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âItâs Andrew Lam Ping-cheung.  He is not patient.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Egan made a similar open reference to Lamâs involvement while he was with Mr Ryan on 14 July 2004.  Mr Ryan said Egan received aphone call and talked to someone called âLammyâ, after hanging up, Egan said to him:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAndrew Lam is a bloody nuisance.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Moreover, Mr Ryan said to Yam J on 15 July 2004 the ICAC:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ have information that this whole application may well have come from one of the major parties involved in this investigationâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p200" class="para" id="p200">200.</a>  At paragraph 407 of his Reasons for Verdict the judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âD1 told Frankie Chung to accompany D4 to make the second legal visit at the ICAC.  Frankie Chung made excuses and suggested D3to do it, but D1 said, âYou do it.  I will be assured if you do itâ, and âAs I ask you to do it, you just do it.â The factremains that the instruction for the second legal visit was given and carried out without Becky Wong ever calling Frankie Chung againasking for legal representation.  Assuming Frankie Chung to be credible, this is an inference of knowledge of the sham against D1and D3.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I find this reasoning difficult.  I do not understand how this conversation can support âan inference of knowledge of the shamâagainst Lam.</p>    <p><a name="p201" class="para" id="p201">201.</a>  On 15 July 2004 Lam had lunch with Mrs Reimer Lau and Mr Martin Yeung (his former trainee solicitors) at Grissiniâs .  The learnedjudge dealt with the Grissini lunch in paras. 332-339 of the Reasons.  In para. 338, the learned judge related the evidence of MrYeung.  According to Mr Yeung, Lam:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â338. â¦ said the ICAC was in the wrong in getting hold of the girl surnamed Wong.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Also Lam had compared Becky with Angela Gong, a person who had allegedly been kept by the ICAC against her will, and whom Lam hadmanaged to âsaveâ.  The evidence regarding the Grissini lunch led the learned judge to conclude:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â631. As to the fact that D3 told Mrs Reimer Lau and Martin Yeung that he planned the habeas corpus and would switch on all themachines to expose the abuse of the ICAC, I find that D3 did plan the habeas corpus and switch on all the machines, meaning involvingthe press.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">632.  Carmen Hsu rang D4 so soon after the first legal visit and knowing his lack of success.  Given the pattern and timing of telephonecalls between D3 and D4, the only reasonable inference was D3 had told Carmen Hsu about it, and she was referred to D4 for more details. D3 was using Carmen Hsu as part of the machines at his disposal.  The result of involving the press was achieved notwithstandingD4 was not in the conspiracy.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a>  These findings should be read with particular (d) in the conspiracy charge (see para. 8 above).  It is to be noted, however, thatthe sting of particular (d) is the false representation that Becky was being unlawfully detained.  So merely involving the pressis insufficient.</p>    <p><a name="p203" class="para" id="p203">203.</a>  The learned judge recognized the conflict between what Lam said at the Grissini lunch which suggested that Lam believed Becky washeld against her will and the incriminating statements he had allegedly made to Nattrass.  In para. 581 of the Reasons he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â581  â¦ As to the conflict between what D3 said during the Grissini lunch and to what he told Aaron Nattrass, I shall deal withthe matter later.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The learned judge did not return to the matter or solve the apparent conflict.  That is ground 16 of Lamâs grounds of appeal.  Ibelieve it is clear that the Grissini lunch was not evidence that Lam believed or knew that Becky was not held against her will.</p>    <p><a name="p204" class="para" id="p204">204.</a>  These adverse inferences are not in any event sufficient to support Lamâs conviction.  Nor had the learned judge said that inthe absence of Nattrassâs evidence which he accepted, he would have convicted Lam.</p>    <p><a name="p205" class="para" id="p205">205.</a>  The learned judge found that Mandy did not believe that Becky was held against her will by the ICAC, and that Mandy realised thatwhat she said or omitted to say in her affirmation of 15 July 2004 amounted to deliberate falsehood.  But there is no evidence thatMandy told Lam that she had indeed been untruthful.  So there is no direct evidence that Lam knew that the application was a sham.</p>    <p><a name="p206" class="para" id="p206">206.</a>  Para. 634 is critical to the learned judgeâs conclusion that Lam was guilty:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â634. â¦ I reject that D3 believed Becky Wong was illegally detained by the ICAC.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p207" class="para" id="p207">207.</a>  Ms Montgomery submitted that as a solicitor, the rule applicable to Lam was clear.  As a solicitor if he had doubts about his instructionsor even a belief that they might not be true, provided he did not know those instructions were false, he was entitled to act on them.</p>    <p><a name="p208" class="para" id="p208">208.</a>  There is no duty upon a solicitor (or a barrister) to enquire whether the person giving him instructions or providing him with materialis telling the truth.  This is confirmed by the commentary in <i>The Hong Kong Solicitorsâ Guide to Professional Conduct</i> in relation to principle 10.03, which prohibits knowing attempts to deceive or participate in the deception of a tribunal.  The Guidecomments:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â2.     In general, there is no duty upon a solicitor to enquire in every case where he is instructed as to whether his client istelling the truth â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">3.      When it has come to the <i>knowledge</i> of a solicitor that a client intends to mislead the court by making false statements or producing false evidence, the solicitor hasa duty to advise the client not to do so â¦ If the client refuses to accept his advice, the solicitor should cease to act.â [Myemphasis]</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â4.     If, either before or during the course of proceedings, a client makes statements to his solicitor which are merely inconsistent,this is not of itself a ground for the solicitor to refuse to act further on behalf of the client.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Insofar as the learned judge relied on Lamâs belief, as opposed to knowledge, with respect, he was wrong.</p>    <p class="heading">Mandy, the 2nd applicant</p>    <p><a name="p209" class="para" id="p209">209.</a>  Her conviction turned on the learned judgeâs finding that she knew that the evidence that Becky was involuntarily detained bythe ICAC, was false.</p>    <p><a name="p210" class="para" id="p210">210.</a>  The learned judge said in para. 430 of the Reasons:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â430. As to whether the seeking of access and the application for habeas corpus have the tendency to pervert the course of justice,the right to seek legal access and to apply for a habeas corpus cannot admit an abuse of the process in making the application wherethe ground that the person was illegally detained and she wanted to seek release was a sham.  D1 told Frankie Chung that Becky Wongwas a fragile person or terms to that effect.  And D2 must have known Becky Wongâs disposition by virtue of the sisterly friendship. Becky Wong said she did cry and consider leaving the WPP because of all the trouble when she was told that someone had applied forhabeas corpus on her behalf.  Assuming the witness to be credible, the inference is that D1 and D2 intended to influence Becky Wongnot to co-operate with the ICAC, and the acts did have a natural tendency to influence her.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p211" class="para" id="p211">211.</a>  So the learned judge was saying that in relation to Derek and Becky the false application was the means by which they intended toput pressure on Becky.  The conspiracy charge, especially particulars (b) and (c), alleged the doing of a series of acts each ofwhich involved falsity or sham.</p>    <p><a name="p212" class="para" id="p212">212.</a>  Hence, it is a case of using unlawful means to put pressure on a witness.  That is unlawful.  I do not agree with Mr Jonathan CaplanQC that the means were not unlawful.</p>    <p><a name="p213" class="para" id="p213">213.</a>  I turn to consider the learned judgeâs finding that Mandy knew that the:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â430. â¦. ground that [Becky] was illegally detained and she wanted to seek release was a sham.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p214" class="para" id="p214">214.</a>  In that regard the learned judge relied heavily on the evidence of Becky, in particular, that Becky told Mandy during their telephoneconversations that she was âsafe and soundâ.  The first took place on 11 July 2004 which had been taped by the ICAC.</p>    <p><a name="p215" class="para" id="p215">215.</a>  The learned judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â180. In her statement dated 14 July 2004, Becky Wong stated that she was accompanied by the ICAC of her free will, and she didnot ask her family or anyone to apply for <i>habeas corpus.</i> She said late at night on 12 July, she rang D2 and told her she was safe and sound. â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">562.  I have absolutely no doubt that Becky Wong is a credible witness.  I accept all her evidence, and in particular, I find thatshe stayed with the ICAC voluntarily, she told D2 that she was OK once and that she was safe and sound, meaning safe and all right,or nothing to worry about, on the telephone on 11 and 12 July.  I find there is no inconsistency in Becky Wongâs evidence withthe official translation of âsafe and soundâ.  She never asked D2 or Frankie Chung to get her a lawyer or to get her out of theICAC, or she did not know where she was.  She never told D2 that her phone and SIM card was confiscated by the ICAC, or she was notallowed to speak on the phone, or she had no close family members in Hong Kong.  She signed the MOU on 13 July.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p216" class="para" id="p216">216.</a>  Here, I do not believe there are substantial grounds to impugn the learned judgeâs finding which are essentially based on hisassessment of Beckyâs evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p217" class="para" id="p217">217.</a>  Following his finding at paras. 365, 430 and 431 that Mandy had knowledge or belief that Becky was not unlawfully detained and didnot seek release from the custody of the ICAC, and the evidence of Frankie Chung that Derek told him that Becky was a fragile personand that Mandy must have known that this was her disposition, the learned judge concluded that she was guilty of the conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p218" class="para" id="p218">218.</a>  I acknowledge Mr Caplanâs submission that Mandy had not said anything to Becky, in any of the telephone conversation, which couldbe construed as a threat or request not to co-operate with the ICAC.  But, with respect, that is not necessary for the charge.  Hesubmitted that Mandy had real concerns about the welfare of Becky and that Becky had sent misleading signals.  But the learned judgefound that Mandy knew the evidence that Becky was involuntarily detained by the ICAC was false.  Mr Caplan also relied on Clementâsevidence that Mandy did not expressly state that Becky had wanted to leave the custody of the ICAC, she only told Clement that sheâhad the feeling that [Becky] didnât want to be where she wasâ, and that her instructions were âa little bit vagueâ.  Butsuch evidence had been considered by the learned judge and his conclusion was one which he was entitled to come to, and more importantly,not one which I am entitled to overturn.  Mr Caplan further submitted that the learned trial judge took into account at para. 622of the Reasons that Mandy did not say she would âtry to saveâ Becky during the telephone conversations on 12<sup>th</sup> July 2004.  Mr Caplan submitted that Mandy did, however, send to Becky via SMS a âlawyerâsâ phone number in the afternoon of12<sup>th</sup> July and a message saying âlawyer will save uâ in the evening of 14<sup>th</sup> July.  I do not believe this could invalidate the learned judgeâs conclusion.  In fact, this evidence was against Mandy : at nostage had Becky requested help from anyone, yet a message was sent to her requesting her to contact a lawyer who was unknown to her.</p>    <p class="heading">Destruction of the telephone intercepts</p>    <p><a name="p219" class="para" id="p219">219.</a>  In para. 22 above, I mentioned that Becky called Mandy and that the call was monitored by the ICAC.  The learned judge found, acceptingthe evidence of Becky that she said to Mandy:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âshe was safe and soundâ âå¹³å®ç¡äºâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p220" class="para" id="p220">220.</a>  This call was intercepted and recorded by the intelligence team of the ICAC.  A first hand listenerâs notes (âthe Notesâ)were contemporaneously prepared by the officer who listened to the call.</p>    <p><a name="p221" class="para" id="p221">221.</a>  Unfortunately the tape recording of 11 July 2004 conversation as well as the Notes of that conversation have been destroyed.  MsMontgomeryâs submission on the destruction of the tape and the Notes was adopted by all the other applicants.</p>    <p><a name="p222" class="para" id="p222">222.</a>  The sound recording was destroyed in July as a matter of routine.  The Notes were destroyed on 2 September 2004.  The ICAC has notexplained why they were destroyed.  It was not said that the Notes were destroyed as a matter of routine.  However, in para. 599,the learned judge said he accepted the evidence that monitored calls were intended for intelligence only and not as evidence, andthat there was a procedure for the Notesâ destruction one month after the cessation of tapping, unless special request was madefor its retention.</p>    <p><a name="p223" class="para" id="p223">223.</a>  The importance of the conversation is obvious as the learned judge clearly recognised.  The learned judge compared the listenerto an âindependent witness to that conversation â¦â.  If the Notes had been available, it would have been highly important evidenceregarding the contents of the conversation.  The Notes having been destroyed and no one had any memory of any of the calls, the matterwas not pursued.</p>    <p><a name="p224" class="para" id="p224">224.</a>  Mr Wilson has referred us to paras. 41, 582, 599, 600 and 601 of the Reasons where the learned judge dealt with the destructionof the telephone recording and the Notes.  The learned judge summarised the submission as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â582. (7)  The first-hand listenerâs notes to the monitored phone calls were destroyed despite the requests by lawyers for D2and D3 to keep them.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p225" class="para" id="p225">225.</a>  But as the learned judge correctly pointed out in para. 600, the requests were for:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â600. â¦ the relevant mobile phone networks to preserve the calling records as they would prove the making of the calls by BeckyWong. â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p226" class="para" id="p226">226.</a>  The learned judge concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â601. The fact is that the relevant call records from the network providers are produced by consent.  I do not see any mala fidesin the destruction of the phone tapping records, nor am I handicapped in trying the case.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p227" class="para" id="p227">227.</a>  It is important to note that the intercept was in place for the Semtech investigation.  In that context, I do not believe the statementâsafe and no incidentâ would have been regarded as significant.  Since the Notes would not have been a verbatim transcript ofthe conversation, even if there was no mention of âsafe and soundâ in the Notes it would not follow that it had not been said. Indeed, there was an investigation report based on the Notes.  The learned judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â599. â¦ Mr Daniel So (PW72), Principal Investigator in charge of this case had seen the first hand listener's notes on the callbetween Becky Wong and D2 on 11 July before their destruction and compiled an investigation report on it.  It was said that the investigationreport did not mention safe and sound.  The report is not produced and I do not speculate on it.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>My understanding is that the investigation report had been provided to the defence, and they must have had good reason not to causethat to be produced.  I am willing to assume that the investigation report had not mentioned âsafe and soundâ but again it doesnot follow that Becky had not said it.  What is significant that the learned judge was sufficiently impressed with Beckyâs evidencethat he said he was not âhandicapped in trying the caseâ.</p>    <p><a name="p228" class="para" id="p228">228.</a>  The learned judge also found that there was no mala fides.  In the context it could only mean that he was of the view that it wasnot a case of deliberate destruction of evidence knowing it to be material.</p>    <p><a name="p229" class="para" id="p229">229.</a>  Ms Montgomery submitted that the learned judge should have regarded their destruction as</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â162. â¦ at least, a deliberate or grossly negligent interference with the rights of the defence and thus an abuse of process (whetheror not the decision was taken maliciously).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>She also submitted that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â163. In addition, whether or not the destruction justified a stay of the proceedings, the Judge was bound to recognise and remedythe prejudice caused to the defence in the trial process. The Judge had earlier described the evidence of the contents of the callas akin to a witness âpresent at the sceneâ</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">164.  The obvious and appropriate response that would have protected the interests of the defence would have been to infer or assumethat the tapes did not corroborate the claim by Becky that she told Mandy she was âå¹³å®ç¡äºâ or âsafe and no incident.âThis inference or assumption would have had two consequences. First it would have been important evidence to be deployed in analysingwhether there had here been any bad faith by the prosecution. Second the inference or assumption would have fundamentally underminedBecky as a witness.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p230" class="para" id="p230">230.</a>  But, as I have endeavoured to explain, in the circumstances, even if the Notes did not corroborate Beckyâs evidence, it did notmean that the learned judge might not otherwise accept Beckyâs evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p231" class="para" id="p231">231.</a>  I have taken into account Ms Montgomeryâs forceful submissions and hope I will be forgiven for not dealing with them at length. With respect, the learned judge dealt with the destruction of evidence issue carefully and fully in his Reasons and I do not believeit has been shown that he was wrong.</p>    <p class="heading">Presumption or inference as a remedy</p>    <p><a name="p232" class="para" id="p232">232.</a>  Ms Montgomery submitted that the learned judge should have applied the evidential presumption â<i>omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem</i>â (all things are presumed against the spoliator).  But at most, it meant presuming that the Notes did not record Becky saying toMandy that she was safe and sound.  But not that Mandy did not say it.  I cannot accept Ms Montgomeryâs submission that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â178. â¦ He was bound, both in accordance with the principles underlying the doctrine of spoilation and logic, as well as the ordinaryrequirements of fairness, to conclude that there was a significant and reasonable doubt as to whether Becky had ever said she wassafe and no incident. â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Conclusion on Charge 1</p>    <p><a name="p233" class="para" id="p233">233.</a>  I believe there was adequate evidence on which the learned judge could convict Mandy on the first charge.  I am unable to agreethat sufficient ground has been shown to entitle me to reject the learned judgeâs conclusion.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Charge 2: Perjury</u></p>    <p><a name="p234" class="para" id="p234">234.</a>  Here, the issue was whether Mandy had attempted to make an affirmation which was, to her knowledge or belief, false in a materialparticular.  The alleged matters of falsity are set out in paragraphs (a) - (c) of Charge 2 and there is one alleged omission.  Paragraph(a) was, however, not pursued by the prosecution.</p>    <p><a name="p235" class="para" id="p235">235.</a>  The learned judge found that the ICAC had not confiscated Beckyâs SIM card, that Becky had not said that she did not know whereshe was, that Becky did have close family members in Hong Kong and that Mandy had omitted to mention that Becky had told her shewas safe and sound. He also found that these statements/omission were false and that Mandy did not believe them to be true. He foundthat Mandy understood the contents of her affirmation as interpreted to her by Raymond Lam.</p>    <p><a name="p236" class="para" id="p236">236.</a>  Mr Caplan submitted that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 43</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Ordinance</a> required âcorroborationâ in the sense that a person could not be convicted:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ solely upon the evidence of one witness as to the falsity of any statement alleged to be falseâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>However, as the learned judge correctly held there were evidence from Beckyâs mother and elder sister that they lived in Hong Kong.

Mr Caplan submitted that it was incumbent on the prosecutionto prove that the statement(s) were false and that Mandy knew that they were false or did not believe them to be true. The prosecutionmust also prove that the statement(s), when viewed objectively, were material in the proceedings which is an issue to be decidedby the judge (<i>R v Millward</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=80%20Cr%20App%20R%20280" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">80 Cr App R 280).</a>  I am satisfied that the statements and omission are capable of influencing the tribunal (see Archbold Hong Kong 2007 paras. 30-80).</p>    <p><a name="p238" class="para" id="p238">238.</a>  Mr Caplan referred to <i>R v Davies</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%207%20SASR%20375" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] 7 SASR 375</a> where the Supreme Court of South Australia considered the meaning of âmaterialityâ in the offence of making a false declarationas contrasted with the offence of perjury. Bray CJ said in the context of perjury: âMaterial, I think, in this context must mean,not only relevant, but practically relevant. A statement of only remote or theoretical relevance might not be materialâ (at page377). Wells J said: âA fact, in my opinion, is material for the purposes of a charge of perjury when it is of such significanceand importance, having regard to the whole of the evidence, that it is capable of affecting the decision of the appropriate tribunalof fact on the factual issue or issues, and materiality should be given a corresponding meaningâ (at page 391).  A little later,Wells J said: âFor the purposes of a perjury charge, materiality must ultimately depend on the relationship between the impugnedevidence and the issues contested in the case in which that evidence was given, and the force and bearing that the one has upon theotherâ (at page 394).</p>    <p><a name="p239" class="para" id="p239">239.</a>  With respect, I am unable to agree that the learned judge has erred in any way.  I am happy to adopt the approach Mr Caplan commendedto me.  Mandyâs omission to mention that Becky had told her that she was âsafe and soundâ is clearly material, as the learnedjudge said that would have undermined Mandyâs professed belief that Becky was detained against her will.  Although I agree withMr Caplan that the absence of close family members in Hong Kong was not a condition for Mandyâs locus standi, it is common sensethat if Becky did have close family members in Hong Kong, they would be expected to come forward if Becky had been detained againsther will.  If Becky was being detained against her will, the court would want to know why her family was not making or supportingthe application.  As for the confiscation of Beckyâs SIM Card, that went to the question whether she was free to do what she pleasedwhich materially supported the case that she was detained against her will.</p>    <p><a name="p240" class="para" id="p240">240.</a>  In the circumstances, I cannot agree that the conviction on charge 2 is wrong.</p>    <p class="heading">Derek, the 1<sup>st</sup> applicant</p>    <p><a name="p241" class="para" id="p241">241.</a>  As noted, the 1<sup>st</sup> applicant has absconded.

The arguments were developed principallyby Mr Jonathan Caplan, QC for the 2<sup>nd</sup> applicant (Mandy) and Ms Clare Montgomery, QC for the 3<sup>rd</sup> applicant (Lam).</p>    <p><a name="p246" class="para" id="p246">246.</a>  Ms Montgomery highlighted the following statement made by the prosecution in opening the trial : </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThis case arises from a deliberate, determined and fairly prolonged attempt to gain access to a potential prosecution witness inorder to ascertain whether she had co-operated with a law enforcement agency, if so, to ascertain what she may have said and to tryto influence her against giving any or any further co-operation.  It is the prosecutionâs case that all four of these defendantswere party to the attempt, together with the witness Frankie Chung, who is PW2, in different capacities, and their agreement constitutedthe Common Law offence of conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice which is the 1st charge.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p247" class="para" id="p247">247.</a>  It was submitted that this statement, which confirmed or summarized Charge 1 as drafted, disclosed no offence known to law.  Essentially,the submission was to the effect that the four pleaded particulars in the Charge merely went to attempts to gain access to Becky. Gaining access to a potential witness was not illegal and could not be said to be an act that would pervert the course of justice. This was premised on the point which Tang VP has already discussed at length, namely, that there is no property in a witness.  Asfar as it goes, this proposition must be right.  However, as Mr Martin Wilson, QC (for the prosecution) has argued, this was notthe effect of Charge 1 at all.  Here, it becomes necessary to deal first with the ingredients of a conspiracy and secondly, of theoffence of perverting the course of public justice.</p>    <p><a name="p248" class="para" id="p248">248.</a>  The essence of a conspiracy is of course the agreement to perform an illegal act (in the present case, to pervert the course ofpublic justice).  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s159a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 159A</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/200">Cap. 200</a> confirms this.</p>    <p><a name="p249" class="para" id="p249">249.</a>  Where direct evidence of the relevant agreement is not available (and this is so in most cases involving a charge of conspiracy),the usual way of establishing the agreement is by way of drawing inferences from overt acts : - see <i>Archbold Hong Kong 2009</i> at paragraph 36-11.</p>    <p><a name="p250" class="para" id="p250">250.</a>  Though it is often said that overt acts need not be spelt out (see <i>Archbold</i> at paragraph 36-41), the particulars of the principal overt act or acts are often set out in an indictment (or ordered to be provided)so as to make clear just what is the conspiracy alleged : see <i>Archbold</i> at paragraph 36-44.  The underlying principle is that the accused and the trial court are entitled to know on the face of the indictmentthe true nature of the prosecutionâs case : see <i>The Queen v Chan Kang To</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20HKLRD%20412" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] HKLRD 412</a>, at 416B (referring to <i>R v Landy</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%2072%20Cr%20App%20R%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 72 Cr App R 237</a>, at 244).</p>    <p><a name="p251" class="para" id="p251">251.</a>  Since the purpose of setting out overt acts is really just to make clear the nature of the case alleged against an accused, it followsthat the pleaded particulars do not necessarily constitute essential ingredients of the offence : - see <i>R v Hancock</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%202%20Cr%20App%20R%20554" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 2 Cr App R 554</a>, at 559-60.  As stated above, the essence of a conspiracy is the agreement to perform an illegal act.</p>    <p><a name="p252" class="para" id="p252">252.</a>  Before analyzing the charge in the present case, I should discuss the ingredients of the offence of perverting the course of publicjustice and particularly in the context of seeking access to actual or potential witnesses.</p>    <p><a name="p253" class="para" id="p253">253.</a>  As Tang VP has stated, the starting point must be that there is no property in a witness.  It follows from this that merely seekingaccess to a witness in criminal proceedings (whether actual or contemplated) will not <i>by itself</i> amount to the offence of perverting the course of public justice.  Asking a witness to reconsider assisting the authorities or givingevidence may not <i>necessarily</i> amount to an offence.  Much depends on the actual circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p254" class="para" id="p254">254.</a>  The gist of the offence of perverting the course of public justice is, in broad terms, conduct which is intended to lead to a miscarriageof justice :  see <i>R v Machin</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20WLR%20763" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 WLR 763</a>, at 766H, 767B.</p>    <p><a name="p255" class="para" id="p255">255.</a>  In the context of approaches made to witnesses, an attempt to dissuade a person who otherwise intends to give evidence from so doing,(in the sense of stifling that evidence being given) and thereby obstructing what otherwise would be the course of justice, can amountto perverting the course of public justice.  But where is the line to be drawn?  The following represents what I understand to bethe law in this area : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  It is far too wide to say that <i>any</i> interference will amount to a perversion or an attempt to pervert.  See <i>R v Kellett</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%201%20QB%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 1 QB 372</a>, where at 386G-H, it was said : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â First, we do not consider it fortuitous that there is no case in the books, as far as we know, which supports the extreme viewindicated by some of the textbook statements that <i>any</i> interference with a witness is an attempt to pervert the course of justice.  That would make a man guilty of this offence if he wentprivately to a witness who had made a false statement and by reasoned argument supported by material facts and documents tried todissuade him from committing perjury and to persuade him to retract lies and tell the truth.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)  Where the objective of the interference with a witness is proper but the means employed are not (for example, threats or bribery),the offence is made out.  Thus, for example, where a person seeks to persuade another person not to put forward a particular versionof events to the police because he regards it as untrue (an acceptable objective) but uses unlawful or improper means to do so, hewill be guilty of the offence.  In <i>Kellett</i>, at 392F-G, Stephenson LJ said this : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSir Peter Rawlinson for the Crown, while asking us to approve both directions, as we understood him, submitted that the prosecutionhad to prove (1) interference with the witnesses, (2) on such a scale as to pervert the course of justice, (3) with that purpose,that is with the intention to make the witnesses do what they would not otherwise have done.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">We understand (1) and (3) to mean that there must be an attempt to make the witnesses do what they would not otherwise have done,with that intention, whatever the means used; but we are not sure what (2) added to the ingredients of the offence.  We have alreadygiven our opinion that some means of attempting to influence witnesses are outside the limits of this particular offence.  But subjectto the qualification that the means must be unlawful or improper, such as force or a threat of force, a reward or the promise ofa reward, we accept his general submission that an intentional interference with a witness is enough.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)  The reference in the quoted passage to âlawful or improperâ means that, in any given case, the actual acts must be lookedat in context to see which side of the line they fall.  The matter is put thus in <i>Kellett</i> at 392G-393B : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThere may be cases of interference with a witness in which it would be for the jury to decide whether what was done or said tothe witness amounted to improper pressure, and so wrongfully interfered with the witness and attempted to pervert the course of justice,and it would be not only unnecessary and unhelpful but wrong for this court or the trial judge to usurp their function.  The decisionwill depend on all the circumstances of the case, including not merely the method of interfering, but the time when it is done, therelationship between the person interfering and the witness and the nature of the proceedings in which the evidence is being given. Pressure which may be permissible at one stage of the particular proceedings may be improper at another.  What may be proper fora friend or relation or a legal adviser may be oppressive and improper coming from a person in a position of influence or authority. But it is for the judge to direct the jury that some means of inducement are improper and if proved make the defendant guilty, andthis was such a case.  A jury should be directed that a threat (or promise) made to a witness is, like an assault on a witness, anattempt to pervert the course of justice, if made with the intention of persuading him to alter or withhold his evidence, whetheror not what he threatens (or promises) is a lawful act, such as the exercise of a legal right, and whether or not he has any otherintention or intends to do the act if the evidence is not altered or withheld.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)  Ms Montgomery relied on the following passage in the joint judgment of Brennan J, Toohey J and McHugh J in the decision of theHigh Court of Australia in <i>Meissner v The Queen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%2d1995%29%20184%20CLR%20132" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994-1995) 184 CLR 132</a>, at 143 : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt will often be difficult to determine whether conduct that falls short of intimidation but which has the tendency to induce anaccused to plead guilty is improper conduct that interferes with the accusedâs free choice to plead guilty or not guilty.  Argumentsor advice that merely seeks to persuade the accused to plead guilty is not improper conduct for this purpose, no matter how stronglythe argument or advice is put.  Reasoned argument or advice does not involve the use of improper means and does not have the tendencyto prevent the accused from making a free and voluntary choice concerning his or her plea to the charge.  As long as the argumentor advice does not constitute harassment or other improper pressure and leaves the accused free to make the choice, no interferencewith the administration of justice occurs.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(5)  This passage, in my judgment, is consistent with that part of the judgment in <i>Kellett</i> just quoted, in that a determination of whether in any given case, pressure or conduct can be said to be improper is entirely dependenton the context.  This was reinforced in another passage in the judgment, this time of Deane J at 148-9 : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe proper administration of criminal justice is, to no small extent, dependent upon the ability of courts to proceed on the basisthat a plea of guilty or not guilty, with all that it entails, is made by an accused in the exercise of his or her own free choice. To endeavour, by intimidation, inducement or other means, to overbear the free choice of a person to plead not guilty and therebybring about a tainted plea of guilty is clearly to attempt to pervert the course of justice in the sense of attempting adverselyto interfere with the proper administration of justice.  And that is so even in a case where the person whose free will is soughtto be overborne is, or is thought to be, guilty.  Obviously, in such a case, circumstances may arise in which the borderline betweenwhat constitutes legitimate persuasion of an accused person to plead guilty and what constitutes the offence of attempting to pervertthe course of justice will be difficult to discern.  When those circumstances arise, the relationship between the parties and anoverall perception of real criminality are likely to be of particular significance.  Thus, for example, a degree of pressure whichwould be quite legitimate if exerted by an accusedâs own lawyer acting solely in the accusedâs interests may be completely unacceptableif exerted by a stranger acting for a collateral and selfish purpose of his or her own.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(6)  Of course, in any case where the objective of the approach to a witness is improper (such as to persuade the witness to do theopposite of what he or she intended to do or say), it will be in practice easier to prove that the means employed were improper. <i>R v Toney</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20WLR%20364" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 WLR 364</a>, a case that was dealt with at some length before us, seems to take this further in that it is authority for the proposition thatthe offence is established where it is shown the objective is improper; it will not be necessary for the prosecution to demonstratethat the means employed were also unlawful : - see 368A-C, 370A-D.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(7)  As <i>Kellett</i> makes clear, the gravamen of the offence where approaches to witnesses are concerned, lies in the attempt to make the witness door say what he or she would not otherwise have done or said.  Where a witness is involved or may be involved in proceedings, be theycivil or criminal, such interference is likely to result in the possibility of a miscarriage of justice.  In the context of proceedingsbefore a court or tribunal, such interference impairs the capacity to do justice, by denying the court or tribunal the knowledgeof the true circumstances of a case : - see the decision of the High Court of Australia in <i>R v Rogerson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20107%20ALR%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 107 ALR 225</a>, at 230 : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âJustice, as the law understands it, consists in the enjoyment of rights and the suffering of liabilities by persons who are subjectto the law to an extent and in a manner which accords with the law applicable to the actual circumstances of the case.  The courseof justice consists in the due exercise by a court or competent judicial authority of its jurisdiction to enforce, adjust or declarethe rights and liabilities of persons subject to the law in accordance with the law and the actual circumstances of the case.  Thecourse of justice is perverted (or obstructed) by impairing (or preventing the exercise of) the capacity of a court or competentjudicial authority to do justice.  The ways in which a court or competent judicial authority may be impaired in (or prevented fromexercising) its capacity to do justice are various.  Those ways comprehend, in our opinion, erosion of the integrity of the courtor competent judicial authority, hindering of access to it, deflecting applications that would be made to it, denying it knowledgeof the relevant law or of the true circumstances of the case and impeding the free exercise of its jurisdiction and powers includingthe powers of executing its decisions.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p256" class="para" id="p256">256.</a>  The <i>actus reus</i> of the offence of perverting the course of public justice consists of any act that has the tendency to impair the capacity to dojustice : - see <i>Rogerson</i> at 230.  The <i>mens rea</i> is the intent to pervert the course of justice by an act that has the said tendency : - see <i>Rogerson</i> at 231.</p>    <p><a name="p257" class="para" id="p257">257.</a>  As to the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence of conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice, this consists of the agreement to do an act having the tendencyto impair the capacity to do justice : - see <i>Rogerson</i> at 231.</p>    <p><a name="p258" class="para" id="p258">258.</a>  The <i>mens rea</i> of the offence of conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice is proved by showing that the alleged conspirators intendedthat if the relevant act was done in the circumstances contemplated, it would have the effect of perverting the course of justice: - see <i>Rogerson</i> at 231.  As to the proof of this element, the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J and Toohey J in <i>Rogerson</i> at 232 represents the law : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âOf course, where there is an agreement to do an act that has a manifest tendency to pervert the course of justice, proof of anagreement to do the act may suffice to prove the intent thereby to pervert the course of justice.  But, if the act to be done isof such a nature that its tendency to pervert the course of justice is not manifest, proof of an agreement that the act be done doesnot, without more, amount to proof of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice: in such a case, there has to be proof of anintent to do an act that will have the effect of perverting the course of justice.  The state of an alleged conspiratorâs knowledgeof the nature of the relevant act is of critical importance.  An act which is not known to have the tendency or is not intended tohave the effect of perverting the course of justice is not an act the doing of which attracts a liability to punishment as for anattempt to pervert, or a perverting of, the course of justice.  An agreement that such an act be done made among persons who do notknow that the act has such a tendency and who do not intend it to have that effect is not a conspiracy to do an unlawful act.  Toestablish a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, it is necessary to prove an agreement to do an act which the conspiratorseither know will have a manifest tendency to pervert the course of justice or which the conspirators intend to have such an effect. In this context, knowledge and intent relate to the acts and circumstances contemplated by the conspirators; the legal complexionof those acts and circumstances is a question of law.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p259" class="para" id="p259">259.</a>  I should for completeness just point out that the offence of perverting the course of public justice is not restricted to the situationwhere curial proceedings are actually in existence.  While admittedly the term âthe course of justiceâ does refer to curial proceedings,the offence can be committed even at the police investigation stage when criminal proceedings are imminent, probable or possible. In the judgment of Mason CJ in <i>Rogerson</i> at 228, he said this : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ The fact that police investigation stands outside the concept of the course of justice does not mean that, in appropriate circumstances,interference with a police investigation does not constitute an attempt or a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.</p>        <p class="quote">It is well established at common law and under cognate statutory provisions that the offence of attempting or conspiring to pervertthe course of justice at a time when no curial proceedings are on foot can be committed.  That is because action taken before curialor tribunal proceedings commence may have a tendency and be intended to frustrate or deflect the course of curial or tribunal proceedingswhich are imminent, probable or even possible.  In other words, it is enough that an act has a tendency to frustrate or deflect aprosecution or disciplinary proceeding before a judicial tribunal which the accused contemplates may possibly be instituted, eventhough the possibility of instituting that prosecution or disciplinary proceeding has not been considered by the police or the relevantlaw enforcement agency.  So, in <i>Kalick v R</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281920%29%2055%20DLR%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1920) 55 DLR 104</a>, at 109, it did not matter whether the police officer intended to institute a prosecution; it was sufficient that, being apprehensiveof a prosecution, the accused gave a bribe to prevent it.  Action taken to prevent the institution of a prosecution is as much aninterference with, or impairment of, the administration of justice as action taken to obstruct the conduct of a prosecution afterit has been commenced.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p260" class="para" id="p260">260.</a>  With the above principles in mind, I move on to an analysis of Charge 1.  In my judgment, the Charge is adequately drafted and cannotbe impugned in the way submitted by the applicants : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  The gist of the alleged conspiracy in this Charge against the applicants was the agreement to do a series of acts that had tendencyto âobstruct and hinder the investigation and possible proceedingsâ in relation to the 1<sup>st</sup> applicant (Derek), in that access would be sought to be gained to Becky for the purposes of finding out what she had said to theICAC, and to influence her against providing assistance or information to the ICAC.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)  The series of acts are particularized in the Charge, there being four, these being the overt acts of the alleged conspiracy.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)  These particulars define the true nature of the conspiracy that is alleged against the applicants.  The references to (a) thefalsity of the representations to the ICAC to the effect that certain persons represented Becky when they did not; (b) the institutionof <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings when, to the applicantsâ knowledge or belief, Becky was not unlawfully detained and did not want release from ICACcustody; (c) the use of false and misleading information and (d) the dissemination of information falsely alleging that Becky Wongwas being unlawfully detained, all clearly point to the conspiracy as essentially an attempt to gain access to Becky with a viewto influence her not to co-operate any further with the ICAC.  The falsities alleged add a sinister element to the conspiracy : itis tolerably clear that there is an element of intimidation here; certainly, an attempt to influence Becky not to do something thatshe otherwise intended to do.  This reference to falsities is important for another reason : the knowledge on the part of the allegedconspirators that Becky was not unlawfully detained and did not want release from ICAC custody.  The judge regarded this aspect asintegral to the charge.  For my part, I agree.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)  Seen in this light, the objective of the conspiracy was an improper one.  The methods that were employed to achieve this purposewere also, in my view, improper in the circumstances. Mr Caplan and Ms Montgomery both submitted forcefully that the acts pleadedin the particulars were not by themselves improper acts in any way.  This is correct if one takes the acts out of their pleaded context. However, in context and particularly given the falsity alleged and the sinister element identified above, they clearly were.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(5)  I should perhaps also just add (this is relevant to the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings) that where proceedings are brought for an improper purpose, they constitute an abuse of process : - see the decisionof the High Court of Australia in <i>Williams v Spautz</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%2d1992%29%20174%20CLR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991-1992) 174 CLR 509.</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The 3<sup>rd</sup> applicant</p>    <p><a name="p261" class="para" id="p261">261.</a>  Before dealing with the position of Lam in detail, it is useful to take a step back to see exactly what had actually happened inthe present case.  The following observations are pertinent here : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  The evidence clearly demonstrates that at no stage did Becky, a person who was assisting the ICAC with their investigations andwho eventually joined the WPP, request any assistance from anyone regarding her release, nor had she given any indication at allthat she was being held against her will.  The most that could be said was that when she spoke with Mandy on one occasion, her voicewas faint or trembling, and she could have sent misleading signals, but this is very far short of evidence to demonstrate that shewas in need of assistance or that she was being held involuntarily.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)  Becky was of course clearly a crucial witness as far as Derek was concerned.  She was his secretary and was in a position togive crucial evidence against him.  Derek knew this from the very start.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)  And yet, quite extraordinary steps were taken to gain access to Becky : the two visits to the ICAC on 13 and 14 July 2004; theinstitution and prosecution of the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings, and the deliberate and extensive involvement of the media.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)  As I have highlighted, Becky eventually became a protected person under the WPP.  Yet, by reason of the steps taken to gain accessto her (and in the circumstances, they were done in a very public way), her identity was revealed to the world at large.  The newspaperreports of the relevant events demonstrate this.  The report of Sing Tao Daily on 14 July 2004 makes reference to Becky and her role,although she was not named.  The reports in the SCMP on 16 July and 17 July not only named Becky, but gave details of her role andthe fact she was in the WPP.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(5)  It is also to be noted that Becky was a fragile witness.  The evidence before the court revealed that when the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings were afoot, she even had second thoughts about whether to continue with her co-operation.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p262" class="para" id="p262">262.</a>  Lamâs role has already been briefly outlined in Tang VPâs judgment.  He was Derekâs lawyer.  In the afternoon of 13 July 2004,Derek and William Lau (the manager of Semtech, the company that was the subject of the criminal investigations) were seen to go intothe offices of Lam to see him.  They were later joined by Mandy at about 5:39 pm.  At 5:59 pm, Derek, Mandy, Lam and William Lauwere seen going to the offices of Massie &amp; Clement.</p>    <p><a name="p263" class="para" id="p263">263.</a>  What then took place in Massie &amp; Clementâs office when the four persons just mentioned met Richard Clement (a partner of Massie&amp; Clement), is of some importance.  Clement said in evidence that Lam referred Mandy to his firm to represent her interests because(according to Lam) there was a conflict of interest.  This was the way the evidence was elicited from Clement in his cross-examinationat trial : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ.    There was a mention, was there not, by Mr Lam when he brought these people to you the reason why he was bringing them toyou was that there was a possible conflict of interest?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.           Absolutely.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.            And did you think at any stage throughout that week your firm was being used as â I quote with the phrase â âcordonsanitaireâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.     It never occurred to me at all, no.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.     You never felt that you were being used in that way.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.     No, no.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.     And you would have regarded yourself and your firm as acting totally independently from any other law firm when you were actingfor Mandy Chui.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.     Oh, absolutely, yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.     And perhaps would be offended if it was suggested that you were somehow under the influence of some other law firm, whetherC.K. Mok or Andrew Lam or ...</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.     I think that would be a very fair comment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.     Pardon?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.     It would be a very fair comment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.     Yes.  And you were throughout, acting, as you thought, properly in the interest of your client who was Mandy.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.     Absolutely, yes.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p264" class="para" id="p264">264.</a>  In my judgment, this was a critical piece of evidence.  It has been suggested on Lamâs behalf by Ms Montgomery that his statementwas entirely reasonable and that there was a potential conflict of interest between Derek and Mandy.  With respect, this is extremelydifficult to accept : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  At that time, Mandy had already spoken to Becky.  In the telephone conversation that had taken place at about lunchtime on 11July, Becky had said to Mandy that she was âsafe and soundâ (or âsafe and no incidentâ).  This was repeated in the telephoneconversation that took place in the morning of 12 July.  Another telephone conversation followed this one during which Becky askedMandy to apologize to Derek.  These conversations are referred to in paragraphs 22 and 32 of Tang VPâs judgment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)  If, which was the position adopted by all the applicants (but contrary to the evidence given by Becky), Becky was indeed heldagainst her will and therefore needed assistance, it is difficult to see where any conflict of interest lay as far as Lam was concerned. In such a situation, both Derek and Mandyâs interests in securing Beckyâs release were exactly the same.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)  If, as was advanced to us as a possible reason for the attempts to gain access to Becky, the intention was only to ask Beckyto reconsider her continuing to co-operate with the ICAC, again there was no conflict of interest.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p265" class="para" id="p265">265.</a>  The premise therefore in Lam not agreeing to act for Mandy (as well as Derek) was non-existent.</p>    <p><a name="p266" class="para" id="p266">266.</a>  Yet, despite this assertion of a conflict of interest, Lam became involved in almost every aspect of the very matter on which Mandywas instructing Massie &amp; Clement, namely, seeking to gain access to Becky : first, by the two visits to the ICAC by Egan andsubsequently, by the institution and prosecution of the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings.  In other words, quite inexplicably, Lam embarked on a series of conduct that not only demonstrated that all that hehad said about the existence of a conflict of interest was simply untrue as a reason, but also that he did the exact opposite ofwhat was apparently intended.</p>    <p><a name="p267" class="para" id="p267">267.</a>  In the Reasons, the Judge emphasized this aspect : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAs to the case against D3, he started to act for D1 on 13 July on the file record.  D1 and D3 met at D3âs office in the afternoonof 13 July, where D2 was called to join in before the party went to Massie &amp; Clement.  From experience, D3 must have realizedthe possibility of Becky Wong being persuaded to co-operate with the ICAC.  Mr Clement said D3 introduced D2 to Massie &amp; Clementbecause of possible conflict of interests.  But if D3 really believed in the instructions that Becky Wong was illegally detainedby the ICAC and she wanted to get out, with all the proper disclosures, there could hardly be any conflict of interests.  It is notedthat D3 spoke freely to Mrs Reimer Lau that he acted for the director of Semtech and he planned the habeas corpus to save the secretaryfrom the abuse by the ICAC.  Of course, the truth of D3âs statement to Mrs Reimer Lau on his belief of abuse by the ICAC remainsto be assessed <i>qua</i> jury function.  But it shows that D3 saw nothing wrong in so telling Mrs Reimer Lau.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This was said in the course of the Judgeâs reasons for rejecting the submissions that had been made that there was no case to answer. These reasons were applicable when the Judge came to consider his final verdict.</p>    <p><a name="p268" class="para" id="p268">268.</a>  The involvement of Lam in almost every aspect of the attempts to gain access to Becky is clearly shown by the evidence as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p269" class="para" id="p269">269.</a>  After the initial meeting in the afternoon of 13 July, eventually Derek and Lam went to the FCC where they met Egan.  At 6:51 pm,Egan telephoned Clement to indicate that Lam was agitated about the way Clement intended to deal with the ICAC in attempting to gainaccess to Becky.  Whether or not Lam was agitated is unimportant : the fact his name was referred to gives rise to the inferencethat he was involved in a matter that, in theory, only concerned Mandy (that is, seeking to gain access to Becky).</p>    <p><a name="p270" class="para" id="p270">270.</a>  Egan was ostensibly instructed by Massie &amp; Clement in the ICAC visits on 13 July in trying to gain access to Becky (see paragraph266 above).  However, Lam spoke to Egan at least three times during this visit (the calls were recorded at 7:45 pm, 7:51 pm and 7:56pm).  There were further telephone conversations at 9:06 pm and 9:21 pm.</p>    <p><a name="p271" class="para" id="p271">271.</a>  The next morning (on 14 July), before Egan went to the ICAC for the second visit, he spoke twice with Lam on the phone, the telephoneconversations were recorded at 9:17 am and 11:01 am.</p>    <p><a name="p272" class="para" id="p272">272.</a>  The same day, after the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings had concluded before Yam J, Lam and Egan spoke on the phone : at 5:58 pm, 6:24 pm and 6:30 pm.</p>    <p><a name="p273" class="para" id="p273">273.</a>  On 15 July, at 12:57 pm (after the hearing before Yam J that day), Egan spoke to Derek (who, it will be remembered, was not hisclient, but Lamâs) mentioning Lam.  At 1:01 pm, Lam and Egan spoke.  That afternoon, when the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings were before Hartmann J, they spoke again at 6:26 pm.</p>    <p><a name="p274" class="para" id="p274">274.</a>  On 16 July, after Hartmann J had delivered his ruling, Lam spoke with Egan on the telephone at 6:26 pm.  Prior to this, Lam hadcalled Egan five times.</p>    <p><a name="p275" class="para" id="p275">275.</a>  It must be borne in mind that at no stage was Egan officially retained by Lam for Derek.  He was at all material times retainedonly on behalf of Mandy.  And yet, as the Judge observed, Lam was engaged in âheavy telephone trafficâ with Egan.</p>    <p><a name="p276" class="para" id="p276">276.</a>  Another feature of Lamâs substantial involvement during the time of the said attempts to gain access to Becky were his communicationswith the press.  The Judge was of the view that Derek and Lam agreed to involve the press in carrying out the conspiracy allegedunder the 1st Charge.  In paragraph 633 of the Reasons for Verdict, the Judge said this : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI have found that D1 did tell Frankie Chung that D3 was going to arrange for a press conference for D1 and that made him happy. Although there was no press conference during the period of the conspiracy, the press was certainly involved resulting in the SingTao article reporting that Becky was illegally detained.  As I have found D3 and D4 not guilty on the 3rd Charge, I ignore the SCMParticle as an effort in involving the press by D3.  I find that D1 and D3 did agree to involve the press in carrying out the objectof the conspiracy in the 1st Charge.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p277" class="para" id="p277">277.</a>  On 13 July, subsequent to the first ICAC visit by Egan, Lam spoke with Carmen Hsu (of the Sing Tao Daily) at 9:36 pm.  At aboutthis time, she was also talking on the phone with Egan.</p>    <p><a name="p278" class="para" id="p278">278.</a>  The next day, Sing Tao Daily published the story that Becky (though not named) was allegedly being held against her will.  At 9:14am, Lam spoke with Ms Hsu.  He did so again at 6:24 pm that day.</p>    <p><a name="p279" class="para" id="p279">279.</a>  On 15 July, in the course of the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings, Lam again spoke with Ms Hsu : at 11:11 am, 2:12 pm, 4:05 pm; there were three calls between 5:09 pm and 6:25 pm, 7:07pm and 8:30 pm.</p>    <p><a name="p280" class="para" id="p280">280.</a>  On 16 July, Lam spoke with Ms Hsu at 3:05 pm and 3:08 pm.  Sometime after 6:00 pm, Lam called Ms Hsu four times and she had calledhim three times.</p>    <p><a name="p281" class="para" id="p281">281.</a>  In the afternoon of 16 July, Lam had also spoken with the reporter from the South China Morning Post, Magdalene Chow.</p>    <p><a name="p282" class="para" id="p282">282.</a>  In my judgment, the above matters (all of which were referred to by the Judge) clearly demonstrated the pivotal role played by Lamin relation to the attempts to gain access to Becky.  And yet, as I have pointed out, he attempted, under the guise of an assertedconflict of interest, to appear not to be involved.  It will be noted that in the documents filed in the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings and during counselâs submissions in those proceedings, no reference was made at all to any link between the personmaking the application (Mandy) and Derek.  The involvement of Lam was of course not apparent either.</p>    <p><a name="p283" class="para" id="p283">283.</a>  The irresistible inference was that drawn by the Judge, that Lam had planned the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings (at least he was heavily involved in it).  The term used by the Judge was that he was âcalling the shots behind thescenesâ.</p>    <p><a name="p284" class="para" id="p284">284.</a>  The Judge was also of the view that Lam must have known that Becky was not illegally detained by the ICAC.  There is admittedlyno direct evidence of this but in my view, this inference is similarly irresistible.  The attempt to disguise his heavy involvementin the attempts to gain access to Becky was, in my view, highly suggestive of an attempt to disguise from the ICAC, and later thecourt, the involvement of the very person who was the subject matter of the ICAC investigation, Derek.</p>    <p><a name="p285" class="para" id="p285">285.</a>  It is to be remembered that Becky was probably at that stage the main witness against Derek; certainly an important one at the veryleast.  All this, coupled with the fact that, apart from what Mandy had asserted, there was no evidence whatsoever that Becky wasbeing held against her will, gave rise to the inference that Lam knew the true position.</p>    <p><a name="p286" class="para" id="p286">286.</a>  I do not ignore the fact that the Judge relied on the evidence of Nattrass and what has been referred to as the Grissini lunch. For my part, I do not place too much importance on these two aspects.  The significance of the evidence in relation to them canbe seen from the following.</p>    <p><a name="p287" class="para" id="p287">287.</a>  As regards the Grissini lunch (which took place on 15 July between Lam, Mrs Mary Jean Reimer Lau (formerly an assistant solicitorin Lamâs firm) and Mr Martin Yeung (Lamâs former trainee solicitor)), discussions took place about the Semtech case.</p>    <p><a name="p288" class="para" id="p288">288.</a>  The relevant points of this evidence were summarized by the Judge as follows : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMrs Reimer Lau said D3 said he had planned the action of habeas corpus to help Becky Wong, and he was making the application. D3 said he was confident that the application would be successful.  D3 said he would switch on all the machines against the ICAC.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">According to Mr Yeung, they chatted about recent work.  D3 said he recently accepted a case.  Mr Yeung asked whether it was the TungChung River case and D3 said no, it was the Semtech case.  D3 said the ICAC was in the wrong in getting hold of the girl surnamedWong.  It was not the first time and it was like the previous case of Angela Gong, and luckily, Angela Gong had lots of friends andhe was able to rescue her.  The girl surnamed Wong was not as lucky because she did not have any relative or friend in Hong Kong,and the ICAC liked to choose this kind of people as their target.  D3 said it was false imprisonment and a report had to be madeto the police.  It was mentioned that an application for <i>habeas corpus</i> had to be made.  D3 said with âourâ <i>habeas corpus</i>, the ICAC would have a lot of trouble that evening as it would be urgent to brainwash the girl.  D3 said if this time the mattercould not be fixed, âI would switch on all the machines against the ICAC.ââ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p289" class="para" id="p289">289.</a>  The significance of this evidence lay in the extensive involvement of Lam, particularly in the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings (which Lam said he had planned), notwithstanding his alleged conflict of interest.  The reference to switching on âallthe machinesâ against the ICAC involved the use of the press to which I have also alluded (the Judge at paragraph 632 of the Reasonsfor Verdict said Lam used Ms Carmen Hsu as âpart of the machines at his disposalâ).  All this was, however, the effect of theevidence to which I have already referred.  The Grissini lunch therefore, in my view, merely corroborated this.</p>    <p><a name="p290" class="para" id="p290">290.</a>  As regards the evidence of Nattrass, the only importance of this in my view was the further corroboration of the role of Lam (asto which there was other evidence as I have said).</p>    <p><a name="p291" class="para" id="p291">291.</a>  I appreciate that Tang VP has carefully analyzed the Judgeâs reasons for accepting the evidence on Nattrass and he has found thisunconvincing.  For my part, I am satisfied that the Judge had carefully analyzed Nattrassâs credibility in the Reasons for Verdict,having heard his evidence first hand.  I am not satisfied that this is an appropriate case for this court to overturn the Judgeâsviews on the credibility of a witness, particularly in areas clearly of primary fact.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Wright J :</b></p>    <p><a name="p292" class="para" id="p292">292.</a>  I have had the opportunity of reading, in draft, the judgments of the Chief High Court Judge and the Vice President.  For the convenienceof the reader, I shall adopt the same descriptions as have already been used.</p>    <p><a name="p293" class="para" id="p293">293.</a>  I propose to deal with the position of each applicant in turn: insofar as Egan, the fourth applicant, is concerned I shall dealwith, together, as a matter of convenience, his application for leave to appeal conviction on the 4th and 5th charges as well asthe Application for Review in respect of his acquittal on the 1st charge.</p>    <p><a name="p294" class="para" id="p294">294.</a>  In an attempt to limit the length of my judgment I shall avoid repeating, so far as practically possible, the evidence, findingsof fact and extracts from the judge's Reasons which have already been set out in the other judgments but shall supplement them asand when it is necessary to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p295" class="para" id="p295">295.</a>  It is important to remember that the applicants were tried by a professional judge sitting alone. Just what is to be expected ofreasons for verdict must vary from case to case: the Reasons ran to 173 pages following a trial which lasted for 50 days.  They havebeen attacked from almost every possible angle.  I accept that some of the criticism is justified but, looked at in the round andnot scrutinised phrase by phrase, dissected line by line, subjected to criticism concerning grammar and verb tenses, the bones arethere: they may well have benefited from the addition of a little more flesh in certain areas but there is a necessity to guard againstover emphasis of form at the expense of the attainment of justice (and see Â§382 below).  And the bones are there for the fundamentalreason that the evidence was there, that justified the judge making the factual findings he did.</p>    <p><a name="p296" class="para" id="p296">296.</a>  This matter was largely fact-based and depended on the drawing of inferences: there were few issues of law which required decisionby the judge, although that may not be how it appears from the arguments before us. With one exception, the judge was correct onthe law, too. The point upon which the judge erred led to the acquittal of Egan.</p>    <p class="heading">CACC248/2006: the first applicant, Derek</p>    <p><a name="p297" class="para" id="p297">297.</a>  I agree with both the Chief Judge and the Vice President that this application for leave to appeal should be dismissed.  No argumentswere advanced by or on behalf of Derek at the hearing of the appeal as there was no appearance, he having absconded after being grantedbail.</p>    <p><a name="p298" class="para" id="p298">298.</a>  In essence, the judge found that it was Derek who set the whole process in motion.  Becky, his secretary, whom he believed, withjustification, knew where the skeletons were hidden, had been arrested on the same day as he, Friday 9 July 2004. She remained inthe presence of the ICAC: he was anxious that the potential damage which she could do to him be neutralised.</p>    <p><a name="p299" class="para" id="p299">299.</a>  Beckyâs state of mind concerning Derek, and others, was described by the judge in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â33. Becky Wong said before she was released on bail, she had expressed fear for her safety.  She said that she had named bankers,financial analysts and wealthy people in her non-prejudicial statements and she feared that they might resort to unlawful means involvingthe triad society against her.  Also, [Derek] was a tempered person, mostly with Mandy and on rare occasions with his business associates. [Derek] once showed her a foreign passport and said that he could get one easily, and she feared [Derek] might send her away.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p300" class="para" id="p300">300.</a>  Derekâs level of involvement and anxiety is apparent from a brief look at the evidence: this evidence is relevant also to Mandyâsapplication as it demonstrates her role as being a willing participant in the steps taken to obtain access to Becky.</p>    <p><a name="p301" class="para" id="p301">301.</a>  Derek was released on bail on Sunday 11 July 2004.  Soon after his release, Derek went to the office of Frankie Chung, a solicitor'sclerk of CK Mok &amp; Co, who had been engaged by Derek's wife to visit Derek and secure his release on bail.  Derek told FrankieChung that he was "very worried" about Becky and William Lau.  Frankie Chung rejected Derek's request to go to see Becky and WilliamLau but said he would arrange another solicitor to do so.  At around the same time Derek made a telephone call to Becky: when shesaw the identity of the caller she switched off her telephone without answering the call as, by then, she was cooperating with theICAC and in the company of ICAC officers: she testified that she was embarrassed by his call.</p>    <p><a name="p302" class="para" id="p302">302.</a>  The following day, Monday 12 July 2004, Derek again saw Frankie Chung and was told that, although it had been possible to see WilliamLau, Becky could not be reached.  Derek described Becky to Frankie Chung as "a fragile person".  Frankie Chung pointed out to Derekthat Becky had been with the ICAC for more than 48 hours and that one possibility was that she might be becoming a prosecution witness. Derek said that he thought she would not do so but, for the reasons set out in Â§565 of the Reasons, the judge rightly inferredthat Derek was worried that Becky may say things damaging to him.  Despite Derekâs admitted boyfriend/girlfriend relationship withthe second applicant, Mandy, he described Becky to Frankie Chung as "his intimate girlfriend". So it was from this time at the verylatest that Derek must have been aware of the possibility, at least, of Becky cooperating with the ICAC.</p>    <p><a name="p303" class="para" id="p303">303.</a>  During that afternoon there was a call from Derekâs mobile telephone to Mandy's mobile telephone simultaneously with which therewas the despatch of a text message from a mobile phone of a person employed by Mandy to Becky's number, the message being "B. requestto call chung lawer at onec. 94918238.  M.".  Mandyâs employee denied having sent that text and explained that she had left herphone in her office whilst working.  The telephone number was that of Frankie Chung, to whom "chung" in the message clearly referred. It is unrealistic to suggest that it was anyone other than Derek who inspired that message and Mandy who sent it.</p>    <p><a name="p304" class="para" id="p304">304.</a>  On Tuesday 13 July 2004 Derek went, with William Lau who had been released by the ICAC, to Lamâs office at about 4 p.m..  Lamarrived a little over 10 minutes later.  Following on brief telephone calls to her, Mandy arrived soon after 5:30 p.m..  Some 15minutes later Derek, Mandy, Lam and William Lau went to the offices of Massie &amp; Clement where they saw Mr Clement.  However,at some earlier stage, Mr Massie had been contacted, according to Mr Clement, by Lam: as Mr Massie was about to go on leave, he hadpassed the contact on to Mr Clement, leaving a note.  Derek, Lam and William Lau left the offices of Massie &amp; Clement after someeight minutes, leaving Mandy behind ostensibly to give instructions to Mr Clement concerning an attempt to communicate with Becky:she remained there for, approximately, a further 25 minutes.</p>    <p><a name="p305" class="para" id="p305">305.</a>  Derek went, with Lam, from Lamâs office to the FCC.  Becky went straight to the FCC from the offices of Massie &amp; Clement. Egan was also present, or arrived, at the FCC.  It was from there that Egan telephoned Mr Clement less than 20 minutes after Mandyhad left the offices of Massie &amp; Clement.  It will be recalled that it was in that conversation that Egan told Mr Clement thatLam was agitated, that Mr Clement should be "hammering on the door of the ICAC" and that he, Egan, had instructions from Mandy toarrange for an immediate visit to the ICAC to find out what was happening to Becky.</p>    <p><a name="p306" class="para" id="p306">306.</a>  Mr Clement, who by then was on his way home, arranged for a member of his staff to take a letter of instructions, addressed to Massie&amp; Clement, to the FCC for signature by Mandy: this was to enable Egan to go to try to visit Becky at the ICAC.  Some time after7 p.m. the staff member saw Derek, Mandy and Egan there and subsequently went with those three persons, in Derek's car, to the ICACoffices where he and Egan were dropped off: Derek and Mandy went on elsewhere in Derek's vehicle.  At 7:30 p.m. Derek went to FrankieChung's office where he remained for some 45 minutes, during the course of which he indicated that CK Mok &amp; Co should act forWilliam Lau and Becky. Of course, despite purporting to give those instructions to CK Mok &amp; Co on Beckyâs behalf, at this stagehe had not been in communication with her.</p>    <p><a name="p307" class="para" id="p307">307.</a>  At about midnight that night (13/14 July 2004) Becky telephoned Frankie Chung having seen the text message from âMâ, plainlyMandy.  The judgeâs summary of what happened then, insofar as it involves Derek, appears at Â§48 above.</p>    <p><a name="p308" class="para" id="p308">308.</a>  There was also evidence that Derek had telephoned Egan shortly after his dead-of-night meeting with Frankie Chung; that Derek andLam had telephoned one another during the morning of 14 July; that Derek had telephoned Frankie Chung a number of times that morning. During the course of one such call Derek had asked Frankie Chung, as opposed to anyone from Massie &amp; Clement, to go with Eganto visit Becky, a request which Frankie Chung apparently sought to reject, but with which, after speaking to Egan, he complied. The visit to the ICAC, as has been seen, was unfruitful but the telephone records disclose that both before and shortly after FrankieChung left the ICAC there were three telephone calls between him and Derek: Frankie Chung also made one call to Mandy at that stage.</p>    <p><a name="p309" class="para" id="p309">309.</a>  It was decided that day to launch <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings.  Massie &amp; Clement required a deposit on fees: this was paid by way of a cheque drawn on a bank account of Ever Brilliant. A further cheque drawn on that account was issued to Frankie Chungâs employers the same day, apparently in payment of fees forthe visit which Frankie Chung had undertaken with Egan to the ICAC that day.  As appears from the Vice Presidentâs judgment, EverBrilliant was a company the finances of which were underwritten by Derek: on 17 July 2004 he deposited $150,000 into that companyâsaccount.</p>    <p><a name="p310" class="para" id="p310">310.</a>  Proceedings were commenced before Yam J. that afternoon but adjourned to 15 July 2004.  Yam J. granted a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> returnable that afternoon.  Shortly before lunch, Derek telephoned Egan enquiring of the outcome of the proceedings.  Despite a completeban being imposed by Yam J on communicating the outcome of the application to anyone, it is abundantly clear from the transcriptof that conversation that Egan was to leave Derek in no doubt as to the fact that the writ had been granted but that an appeal wasto be launched against that decision.  There was then a meeting in Lam's offices from shortly before 5 p.m. until just after 6:30p.m. that afternoon at which Derek, Mandy and William Lau were present.  Shortly after those three persons left the offices withLam, Mandy went to the offices of Massie &amp; Clement and provided information to enable an affirmation to be drafted on her behalf.</p>    <p><a name="p311" class="para" id="p311">311.</a>  Mandy returned to Massie &amp; Clement the following morning and signed the affirmation, that being the affirmation which gave riseto charge 2.  About 30 minutes after she arrived, Derek arrived.  They left together some 20 minutes later.</p>    <p><a name="p312" class="para" id="p312">312.</a>  On 21 July 2004 Derek and Mandy went to a motor car dealer where Derek purchased a used vehicle for $270,000 for which he paid byway of trade in of an existing vehicle, apparently registered in his name but used extensively by Mandy, by cash and by the use ofhis credit card.  Derek instructed the salesman that the purchased vehicle was to be registered in, and the contract and receiptwere to reflect, Mandy's name.</p>    <p><a name="p313" class="para" id="p313">313.</a>  In the light of all this evidence, which the judge accepted and set out in detail in his Reasons but summarised at Â§Â§405 to 411,the judge was entirely justified in finding that the prosecution had proved its case against Derek. There is no merit in this application.</p>    <p class="heading">CACC248/2006: the second applicant, Mandy</p>    <p><a name="p314" class="para" id="p314">314.</a>  I also agree with both the Chief Judge and the Vice President that the second applicantâs application for leave to appeal theconvictions on charges 1 and 2 should be dismissed.  There is little that I feel it necessary to add.</p>    <p class="heading">Charge 1</p>    <p><a name="p315" class="para" id="p315">315.</a>  The prosecution case was described, in ground 1.1 of  Mandyâs Amended Perfected Grounds of Appeal, as depending:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... on the contention that the use of the judicial process to apply for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> constituted in all the circumstances a perversion of the course of justice.  Rather, the object of the application, however, wasto determine the issue as to whether the Becky was or was not voluntarily in the company of ICAC officers.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p316" class="para" id="p316">316.</a>  That wrongly characterised the prosecution case which, insofar as the <i>habeas corpus</i> application was concerned, was that it was <u>but one</u> of the means by which the conspirators sought to give effect to their agreement.  This was made clear to the judge, and the parties,at the commencement of the trial when, in outlining the prosecution case, Mr Martin Wilson QC said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In order to achieve [the conspiracyâs] aims, <u>various means were used</u>: by attempting to get the witness to ask to make contact with Frankie Chung; by attempting to persuade the ICAC to give access tothe witness; by purporting to act in the interests of the witness; by attempting to put pressure on the ICAC by threatening to makea complaint to the Hong Kong police that she was being illegally detained by them and then by making the complaint; by disseminatinginformation to the press in order to obtain publicity for allegations that the ICAC was guilty of false imprisonment; <u>and by</u> making an application for a writ of habeas corpus to the Court of First Instance of the High Court, purporting to be made on behalfof that witness and, in furtherance of that application, submitting to the court two affirmations which contained material assertionsabout the witness which were untrue." [emphasis supplied]</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p317" class="para" id="p317">317.</a>  The judge indicated, in Â§430 of the Reasons set out in Â§210 above, that, if Becky were a credible witness, her evidence establishedthat "the acts did have a natural tendency to influence her.".  That plainly was an inference which he was entitled to draw fromthe evidence before him.</p>    <p><a name="p318" class="para" id="p318">318.</a>  The ground asserts that ââ¦the object of the applicationâ¦ was to determine the issue as to whether the Becky was or was notvoluntarily in the company of ICAC officersâ¦â. The judge found to the contrary, that it was a device by which to gain accessto Becky in order to influence her:  he was correct in that finding.</p>    <p><a name="p319" class="para" id="p319">319.</a>  For my part, I find no substance in the submission in ground 1.2 that the issue of Becky's voluntariness was reasonably raised. Such a submission ignores the factual background against which these events unfolded; the arrest of Derek and his desire to protecthis interests; and Beckyâs evidence generally, but particularly that she had told Mandy directly by telephone that she was "okay"and, twice, that she was "safe and sound".  In context, and notwithstanding the additional submissions made by Miss Montgomery QC,who appeared on behalf of Lam in this appeal but not below, I do not accept that these references reasonably, or sensibly, couldhave been construed as simply meaning that she was physically well.</p>    <p><a name="p320" class="para" id="p320">320.</a>  Nor did Beckyâs evidence disclose, as is suggested, that she was in two minds as to whether to co-operate with the ICAC: her vacillationoccurred only after the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings were made known to her, when she felt that she may have inconvenienced third parties. It was the conduct of the conspiratorsin seeking to carry out the objects of the conspiracy that demonstrably had that adverse effect on Becky.  It was clear from herevidence that she experienced a period of indecision and distress once she became aware of the existence of the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings.  Her evidence supported that of Mr Ryan, who appeared on behalf of the Commissioner of the ICAC in those proceedingsand as a witness in this trial, who colloquially expressed the concern that the proceedings themselves would have the effect of intimidatingBecky: the judge accepted Mr Ryanâs evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p321" class="para" id="p321">321.</a>  The judge, although demonstrating his awareness of the criticisms which had been passed, accepted all of Beckyâs evidence, ashe was so entitled.  His finding in this regard, which appears at Â§562 of the Reasons appears in full at Â§215 above.</p>    <p><a name="p322" class="para" id="p322">322.</a>  Contrary to the submission in ground 1.3, Mandyâs role was not, "â¦to instruct, with the financial support of [Derek], the solicitorsMassie &amp; Clement on 13 July in order to express her concerns about [Becky] and, if possible, to obtain her release".</p>    <p><a name="p323" class="para" id="p323">323.</a>  Even from my brief consideration of the evidence as it affected Derek, it was manifest before the judge that Mandyâs role wasto lend her name to the events, participating willingly in whatever occurred and do whatever she was required to do to bring aboutthe intended object of the conspiracy.  The most striking example of this is the fact that she was prepared to sign an affirmationin support of the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings which, as the judge found, deliberately contained what she knew to be material falsities.</p>    <p><a name="p324" class="para" id="p324">324.</a>  To this must be added two facets of the evidence: first, it was not she who furnished any instructions to Massie &amp; Clement asto the commencement or conduct of, nor was she even present at court at any of the hearings of, the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings; secondly, even when Mr Ryan, a person with whom Egan was well familiar, informed the court that Becky was in the witnessprotection programme, Egan did not even think it necessary to ask for the matter to be stood down in order to take instructions fromMandy, or come to that anyone else, as to the further conduct of the proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p325" class="para" id="p325">325.</a>  Ground 3, which relates to charge 1, listed 12 matters which the judge was said to have failed properly to take into account inassessing the evidence before him.  These submissions relied upon a slow trawl through the transcript of the hearing, upon a microscopicexamination of individual, frequently quite minor, passages of the evidence, out of their true context, which were then used to criticizethe judge for notionally not having considered them.</p>    <p><a name="p326" class="para" id="p326">326.</a>  Whilst of course it is necessary for a judge to take into account all of the evidence before him and to consider the effect thatthe evidence has on the case for any of the parties involved, it is equally his duty both to apply commonsense in the implementationof that approach and to stand back to look at the evidence as a whole and to consider its overall effect. It would be an exceptionalcase where, on appeal, it were not possible for counsel to be able to point to a facet of the evidence to which a judge has not referred,especially in a lengthy trial such as this.</p>    <p><a name="p327" class="para" id="p327">327.</a>  Whilst there is a duty on a judge of the District Court to provide adequate reasons for his/her decision, just what is requiredwill vary from case to case: what will amount to adequate reasons for a decision will be dependent on the context in which the decisionmaker is operating and the circumstances of the particular trial. See <i>Oriental Daily Publisher Ltd v. Commissioner For Television And Entertainment Licensing Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%2d1998%5d%201%20HKCFAR%20279" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997-1998] 1 HKCFAR 279.</a></p>    <p><a name="p328" class="para" id="p328">328.</a>  There was no indication in this matter that the judge overlooked evidence, even if he did not specifically refer to certain aspectsof it. There were extensive submissions made to him by counsel for each accused at the conclusion of the prosecution case and, again,at the conclusion of the trial: those submissions dealt in detail with the evidence. It is quite clear from a balanced reading ofthe Reasons as a whole, and of the transcript of the hearing, that the judge was fully alive to the elements of the offences, or,in the case of charge 1, what he understood to be the elements; to the issues that he needed to decide; and to the nature, extentand effect of the vast amount of evidence before him. There is a similar lack of merit in the submissions in grounds 3.2 and 3.3.</p>    <p><a name="p329" class="para" id="p329">329.</a>  Ground 3.4 complains of the destruction of ICAC records of telephone intercepts despite a request from Lam that "the relevant records"be preserved.  Mr Caplan QC, who appeared for Mandy in this appeal but not in the court below, allied himself with what was saidon Lamâs behalf: similar submissions formed ground 11 of Lamâs grounds and ground 12 of Egan's grounds.</p>    <p><a name="p330" class="para" id="p330">330.</a>  It is convenient to deal with all the submissions relating to this topic at this stage.  Miss Montgomery submitted, particularly,that "the telephone records constituted... real evidence of a critical part of the case, namely [what] Becky had said...", furthercontending that the records had been destroyed when, first, the ICAC had a duty to retain those records and, secondly, their retentionhad been requested.</p>    <p><a name="p331" class="para" id="p331">331.</a>  It was suggested that <i>mala fides</i> on the part of the ICAC was demonstrated by the fact that the "records" were destroyed only after Lam had written a letter, dated10 August 2004, making his request that they be retained. It is pertinent to look at exactly what it was Lam requested:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI also urge you to order the ICAC to conduct an enquiry with two relevant mobile phone networks to preserve the calling recordsof 60833118 (mobile number belonging to [Becky]) for the period from 1315 hours to 1330 hours on 11 July 2004 and 95344584 (a prepaidsim card belonging to [Becky]) for the period of 1030 hours to 1045 hours on 12 July 2004 and that of 0030 hours to 0050 hours on14 July 2004.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The records of the mobile phone networks will prove the making of the calls by [Becky]â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p332" class="para" id="p332">332.</a>  Apparently the contention was that the "duty" was either absolute or arose from the fact that, when Lam asked for the records ofthe two mobile phone networks to be preserved, the ICAC should have realised the significance of the calls referred to by Lam inhis letter and should then have appreciated that they should retain the recordings or the notes arising from them.</p>    <p><a name="p333" class="para" id="p333">333.</a>  It seems to me that any solicitor practising in the field of criminal law in Hong Kong will inevitably be aware of the fact thattelephone intercepts are carried out by the ICAC from time to time.  If it was the intercept recordings and product of them thatwas what, indeed, was sought to be preserved, then one would expect that to have been specifically requested.  I impose no higherexpectation on Lam simply because he had been an ICAC officer.</p>    <p><a name="p334" class="para" id="p334">334.</a>  The evidence of Rebecca Li and of Veronica Poon dealt with the procedure of retention and destruction of recordings of telephoneinterceptions.  The procedure to which each of them spoke was that once an intercept takes place an ICAC officer listens to the recordingthat has been made and prepares what is known as a "first hand listenerâs note".  That first hand listenerâs note is then distilledinto a document known as an "intelligence summary".  Only in the most exceptional circumstances is even a senior ICAC officer allowedaccess to the original recording: even access to the first hand listenerâs note is strictly controlled and limited to senior ICACofficers: less senior officers are allowed specified access to the intelligence summary. The evidence was that the actual aural recordingof the intercept is destroyed approximately 1 week after the intercept occurs whereas the first hand listenerâs notes are destroyedapproximately a month after the "operation" terminates: it was not clear from the evidence whether this means that the "interceptoperation" or the overall operation during the course of which intercepts may be made.  Nothing turned on that in the present matter.</p>    <p><a name="p335" class="para" id="p335">335.</a>  What was destroyed subsequent to the date of Lam's letter were notes made consequent upon those recordings having been reviewedand further distilled.  Moreover it is important to appreciate that what Lam asked to be retained, in very specific terms, was notthe records of the intercepts or any product of them generated by the ICAC, but the records of the mobile service providers.  Thoserecords indeed were preserved.</p>    <p><a name="p336" class="para" id="p336">336.</a>  A similar issue arose in <i>HKSAR v MO Yuk Ping &amp; Others</i> DCCC367, 1334, 1360/2004 &amp; 636/2005 in which the ruling refusing an application for permanent stay of proceedings on the basisof destruction of telephone interception recordings contained the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â83. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the policy adopted by the Government of allowing telecommunications intercepts forthe purposes only of intelligence gathering and thereafter requiring the destruction of the product flowing there from is rational.The policy, overall, is one which is designed to strike a fair balance between the competing interests at stake and to minimise theinherently intrusive nature of the intercepts.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">84.  In the context of the instant matter, the ICAC, if it wished to use telecommunications intercepts, was obliged to follow thatpolicy.  It follows that by adhering to the policy it was under no obligation to retain the product or synopses for the potentialpurpose of later disclosure in the event that any charges arise.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i><u>Was there conduct possessed of "serious fault" or mala fides?</u></i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">85. It follows from my finding that as there was no duty upon the ICAC to retain the intercept materials, because of the existingpolicy to which it was subject, that it cannot be said that the ICAC was acting <i>mala fide</i> or that its conduct was unconscionable or possessed of "serious fault" in destroying the material.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">86.  It takes no imagination to anticipate the argument, diametrically opposed to the present, if it were to be suggested that theICAC had acted contrary to that very policy.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p337" class="para" id="p337">337.</a>  As Hartmann J recognised in <i>MO Yuk Ping v Secretary for Justice</i> HCAL111/2005, an application for judicial review which flowed from that ruling:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â22. The destruction was not an act of bad faith. The purpose was to protect the privacy of third parties. It was done in accordancewith set procedure.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">.â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">26.  I state again that the destruction of the great bulk of the intelligence material was not arbitrary. The destruction of the materialwas in terms of an administrative or executive policyâ¦to ensure that the rights of privacy of third parties were protectedâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p338" class="para" id="p338">338.</a>  In any event, the intercepts in the instant matter occurred in regard to an intelligence gathering exercise concerning offenceswhich may already have been committed in regard to Semtech and not in regard to the events which gave rise to the instant offences.</p>    <p><a name="p339" class="para" id="p339">339.</a>  In the circumstances, I fail to see how it can be suggested that the ICAC acted <i>mala fides</i> in destroying the tapes, that the destruction was an abuse of the process of court or that it would give rise to the applicationof the <i>omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem</i> presumption.</p>    <p class="heading">Charge 2</p>    <p><a name="p340" class="para" id="p340">340.</a>  The judge amended the original charge of perjury to one of attempted perjury for want of form in the affirmation process: he wassatisfied, however, that it had been Mandy's intention to make an affirmation which contained statements which, not due to inadvertenceor honest mistake, were material and wilfully false to her knowledge â statements by way both of assertion and omission.</p>    <p><a name="p341" class="para" id="p341">341.</a>  Ground 4.1 asserts the necessity of a person to be "lawfully affirmed" before he/she is able to commit the offence of attemptedperjury.  With respect, the requirement is that before someone is able to commit the offence of perjury he/she must be lawfully affirmedand it was that requirement that gave rise to the amendment: it was precisely because Mandy had not been "lawfully affirmed", yetsigned what she intended to be an affirmation containing what she knew to be material and wilfully false statements, that correctlymotivated the judge to amend the charge. That she intended it to be an affirmation and that it was made wilfully, contrary to thesubmission in ground 4.6, is self-evident from the fact that it was tendered to court in the adjourned <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p342" class="para" id="p342">342.</a>  The judge's approach to the evidence against Mandy in respect of both charges was appropriate.  He evaluated that evidence adequatelyand drew the appropriate inferences.</p>    <p class="heading">CACC248/2006: the third applicant, Lam</p>    <p><a name="p343" class="para" id="p343">343.</a>  I also agree with the Chief Judge that Lam's application for leave to appeal should be dismissed. There were, in all, 20 groundsset out in the Re-amended Perfected Grounds of Appeal: although not all were elaborated upon individually in argument before us,none was abandoned.  Some have already been dealt with simultaneously when considering Mandy's application and need no further consideration:others have been dealt with by the Chief Judge, which need attract only little, if any, additional comment from me.</p>    <p><a name="p344" class="para" id="p344">344.</a>  Even though I take the view, for the reasons that appear hereunder, that the judge erred when he held knowledge or belief that Beckywas not unlawfully detained and did not seek release from the custody of the ICAC to be an essential element of charge 1, I am entirelysatisfied that the judge was entitled to draw the inference against Lam that he was well aware that there had been no request fromBecky to secure her release.  Thus, the judgeâs error was one which favoured Lam as it imposed a higher burden on the prosecution:notwithstanding that higher burden, the judge was properly satisfied of the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p345" class="para" id="p345">345.</a>  I agree with the Chief Judge that even leaving aside the supporting evidence which is available from Mr Nattrass in regard to whatLam said to him and from Ms Reimer and Mr Yeung concerning what Lam said at, what has been described as, the "Grissini lunch", therewas more than sufficient evidence for the judge to have drawn the inference that Lam had been a party to the conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p346" class="para" id="p346">346.</a>  Lam's conduct has already been substantially summarised by the Chief Judge in Â§Â§262-291, by the Vice President, and earlier byme in Â§Â§304-305.</p>    <p class="heading">Conflict of interest</p>    <p><a name="p347" class="para" id="p347">347.</a>  I agree with the Chief Judge that critical evidence was the assertion that Lam introduced Mandy to Massie &amp; Clement becausehe foresaw a possible conflict of interest between Derek, his client, on the one hand and Becky, and presumably William Lau, on theother, yet this claim is completely controverted by his conduct thereafter.</p>    <p><a name="p348" class="para" id="p348">348.</a>  To my mind, the most striking feature of Lamâs involvement is that within, quite literally, a few minutes of Mandy leaving theoffices of Massie &amp; Clement and meeting Derek, Lam and Egan at the FCC, Lam was, as was seen from the conversation that Eganhad with Mr Clement, already countermanding the course of conduct planned by the very solicitors to whom Lam had introduced Mandy. Egan's claim that, by the time of his phone call to Mr Clement, he had already received instructions to go to the offices of theICAC and that that course had been conceived of by "Mandy" beggars belief - especially in the light of his assertions that Lam wasagitated by the course of action which Mr Clement had proposed and that Mandy appeared to be ââ¦like a fish out of water.  Shelooked like someone who had no idea of what was going on.".</p>    <p><a name="p349" class="para" id="p349">349.</a>  The Chief Judge has set out in detail the communications that were recorded as having taken place between various mobile telephonessubscribed to by others and that of Lam.  I will not repeat that evidence, but would observe simply that not only does that evidencegraphically illustrate Lam's involvement but the calls with Carmen Hsu of Sing Tao Daily are entirely consistent with Lamâs talkat the Grissini lunch on 15 July of switching on "all the machines" against the ICAC.</p>    <p><a name="p350" class="para" id="p350">350.</a>  To seek to pass off Lam's extensive involvement throughout the period of the events from the earliest stage onwards as being attributableto mere professional concern that the firm to whom he had referred Mandy was acting in her best interests is inconsistent with commonsense. The judgeâs conclusion that Lam was "calling the shots behind the scenes" was right on the mark.</p>    <p class="heading">Mr Nattrassâs evidence</p>    <p><a name="p351" class="para" id="p351">351.</a>  The issue of the judge's assessment of Mr Nattrass as a witness has been dealt with by the Chief Judge at Â§Â§290-291 and the VicePresident at Â§Â§189-199.  The judge has been criticised, generally and, specifically in ground 14, for accepting the evidence ofMr Nattrass.  In my judgment, that criticism was unfounded, in this case.</p>    <p><a name="p352" class="para" id="p352">352.</a>  Mr Nattrass was subjected to lengthy and wide-ranging cross-examination, even as to topics which, with respect to the judge, wereneither relevant to any of the issues before him nor to the witnessâs credibility or reliability.  The judge could not have beenanything other than fully alive to the opprobrium which was heaped upon Mr Nattrass at every possible opportunity.  He demonstratedthis to be the case. Over the space of 10 paragraphs in the Reasons he dealt with a number of the specific criticisms made of MrNattrass from which it was perfectly apparent that he approached Mr Nattrass's evidence with a substantial degree of caution.  Andrightly so.  It is repeatedly said, despite being self-evident, that the longer cross-examination lasts, the more opportunity itaffords a judge to assess the veracity and reliability of the witness.  The judge had ample opportunity of doing so in this matter.</p>    <p><a name="p353" class="para" id="p353">353.</a>  Despite demonstrating that he was fully aware of the criticisms of Mr Nattrass the judge expressed himself as being "... left inno doubt that Nattrass has been telling the truth about the conversations with [Lam] and [Egan]." Even had the judge felt inclinedto deplore some or all of Mr Nattrass's conduct, once he found him to be a truthful and reliable witness in regard to issues whichhe was required to decide, the judge was entitled to take the evidence into account.  There can be no doubt that that evidence issupportive of Lam's deep involvement in these events and, to a large extent, emanates from Lam himself.</p>    <p><a name="p354" class="para" id="p354">354.</a>  I believe it to be necessary to deal, briefly, with two additional points made in ground 14 in regard to Mr Nattrassâs evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p355" class="para" id="p355">355.</a>  The first is the submission made at Â§14.5 that the judge failed to consider whether Lam's right against self-incrimination hadbeen violated after accepting that Mr Nattrass was âacting as an ICAC informerâ at the time when Lam made the self-incriminatorystatement to him; alternatively, that the judge should have exercised his residual discretion to exclude that evidence. That overstateswhat the judge found Mr Nattrassâs role to have been.</p>    <p><a name="p356" class="para" id="p356">356.</a>  Reliance is placed, for this submission, on <i>Secretary for Justice v LAM Tat Ming &amp; Another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%202%20HKLRD%20431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 2 HKLRD 431</a> and <i>Secretary for Justice v LAM Hong Kwok Popy &amp; Others</i> CACC528/2004. Each is factually entirely remote from the present: in particular, it is important to bear in mind the opening qualificationof Li CJ in <i>LAM Tat Ming</i> at 438H:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAt the outset, it is important to observe that by the time the undercover operation started in November 1996, the alleged criminaloffences had long been completed and there were suspects. At first the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent was a suspect and as the operation progressed the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent also emerged as a suspect. The purpose of the operation was to obtain confessions from them.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">This kind of undercover operation should be contrasted with undercover operations by a law enforcement agency conducted where thecriminal activities are ongoing and the offences had not been completed. We are not concerned with them in this appeal as differentconsiderations apply to themâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p357" class="para" id="p357">357.</a>  The Chief Justice went on to say at 447E:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âUltimately [the certified question] has to be answered by reference to the common law in Hong Kong. In summary, in exercising theresidual discretion to exclude a voluntary confession, the judge has to consider whether it would be unfair to the accused to usethe confession against him at trial and unfairness is to be judged against what is required to secure a fair trial for him. The protectionof his right of silence is a principle of a fair trial...â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p358" class="para" id="p358">358.</a>  Mr Nattrass may have been a public-spirited citizen just passing on information that came his way; he may have been an interfering,self-important busybody: it was unnecessary for the judge to make a finding in this regard.  No matter what Mr Nattrassâs pretences,or the impression he sought to create, may have been, the fact was that he was not at any stage employed by or under the instructionor direction of the ICAC insofar as his dealings with Lam were concerned. He merely passed on information that he thought may beof interest to the ICAC which came his way from time to time.</p>    <p><a name="p359" class="para" id="p359">359.</a>  Even recognizing that a judge does have a residual discretion to exclude otherwise relevant and thus admissible evidence and thata consideration for a judge may be a breach of a constitutional right (see <i>HKSAR v CHAN Kau Tai</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20HKLRD%20400" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 HKLRD 400</a> and the authorities there collected), the issue of the exercise of the judge's discretion simply did not arise on facts of this case. It is noteworthy, particularly given the intensity with which the defence cases were advocated, collectively and individually, thatthere was no submission to the judge that this was an appropriate case in which his discretion should be exercised in their favour.</p>    <p><a name="p360" class="para" id="p360">360.</a>  The second point, that in Â§14.7, submitted that the judge took into account statements made outside of the period of the conspiracywhich "... have no bearing whatsoever... " on the conspiracy.  It is correct that the statements made by Lam to Mr Nattrass weremade on 30 August 2004, well outside the period charged in the conspiracy which was said to have subsisted between 11 and 17 July2004.  Conversely, they certainly had a bearing on the conspiracy: they demonstrated Lam's involvement in it.</p>    <p><a name="p361" class="para" id="p361">361.</a>  The submission failed to appreciate the use to which the judge indicated he was able to put this evidence.  The judge specificallystated at Â§417 "Further, evidence admissible against [Lam] only is the conversation with Aaron Nattrass on 30 August 2004...". It is quite clear that the judge was aware, correctly, that he could not use, as evidence to prove the conspiracy against the co-conspirators,whatever Lam said to Mr Nattrass unless it had been said in furtherance of the conspiracy.  It is equally clear that the judge regardedthis evidence purely as evidence of Lam's knowledge or state of mind at the time the conspiracy existed.  He was certainly entitledto take into account, for that purpose, such statements as he found Lam had made to Mr Nattrass at whatever time, whether withinor without the period of the conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p362" class="para" id="p362">362.</a>  My view accords with that of the Chief Judge, that this is not an appropriate matter in which this court should interfere with sucha fundamental finding of the judge.</p>    <p><a name="p363" class="para" id="p363">363.</a>  Without ignoring the rest of his evidence, the first feature of Mr Nattrass's evidence which is striking is that at a dinner partyat Egan's flat on 30 August 2004 at which Lam was present, Lam indicated to Nattrass in the course of conversation that he, Lam,regarded Mr Massie as weak, that Mr Massie should not have cooperated with the ICAC by surrendering the files in the <i>habeas corpus</i> application but instead should have claimed professional privilege and caused the files to be sealed.  That is an aspect of the evidencewhich the judge was entitled to take as consistent with, and supportive of, Lam's earliest intervention when he overrode Massie &amp;Clement's proposal to write to the ICAC, being of the view that it was an inadequate course of action.</p>    <p><a name="p364" class="para" id="p364">364.</a>  The second singular feature, is his testimony that Lam had asked him, Mr Nattrass, to tell Mr Massie not to disclose to the ICACthat he, Lam, had told Mr Massie that Becky was in protective custody at the time when he initially had referred Mandy to Massie&amp; Clement, on 13 July 2004.  The judge having accepted that Mr Nattrass was telling the truth about the conversations betweenhim and Lam, this is direct evidence that, from the very outset, Lam knew all of the proceedings - not just the <i>habeas corpus</i> application - to be spurious.</p>    <p><a name="p365" class="para" id="p365">365.</a>  The third feature of note is the evidence of Mr Nattrass that Egan had told him that "... Lam would have Massie &amp; Clement sackedand get another firm of solicitors to do the case the way he wanted it done...", which is supportive of the statement by Egan inhis telephone call to Mr Clement on 13 July.</p>    <p class="heading">The Grissini lunch (Ground 15)</p>    <p><a name="p366" class="para" id="p366">366.</a>  Notwithstanding the submissions made in ground 15, I agree with the Chief Judgeâs summary, at Â§Â§287-289, and his view that theevidence flowing from the Grissini lunch provides further evidence, and support for the judge's finding, of the extent of Lam's involvementin the conspiracy.  In Â§332 of the Reasons the judge correctly reminded himself that âThe content of the conversation at the Grissinilunch is admissible against [Lam] only.â, just as we have seen that he did in regard to the evidence of Mr Nattrass.</p>    <p><a name="p367" class="para" id="p367">367.</a>  A similar submission concerning the judgeâs supposed failure to take evidence into account was made on Mandyâs behalf. I donot propose to repeat what I said in that connection at Â§Â§325-328 above. I reject this submission, too.</p>    <p><a name="p368" class="para" id="p368">368.</a>  A singular feature relating to that lunch which should be borne in mind is the evidence that, on that day, Lam was appearing ina trial in the District Court in Wanchai: despite having arrived âaround 1.10 pmâ, spent âhalf an hourâ having lunch withMs Reimer and Mr Yeung, and needing to be back in Court, across the road, by 2.30 pm, Lam still went to the FCC to meet Egan. AlthoughEgan stated that that meeting had nothing to do with the <i>habeas corpus</i> application, the judge rejected Eganâs evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">Other grounds of appeal</p>    <p><a name="p369" class="para" id="p369">369.</a>  Ground 1 submitted that the basis for Lamâs conviction on charge 1 was fundamentally flawed, the main contention being that theoffence charged was one unknown to law.  The Chief Judge has dealt with this issue and I do not propose to repeat what he has said. Insofar as the submission is made in support of this ground that "The Prosecution accepted and alleged in charge 1 that <u>the means</u> by which access to... Becky was sought to be secured was by way of an application for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>" I would emphasise what I said in Â§316, that this was <u>but one</u> of the means resorted to by the conspirators to achieve their object.  That application was designed to gain access to Becky to influenceher against cooperating with the ICAC, not for her benefit or to protect her interests.</p>    <p><a name="p370" class="para" id="p370">370.</a>  Ground 2 asserted that the judge incorrectly drew inferences and provided what are said to be examples, whilst Ground 3 contendedthat the judgeâs approach to his assessment of Becky's credibility was flawed: I have already expressed my view on this when dealingwith a similar submission made on Mandy's behalf.  Once the judge accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, particularlyBecky and Mr Nattrass, which he did properly in my judgment, then he was entitled to draw the inferences which he did.  He demonstratedthat he was fully aware of the circumstances in which an inference adverse to an accused person may be drawn (see <i>KWAN Ping Bong &amp; Anor v R</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20HKLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] HKLR 1</a>, PC and <i>TANG Kwok Wah v HKSAR</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282002%29%205%20HKCFAR%20209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2002) 5 HKCFAR 209</a> Â§Â§18-25).</p>    <p><a name="p371" class="para" id="p371">371.</a>  Ground 4 asserted an imbalanced analysis of Frankie Chungâs evidence and particularly the judgeâs "finding" that Frankie Chungwas a co-conspirator in charge 1.  It may well be that Frankie Chung did deny, in his evidence, being one of the conspirators butthat is no bar to the judgeâs finding, on the evidence as a whole: evidently he did not accept that aspect of Frankie Chung's evidence. The fact that he chose not to accept one facet of a witness's evidence is no bar to his accepting other evidence from that samewitness: if support for this proposition be needed then the observations of Keene LJ, giving the judgment of the court in <i>R v Cairns</i> [2003]1 Cr. App. R 38 at Â§35 are apposite:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"But it is not uncommon for there to be witnesses whose evidence is regarded by the prosecution as largely, or in part, worthy ofbelief and reliable but not wholly reliable.  There may be good reason for the prosecution arriving at such a judgment.  It is anormal human experience that people sometimes tell the truth about certain matters but may not be reliable about others, as the verdictsof juries from time to time suggest.  There is no reason why a jury should not regard part of a witness's evidence as true but takethe position that they cannot rely on the whole of that evidence.  That not infrequently happens and it seems to have happened inthe present case."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p372" class="para" id="p372">372.</a>  Where a judge decides that it is appropriate to adopt such an approach he will then consider the evidence which he accepts withan appropriate degree of caution: it is clear from the Reasons that the judge was fully alive to Frankie Chung's shortcomings asa witness and the fact that he was testifying under an immunity. The fact that the judge also found that he was a co-conspirator,which, it will be remembered, was alleged in the particulars of the charge, is a fact that redounded to the benefit of all of theaccused resulting, as it plainly did, in the judge approaching Frankie Chung's evidence with due circumspection.</p>    <p><a name="p373" class="para" id="p373">373.</a>  It is plain from Â§Â§568 and 569 of the Reasons that the judge regarded as particularly telling, as to the nature of Frankie Chung'sinvolvement in these events, the fact that his evidence was that when Becky spoke to him at midnight on 13/14 July he made it clearto her that he would only go to see her if she contacted him thereafter: he related this condition to Derek when they met shortlythereafter.  Yet only a few hours later he (Frankie Chung) and Egan went to the ICAC in an attempt to see Becky despite the factthat she had not contacted him again.</p>    <p><a name="p374" class="para" id="p374">374.</a>  The judge supplied cogent reasons as to why it was that he did not accept the truthfulness of Frankie Chungâs diary entry to theeffect that Becky had indicated she "wanted to escape from the evil power of the ICAC". In addition to the judgeâs observations,that entry was at odds with an insistence that she contact him again if she wished him to help her to do that very thing.</p>    <p><a name="p375" class="para" id="p375">375.</a>  Grounds 5 and 7 related to Lam's knowledge of the bogus nature of the events and his state of mind.  The evidence outlining thebasis of Lam's knowledge as well as the issue of conflict of interest has already been dealt with: with respect, these grounds appearto misunderstand the effect of the judge's finding concerning Mr Nattrass's evidence, as already discussed.</p>    <p><a name="p376" class="para" id="p376">376.</a>  Ground 6 suggested that the only way Lam could have learned of Beckyâs state of mind was from Mandy and, indirectly, Frankie Cheung. That ignores the fact that Derek was Lam's client; that the judge found that the conspiracy was put in place for Derek's benefit;that the evidence of Derek's relationship with Becky, which even if his description of her as his "intimate girlfriend" was an exaggeration,was sufficient to enable him to describe her as "fragile"; that, on what was apparently Derekâs first visit to Lam, they had hada meeting in excess of an hour in Lamâs office before Mandy even arrived there; and the evidence that there had been a referenceby Lam to Becky being in "protective custody" when passing on Mandy to Massie &amp; Clement as a client, showing the state of Lamâsknowledge.</p>    <p><a name="p377" class="para" id="p377">377.</a>  Ground 8 alleged that the judge assured counsel that he did not intend to rely upon âthe fact and frequencyâ of telephone conversationsbetween Lam, Egan and Hsu without evidence of the content of such calls.  The reality is that no such assurance was ever given bythe judge: that emerges clearly from the record of the trial.  Given the highly probative nature of the evidence, such an undertakingor assurance by the judge would have been extraordinary.</p>    <p><a name="p378" class="para" id="p378">378.</a>  This undertaking was identified on behalf of Lam as having occurred "in the course of the closing submissions of counsel for MrEgan". After listening to the recordings of the closing speeches by all counsel, the only exchange between Mr McNamara, who appearedfor Egan at trial, and the judge which bears any relationship to this ground, and then only tangential, occurred when Mr McNamarawas dealing with an <i>aide memoire</i> which related to a series of telephone calls which the prosecution contended showed a "triangular exchange" between Lam, Egan andCarmen Hsu.  The exchange was in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Mr McNamara: If thatâs a triangle itâs extraordinarily lopsided. If thereâs any inference to be drawn from telephone calls betweenAndrew Lam and Carmen Hsu, and I suggest that there is not, and Mr Harris has dealt with that, then the lack of participation ofMr Egan in those calls is evident  from the aide memoire, Particularly when we donât know what the content of any of the telephonecalls was.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Judge: I tell you nowâ¦if you heard me, when there is no evidence I  do not speculate as to what it could have been. But that maynot be equally for both defence and prosecution because for the defence, the defence does not have to prove anything. If the lackof evidence causes me any doubt, of course the doubt goes to the defence.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p379" class="para" id="p379">379.</a>  That indication by the judge met with an appreciative response from Mr McNamara to the effect that he was pleased to hear that,because that was the correct approach to adopt.  This ground was misconceived.</p>    <p><a name="p380" class="para" id="p380">380.</a>  Ground 9: as already discussed, the mere fact that the judge did not mention in the Reasons the specific portions of evidence setout in support of this ground means neither that he failed to take them into account nor that he was unjustified in making the criticisedfinding.  The portions of evidence relied upon were before the judge and there is simply no indicator whatsoever that he failed totake them into overall account.</p>    <p><a name="p381" class="para" id="p381">381.</a>  The thrust of ground 10 was to criticise the style of the judgeâs rendering of the Reasons, criticism which finds itself repeatedin a different sense in ground 18 and, in gratuitous terms, in Â§2.9 "... insofar as the relevant paragraph is comprehensible..."; in Â§5.1 "this proposition, insofar as it is comprehensible..."; and in Â§14.6 "the judge's remarks in paragraph 579... are incomprehensible...".</p>    <p><a name="p382" class="para" id="p382">382.</a>  I accept that there are passages in the very lengthy reasons from which the judge's approach or reasoning does not emerge as readilyas perfection may desire but as a majority of this court, differently constituted but of which two of us were members, observed in<i>HKSAR v HO Ka Keung</i> CACC196/2007, unreported:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â35.        That is not to say that all judgments must be written in a âtemplateâ style.  What is important is that a methodicalapproach should underpin the intellectual exercise that has to be undertaken in every case.  The more complex the case, the moreimportant it is to apply that methodical approach to avoid any misunderstanding as to how the judge came to his decision.  In thepresent case however in view of the way in which the judge chose to present his reasons for verdict, it has become necessary forus to ascertain from various parts of the Reasons for Verdict what are the facts the judge has found relating to each element ofthe offence in order to determine whether the conviction should be upheld.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and, without adopting a meretricious approach</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â76.        That said, to allow an appeal, where there is otherwise clear and sufficient evidence of guilt, simply on the basisthat the judge has not slavishly followed a formulaic approach or some perceived stylistic preference is contrary to the interestsof justice. As Lord Bingham observed in <i>Singh v The State</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/2005/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] UKPC 35</a>, â¦:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The omission of a good character direction on credibility is not necessarily fatal to the fairness of a trial or the safety of a conviction.Much may turn on the nature of and issues in a case, and on the other available evidence. <u>The ends of justice are not on the whole well served by the laying down of hard, inflexible rules from which no departure may everbe tolerated.</u> â [Emphasis supplied]</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The observation in <i>Singh</i> is particularly apposite given ground 13, below.</p>    <p><a name="p383" class="para" id="p383">383.</a>  As Mortimer V-P, in giving the judgment of the court in <i>HKSAR v Kwok Chi Wah</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20HKLRD%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 HKLRD 481</a> noted, at 486D-E:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe real issue, therefore, on appeal is whether there was evidence upon which the Judge could make the necessary inferences tothe criminal standard in order to convict.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p384" class="para" id="p384">384.</a>  In particular in regard to ground 10, the contention in Â§10.1 that Lam never sought to influence Mr Clement regarding the instructionsgiven to him by Mandy chose to ignore the immediate attempt to countermand Mr Clementâs proposed course of action â writing aletter to the ICAC.</p>    <p><a name="p385" class="para" id="p385">385.</a>  The twelfth ground detailed what were said to be "a number of significant errors of fact".  What was meant by Â§12.1 is, with respect,unclear; the judge's finding referred to in Â§12.2 was factually correct - what seems to be intended by this ground was that thatfinding should have been qualified in some way; Â§12.3 could not have been, on any reading of the Reasons, a finding of fact by thejudge but purported to be a rehearsal of Mr Wilson's submission, albeit perhaps an erroneous rehearsal; Â§12.4 was not a statementof the evidence but a conclusion of the judge which, let it be said, was one to which he would inevitably have been driven on theevidence; the complaint in Â§12.5 was one of semantics; that in Â§12.6 occurred during the sentencing process, not as part of thejudge's reasoning process for reaching the verdict he did.</p>    <p><a name="p386" class="para" id="p386">386.</a>  The character direction given by the judge formed the basis of ground 13.  The complaint was that the judge limited the effect ofthe credibility limb of the direction to an accused who has testified, ignoring the applicability of the direction to out-of-courtstatements made by an accused.  What the judge said was:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAll the defendants are admitted to be of clear record.  I also bear in mind their stations in society.  These are matters I takeinto account in their favour.  The fact that the defendant is of good character may mean that he is less likely than otherwise maybe the case to commit the crime now.  Further, for a defendant who has given evidence, <u>and as with any man of good character</u>, his good character supports his credibility.  This is a matter I should take into account when deciding whether to believe his evidence.â[emphasis supplied]</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p387" class="para" id="p387">387.</a>  In my view it is clear that the judge, when using the emphasised phrase, appreciated the effect of the credibility direction evenwhere an accused elected not to testify: to hold otherwise would render that phrase otiose.  It may well have been preferable tohave set that out in terms which would have avoided this even being raised as an, albeit unsuccessful, ground. See, in any event,the observation in <i>Singh</i> Â§382 above, which is particularly pertinent given the judgeâs indication that he bore in mind the "stations in society" of allthe accused.</p>    <p><a name="p388" class="para" id="p388">388.</a>  It is correct that, as asserted in ground 16, the judge failed to return to a conflict he perceived as existing between what Lamis reported as saying at the Grissini lunch and what he had said to Mr Nattrass. Like the judge, the ground of appeal does not identifythe purported discrepancy which is asserted to ââ¦go to the core of the defenceâ¦â. It is not our function to speculate onwhat it was the judge had in mind. That he perceived there to be a âconflictâ demonstrates that he was aware of it and appliedhis mind to it even if, in the course of a set of Reasons running to 679 paragraphs, he overlooked his indication that he would returnto it.  The judge adequately evaluated all of the evidence: it follows that he must have been of the view that, whatever the âconflictâmay have been, it did not affect any of the material findings he was to make.</p>    <p><a name="p389" class="para" id="p389">389.</a>  Ground 17 suggested that "It would appear to be implicit... that [the judge] found that Andrew Lam was party to the allegedly falseaffirmation of Mandy....".  In my view, no such conclusion is justified on a sensible reading of the Reasons.</p>    <p><a name="p390" class="para" id="p390">390.</a>  Contrary to ground 18, the judge was fully aware of the onus and burden of proof. He gave himself, as unnecessary as it may havebeen to do so, impeccable, concise directions at Â§Â§547 â 551.  It is correct that he spent some time detailing the evidence hefound proven and applying it to the case against Lam: that was a course he followed in respect of each accused. It cannot be gainsaidthat he had been made abundantly aware of the suggested inadequacies in the prosecution case, by experienced counsel who addressedhim at considerable length at both the conclusion of the prosecution case and in final submissions. In real terms, this is anothercomplaint concerning the judgeâs style of expression, with which I have already dealt.</p>    <p><a name="p391" class="para" id="p391">391.</a>  Ground 19 complained of the judge's refusal to find that there was no <i>prima facie</i> case for Lam to answer at the conclusion of the prosecution case.  The judge correctly set out in Â§364 the principles which areto be applied to such a submission, which emerge from <i>R v Galbraith</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%2073%20Cr%20App%20R%20124" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 73 Cr. App. R 124.</a>  He provided detailed and compelling reasons for not accepting the submissions, which were made on behalf of all of the accused andnot only Lam.  The judge went into considerable detail for his ruling in respect of each accused on each of the charges he or shefaced, as appears from the Reasons.  Indeed, it was at this stage that he dealt with the problem which he perceived arising as aresult of the person who interpreted Mandyâs affirmation to her from English into Cantonese not having been affirmed.  He was rightin making the findings that he did.</p>    <p><a name="p392" class="para" id="p392">392.</a>  The final ground, ground 20, asserted that the conviction is unsafe and unsatisfactory.  For the reasons which I trust have emergedfrom dealing with each of the grounds advanced, I do not accept that to be the case.</p>    <p><a name="p393" class="para" id="p393">393.</a>  Apocalyptic alarms have been rung concerning the effect on the legal profession as a whole consequent upon Lamâs conviction: this,it was suggested, because the convictions are predicated upon the existence of a duty by a solicitor (and, by extension, a barrister)being obliged to satisfy himself as to the genuineness (for lack of a better word) of a clientâs claim. If a client makes an assertionthen why, it is asked, should the professional not rely on those instructions - excluding, presumably, the patently absurd?</p>    <p><a name="p394" class="para" id="p394">394.</a>  That is a question which may need to be addressed at another time for that was not the prosecution case, nor was it the basis uponwhich the judge approached his decision making process. The prosecution case was simple â that there was, from the very outset,an agreement between the named conspirators to pervert the course of justice by influencing Becky against providing assistance orinformation to the ICAC. To paraphrase the judgeâs appreciation of the prosecution case when considering that against Egan, theywere all âin itâ from the very beginning.</p>    <p><a name="p395" class="para" id="p395">395.</a>  The conduct of Lam, so the judge found, went far beyond the conduct of a solicitor acting on behalf of a client.  There was no suggestionthat there is a duty upon a solicitor or, come to that, a barrister to whom different considerations apply, to have a belief in thevalidity or truth of his clientâs proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p396" class="para" id="p396">396.</a>  An analogy is to be drawn with the situation where a law enforcement agency is proscribed by solicitor/client privilege from monitoringtransactions in respect of genuine solicitor/client transactions but such a restriction does not apply where the solicitor/clientrelationship is merely a sham to conceal unlawful conduct on the part of the solicitor: see <i>Secretary for Justice v SHUM Chiu and Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%201%20HKLRD%20155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 1 HKLRD 155.

He was convicted, after trial, on charges 4 and 5, two charges of attempting to disclose information about the identityof a participant in the witness protection programme: he seeks leave to appeal those convictions.

He outlined the underlying theme of Egan's defence in respectof the charge which was that he was merely acting on legitimate instructions; there was nothing on the face of the instructions themselvesthat required him to call them into question; that he had not joined in a conspiracy at any stage.</p>    <p><a name="p402" class="para" id="p402">402.</a>  At Â§613 judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ I must consider whether an inference of knowledge or belief that [Becky] was not unlawfully detained and did not seek releasefrom custody could be drawn against [Egan].

I am sure [Egan] knew that [Derek] and [Lam] had an interest in the <i>habeas corpus</i> application.

He wrotedown [Derek's] name instead of [Mandy's] name in his notebook, although he did not write down [Derek] was his client.  On the otherhand, he would not have written down [Derek's] name unless he thought [Derek] was closely related to the case.  He effectively told[Derek] the outcome of the hearing before Yam J.  [Egan] tried to liken his mistrust of the ICAC to the queries by Yam J. and HartmannJ.

On reading the Reasons, it seemed to me that the judge was saying that he had to consider whether Egan knew everythingdone in regard to Becky was a sham, which would have the obvious consequence of placing a wider evidential burden on the prosecution.However, in the Case Stated (Â§13) the judge appears to assert that he limited his consideration to the status of the <i>habeas corpus</i> application.</p>    <p><a name="p406" class="para" id="p406">406.</a>  It is clear from Â§620 of the Reasons that the judge was satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt - which, as Mr Reynolds, who appearedfor Egan in this appeal but not below, was at pains to remind us is the requisite standard - that Egan had conducted himself in amanner that demonstrated that he ââ¦must have known, and intended, that his acts would have the tendency of influencing BeckyWongâ.  The judge had earlier identified this as being the intention required for the commission of the offence of perverting thecourse of justice and had expressed himself as being satisfied that the evidence established that the other three accused also heldthat intention.</p>    <p><a name="p407" class="para" id="p407">407.</a>  The judge then went on to acquit Egan on the basis that the prosecution had failed to prove that Egan knew or believed that Beckywas not unlawfully detained and did not seek release from custody of the ICAC, observing that he could not be sure that Egan "â¦knew[the <i>habeas corpus</i> application] was a sham".</p>    <p><a name="p408" class="para" id="p408">408.</a>  The effect of the judge's finding, as emerges from the Reasons, is that he made no further findings concerning Egan.  In view ofthe order that I would propose, it is not appropriate for me to make any further comment on what findings the judge ought to havemade.</p>    <p><a name="p409" class="para" id="p409">409.</a>  The judge made two further oblique references to Egan's lack of participation in the conspiracy - at Â§632 that âThe result ofinvolving the press was achieved notwithstanding [Egan] was not in the conspiracy" and at Â§674 "I find that he did intend to disclosewhen he made the disclosure to Magdalene Chow <i>albeit</i> not within the conspiracy of the first charge" but it is clear that, rather than individual findings of fact that Egan was not aparty to the conspiratorial agreement as has been suggested on Egan's behalf, those were observations consequent upon the basis ofhis earlier acquittal of Egan.</p>    <p><a name="p410" class="para" id="p410">410.</a>  In the Case Stated, after summarising the evidence the judge said the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â13.

It is quite clear from Â§620 of the Reasons, set out at Â§109 above, that the reason why the judge acquitted Eganwas because (a) he had found that knowledge or belief that Becky was not unlawfully detained and did not seek release from custodyof the ICAC was an essential element of the offence and (b) he was not satisfied that that had been proven by the prosecution.</p>    <p><a name="p413" class="para" id="p413">413.</a>  Â§13 of the Case Stated adverts to a material fact â his inability to make the finding that Egan knew the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings to be a sham - which, obviously, may have helped the judge arrive at his decision as to whether the prosecution had proventhe perceived element of the offence.  It is not a separate basis of acquittal.  Â§20 is simply a consequential consideration ofthe basis of the acquittal.</p>    <p><a name="p414" class="para" id="p414">414.</a>  It seems to me that, with respect, the judge confused what it is necessary for the prosecution to prove as being one of the essentialelements of the offence with evidentiary considerations which he need address in arriving at that proof.  The judge had to be satisfiedthat the prosecution had proven both the <i>actus reus</i> and the <i>mens rea</i> of the offence.</p>    <p><a name="p415" class="para" id="p415">415.</a>  The existence of a conspiracy is sometimes proven by the evidence of one conspirator against his co-conspirators; sometimes by aconfession by a conspirator admitted into evidence against him; sometimes solely by the proof of a series of facts from which thetribunal is invited to draw as the irresistible inference the existence of the conspiracy; sometimes by an amalgam of the three.This trial fell into the fourth category, for there was evidence from the named co-conspirator, Frankie Cheung, as well as proofof a series of facts upon which the prosecution relied.</p>    <p><a name="p416" class="para" id="p416">416.</a>  A conspiracy is simply an agreement between two or more persons to perform an unlawful act or a lawful act by an unlawful means,as the judge rightly recognized.  The <i>actus reus</i> of the offence is the agreement itself, the <i>mens rea</i> being the intention of the particular conspirator to be a party to the agreement and ââ¦to play some part in the agreed courseof conduct in furtherance of the criminal purpose which [it] was intended to achieve.â (<i>R v Anderson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20AC%2027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] AC 27</a> at 39E).</p>    <p><a name="p417" class="para" id="p417">417.</a>  In this case, the prosecution alleges that the unlawful act which the conspirators agreed to perform was that of perverting thecourse of justice.  Perverting the course of justice is a substantive offence which consists in the doing of an act which has a tendencyto pervert the course of justice or perform an act with an intent to pervert the course of justice (<i>R v Rogerson &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=107%20ALR%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">107 ALR 225</a> at 230). The gist of the offence is conduct which may lead, and is intended to lead, to a miscarriage of justice whether or not amiscarriage actually occurs (<i>R v Machin</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20WLR%20763" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 W.L.R. 763</a> at 767).  The use of unlawful means is not an essential ingredient of the offence: the gist of the offence lies in telling a potentialwitness what he should or should not say - or, I would add, intimidating a potential witness - with the intention of influencinghis evidence, not in the means adopted (<i>R v Toney</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20WLR%20364" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 W.L.R. 364</a> at 368 - cf. <i>R v Kellett</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%201%20QB%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 1 QB  372</a> at 388D).</p>    <p><a name="p418" class="para" id="p418">418.</a>  Neither of these encapsulations envisages the incorporation, as an essential element of the offence of conspiracy to pervert thecourse of justice, the necessity to prove, in the instant case, the state of knowledge or belief of the conspirators regarding thenature of Beckyâs remaining with the ICAC and any desire for release, as opposed to their intention.  At the risk of stating theobvious, proof of knowledge or belief may aid the proof of intention.</p>    <p><a name="p419" class="para" id="p419">419.</a>  The prosecution case, as I understand it, was not that the act that had the tendency to pervert the course of justice which theconspirators would perform was the bringing of the <i>habeas corpus</i> application as has been the focus of much argument, but it was that of influencing her against providing assistance or informationto the ICAC.  To do this they needed to gain access to her: the <i>habeas corpus</i> application was one method of doing so.</p>    <p><a name="p420" class="para" id="p420">420.</a>  If they succeeded in so influencing Becky the prosecuting authority would be deprived of the evidence of a material witness, toits detriment. They intended, the prosecution asserted, to perform that act with the consequence that the course of justice be perverted.It was the act of influencing her against providing assistance or information to ICAC which would have the tendency to pervert thecourse of justice. For that reason it did not matter whether Becky was being held against her will or not, nor did it matter whethershe was seeking release from the ICAC or not: the conspiratorsâ intention was to influence her against providing assistance orinformation to ICAC and that could be done irrespective of her status or wishes.</p>    <p><a name="p421" class="para" id="p421">421.</a>  When the prosecution alleges a conspiracy it is incumbent upon it to identify, amongst other things, the parties to the agreementand the object/s (or term/s) of the agreement.  It is only the object/s of the agreement which need be proved in order to securea conviction.

It is unfortunately so that thedrafting of the particulars of a charge of conspiracy may fail to clearly identify and distinguish between (i) the object/s of theconspiracy; and (ii) those overt acts on the part of the conspirators which tend to prove the existence of the agreement betweenthem.</p>    <p><a name="p424" class="para" id="p424">424.</a>  In many instances, as in this, there will be a close relationship between the object/s and those acts which lead to the inferenceof the conclusion of the agreement.

What the judge had to be satisfied about was that each applicant, forhim/herself, had agreed with one or more or all of the other applicants that they would (i) gain access to Becky Wong;  (ii) ascertainwhat she had said to the investigators of the ICAC; and (iii) influence her against providing assistance or information to the ICAC:that each applicant intended that the offence would be carried out: that, in order to achieve those objects, one or more or all ofthe acts set out in paragraphs (a) to (d) of the particulars of the charge would be performed.</p>    <p><a name="p427" class="para" id="p427">427.</a>  In <i>Rogerson &amp; Ors, supra,</i> at 230 Brennan and Toohey JJ said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"At common law, attempting to pervert the course of justice, like perverting the course of justice, is a substantive offence.

Such an agreement importsa common intention among the conspirators that an act be done by somebody which will have the effect of perverting the course ofjustice."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and, further:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...

But, if the act to be done isof such a nature that its tendency to pervert the course of justice is not manifest, proof of an agreement that the act be done doesnot, without more, amount to prove the conspiracy to pervert the course of justice: <u>in such a case there has to be a proof of an intent to do an act that will have the effect of perverting the course of justice</u>.â [emphasis supplied]</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p429" class="para" id="p429">429.</a>  It is important to appreciate the fact that <i>Rogerson &amp; Ors</i> recognizes that two situations exists: either (a) the conspirators know that the act which they intend to perform will have a manifesttendency to pervert the course of justice or (b) they agree to perform an act which they intend to have that effect.  This was emphasisedwhen the Court went on to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"To establish a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, it is necessary to prove an agreement to do an act which the conspiratorseither know will have a manifest tendency to pervert the course of justice <u>or which the conspirators intend to have such an effect.</u>"  [emphasis supplied]</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and, again, at 234:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"When the Crown must rely on inference to prove the intent of the alleged conspirators to pervert the course of justice by the doingan act which tends to mislead the police in the conduct of an investigation into a possible offence, the evidence must be capableof supporting at least:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1) an inference that the conspirators believed that the police might invoke the jurisdiction of the court or of some competent judicialauthority or might invoke that jurisdiction unless the relevant act deflected them; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2) a further inference that the conspirators either knew that the relevant act would have a manifest tendency to pervert the courseof justice in a relevant respect <u>or intended that the action had that effect.</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It is not sufficient for the Crown to prove merely an intention to deceive the police"  [emphasis supplied]</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p430" class="para" id="p430">430.</a>  Bearing in mind the act which the prosecution alleged the conspirators agreed, it was necessary for the judge to be satisfied thatthat act was intended to be performed so as to pervert the course of justice, for their acts, by themselves, would not have had aâmanifest tendencyâ to pervert the course of justice.  That intention, of course, is precisely what the judge did find in respectof each of the applicants.</p>    <p><a name="p431" class="para" id="p431">431.</a>  In order to arrive at his finding the judge was entitled to look at the conduct of each applicant (and all of them, within the limitsof the co-conspirator rule) including the conduct alleged in the four particularised items.  If the judge was satisfied that theevidence as a whole established, beyond reasonable doubt, the irresistible inference that any particular applicant was a party tothe agreement and had intended to play some part in the agreed course of conduct in furtherance of the criminal purpose, then itwas open to the judge to convict that applicant.</p>    <p><a name="p432" class="para" id="p432">432.</a>  What the prosecution did not allege was that the four stipulated overt acts were objects/terms of the conspiracy: it was not theprosecutionâs case that they specifically agreed, for example, that one or more or all of them, in pursuance of the conspiracy,would launch <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings. Indeed, the evidence shows that those proceedings were launched well after the conspiracy had commenced. Those proceedingswere not alleged to be, and nor were they, an element of the offence (in the sense of being an essential object/term of the agreement)but merely <u>one of</u> the overt acts upon which the judge was entitled to rely in order to be satisfied that he was able to infer the existence of theconspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p433" class="para" id="p433">433.</a>  It is for this reason that whether Egan knew or believed that Becky was not unlawfully detained and did not seek release from custodyof the ICAC or, consequently or otherwise, knew that the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings were a sham, were not individual issues about which the judge need be satisfied, although, if he were able to be satisfiedabout either of those issues, his task of inferring Eganâs intention may well have been made the easier: the fact of which thejudge had to be certain was that it was his intention, in common with the co-conspirators, to gain access to Becky Wong; to ascertainwhat she had said to the investigators; and to influence her against providing assistance or information to the ICAC with the intentionthat, as a result of that influence, she would not provide assistance or information to the ICAC, and the course of justice wouldthus be perverted. This is precisely what he found Eganâs intention to be, as well as that of the other three applicants.</p>    <p><a name="p434" class="para" id="p434">434.</a>  It is self-evident that if the judge was satisfied that a particular applicant indeed knew or believed that the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings were a sham, that would facilitate the drawing of an inference against that applicant: but it does not follow that theinference could not be drawn from other evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p435" class="para" id="p435">435.</a>  I accept that, in a given factual situation, and, perhaps, particularly where a barrister is involved - a matter to which I shallreturn - it may not be possible for a finder of fact to make a finding in a particular case in respect of proof of <i>mens rea</i> absent being able to make a finding of knowledge or belief.  That, however, does not elevate the knowledge or belief of the partyto the status of an element of the offence: what it does is to create an evidentiary hurdle for the prosecution.</p>    <p><a name="p436" class="para" id="p436">436.</a>  I am satisfied that the judge did err in holding that the knowledge or belief that Becky was not unlawfully detained and did notseek release from custody of the ICAC was an essential element of the offence.</p>    <p><a name="p437" class="para" id="p437">437.</a>  Considerable time was occupied during the hearing of this appeal in minute dissection on behalf of the applicants of each of thethree described elements of the object of the conspiracy and, to an extent, of the overt acts pleaded in the particulars of offence. Whilst, obviously, such an approach is not necessarily inappropriate, there are times when it has the effect of obscuring the woodfor the trees.  This seems to be one such.  It was the totality of the evidence from which the judge would draw inferences and uponwhich he would base his decision.</p>    <p><a name="p438" class="para" id="p438">438.</a>  In general terms it was argued that there is no property in a witness: as a consequence it was lawful to attempt to gain accessto Becky; it was lawful to ascertain, or attempt to ascertain, what she had said to the ICAC; and it was lawful to ensure that shewas aware that she was under no obligation to co-operate with the ICAC and could refuse to do so should she so wish.  It was specificallyurged upon us, in regard to the overt act of the application for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, that, as such a course was one provided by law, the use of that procedure could not constitute an unlawful means of attaining theobject of the conspiracy, absent a perversion of the <i>habeas corpus</i> process itself.</p>    <p><a name="p439" class="para" id="p439">439.</a>  Authority and counter-authority were proffered in support of each of these propositions which I do not believe it to be necessaryto traverse for none is, to my mind, controversial or, by itself, an incorrect statement of legal principle.  But what was not reflectedby any of the individual arguments advanced was that the intention of the conspirators was to be inferred from their conduct, fromthe manner in which the, superficially legitimate, means were employed or exploited.  It is from the cumulative effect of the individualactions that the true intention appears.  And that true intention, as the judge correctly found, on the evidence as a whole, in respectof each of the applicants, including Egan, was to influence Becky against providing assistance or information to the ICAC.</p>    <p><a name="p440" class="para" id="p440">440.</a>  As Stephenson L.J. observed when giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>Kellett, supra,</i> at 388D:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Threats and bribery the means used by offenders in the cases, and any pressure by those means... would, in our opinion, be an attemptto pervert the course of justice by unlawfully or wrongfully interfering with a witness.  If he altered his evidence or will notgive it a "through affection, fear, gain, reward, or the hope or promise thereof" (in the words of the oath which used to be administeredto the Foreman of a grand jury), the course of justice is perverted, whether his evidence is true or false and whether or not itis believed to be so by him who puts him in fear or hope."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p441" class="para" id="p441">441.</a>  In regard to the second question, considerable reliance was placed on the fact that, as a barrister, Egan was under a duty to giveeffect to his instructions according to The Code of Conduct of the Bar, the relevant provision of which the Vice President has setout at Â§108 above.  That, too, is non-controversial: I did not understand Mr Wilson to dispute that.</p>    <p><a name="p442" class="para" id="p442">442.</a>  I readily acknowledge that it must be that that duty has the effect of introducing a specific consideration in the case of Egan,quite separate and distinct from the other applicants.  It is unclear from the judgment whether this was the, or a, factor whichthe judge took into account in arriving at his decision that knowledge or belief that Becky was not unlawfully detained and did notseek release from custody of the ICAC was an essential element of the offence and that before he could convict Egan he had to besatisfied that Egan knew the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings to be a sham.</p>    <p><a name="p443" class="para" id="p443">443.</a>  Where a judge is required to consider the question of the intent of a barrister appearing on a particular charge before him in circumstanceswhere that barristerâs professional duty is engaged, it may well be that the judge would find himself unable to determine the intentunless he is able to make a specific finding as to that barristerâs knowledge or state of mind.  In such a case it may well bethat the judge would adopt the attitude that the barrister's discharge of his professional duty raises a doubt in his mind as tothe barristerâs intent.  However, whether that situation arises will be dependent upon the nature of the charge and upon the evidencepresented in that particular case.</p>    <p><a name="p444" class="para" id="p444">444.</a>  Because I would refer this matter back to the judge to reconsider his decision in the light of what I view it as necessary for theprosecution to prove to be the essential elements of the offence, it would be inappropriate to express any view on whether the judgewas correct in finding that Egan must have known, and intended, that his acts would have the tendency of influencing Becky Wong.If the judge were unable to be satisfied as to that issue it would be open to him to acquit, if that caused a reasonable doubt inhis mind as to Eganâs intention; or, based on the totality of the evidence as a whole, to convict.</p>    <p><a name="p445" class="para" id="p445">445.</a>  Question 3 appears to be intended to address the judge's finding that if Egan had mixed motives, that is that he believed both thatBecky was being held against her will and that he also intended to influence her into not co-operating with the ICAC, he still wasentitled to be acquitted (Â§612 of the Reasons and Â§21 of the Case Stated).</p>    <p><a name="p446" class="para" id="p446">446.</a>  With respect to the judge it appears that he has failed to recognize the important distinction between Egan's intention and hismotive when he made this finding.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn ordinary parlance, the words "intent" and "motive" are frequently used interchangeably, but in the criminal law they are distinct. In most criminal trials, the mental element, the <i>mens rea</i> with which the Court is concerned, relates to "intent", i.e., the exercise of a free will to use particular means to produce a particularresult, rather than with "motive", i.e., that which precedes and induces the exercise of will.  The mental element of the crime ordinarilyinvolves no reference to motive:  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=11%20Hals%204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">11 Hals., 4</a><sup>th</sup> ed.

(2D) 24</a> at 33.</p>    <p><a name="p447" class="para" id="p447">447.</a>  In reply to a question by the judge Mr Wilson accepted, as obviously he was obliged to do, that if the evidence were that Egan was<u>solely</u> motivated by the belief that Becky was being held against her will, that would be the end of the prosecution (Â§610 of the Reasons),for Egan could not have had the required <i>mens rea</i> for the offence.</p>    <p><a name="p448" class="para" id="p448">448.</a>  In my judgment, whether Eganâs motive for making the <i>habeas corpus</i> application was because he genuinely believed that Becky was being held against her will or whether he simply acted unthinkinglyin terms of the instructions given to him, does not absolve him from criminal liability provided it is proved that he possessed therequisite <i>mens rea</i> of the intent to influence Becky into not co-operating with the ICAC.  I am unable to discern any reason, in law or in logic, why,in such circumstances, motive and intent could not coexist.</p>    <p><a name="p449" class="para" id="p449">449.</a>  I find support for this view in <i>Kellett, supra,</i> where, at 392, Stephenson L.J. said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhere it is made with threats - or promises â it is committed notwithstanding that the threat is a threat to do a lawful act,provided that one of the motives which activates the accused in making the fact is to intimidate the witness into altering or withdrawingevidence....

Once the judge found thatEgan believed that Becky was participating in the witness protection programme, which finding was made at Â§674 of the Reasons andin my view correctly so, not only did the entire substructure for the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings cease to exist, but persisting in prosecuting those proceedings was the clearest possible evidence supporting the drawingof the inference in regard to Egan's intent - further supported, it may be said, by his not even seeking the briefest of adjournmentsto take instructions as to further courses to be followed.</p>    <p><a name="p451" class="para" id="p451">451.</a>  Accordingly, I would answer each of the questions posed by the prosecution in the Application for Review in the affirmative.</p>    <p><a name="p452" class="para" id="p452">452.</a>  I am satisfied that, following upon the decision of this court, differently constituted, in <i>Secretary for Justice v WONG Sau Fong</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20HKLRD%20254" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 HKLRD 254</a> at 265J-266C, we have the power to refer this matter back to the judge with an order that the trial be resumed.  Despite the lapseof time since this offence was alleged to have been committed, I adjudge that to be the appropriate course in all the circumstances.Consequently I would set aside the acquittal and remit the matter to the trial judge for the trial to resume in accordance with theclarification now made as to the elements of the offence alleged in charge 1.</p>    <p class="heading">CACC248/2006: charges 4 and 5</p>    <p><a name="p453" class="para" id="p453">453.</a>  I find that I am unable to agree that the application in respect of these two charges should be allowed.  The format in which theRe-Amended Perfected Grounds of Appeal filed on behalf of Egan have been presented permits of a more generalised approach in dealingwith them although individual comment on some remains to be made, not least as a courtesy to counsel.</p>    <p><a name="p454" class="para" id="p454">454.</a>  The Vice President has set out at Â§125 the relevant provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 17</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564" class="autolink_findacts">Witness Protection Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564">Cap. 564</a> and also in some detail, the circumstances surrounding the commission of these offences.</p>    <p><a name="p455" class="para" id="p455">455.</a>  The first important issue seems to me to be whether or not this court, effectively, ought to set aside the judge's finding that,at the time the disclosures were made Egan believed Becky to be a participant in the witness protection programme.</p>    <p><a name="p456" class="para" id="p456">456.</a>  That Egan believed Becky to be a participant in the witness protection programme was a finding of fact which the judge made, havingheard the evidence from Magdalene Chow, which he accepted, and having heard Egan's evidence, which he rejected.  It is true thatthroughout his evidence Egan denied ever having believed Becky to be voluntarily with the ICAC: the judge rejected that evidencein terms. That was a course which the judge was entitled to take.</p>    <p><a name="p457" class="para" id="p457">457.</a>  He provided compelling reasons, particularly for rejecting Egan's evidence. The judge said, at Â§674:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAfter considering all the circumstances and what [Egan] have said to the courts on 15 July, I reject his evidence that he did notbelieve Becky Wong was in the WPP.  I am sure that he did believe that Becky Wong was in the WPP when he made the disclosure to MagdaleneChow notwithstanding he had instruction that Becky Wong wanted to leave the ICAC.  Before Mr Ryan said Becky Wong was in the WPP,the position was [Egan] told Daphne Lim of that and in the complaint letter of 13 July 2004, and what he had indicated to Mr Ryanthat he believed Becky Wong was in protective custody in a safe house but he had further instructions that she wanted to leave."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p458" class="para" id="p458">458.</a>  Thus it was that the judge, in addition to considering all of the evidence, was relying upon three specific aspects of the evidencewhich he set out: first, that during his first visit to the ICAC Egan in effect had conveyed to Daphne Lim that he realised thatif Becky was not being detained there by the ICAC then she was being "kept" by them somewhere else, the obvious implication fromthat being that she was co-operating with them; secondly, he communicated a similar appreciation of the situation in what has beencalled his complaint letter; and thirdly, he had indicated to Mr Ryan that he believed Becky was in a safe house but, that notwithstanding,he had instructions that she wished to leave.</p>    <p><a name="p459" class="para" id="p459">459.</a>  Moreover, the judge had before him the transcripts of the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings, including the appeal during which the following exchange occurred:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSTOCK JA: â¦what reason do you have to believe that what weâve been told by the ICAC through Mr Ryan is untrue?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Becauseâ¦itâs one hell of a story to be making up</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">EGAN:  My Lord, I donât suggest that the ICAC or Mr Ryan are in the habit of making things upâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p460" class="para" id="p460">460.</a>  Although Egan went on to qualify that statement by reference to his âlong, bitter experienceâ with the ICAC it is clear thathe was not suggesting that the information provided to the court that Becky was in the WPP was in any way untrue. Such a stance iswholly inconsistent with his professed disbelief.</p>    <p><a name="p461" class="para" id="p461">461.</a>  The judge went on to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWith the disclosure of Becky Wong being in the WPP, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, [Egan] did believe that Becky Wong was in the WPP notwithstanding he had instruction that Becky Wong wanted to leave the ICAC.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>although it is not entirely clear what it was he intended to convey by inserting the Latin expression.  Be that as it may, it wasa finding of fact, on evidence that he found credible, which he was entitled to make.</p>    <p><a name="p462" class="para" id="p462">462.</a>  Just as in the case of the evidence given by Mr Nattrass where I concurred with the Chief Judge, my view is that this is not anappropriate matter in which this court should interfere with such a fundamental finding of the judge.</p>    <p><a name="p463" class="para" id="p463">463.</a>  This is a convenient point to mention Grounds 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 which all complained of a failure on the part of the judge to evaluatethe evidence of various witnesses.  At the risk of repeating myself, the judge demonstrated that he was aware of the issues beforehim and traversed the important aspects of material witness's evidence during the course of his very lengthy Reasons.  No doubt theremay be other aspects of the evidence which Mr Reynolds would have preferred be included in the Reasons: that they were not does notmean, as I have already said in a different context, that that evidence was ignored.  The Reasons, overall, were sufficient.</p>    <p><a name="p464" class="para" id="p464">464.</a>  The judge set out, at Â§469 of the Reasons, the three questions he felt it was necessary for him to answer in order to decide whetherEgan was guilty of these offences.  The first, whether Egan believed that Becky was in the WPP was, in my view, correctly answeredby the judge in the affirmative.  Mr Wilson submitted that this was an unnecessary question for the judge to have posed.  It mayhave been but I do not regard it as necessary to decide that issue as, if it were an unnecessary question, it was one which raisedthe barrier of proof and thus was to Egan's benefit.</p>    <p><a name="p465" class="para" id="p465">465.</a>  The second question which the judge addressed was whether, possessed of that belief, Egan did disclose the identity of Becky asa participant in the WPP.  This effectively, formed the basis of ground 4 of the grounds of appeal. Again, in my judgment, the judgewas correct when he answered this question affirmatively.</p>    <p><a name="p466" class="para" id="p466">466.</a>  The judge set out Magdalene Chow's evidence at Â§Â§272, 273 and 276 of the Reasons (quoted by the Vice President at Â§140 above).At Â§Â§661 and 662 of the Reasons (quoted at Â§143 above) the judge found, in respect of each of the conversations which MagdaleneChow described as having had with Egan, the only irresistible inference to be drawn from what Egan said was that Becky was a participantin the witness protection programme.  In this sense he echoed the testimony of the witness Magdalene Chow who said: ââ¦from theconversation between Mr Egan and me that afternoon that was the only logical and reasonable inference I could draw.â  It is ofcourse necessary to look at just what it was the judge found Egan to have said in those conversations and to have regard to the contextin which it was said.  The judge conducted that exercise.  For my part, I agree with the inference that he drew in each instance.</p>    <p><a name="p467" class="para" id="p467">467.</a>  The question as to whether what he found Egan did amounted to an intention to disclose for the purposes of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 17</a> remains.  Although the judge did not specifically use the verb "disclose " at that stage, first, it is implicit from the inferencethat he drew in respect of each conversation and, secondly, he made the specific finding at Â§674:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI find that [Egan] did intend to <u>disclose</u> when he <u>made the</u> <u>disclosure</u> to Magdalene Chow albeit not within the conspiracy of the first charge.â [emphasis provided]</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p468" class="para" id="p468">468.</a>  In my judgment, it is the intention of the accused which is determinative â did <u>he</u> intend to âdisclose informationâ. It is plain on the facts, as the judge found, that by the time he spoke to Magdalene Chow,Egan believed Becky to be in the witness protection program: he made such overt references during the conversations that he had withher that, on each occasion, she could not have failed to have concluded that Becky was a participant in the WPP: on each occasionhe intended to disclose information, in the ordinary, everyday, meaning of that phrase, concerning his knowledge of Beckyâs statusâ and it is against such disclosure that the legislation is aimed.</p>    <p><a name="p469" class="para" id="p469">469.</a>  The fact that one may disclose information on more than one occasion, to the same person, does not prevent the person making thestatement from having intended to disclose that information. Nor does it matter if the information is the same â which, in anyevent, it was not, according to Magdalene Chowâs evidence â if the speaker intended to disclose the information. That the informationdisclosed may already be known to the listener does not affect the intention of the speaker: if a speaker intends to disclose informationto a listener which, unbeknown to him, the listener already knows, it surely cannot be that the speaker would be absolved from criminalliability.</p>    <p><a name="p470" class="para" id="p470">470.</a>  The third question on this topic which the judge addressed was whether Egan intended to commit the offence. Despite Eganâs denials,the judge found that he had done so: that was the only inference he could draw once he had rejected Eganâs evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p471" class="para" id="p471">471.</a>  There remains the issue of âidentificationâ, of whether the judge was correct in finding that it was Egan who imparted the informationto Magdalene Chow. This arose particularly in the context of her having said that the person who spoke to her had turned away tosmoke a cigarette: there was unchallenged evidence that Egan did not smoke: Mr Clement, who was also at Court, although, accordingto his evidence, not continuously in Eganâs company, is a smoker. A further factor is that Magdalene Chow testified that the personwho had spoken to her had made reference to âdraftingâ and to âfilingâ the <i>habeas corpus</i> application, the argument being that a barrister would not say such things: Mr Clementâs evidence was that he had performed thosefunctions.</p>    <p><a name="p472" class="para" id="p472">472.</a>  This issue of identity of the speaker was an issue which was four square before the judge. I unhesitatingly accept that it was anissue which ought to have been addressed in terms in the course of the Reasons, albeit that the judge did review the evidence ingeneral (Â§Â§652/653 and 655).  Were it but for one matter, I may well have regarded such a failure as fatal to the conviction.</p>    <p><a name="p473" class="para" id="p473">473.</a>  That one matter is that Egan accepted that he had spoken to Magdalene Chow and that he had, on his version, made a reference tothe <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564" class="autolink_findacts">Witness Protection Ordinance</a>. The judge was entitled to have regard to that aspect of Eganâs evidence as being supportive of Magdalene Chowâs assertion thatit was Egan to whom she had spoken. I am satisfied that the judge was entitled to make the finding he did.</p>    <p><a name="p474" class="para" id="p474">474.</a>  I shall refer briefly to the remaining grounds of appeal. Ground 1 submitted that it was inconsistent of the judge to acquit Eganon charge 1 yet convict him on charges 4 and 5. That does not take account of the basis of the acquittal on charge 1: it was a narrowand distinct issue, where the judge found that the prosecution had failed to prove what he thought to be an essential element ofthat offence. The offences in charges 4 and 5 were entirely separate and distinct in nature from that in charge 1. Wholly differentconsiderations applied. There was no inconsistency.</p>    <p><a name="p475" class="para" id="p475">475.</a>  Ground 2 referred to a lack of a finding by the judge that Egan should have believed that Becky was a voluntary participant in thewitness protection program. This ignores the judgeâs finding at Â§674 of the Reasons, discussed above. If this ground is to beunderstood to mean that there was no finding that Beckyâs participation was voluntary - presumably as opposed to involuntary -then such a finding is implicit in the judgeâs finding that she was a participant in the program.</p>    <p><a name="p476" class="para" id="p476">476.</a>  Ground 3 appeared to me to be a differently phrased repetition and extension of what it was suggested should have been consideredunder Ground 2. The passages from the evidence upon which reliance is placed were before the judge: there is nothing to indicatethat he was not fully aware of that evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p477" class="para" id="p477">477.</a>  Ground 11 contended that the judge reversed the onus of proof: this ground seems to me to be a re-presentation, differently expressed,of the criticism of the judgeâs finding that Egan believed Becky to be in the witness protection program. I do not accept, forthe reasons already set out, that that finding may properly be impeached.</p>    <p><a name="p478" class="para" id="p478">478.</a>  Ground 13 asserted that the judge erred in a fact and that that error led to the conviction being unsafe and unsatisfactory as aresult of the judge rejecting Eganâs evidence. Assuming that there was an error of fact, although the judgeâs finding does notseem to me to be entirely clear on this, it was not material and it cannot sensibly be suggested that that was the sole reason whyhe rejected Eganâs evidence. There is no merit in this ground.</p>    <p><a name="p479" class="para" id="p479">479.</a>  Ground 14 complained that the prosecutor did not fully put his case to Egan in the course of cross-examination, that this was âunfairâand resulted in a material irregularity in the trial. It is unrealistic to suggest that Egan was not wholly alive to the nature ofthe prosecution case, in detail, as it related to him and, indeed, to every one of his co-accused. Egan had been present throughoutthis long trial. It is recognised in Hong Kong that the decision in <i>Browne v Dunn</i> (1893) 6 R 67 is not an inflexible one (<i>HKSAR v LO Chun Nam</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282001%29%204%20HKCFAR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2001) 4 HKCFAR 1).</a>  The requirement is that where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not being truthful on a particular point, there shouldbe such cross-examination as will show that this is the proposed course: the record shows that the prosecutor put to him such aswas appropriate, necessary and fair in the context of this trial.</p>    <p><a name="p480" class="para" id="p480">480.</a>  Ground 15 comprised the catch-all ground that the conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory.
