The proposition, the correct solution ofwhich had caused me considerable doubt from the outset, was whether the particulars of the charge as laid, and the facts as established,constituted the offence of conspiracy to effect a public mischief. It was for this reason that I referred the matter to the FullCourt when the appeal first came before me as a single judge on an appeal from the decision of a magistrate. I have now had the advantageof reading the lengthy and careful judgments of my fellow members of this Court. Both of them, for reasons which are very fully stated,concur in the view that there is no specific offence of "conspiracy and the additional words "to effect a public mischief" may beregarded as mere surplusage. If that be the correct view - and I do not dissent from that view whatever my own doubts may be - thenwhen one looks at the particulars of the offence and the overt acts that the appellants were alleged to have committed, it wouldseem clear that what in fact was alleged against the appellants was not a conspiracy to effect a public mischief but a conspiracyto effect a private mischief.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> It is clear law - and my brother judges in this appeal have referred to the authorities in considerable detail - that an agreementbetween two or more persons entered into consciously and deliberately for the purpose of seeking to damage another person in hisprofession, trade or calling, can be charged as a criminal conspiracy. When one looks at the overt acts charged - and they are setout in the judgment of my brother, Huggins, J. - and accepted by the magistrate as proved, and when one appreciates that this wasthe concerted conduct and behaviour of the appellants over a period of several days whilst they were at the ballroom of the complainant,the inference, in my view, is irresistible that such conduct and behaviour was jointly directed and deliberately and maliciouslyintended to prejudice the complainant in the conduct and management of his ballroom to the detriment of his trade or business.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> I would, accordingly, agree that this appeal should be dismissed.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">Goodbody (D'Almada Remedios &amp; Co.) assigned for Appellant.</p>        <p align="left">Sceats, S.C.C. for Crown/Respondent.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:center"> IN THE SUPREME COURT OF HONG KONG</p>    <p style="text-align:center">APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:center">CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 558 OF 1970.</p>    <p style="text-align:center">-----------------</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section party --><parties>        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" align="left" width="25%">BETWEEN</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">(1) CHAN Siu-ming (D.4)</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%">Appellants</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">(2) HO Siu-lun (D.6)</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">(3) LEUNG Chuen-wa (D.9)</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">(4) LO Wai-hung (D.10)</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">and</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">The Queen</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%">Respondent</td>            </tr>        </table>        <p style="text-align:center">-----------------</p>        <!--sino section coram --><coram>            <p align="left">Coram: Full Court (Rigby, C.J., Mills-Owens &amp; Huggins, JJ.)</p>        </coram><!--sino section text -->        <date>            <p align="left">Date of Judgment: 23 April 1971</p>        </date>        <p style="text-align:center">-----------------</p>        <p style="text-align:center">JUDGMENT</p>        <p style="text-align:center">-----------------</p>        <p align="left"> </p>        <p align="left"><u>Mills-Owens J.</u>: Crown counsel sought to maintain the convictions on the grounds that if the conduct of the appellants did not fall into the categoryof a conspiracy to effect a public mischief, nevertheless the overt acts alleged and proved were sufficient to support the findingof a conspiracy to injure the proprietor of the ballroom in his business; alternatively a conspiracy to commit a breach of the peace.Thus, counsel contended, the averment of a public mischief might be ignored.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> I would agree that it is not of the essence of a charge of conspiracy that it be labelled as falling into one category or another."It matters little what label is given to the offending act" (per <u>Viscount Simonds in Shaw v.

Duke of Brunswick</u> ((1843) 6 Man. &amp; Gr. 205). But that was a civil action and the matter of criminality arose only in the arguments. There is nomodern instance of such a charge. There are, however, dicta which would tend to support a charge of criminal conspiracy for conductwhich might be said to be analogous. Thus Lord Campbell is reported as saying in Parliament in 1859: "If two men agree to blow theirnoses together during Divine Service so as to disturb the congregation, they may be indicted for conspiracy" (Hansard, 1st March1859), but disturbing Divine Service was a statutory offence (52 Geo. 3, c.155, sec. 12). In the case of <u>Mogul S.S. Co. Ltd. v. McGregor Gow &amp; Co.</u> in the House of Lords ((1892) A.C. 25) Lord Halsbury referred to "a combination to insult and annoy", and said, at p.38: "I shouldhave thought it as beyond doubt or question that such a combination would be an indictable misdemeanour". But in the same case, atp.48, Lord Bramwell introduced the qualification that a combination to violate a private right was a criminal conspiracy "where thepublic has a sufficient interest in it".</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Undoubtedly, in the 18th and early 19th centuries combinations to molest or impoverish an individual or to prevent him from carryingon his business were held to be criminal conspiracies at common law, but the law as to this was largely built up on the doctrineof 'restraint of trade'; all combinations in restraint of trade were regarded as criminal (vide Harrison on the Law of Conspiracy,pp.36-7). Efforts to maintain the common law conspiracy of 'molesting' continued in the field of trade disputes notwithstanding legislationdirected towards enabling employers and workmen to combine in the case of genuine trade disputes (see <u>R. v. Druitt</u> ((1867) 10 Cox 592) and <u>R. v. Bunn</u> ((1872) 12 Cox 316)). The dicta in those cases were expressly disapproved by a court of five judges presided over by Lord ColeridgeC.J. in Gibson v. Lawson ((1891)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20QB%20545" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 Q.B. 545</a>, at p.560). In Curran v. Treleaven the same court, at p.563 of the same report, said -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"(The Recorder) cites in support of his view some phrases from the judgments of the Lords Justices in the case of the <u>Mogul Steamship Co. v. McGregor and others</u> (1) . But with deference, he has some what misapprehended the point of these observations. It is true that where the object is injury,if the injury is effected, an action will lie for the malicious conspiracy which has effected it; and, therefore, it may be thatsuch a conspiracy, if it could be proved in fact, would be indictable. But it was pointed out in some detail by the Court of firstinstance, that where the object is to benefit oneself, it can seldom, perhaps it can never, be effected without some consequent lossor injury to someone else. In trade, in commerce, even in a profession, what is one man's gain is another's loss; and where the objectis not malicious, the mere fact that the effect is injurious does not make the agreement either illegal or actionable, and, therefore,it is not indictable. The Recorder finds that there were no malice in fact, and this finding is inconsistent with the conclusionthat the agreement was either criminal or unlawful."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left">Lord Field, in his judgment in the Mogul case, (at p.52) said that in all the cases in which agreements to do acts injurious to othershave been held indictable as conspiracies "it will be found that there existed either an ultimate object of malice, or wrong, orwrongful means of execution involving elements of injury to the public, or, at least, negativing the pursuit of a lawful object".</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> In the case before us, the question must then arise whether there was malice in fact.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> So far as trade disputes are concerned the next step was the setting up of a Royal Commission, following whose report the Conspiracyand Protection of Property Act 1875 was passed. Section 3 of the Act rendered lawful combinations in the field of trade disputes,and freed the law of criminal conspiracy from doubt in that field. Section 7 was general in its terms and the corresponding enactmentin the Hong Kong legislation is sec. 27 of the Public Order Ordinance (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/245">Cap. 245</a>) which section was repealed and replaced by OrdinanceNo. 31 of 1970, no doubt because the original section 27 is repeated in the same terms in section 47 of the Trade Union RegistrationOrdinance (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/332">Cap.332</a>).

It might,perhaps, be suggested that these provisions have superseded the common law with regard to combinations to molest or annoy or to injurea person in his trade or business (otherwise than in the course of trade disputes). The Ordinance, however, is expressed to be anOrdinance to amend and consolidate the law, and, on principle, it would appear that it may not be taken to have that suggested effect(of. <u>R. v.

R.</u> ((1844)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=11%20Cl%20%26%20F%20155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">11 Cl. &amp; F. 155)</a> The definition has been cited in many cases, including in the Court of Appeal in the <u>Mogul case</u> ((1889)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=23%20QBD%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">23 Q.B.D. 598)</a> by Bowen L.J. at p.616, where, however the learned Lord Justice said that that it was 'necessary to be very careful not to pressthe doctrine of illegal conspiracy beyond that which is necessary for the protection of individuals or the public'. But, as it hasbeen observed, the definition does not state whether "unlawful", whether in the ultimate aim or the means used, is used in the senseof criminal or includes tortious conduct. In <u>R. v. King</u> ((1844)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=7%20QB%20782" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">7 Q.B. 782)</a>, Lord Denman himself doubted his own definition. The often-quoted definition of Willes J. in Muleahy v. R. ((1868)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=LR%203%20AL%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">L.R. 3 A.L. 300</a> refers expressly to agreements "punishable if for a criminal object or for the use of criminal means", which definition was acceptedby the House of Lords in that case, and in subsequent cases (per Lord Cairns at p.374; in <u>Quinn v. Leathem</u> (supra) per Lord Brampton at p.529; and in <u>R. v. Brailsford</u> ((1905)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20KB%20730" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 K.B. 730</a> at 746). This definition is not wide enough to include, e.g., a conspiracy to defraud by non-criminous means. In <u>R. v. Parnell</u> ((1881) 14 Cox 505) Fitzgerald J. included the case "where the object is to do injury to a third party or to a class, though if thatinjury were effected by a single individual it would be a civil wrong but not a crime"; to the same effect is the definition givenby Cockburn C.J. in <u>R. v. Warburton</u> ((1870) L.R. 1 C.C. 274). The Royal Commission of 1874 presided over by Cockburn C.J. reported that -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Conspiracy may be divided into three classes. First, where the end to be accomplished would be a crime in each of the conspiringparties, a class which offers no difficulty. Secondly, where the purpose of the conspiracy is lawful, but the means to be resortedto are criminal. The third and last case is where, with a malicious design to do an injury, the purpose is to effect a wrong, thoughnot such a wrong as when perpetrated by an individual would amount to an offence under the criminal law."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left" class="quote">"Wrong" was, apparently, intended to mean a civil wrong, so that, in the opinion of the Commission, it is a criminal conspiracy tocombine to commit a tort to the injury of a third person where the design is maliciously to injure him. "Malicious" in the area oftort means with an improper motive, such as spite or ill-will, or as Lord Summer put it, in <u>Sorrell v. Smith</u> ((1925) A.C. 700, at p.731) with 'malevolence'. Although, therefore, as it is often said, the agreement or combination is the gistof the offence, "mere concert in itself is not a crime" (per Serjeant Talfourd in his edition of Dickinson's Guide to the quarterSessions); it is necessary to prove an agreement of a certain character. On the other hand, as it is suggested in the present case,the agreement may be inferred from conduct (see <u>R. v. Hunt</u> ((1820) ...(illegible) St. Tr. (N.S.) 171;) <u>R. v. Parsons</u> ((1762) 1 Win. B1. 391); <u>R. v. Brisac</u> ((1803)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=4%20East%20164" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">4 East 164)</a>; <u>R. v.

It is clear that a conspiracy to damage a personin his legal rights by almost any degree of fraud or deceit will constitute a criminal conspiracy (vide Harrison, p.86). Where theobject is to defraud the public no doubt such a conspiracy may be framed as 'to effect a public mischief; there are a number of moderninstances. Turning to combinations to commit a tort not involving fraud or deceit, the position is confusing. On the one hand, thereare the sweeping dicta, referred to earlier, to the effect, prima facie, that combination to commit any tort is a criminal conspiracy.So also, but dubicusly, is the statement of Erle J. in <u>R. v. Duffield</u> ((1851) 5 Cox 404): "A conspiracy to injure a man in his private property; a conspiracy to prevent all customers coming to his shop- what is that but a civil injury? A conspiracy to injure - two men combining to interfere with a man's civil right - is indictable."</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In the more recent case of <u>R. v. Whittaker</u> ((1914)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=10%20Cr%20AppR%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">10 Cr. App.R. 245)</a> A.T. Lawrence J. proposed a more limited definition, when he said: "It is sufficient that the agreement should be to do any act unlawfulor wrongful in the sense of being a tort on another person, at any rate where there is fraud or corruption involved." Harrison, writingin 1924, says: "It is conceived, therefore, that there is no reliable authority for saying that a conspiracy to commit a tort iscriminal, except where a fraud is involved ....... or a "malicious" tort, or one causing a public mischief." In the case of Bramley((1946) 11 J. Cr. L. 36) five persons were charged with conspiracy to trespass and to commit forcible entries, and also with forcibleentry itself, contrary to the Statute of Forcible Entry, 1381. Stable J. ruled that a conspiracy to deprive a person of his legalrights was criminal if having regard to the numbers involved, the methods adopted, and the magnitude of the common aim, the juryconsidered that the matter far transcended the sphere of civil law and passed into that sphere where it became a matter of publicconcern of citizens interested in the maintenance of good order and security. Professor Glanville Williams, in his 'Criminal Law',at p.699, comments on this case as follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"On this direction, which seemed to allow the jury to turn tort into crime, the jury found the accused guilty on all counts. No appealwas taken, perhaps because the conviction was clearly correct on the point of forcible entry; and in the absence of an appellatepronouncement it cannot be said with confidence that Stable J.'s ruling represents the law."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left">In Shaw v. D.P.P. (supra) Lord Reid, at p.456, said:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"To commit a tort - yes in certain cases, but for somewhat similar reasons it seems to be at least doubtful whether it is an offenceto conspire to commit a tort which is neither malicious nor fraudulent nor accompanied by violence. Then there is undoubtedly a thirdclass of act which an individual can do with impunity but a combination cannot. Perhaps the best known example is conspiring to injurea man in his trade if done without justification. I need only refer to the series of cases in this House from <u>Mogul S.S. Co. v. McGregor, Gow &amp; Co.</u> (12) to <u>Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co., Ltd. v. Veitch</u> (13). No one has ever attempted to define what makes an act 'unlawful' so as to bring it within this class, the law seems to be haphazarddepending largely on historical accident. Perhaps as good a summary as any is that which goes back to early editions of ProfessorKenny's book (now s.451):</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"..... certain other acts ..... which ...... are not breaches of law at all, but which nevertheless are outrageously immoral or elseare, in some way, extremely injurious to the public.""</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left">This appears to put the class of conspiracy to injure a person in his trade into the category of public mischief, consequently requiringextreme injury to the public if it is to be criminal; on the other hand, it recognises the category of malicious tort. To the sameeffect is the statement of Lord Tucker at p.462:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"The difficulty with regard to this third class of conspiracy has always been to define its limits or give it a label which will includeall its manifestations. It was referred to by Viscount Simon, L.C., in <u>Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co. Ltd. v. Veitch</u> as one in which 'the purpose aimed at, though not perhaps specifically illegal, was one which would undermine principles of commercialor moral conduct". The late Professor Kenny in his Outlines of Criminal Law (11th Edn.) at p.290, in a passage which is repeatedin later editions, wrote:</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'An unlawful purpose. The term "unlawful" is here used in a sense which is unique; and, unhappily, has never yet been defined precisely.The purposes which it comprises appear to be of the following species: .... (iv) Agreements to do certain other acts, which (unlikeall those hitherto mentioned) are not breaches of law at all, but which nevertheless are outrageously immoral or else are, in someway, extremely injurious to the public.'"</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left">At p.698 of his book Professor Glanville Williams comments, and I would accept it, as follows:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Even if the tort doctrine of conspiracy to injure has any place in the criminal law, it must be subject to the limitation, establishedin the law of tort, that what is done bona fide in the use of a man's own property, or in the exercise of a man's own trade, is notwrongful."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left">At p. 697 he refers to the case of <u>Levy</u> (supra):</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"where persons were ruled guilty of conspiracy who had banded together to make great noises and to knock violently against the wallof a house in which the prosecutrix lay, when she was giving birth to a child. It is not easy to collect the effect of this decision,which is not of high authority, and there may be thought to be a danger in admitting that any agreement to commit a malicious tortis a criminal conspiracy. There is in fact a much narrower way of supporting the decision in Levy than the doctrine of malicioustort, namely, that the conspiracy in that case was to insult and annoy."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left">Harrison, dealing with the theatrical cases, at pp.118-120, says:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"We come next to the theatrical cases (supra, p.30), which have so frequently been cited by those who hold wide views as to the scopeof the offence of conspiracy, both in its criminal and civil aspect, <u>R. v.

Here the point at issuewas the fact of the riot, and when the jury had given their verdict for the plaintiff, on the ground that the arrest was illegal,the foreman explained that some of the jury proceeded on the ground that the riot was over at the time of the arrest, others on theground that plaintiff did not instigate the riot.

It seems impossible to argue that the case is an authority for the criminalityof a conspiracy to injure except by assuming that it decided that such a conspiracy gives rise to an action for damages (a pointwhich will be considered in the next chapter), and that if a conspiracy is a civil wrong it must therefore be also a criminal offence."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left">At pp.146-8, Harrison suggests a classification of criminal conspiracies; his class (6) is as follows:-</p>        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>                <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">(6) Conspiracy to injure a private individual; here the injury to be effected may constitute a tort (in which case it must, it wouldseem, be either fraudulent - when the combination falls under heading (4) above, or malicious - see <u>R. v.

It has, indeed, been frequently suggested that no such species of conspiracy exists, and this heading iscertainly the one upon which the greatest uncertainty prevails. The truth of the matter would appear to be that up to the end ofthe eighteenth century no reliable authority for such an offence can be found, beyond a number of general statements which were clearlyobiter dicta. Various combinations of this kind had, however, been prohibited by statute, and it seems clear that, when these statutoryrestrictions were swept away or greatly modified in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, a strong impression prevailed amongstlawyers generally that a "conspiracy to injure" a private person was indictable at common law."</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            </tr>        </table>        <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> I would refer also to the speech of Lord Diplock giving the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of <u>Reg. v.

Your Lordships should not be zealous to use this legal fiction to create new offences of acts not previouslyrecognised as criminal at common law which Parliament itself in intervening to change the common law has not expressly penalised."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> In this state of the law, as it appears to me, the only basis upon which the convictions of the appellants in the present case might,possibly, be upheld as a matter of law is that they combined to commit a malicious tort by acting in a noisy and disorderly manner,intending thereby to injure the ball-room business, or to annoy and molest the management and attendants, doing so "maliciously",that is to say not for the protection or furtherance of their own rights - as, for example, with the intention of asserting theirright, equally with other persons wishing to resort to the ball-room, to attend there notwithstanding that, possibly because theyare not wealthy persons, they were not particularly welcomed by the management - but acting simply out of spite, ill-will or malevolence.As has been remarked earlier, there is no modern instance of such a charge, for the good reason no doubt that is such a case thecommon-sense remedy is to eject the persons guilty of disorderly behaviour, having the police standing by if necessary to preventa breach of the peace. I am reluctant to give any countenance to the proposition that such circumstances as these give rise to aprosecution for criminal conspiracy. On the other hand I cannot avoid the conclusion that technically such a prosecution lies, ifmalice can be proved. The question remains whether the findings of the magistrate justified the convictions. He did not expresslyadvert to the element of malice, nor expressly advert to the object or purpose which the appellants may have had in their own minds.Whether or not there is malice, as it is defined in this area, must be tested subjectively, not objectively, I have no doubt. Butit may be inferred, as any other matter of intention may be inferred, provided the inference admits of no reasonable doubt. In thecircumstances of the present case I am bound to agree that the only proper inference to be drawn was that the appellants acted maliciously,and accordingly to concur in the appeal being dismissed.</p>        <p align="left"> </p>        <p align="left"> </p>        <!--sino section representation --><representation>            <p align="left">Representation:</p>        </representation><!--sino section text -->        <p style="text-align:center"> IN THE SUPREME COURT OF HONG KONG</p>        <p style="text-align:center">(APPELLATE JURISDICTION)</p>        <p align="left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:center">CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.558 OF 1970</p>        <p style="text-align:center">-----------------</p>        <p align="left"> </p>        <!--sino section party --><parties>            <table border="0" width="100%">                <tr>                    <td valign="top" align="left" width="25%">BETWEEN</td>                    <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%"></td>                    <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>                    <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">1.

It will be seenthat these so-called overt "acts" include something more than a statement of acts and in some of the paragraphs there is allegedthe intent with which the acts were done.</p>            <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The argument on behalf of the appellants may be briefly summarised as a contention that although on the findings of the learned magistrate,which are not challenged, the appellants were guilty of a criminal conspiracy they were not guilty of a conspiracy to cause a publicmischief. The findings were that the appellants committed the overt acts particularised in paras. (1), (2), (4) and (5) in pursuanceof a concerted plan.</p>            <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> I think any difficulty in the case stems from the attempts which have been made over the years to categorise criminal conspiracies.Thus we find in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/221C" class="autolink_findacts">Indictment Rules</a>, a form of indictment for "conspiracy to defraud". In my view there is no crime known to the law as "conspiracy to defraud", anymore than there is a crime of "theft from a motor vehicle" or "murder in a cathedral": the crime is conspiracy and should be chargedas such or, as I would prefer to call it, as "unlawful conspiracy". That is not to say the particulars must not disclose one of thosekinds of agreement which the Common Law recognizes as criminal but merely that no useful purpose is served by trying to categorisethe unlawful conspiracy in the statement of offence in an indictment or charge. Equally, as it seems to me, there is no separatecrime of "conspiracy to effect a public mischief" and any offence which may properly be described as such ought to be charged simplyas "unlawful conspiracy". I am not unaware that in <u>Reg</u>. v. <u>Newland</u><sup>(1)</sup>, in a passage which was relied upon by Lord Tucker in the House of Lords in <u>Shaw</u> v. <u>Director of Public Prosecutions</u><sup>(2)</sup>, Lord Goddard said "it is much too late to object that a conspiracy to effect a public mischief is an offence unknown to the law.There have been at least three reported cases during the present century in which that charge has been made and convictions upheld".The Lord Chief Justice went on to name the three cases, but a perusal of the reports does not show that in any of these cases theoffence was described in the indictment as "conspiracy to effect a public mischief": rather do they suggest that the offence wassimply "conspiracy". Nor do I believe that the Lord Chief Justice ever intended to lay down that there was a separate and distinctoffence of conspiracy to effect a public mischief. Lord Reid, in his powerful dissenting judgment in <u>Shaw</u> v. <u>Director of Public Prosecutions</u>, expressed his clear opinion that "there is no such general offence known to the law as conspiracy to corrupt public morals" althoughhe conceded that a conspiracy "to say or do or exhibit anything in public which outrages public decency, whether or not it also tendsto corrupt and deprave those who see or hear it" is indictable. I find nothing in the speeches of the other learned judges whichjustifies the conclusion that conspiracy to corrupt public morals is a separate and distinct offence from conspiracy: the argumentin the House was not a purely semantic one but was concerned to ascertain whether a conspiracy to do something tending to corruptpublic morals was indictable as a conspiracy and it was fortuitous that the indictment in that case described the offence as "conspiracyto corrupt public morals". Can it seriously be supposed that a different conclusion would have been reached if the indictment hadbeen for conspiracy simpliciter? It may be convenient to label to conspiracies for the purposes of argument but one must not allowthe labels to hide the fact that the offence is always unlawful conspiracy. Lord Tucker himself warned against attaching too muchweight to such labels when he said at p.463:</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">"...... the decision of the present and other similar cases does not depend on the label which is to be attached to a particular conspiracy.Can it be doubted that a conspiracy to corrupt public morals is a conspiracy to effect a public mischief?"</p>            </blockquote>            <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> It must, however, be recognised that the attempts to categorise conspiracies have not been an idle, academic exercise but have hadthe object of introducing into this branch of the criminal law a degree of certainty which the crime of unlawful conspiracy by itsvery nature lacks. A crime which can be used to punish such a wide variety of conduct that charges of it might be used by an unscrupulousGovernment to overcome any kind of opposition and to work oppression is inevitably unpopular and the courts have been jealous toensure that the wide limits of the crime have not led to abuse.</p>            <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> It is necessary first to inquire why unlawful conspiracy ever came to be recognised as a crime and what categories of agreement havebeen held to be criminal conspiracies. It is, of course, trite law that it is the agreement itself which constitutes the crime ofunlawful conspiracy. If some kinds of agreement are performed, damage to the public is certain and the State therefore steps in,before anything has been done in pursuance of the agreement, and punishes the contracting parties for having threatened the commongood. It is the certainty of damage to the public that justifies action at a time when no step has been taken in pursuance of theagreement and when, consequently, no question can arise of prosecuting for an attempt even though the object of the agreement isthe commission of a crime.</p>            <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> When we come to consider the categories of unlawful conspiracies we see that no consistent method of division has found favour. Aconvenient starting point is the report of the Royal Commission presided over by Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, part of whose reportis cited in <u>Reg</u>. v. <u>Parnell</u><sup>(3)</sup>. There three categories are mentioned:</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">"... first, where the end to be accomplished would be a crime in each of the conspiring parties, a class which offers no difficulty.Secondly, where the purpose of the conspiracy is lawful, but the means to be resorted to are criminal as where the conspiracy isto support a cause believed to be just by perjured evidence. Here the proximate or immediate intention of the parties being to commita crime, the conspiracy is to do something criminal, and here again the case is consequently free from difficulty. The third andlast case is where with a malicious design to do an injury, the purpose is to effect a wrong, though not such a wrong as when perpetratedby a single individual, would amount to an offence under the criminal law. Thus an attempt to destroy a man's credit, and effecthis ruin by spreading reports of his insolvency would be a wrong act which would entitle the party whose credit was thus attackedto bring an action as for a civil wrong, but it would not be an indictable offence."</p>            </blockquote>            <p align="left">Lord Tucker in <u>Shaw</u> v. <u>Director</u> of <u>Public Prosecutions</u><sup>(4)</sup> indicates that some conspiracies within the third category may be indictable:</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">"It has for long been accepted that there are some conspiracies which are criminal although the acts agreed to be done are not perse criminal or tortious if done by individuals. Such conspiracies form a ... class in addition to the well-known and more clearlydefined conspiracies to do acts which are unlawful, in the sense of criminal or tortious, or to do lawful acts by unlawful means."</p>            </blockquote>            <p align="left">What are the limits of the acts properly comprehended within the third category it is not necessary to decide for the purpose of thiscase, but I agree with Mr. Justice Mills-Owens that to bring a conspiracy to commit a tort within the ambit of the <u>criminal</u> law it must be malicious, in the sense that it is malevolent. The original writ of conspiracy was of very narrow application andour present tort of conspiracy developed from a form of trespass upon the case: it is more accurately described as a trespass inthe nature of a conspiracy. As a result the tort has certain features which are not found in relation to indictments for conspiracy:see <u>Skinner</u> v. <u>Gunton</u><sup>(5)</sup>. Nevertheless there are dicta in some of the civil cases which may be of assistance to us. Thus in <u>Mogul Steamship Company Ltd</u>. v. <u>McGregor, Gow &amp; Co</u>.<sup>(6)</sup> Lord Justice Bowen said at p.616:</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">"Of the general proposition, that certain kinds of conduct not criminal in any one individual may become criminal if done by combinationamong several, there can be no doubt. The distinction is based on sound reason, for a combination may make oppressive or dangerousthat which if it proceeded only from a single person would be otherwise, and the very fact of the combination may shew that the objectis simply to do harm, and not to exercise one's own just rights. In the application of this undoubted principle it is necessary tobe very careful not to press the doctrine of illegal conspiracy beyond that which is necessary for the protection of individualsor of the public; and it may be observed in passing that as a rule it is the damage wrongfully done, and not the conspiracy, thatis the gist of actions on the case for conspiracy."</p>            </blockquote>            <p align="left">The learned Lord Justice then defined an illegal combination as an agreement by one or more to do an unlawful act or to do a lawfulact by unlawful means. He went on:</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">"The unlawful act agreed to, if any, between the defendants must have been the intentional doing of some act to the detriment of theplaintiffs' business without just cause or excuse. Whether there was any such justification or excuse for the defendants is the oldquestion over again, which, so far as regards an individual trader, has been already solved" (that is to say, whether the defendantswere merely exercising their own legal rights in the mode and manner that best suited them and which they thought best calculatedto secure their own advantage or whether they were merely acting maliciously with intent to do the plaintiff wrongful harm.)</p>            </blockquote>            <p align="left" class="quote">As to the question whether the means adopted were unlawful the learned Lord Justice said:</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">"Whether such means were unlawful is in like manner nothing but the old discussion which I have gone through, and which is now revivedunder a second head of inquiry .......... The truth is, that the combination of capital for purposes of trade and competition isa very different thing from such a combination of several persons against one, with a view to harm him, as falls under the head ofan indictable conspiracy. There is no just cause or excuse in the latter class of cases. There is such a just cause or excuse inthe former."</p>            </blockquote>            <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> One thing must be axiomatic and that is that not every conspiracy in the categories described can properly be described as a conspiracyto effect a public mischief: if it could, there would never have been any point in using that label at all, for conspiracy and conspiracyto effect a public mischief would be synonymous. There can be no doubt that any conspiracy to commit a crime or to do a lawful actby criminal means (i.e. one in our first two categories) necessarily involves an intent to effect a public mischief and if the othercategory also necessarily involves the same intent what distinction does the label indicate? In contrast to conspiracies in the firstcategory it seems to me that many in the third category, being conspiracies to commit torts, are necessarily aimed at harming privateinterests rather than public, while that category also includes agreements to do some acts which, apart from the combination, wouldnot be contrary to law, for example an agreement to facilitate the seduction of a woman (<u>Reg</u>. v. <u>Howell</u>)<sup>(7)</sup> or to prevent tenants from paying their rents (<u>Reg</u>. v. <u>Parnell</u>)<sup>(3)</sup>. Some conspiracies within the third category may, of course, be designed to harm the public rather than an individual - for examplean agreement to deceive the Benchers of an Inn of Court into admitting as a student a person not qualified (<u>R</u>. v. <u>Bassey</u>)<sup>(8)</sup>. The conspiracies in the first two of these examples could not properly be described as conspiracies to effect a "public" mischiefwhile that in the third example could.</p>            <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The argument addressed to us by counsel for the Crown appears to me to transfer the epithet "public" from the mischief intended bythe agreement to the mischief caused by the agreement. It is, as we have seen, the very basis of the crime of unlawful conspiracythat the agreement itself is harmful to the public and therefore one may fairly say that every criminal conspiracy is a public mischiefbut it does not follow that every criminal conspiracy is a conspiracy to effect a public mischief.</p>            <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> For a time there appeared to be a division of opinion among the members of the Court but it transpires that this was due not to anydisagreement as to the nature of the crime of conspiracy but rather as to the findings of the learned magistrate. He said that theprosecution had proved "the overt acts 1, 2, 4 &amp; 5 referred to in the body of the charge". I took that to mean that he foundproved not only what could strictly be called "acts" but also the intents alleged in the statement of overt acts in the body of thecharge. That is to say, I understood him to have found that the purpose of the agreement was "to interfere with the maintenance ofgood order in the Golden Fountain Ballroom ..." inter alia "by the defendants and other persons unknown acting in concert bangingchairs and tables and shouting loudly and generally making excessive noise for the purpose of disrupting the business of the ballroomand annoying the staff and management thereof and discouraging other members of the public from using the said ballroom". If thelearned magistrate's findings are to be construed more narrowly then we are driven to the conclusion that he did not apply his mindto the question of intent but only to the acts themselves. For my <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/221C#p1" class="autolink_findacts">part I</a> am prepared to hold that even if my interpretation of the findings be wrong the overt acts (using that word in its strict sense)could not have been done otherwise than with the malevolent intents alleged in the Charge Sheet; for there was no legitimate purposeto the attainment of which such acts could have been aimed. Even though the test of intent is a subjective one the failure to makean express finding as to the intent would not, in my view, be fatal.</p>            <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> On the basis that there was a finding of an intent as alleged in the Charge Sheet it has been submitted to us that this was an agreementto harm the public and, as such, was fairly described as a conspiracy to effect a public mischief. Indeed, counsel for the Crownwent so far as to submit that every indictment for conspiracy could properly be an indictment to effect a public mischief. In myview the conspiracy of which particulars were given and which was proved was one to effect a private mischief and not one to effecta public mischief. There was no suggestion of any intent to cause a riot or even a breach of the peace: the object of the conspiracywas to do acts which necessarily would harm the proprietors of the ballroom in their business.</p>            <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Is this fatal to the conviction? It is submitted by counsel for the appellants that it is, although he cannot say that the errorof description in the charge misled the appellants or their advisers or that the trial could have taken any other course had thewords "to effect a public mischief" been omitted from the statement of the offence and the words "to effect a public mischief towit" been omitted from the particulars. In view of my understanding of the learned magistrate's findings I expressly put to counselthe question whether his argument involved that if the reference to a public mischief had been omitted he could not have objectedto the conviction and he agreed that he could not: he also submitted that conspiracy charges should be avoided. (I certainly do notquarrel with the submission that such a charge should be avoided if an alternative, substantive charge can be laid). What was thepractical effect of including the erroneous words? They did not alter the allegation as to the object of the agreement, namely harmingthe proprietors by interfering with the maintenance of good order and by disrupting the business. They merely suggested that theconduct of the appellants was aimed not only at the proprietors but also at the public. The argument as it was addressed to us wasthis:</p>            <table border="0" width="100%">                <tr>                    <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>                    <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">If it could have been proved that the locally enlisted soldiers had the intention of damaging the proprietors of the dance hall byinterfering with their business, it would be a criminal conspiracy. That is not what they have been charged with. The magistratedid not amend the charge. I do not concede that there was evidence of an intent to damage the proprietors in their trade.</td>                    <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"></td>                    <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">          It is certainly an offence to conspire to interfere with someone's business."</td>                    <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>                </tr>            </table>            <p align="left">It follows from what I have said that I think that an intent to damage the proprietors of the dance hall by interfering with the businessis precisely what the appellants were charged with and that the findings justified conviction. I am satisfied that the evidence justifiedthe findings.</p>            <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Although the concession made by counsel appears to me not to leave the point open it has been suggested that an agreement maliciouslyto injure another in his business, although tortious and therefore actionable, is not indictable. That argument would find much supportin the dissenting judgment of Lord Reid in <u>Shaw</u> v. <u>Director of Public Prosecutions</u> (supra). For my <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/221C#p1" class="autolink_findacts">part I</a> can see no good sense in holding that on the one hand it is criminal to conspire to publish a book of the kind in question in thatcase and on the other hand not criminal to outrage persons in the pursuance of their livelihood by maliciously conspiring to do whatthe appellants have here been found to have conspired to do: it is at least as harmful to the State. One may talk of corrupting "publicmorals" but in truth what stand to be corrupted are the morals of individual members of the public. The public is an amorphous concept:it has no mind to judge of good and evil nor, apart from its individual members, can it have any hope of salvation. If, therefore,it is criminal to conspire maliciously to do something so outrageously immoral that it is likely to corrupt the minds of membersof the public why should it not be criminal to conspire maliciously to do something designed to damage them in their bodies or estates?I believe we shall be failing in our responsibility to the Queen's subjects if we tolerate such manifestations of undisciplined ill-willas have been proved in the present case. The Common Law of England is not so confined that it cannot protect law abiding citizensagainst such behaviour, which is but one example of the sort of mob violence so many persons today appear to think it is their God-givenright to employ in order to achieve their own ends. I am not deterred by the fact that no modern instance of such a charge as thatin the present case has been brought to our notice: there have been sufficient expressions of opinion over the years to the effectthat conspiracies to injure are indictable to satisfy me that we should not be breaking new ground or usurping the functions of theLegislature were we to uphold these convictions. Nor am I conscious that we should be interfering with any freedom of the Queen'ssubjects under the law: rather would we be upholding the freedom of the peaceful individual against the devilish contriving of themob. In <u>R</u>. v. <u>Levy</u><sup>(9)</sup> it was held to be indictable to agree to make loud noises and to knock violently against the wall of a room in which a pregnant womanlay in order "to injure and terrify her". Is not to agree to make loud noises and knock violently on tables in order to interferewith the maintenance of good order in a restaurant entirely comparable conduct? I cannot believe that the mere failure to allegethe intent to injure which was implicit in the allegation of the intent to interfere with the maintenance of good order is sufficientground for our distinguishing the present case.</p>            <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> It is one of the unusual features of the crime of unlawful conspiracy, and one which has been the subject of much criticism, thatthe question whether the acts alleged were contra bonos mores if proved is one of fact for the jury (or, upon a summary trial, forthe magistrate or judge). If the magistrate here did not direct his mind to that question his judgment is open to attack, but formy part on a consideration of the authorities I cannot see that if he properly directed himself he could possibly have come to anyconclusion other than that the offence had been proved. Whether or not it is desirable that conspiracy should continue to be recognisedas a Common Law offence (see 1 Glanville Williams's Criminal Law (2nd edition) 710 at reg.) is not a question which it is necessaryfor me to consider here. Suffice it to say I would respectfully adopt another passage from the Report of the Royal Commission whichwas cited in <u>Reg</u>. v. <u>Parnell</u>:</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">"If it be asked on what principle a combination of several to effect the like wrongful purpose becomes an offence, the answer is,upon the same principle that any other civil wrong, when it assumes a more aggravated and formidable character, is constituted anoffence, and becomes transferred from the domain of the civil to that of the criminal law. All offences, it need hardly be observed,are either in their nature offences against the community, or are primarily offences against individuals. As regards the latter case,every offence against person or property, or other individual right involves a civil wrong, which would have entitled the personinjured to civil redress were it not that owing to the aggravated nature of the wrong and the general insecurity to society whichwould ensue from such acts, if allowed to go unpunished, the State steps in, and merging the wrong done to the party immediatelyinterested in the larger wrong done to the community, converts the wrong done by the infraction of individual right into a crime,and subjects the wrong doer to punishment to prevent as far as possible the recurrence of the offence. Thus the dividing line betweenprivate wrongs, as entitling the party injured to civil remedies, and private wrongs thus converted into public wrongs, in otherwords into offences and crimes, is to be found in the more aggravated and formidable character which the violation of individualrights under given circumstances assumes. It is upon this principle that the law of conspiracy, by which the violation of privateright, which if done by one, would only be the subject of civil remedy, when done by several is constituted a crime, can be vindicatedas necessary and just. It is obvious that a wrongful violation of another man's right committed by many assumes a far more formidableand offensive character than when committed by a single individual. The party assailed may be able by recourse to the ordinary civilremedies to defend himself against the attacks of one. It becomes a very different thing when he has to defend himself against manycombined to do him injury."</p>            </blockquote>            <p align="left">I see no appreciable danger if the courts are left to decide when the subject matter of a conspiracy involves such a gross breachof good manners that the conspirators ought to be punished by the State. That not even every conspiracy which may prejudice the Stateis indictable is clear from the decision of the House of Lords in <u>Director of Public Prosecutions</u> v. <u>Bhagwan</u><sup>(10)</sup>. There the object of the conspiracy was to defeat the objects of a statute but it was held that the freedom of the individual wasparamount and that Mr. Bhagwan had done nothing which as a British subject he was not fully entitled to do. But it is otherwise withthe appellants for surely no-one would contend that they had a legal right maliciously to create an uproar with intent to damagethe proprietors of the ballroom in their business. Judges and juries have shown themselves well aware of changing customs and onlythose have anything to fear from any lack of precision in the definition of the crime who go so far beyond the limits of generallyaccepted behaviour that any reasonable person should at least see the possibility, if not the probability, that a jury, properlydirected, might condemn them. I am content to be counted among those who hold "the distinctly minority view" (if such it be) thatthe Common Law relating to conspiracy, by its very lack of precision, gives to the courts an invaluable residual jurisdiction, thoughone to be exercised with the utmost circumspection, in upholding the good government of the realm.</p>            <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> I would dismiss the appeal.</p>            <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> There has been no appeal against sentence but I would like to say that although I would hold that as a matter of strict law a criminaloffence was committed it does not necessarily follow that all conduct which thus constitutes a criminal conspiracy ought to be thesubject of a prosecution. The absence of recent authority on the matters I have been considering may well be due to wise restrainton the part of those responsible for instituting prosecutions. I cannot help thinking that the removal of the appellants from theballroom by the Police, coupled with a stern warning against repetition of such behaviour, might have been appropriate. However,I do not for a moment suggest that the sentence imposed was wrong in principle or manifestly excessive.</p>            <p align="left">  </p>            <!--sino section representation --><representation>                <p align="left">Representation:</p>                <p align="left">Goodbody (D'Almada Remdios &amp; Co.) assigned for all Appellants.</p>                <p align="left">Sceats, S.C.C. for Respondent.</p>            </representation><!--sino section text -->            <p align="left"> </p>            <p align="left"> </p>            <p align="left">(1)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281953%29%202%20All%20ER%201067" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1953) 2 All E.R. 1067</a>, 1071</p>            <p align="left">(2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%202%20All%20ER%20446" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 2 All E.R. 446</a>, 462.</p>            <p align="left">(3)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281881%29%2014%20Cox%20CC%20508" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1881) 14 Cox C.C. 508</a>, 520.</p>            <p align="left">(4)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%202%20WLR%20897" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 2 W.L.R. 897</a></p>            <p align="left">(5) 1 Wms.Saund.
