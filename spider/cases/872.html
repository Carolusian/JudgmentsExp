Yue Fung Industrial Building situated at 35-43 Chai Wan KokStreet, Tsuen Wan, New Territories ("the plaintiffs' premises'). The 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs are respectively the tenant and sub-tenantof the 1st plaintiff in respect of the plaintiffs' premises.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The 2nd defendant is the registered owner of unit 12, 3/F. of the same Yue Fung Industrial Building ("the defendants' unit'). The1st defendant has been the tenant of the defendants' unit since 2 March 1998. The defendants' unit is situated one floor above theplaintiffs' premises.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The 2nd plaintiff is a contractor in electrical installation work whereas the 3rd plaintiff is a supplier of materials for electricalinstallation work. Part of the plaintiffs' premises is used as godown and the other part as office. The office area is situated immediatelybelow the defendants' unit.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The 2nd defendant is in the business of manufacturing woven labels by the use of 2 sets of weaving machine, each of about 10 feetin height.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> It is the plaintiffs' case that since early March 1998, the employees of the 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs have heard loud noises and feltserious vibrations coming from the ceilings of the office area on the plaintiffs' premises. It is not in dispute that the noise andvibrations were generated by the 2 sets of weaving machine on the defendants' premises. The employees of the 2nd and 3rd plaintiffswere so affected and disturbed in their work that they had to be re-located to other area on the plaintiffs' premises.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The plaintiffs had since lodged complaints with the management authority of Yue Fung Building ("the Building"), Environmental ProtectionDepartment, Buildings Department and Labour Department. The management company was reluctant to take action to enforce the termsof the deed of mutual covenants of the Building ("the DMC") as requested by the plaintiffs. The Environmental Protection Departmentdeclined intervention on the basis that the matter complained of is not within the ambit of the existing legislation on control ofnoise pollution. As for the Buildings Department and the Labour Department, they also did not take up the complaints for they saidthe matter falls outside their scope of responsibilities.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The plaintiff says that in April 1998, additional false ceiling with insulation material had to be installed on the plaintiffs' premisesto reduce the noise and vibration. It is also the defendants' case that they had in April and July 1998 and after consulting thesupplier of the 2 sets of weaving machine, taken abatement action by placing rubber padding beneath the 2 sets of machinery to reducethe noise and vibration.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> It is the plaintiffs' case that, throughout the period, the employees of the 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs had measured the noise levelswith a digital sound level meter (exhibit P1) and recorded the readings. It is also not in dispute that on 22 July 1998, shortlyafter the Writ herein was issued, the 1st defendant brought 2 technicians to the plaintiffs' premises and in their presence, thenoise level was measured and recorded. The readings were 60 db(A) for the office area and 70 db(A) for the godown area when one machinewas running, and were 64 db(A) and 77 db(A) for the respective areas when both machines were operating.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> On 5 August 1998, the 2nd defendant advised that better vibration isolators had been fitted to the machinery.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The plaintiffs commenced these proceedings in July 1998. In March 1999, the plaintiffs engaged expert to measure the level of soundand vibrations. A report was subsequently compiled. In June 1999, the 1st defendant also commissioned expert to examine the situationand a report was also compiled.</p>    <p class="heading">Issues</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The defendants do not deny that the 2 weaving machines of the 1st defendant have produced noises and vibrations. They, however, denythat the noises and vibrations are excessive or such as to constitute nuisance and/or breach of the DMC. In particular, the defendantscontend that regards must be paid to the fact that the Building is an industrial building situated in an industrial area. Accordingly,the major issue between the parties is whether the level of noise and vibration emitted from the defendant's premises is excessiveor of such level as to constitute nuisance. For the 2nd defendant, there is a further issue of whether he has been in breach of hisobligations under the DMC, even if the first issue is answered in the plaintiffs' favour.</p>    <p class="heading">The Evidence</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Witnesses of Facts</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The plaintiffs had called 5 factual witnesses, who are all employees of the 2nd and/or 3rd plaintiffs. They are Mr Fung Kwai Kin,Mr Lai Ming, Mr Lo Ting, Jim, Miss Liu Yee Tung and Mr Chu Hon San, Sam. Mr Fung is the managing director of the 2nd plaintiff andMr Lai is the administration manager. Both Mr Lo and Mr Chu are sales engineers whereas Miss Liu is an invoicing clerk. They allstarted working on the plaintiff's premises before March 1998. For Mr Fung and Mr Lai, they have been working on the plaintiff'spremises since 1991 when the 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs moved in.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> In March 1998, the working areas of Mr Lo, Mr Chu and Miss Liu were directly below the defendant's premises. They testified thatone day in March 1998, they heard continuous loud noise coming through the ceiling of their working areas. They described the noiseas being of low pitch or frequency and similar to that of an engine or of the piling machine. The witnesses also felt strong andcontinuous vibrations. They said that the vibrations were so strong that the air grilles and fluorescent light troughs in the falseceiling as well as their working desks shook. According to them, the disturbance was intolerable and they, except Miss Liu, had tomove to another part of the plaintiff's premises where they have remained working since then. Miss Liu had not moved to another workingarea because her desk is at the fringe of the affected area and there is no alternative space available. The 3 witnesses said thenoise and vibrations run for most part of their working hours with very brief stops occasionally. Their mood, concentration and efficiencyare affected and they cannot communicate effectively with customers over the telephone. They testified that after attempts by theplaintiffs and defendants to reduce the noise and vibration, the level of disturbance was slightly reduced. The situation howeverfluctuates widely, and on the whole it remains intolerable. The witnesses all indicated that they do not wish to move back to workat the former office area.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Mr Fung and Mr Lai, although not working in the same area as the other witnesses, confirmed that they also heard the noise and experiencedthe vibrations when they went over to the affected area upon receiving complaints from the other witnesses. Mr Lai said that theaffected area, which measures about 800 sq. ft., has not been used since March 1998. Both Mr Fung and Mr Lai, aided by Mr Chu, hadmeasured and recorded the noise level by means of a digital sound level meter. The equipment is part of the working tools of theplaintiffs and was not specially acquired for the litigation. Mr Fung, who is a qualified engineer, is accustomed with the use ofthe meter as he has to use it in connection with clients' projects. As for Mr Lai and Mr Chu, they only learnt to use the meter inMarch 1998. Mr Lai said he had received instructions from Mr Fung on the use of the meter while Mr Chu said he had, in learning tooperate the meter, read the instruction manual. It is Mr Lai's evidence that the meter is calibrated annually to ensure its accuracy.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The readings recorded by these witnesses during the month of March 1998 ranged between 68.5 db(A) and 80 db(A). In the month of July1998, the readings were between 63 db(A) and 73.5 db(A). On 22 July 1998, after the 2nd defendant had arranged for rubber paddingto be placed beneath 1 set of machine, the reading when only 1 set of machine was turned on was 60 db(A) for the office area and70 db(A) for the godown area. When both sets of machine were turned on, the readings recorded were 64 db(A) and 77 db(A) for therespective areas. On 5 August 1998 after better quality rubber padding was fitted to the machines, the readings recorded were 65db(A) and 70 db(A) for the office and godown. Between February and April 1999, the readings recorded fluctuated between 58 db(A)and 73 db(A).</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> All the 5 witnesses accepted that as the plaintiff's premises are located in an industrial building and the building is within anindustrial area, the surroundings are bound to be noisy. They also agreed that there were noises even before March 1998. However,they all maintained that the noises and vibrations they have experienced since March 1998 are much more serious than what they hadbefore that.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> As for the 1st defendant, Mr Pang Pui Hung, one of its directors, had given evidence. He stated that, shortly after the 1st defendantstarted operation, the 1st defendant did receive complaints from the plaintiffs. He accepted that the 1st defendant's machinery didproduce noise and vibration, but disagreed that they are excessive. Nevertheless, Mr Pang said, as good neighbours, the 1st defendanthad twice added noise and vibration isolators to the 2 sets of machinery. According to Mr Pang, the 1st defendant had used all itsbest endeavours to reduce the noise and vibration and that it is unreasonable for the plaintiffs to expect an office environmentin an industrial setting.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The 2nd defendant had also testified. He gave evidence that the defendant's premises were let to the 1st defendant for a term of2 years. Upon the expiration in March 2000, the tenancy had been renewed for another 2 years. He said that he came to know of theplaintiffs' complaints in about July 1998. He then took steps to improve the situation, including arranging for and paying for thecosts of adding better quality padding to the machinery in August 1998. The 2nd defendant pointed out that the Building has alwaysbeen a noisy one because of the industrial undertakings situated inside it. He also said that the Building has a noisy surrounding.According to the 2nd defendant, no other occupants of the Building, save the plaintiffs, have ever complained about the noises andvibration coming from the 1st defendant's operation.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Much of the factual evidence in this case is not in dispute. The only areas of dispute turn on the events during the inspection bythe plaintiffs' expert and the accuracy of the readings of the digital sound level meter recorded by the plaintiffs' witnesses.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> It is the evidence of Mr Lai that when the plaintiffs' expert carried out the inspection on 8 March 1999, Mr Fung had requested thepersons in charge of the 1st defendant to turn on both sets of machinery, but the request was declined. Hence, the inspection wasconducted with only 1 set of machine being turned on. The plaintiffs' expert, Mr Sam Tsoi, confirmed this in his report and evidence.When Mr Pang gave evidence, he said that because there was no work, both sets of machine were not in operation when the plaintiffs'expert came. It is Mr Pang's evidence that the plaintiffs only requested for one set of machine to be turned on and no one had everasked for both sets of machine to be operated.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> On this point, I prefer the evidence of the plaintiffs' witnesses to that of Mr Pang. Mr Pang was contradicting himself when he saidthe 2 machines were not under operation during the inspection because there was no work when it is also his evidence that March isthe peak season for the 1st defendant's business. It is to be noted that neither Mr Lai nor Mr Tsoi was cross-examined on this point.Mr Pang did not mention in his witness statement that the reason for running only one set of machine during the inspection was aswhat he testified in court. In my view, it is inherently improbable that Mr Tsoi would not have asked for both sets of machine tobe turned on during his inspection, having regard to the purpose of his visit and the meticulous way in which he carried out theinspection and testing.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> As to the noise level measured and recorded by Mr Fung, Mr Lai and Mr Chu of the plaintiffs, the defendants' challenge is twofold.First, it was said that the measurement was not carried out in the presence of independent witnesses. Secondly, the reliability ofthe digital meter was doubted on the basis that it was not calibrated on each occasion when it was used.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> For my part, I do not consider the fact that the absence of the so-called independent witnesses is per se of significance. It hasnot been suggested that the plaintiffs' witnesses are untruthful in their evidence or have any reason to fabricate or falsely reportthe readings. As a matter of fact, all the plaintiffs' witnesses strike me as honest and straightforward witnesses. I do not believethat they would exaggerate or distort the readings. The witnesses had been cross-examined on their familiarity with the use of thedigital meter. I have no doubt that Mr Fung is well familiar with the operation of the meter as he had to use it regularly in hiswork. In the case of Mr Chu, I do not think that, being an assistant engineer, he would have any difficulty understanding the operationmanual and handling the meter. As for Mr Lai, I also accept his evidence that he knew how to operate the meter correctly, havingbeen trained by Mr Fung.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> On the question of calibration, Mr Lai's evidence clearly shows that the digital meter in question was subject to annual calibrations.The relevant certificates had also been produced. The calibration results show that the meter operated within the manufacturer'sspecification. The plaintiffs, however, accepted that, because the plaintiffs do not have the calibrator, the meter was not calibratedevery time it was used. I accept that, on that basis, it is open to doubt whether the readings recorded are absolutely accurate andwithout marginal error. The readings recorded ought therefore to be approached with caution.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Expert witnesses</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Both the plaintiffs and the 1st defendant had commissioned experts to test the level of noise and vibrations emitted by the 2 setsof machine. For the plaintiffs, they had engaged the firm called Arup Acoustics. Mr Sam Tsoi of the firm, who was in charge of themeasurement and analysis, had compiled a report and had also given evidence in Court. As for the 1st defendant, the firm of DanielChan &amp; Associates was engaged. Dr Tony Chan of the firm, who carried out the inspection and took the measurement at the plaintiffs'premises, compiled the expert report. Dr Chan, however, was not called to testify. The expert witness called by the 1st defendantis the proprietor of the firm, Professor Daniel Chan, who had endorsed and approved the expert report.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Mr Tsoi is a chartered engineer and holds academic qualifications in relation to vibration and noise controls. Since 1995, he hasbeen leading the Hong Kong office of Arup Acoustics, a specialist group within Ove Arup &amp; Partners Hong Kong. According to thecurriculum vitae provided by him, Mr Tsoi has extensive experience in the design, manufacture and installation of noise control treatmentand assessment projects, including the new airport at Chek Lap Kok and other projects locally and overseas. Counsel for the 1st defendanthad indicated that the competence of Mr Tsoi as an expert witness was not challenged. Despite that, in examining her own expert,Professor Chan, she endeavoured to lead evidence that Mr Tsoi had sought to become a fellow of the Hong Kong Institute of Acousticsbut failed. That in my view is both inappropriate and irrelevant, given that the status and competence of Mr Tsoi as an expert isnot disputed. At any rate, from the qualifications and working experience of Mr Tsoi and judging from his evidence in Court, I haveno hesitation in accepting him as an expert competent and knowledgeable in the areas of noise and vibration assessment and controls.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> In the case of Professor Chan, he is the managing director of Daniel Chan &amp; Associates and also a part-time associate professorwith the department of architecture of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He has been involved with work on environmental noisepollution and building services in the past 20 years and has issued publications and given presentations on these areas. Similarto Mr Tsoi, I am prepared to accept Professor as an expert witness.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> According to Mr Tsoi, he, together with 2 staff members of his firm, went to the plaintiffs' and defendant's premises on 8 March1999 to carry out measurement of the noise and vibration levels. He gave an account of the equipments they brought along on the occasionand also explained the procedure and steps adopted to check the equipment and carry out the measurement. The results recorded onthe equipment were produced as attachments to his report.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> In the case of Professor Chan, as previously mentioned, he did not attend the premises in question. According to him, he designedthe methodology and specified the raw data to be collected. He then instructed his assistants, including Dr Tony Chan, about themeasurement and tests to be done. His assistants made the first visit on 22 June 1999. That however was an aborted attempt becauseit was discovered afterwards that a wire of one of the equipments was broken. The second visit was made on 30 June 1999. ProfessorChan also described the equipments used, but, as he was not involved in the process of taking measurement, he was not in a positionto describe the procedure and steps adopted by his assistants. The results of the measurements were either recorded by digital recorderor noted down by his assistants. Analysis on the data collected was then carried out and the report was compiled.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Counsel for the plaintiff had complained that Dr Tony Chan was not called and not all the raw data he collected was available forthe purpose of verification. No explanation had been advanced as to why Dr Tony Chan was not called. I agree that it is unusual notto call the person responsible for the measurement and compilation of the report. It is also unsatisfactory in that those parts ofthe expert report on site observations and the process of taking measurements become hearsay, since Professor Chan was not presentat the inspection. The Court is in fact being asked to infer from Professor Chan's evidence, namely, his assistants had been trainedand fully instructed, that the equipment had been properly operated, the measurements correctly carried out and the readings accuratelyrecorded. That is clearly inappropriate. And the Court is also clearly in no position to draw such inference.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> In my view, no weight can be placed on the part of the defendant's expert report dealing with site observation, as that is plainlyhearsay. As to the results of the measurements contained in the report, little weight can be attached to it, as their reliabilityhas not been properly proved.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> The main point of contest between the parties' 2 experts, however, does not rest with the results of the measurements, but with thestandards or methods of assessment to be adopted for the purpose of determining whether the noise and vibration level is excessiveor acceptable. In assessing the noise level, Mr Tsoi had applied the British Standard BS 4142: 1997 ("BS4142"). BS4142 is a methodfor determining the level of a noise of an industrial nature by assessing whether the noise in question is likely to give rise tocomplaints by people living in the vicinity. This method involves measuring the background noise level and the noise level afterthe noise in question was added to the background noise, and then calculating the difference between these 2 noise levels. Correctionsmay have to be done to the difference ascertained by adding certain weightings where the noise in question carries certain characteristics.The difference thus established will then be used to assess the likelihood of complaints based on the table set out in BS4142.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> In the present case, from the measurements made at 5 locations on the plaintiffs' premises, the difference between the backgroundnoise level and the noise level when one machine was turned on ranges between 9dbB to 14dbB. As Mr Tsoi considered the nature ofthe noise omplained of was of fast repeated cycles with tonal and impulsive characteristics, he therefore followed the recommendationsof BS4142 and added a 5dbB weighting to the difference. The difference thus established is therefore between 14dbB and 19dbB. Thisfalls within the "complaints likely" category under BS4142, which is defined as "a reasonable person when exposed to such noise leveland/or characteristics would be dissatisfied or even annoyed, and this will probably lead to a complaint".</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Professor Chan, on the other hand, had chosen speech intelligibility as the factor for assessment. He referred to the InternationalStandard Organization (ISO) technical report TR3352-1974 ("ISO Report"), which prescribes a survey method for assessing the influenceof noise on intelligibility of speech in direct communication. Under this method, the band pressure levels in the 4 octave bandswhose centre frequencies are 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz are measured. The average value of these 4 octave bands will give the levelof the disturbing noise. The level, known as the speech interference level, is then judged by a table which sets out the maximumdistance at which normal conversation is considered to be satisfactorily intelligible, and that at which conversation at a raisedvoice is considered to be satisfactorily intelligible.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> In this case, Professor Chan's assistants measured the band pressure levels in the 3 octave bands centered on 500, 1000 and 2000Hz at 3 chosen locations on the plaintiffs' premises when, firstly, only one machine was turned on and, secondly, when both machineswere operating. The speech interference level thus calculated was 50.8db, which is right within the acceptable range of the tablein the ISO Report. Professor Chan therefore concluded that the noise level was acceptable since face to face communication is possible.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> As for vibration assessment, Mr Tsoi adopted the British Standard BS 6472: 1992 ("BS6472") which is a standard providing guidanceon human response to building vibration. The major feature of BS6742 is that it takes into account the effect of duration in assessingthe likely human response. The assessment method involves measuring the vibration dose value (VDV) or the r.m.s. (i.e. root meansquare) value of the frequency-weighed acceleration. Based on the measurements, the estimated vibration dose value (eVDV) is thencalculated, which involves the use of a constant or multiplying factor. The constant or multiplying factor is determined by referenceto the time of the day and the duration of exposure to continuous vibration as well as the use made of the building, whether it isa workshop or office and so on. The result is then judged in accordance with the prescribed complaint assessment-rating table.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Based on this method, the calculated eVDV for 3 of the 5 chosen locations on the plaintiffs' premises exceed the recommended limitfor offices under BD6742. For one of these 3 locations, the result falls within the "adverse comment probable" category of the assessment-ratingtable. "Adverse comment probable" is defined as "a reasonable person when exposed to such vibration levels would be dissatisfiedor even annoyed, and this will probably lead to a possible complaint". As for the other 2 locations, they fall within the "adversecomment possible" category of the assessment-rating table. "Adverse comment possible" is defined as "a reasonable person when exposedto such vibration levels would probably be dissatisfied or even annoyed, and this leads to a possible complaint".</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> As for Professor Chan, he preferred to use what he referred to as the European Commission Directive ("EC Directive") published in1993 as the criteria for assessing the vibration. According to Professor Chan, the EC Directive provides criteria on the risk tohealth and safety of workers resulting from their exposure to vibration. It involves measuring the r.m.s. acceleration level andcomparing it to 2 criteria called "threshold level" and "ceiling level". Vibration above the threshold level (i.e. 0.25m/s2) maycause back morbidity and trauma of the spine as well as severe discomfort. As for vibration above the ceiling level (i.e. 0.7 m/s2),it is said to be dangerous and systematic health surveillance is required.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The r.m.s. acceleration values obtained by Professor Chan's assistants at the 3 chosen locations on the plaintiff's premises producea level below 0.25 m/s2. On this basis, Professor Chan concluded that the overall vibration level was acceptable.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> In deciding which of the 2 expert opinions to adopt, I have regard not only to the reports prepared or endorsed by them and theiroral testimony, but also to the contents of the authorities they relied upon, namely, the 2 British Standards and ISO Reports. Iam of the view that the evidence and methods adopted by Mr Tsoi is to be preferred to those of Professor Chan.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> In the area of noise assessment, BS4142 clearly prescribes a more relevant and appropriate standard and method than the speech intelligibilityor interference criteria set by the ISO Report. Firstly, BS4142 relates to an industrial setting and noise of an industrial nature.Secondly, the criteria contained in the ISO Report is only applicable to face to face communication and not to telephone conversation.It therefore does not address one of the major complaints of the plaintiffs' employees, namely, the noise complained of have preventedeffective telephone communications. Thirdly, the ISO Report published in 1974 contains the following opening remarks : "It was decidedto publish the document in the form of a Technical Report as this is a subject that cannot yet be considered as suitable for an InternationalStandard. The subject is still under study and it may be found necessary to make changes in the levels of mean speech power in thefuture." Further in the <em>Introduction</em> section, it says that the mean speech power levels "may be subject to future modifications according to the results of the studiesthat are in the programme of work of WG 12 of ISO/TC43/SC 1". Plainly, the method or criteria described in the ISO Report was stillbeing developed after 1974. In answer to my queries, Professor Chan stated that he was not aware of the subsequent development. Purelyon this point alone, it would not be appropriate or safe to rely on the ISO Report when its subsequent development is unknown. Bycontrast, BS4142, being a third revised edition published in 1997, must be more reliable.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Even if the Court is to adopt the criteria prescribed by the ISO Report, the reliability of the results and the related conclusionscontained in the report endorsed by Professor Chan are open to doubts. This is because instead of measuring the band pressure levelsin the 4 octave bands prescribed in the ISO Report, only the band pressure levels in 3 of the octave bands had been measured. ProfessorChan explained that this was because 4000 Hz is not among the common bands for intelligibility, and that this octave band was includedonly for cautious sake. That may well be the case, but if we were to adopt the ISO Report as an assessment guideline, we would haveto follow fully the prescribed method of measurement. It is to be noted that in the ISO report, speech interference level is representedby the average values of the 4 recommended octave bands. The average figure of 3 of the recommended octave bands therefore cannotgive the speech interference level for the purpose of the assessment. Indeed, if the 4000 Hz octave band is included for cautioussake, it is all the more important that measurement in this octave band be obtained so as to ensure that the average value is accurate.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Apart from the ISO Report, the expert report endorsed by Professor Chan also made reference to the level of 85 db(A) prescribed insection 2 of the Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Noise at Work) Regulation, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59">Cap. 59</a>. As counsel for the plaintiffs observed,this statutory level has no application here in that it is a standard to govern the duties of proprietors of factories and industrialundertakings vis-Ã -vis their employees. It is also a standard for criminal prosecution under the legislation.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Professor Chan had commented in his oral evidence that he considered BS4142 unsuitable in that it had not taken into account thelocal conditions. Professor Chan, however, did not elaborate on what aspects of the local conditions have rendered the British standardinapplicable. This comment is therefore of no assistance to the Court. Professor Chan also observed that the terms of "complaintlikely" and "probably" too imprecise. But as he repeatedly emphasized in his evidence, we are not dealing with an absolute science.Relativity and certain degree of subjectivity are therefore inevitable in assessing the levels of noise and vibration. ProfessorChan is also critical of the addition of a 5dbB weighting by Mr Tsoi to reflect certain characteristics of the noise of the machines.He considered it too subjective. The method of adding weighting to reflect the characteristics of the noise under investigation isnot unique to BS4142. As Mr Tsoi's report shows, the Technical Memorandum published by the Environmental Protection Department inconnection with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/400" class="autolink_findacts">Noise Control Ordinance</a> also recommends the adoption of this correction method in appropriate cases. No doubt, the decision whether to add any weightingis a subjective one, but it is the subjective decision of an expert in the field. In the present case, Mr Tsoi had personally visitedthe premises in question and experienced the noise complained of. In his expert opinion, he considered the noise tonal and impulsivein nature. There is thus no basis to doubt his decision to add the weighting recommended by BS4142.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> In the area of vibration assessment, I am also of the view that BS6472 is an appropriate means of assessment. In the first place,it gives a general standard for ascertaining human response to vibrations in a building. Unlike, for instance, the EC Directive oranother standard referred to by Professor Chan, i.e. ISO2631, it is not confined to specific category of people and situations. Inthe case of the EC Directive, it is reportedly dealing with assessing hazards and injuries to the health of workers, hence addressingthe issue of industrial safety. As for ISO2631, it is apparent from the report itself that it is dealing with the health and comfortof passengers travelling on public transportation. Further, by taking into account such elements as the nature of the location inquestion and the duration of the exposure to vibration, the assessment method described by BS6472 is more comprehensive.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Professor Chan had criticized BS6472 as being too complicated. I agree that, because of the employment of various technical termsand measuring units, the text of BS6472 is not easy to read. However, the method and the theories involved are not difficult to applyor understand. The former is essentially a matter of arithmetic calculations. Professor Chan also questioned the use of vibrationdose value (VDV) on the basis that it ignores frequency. This cannot be right because the publication on BS6472 clearly states that"the vibration dose value is given by the fourth root of the integral of the fourth power of the acceleration after it has been frequency-weighted":see Appendix B. Frequency is therefore a component and element taken into account by BS6472.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> On the other hand, I have reservations on the current status of the EC Directive much relied on by Professor Chan as an internationallyaccepted standard. Mr Tsoi testified that the EC Directive first appeared in a draft form, and he is not aware of a finalized versionbeing produced. Professor Chan also accepted that he came across it when it was circulated as a draft in 1993 for comments. He isunable to say whether it has eventually been approved and adopted by the European Commission or whether it remains in draft form.There is one curious feature about this EC Directive. It is that, despite requests from the plaintiffs' solicitors, the 1st defendanthas not provided nor produced in evidence a copy of the EC Directive. Professor Chan said that he had not been able to trace thefull text of the EC Directive, but he had supplied an extract of it to the 1st defendant's solicitors. I find this all very strange.According to Professor Chan, he had on a number of occasions used this EC Directive for other cases or projects. One would thereforeexpect a copy of it to be readily available to him. One would also expect him to be well familiar with its development, includingwhether it has been finalized and passed by the European Commission. Given the state of the evidence, there must be a grave doubtas to whether the EC Directive described in the 1st defendant's expert report can be regarded as affording an internationally recognizedor approved standard for assessing the effect of vibrations.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Even assuming that the EC Directive is an internationally approved standard, its applicability to the present case is not withoutdoubt. As mentioned above, it is a standard reportedly dealing with industrial safety. That understandably is not quite the sameas the standard for assessing the disturbance and discomfort caused by vibration in a building to its occupants.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> In support of his use of the standard in the EC Directive, Professor Chan referred to an earlier decision of Deputy Judge Yeung (ashe then was) in the case of <strong>Samfit Limited v. Hoi Tung Computer Label Industrial Company Limited</strong> (unreported) HCA10291 of 1993. Professor Chan suggested that the Court in that case had approved the threshold level of 0.25m/s<sup><sup><sup>2</sup></sup></sup> as the criteria for evaluating whether vibration was excessive. It appears from the judgment that Professor Chan was one of the 2experts for the plaintiff in that action. Both he and the other plaintiff's expert were of the opinion that the noise and vibrationwere excessive and should be reduced. Professor Chan was said to have considered that the vibration could be reduced to 0.25m/s<sup><sup><sup>2</sup></sup></sup> while the defendant's expert had reservation about it. The Judge took the view that some allowance should be given to the defendant,and he therefore granted an injunction restraining the operation of the defendant's machines unless the vibration level be reducedto no more than 0.3m/s<sup><sup><sup>2</sup></sup></sup>.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> I do not read the judgment of the Deputy Judge as approving or establishing 0.25m/s<sup><sup><sup>2</sup></sup></sup> as the standard for determining whether any vibration is excessive or otherwise. It does not appear from the judgment that the DeputyJudge had been called upon to adjudicate on which standards should be adopted for vibration assessment. The judgment therefore cannotbe regarded as approving the adoption of the EC Directive.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> It is also of interest to note that in the <strong>Samfit Limited</strong> case, Professor Chan had in his report set out 3 vibration limits based on an exposure time of 8 hours per day, and 0.25m/s<sup><sup><sup>2</sup></sup></sup> is but one of them. This shows that he had also acknowledged the relevance and importance of the duration of exposure to vibrations,which is a major feature of BS6472. As a matter of fact, Professor Chan had in his report in the <strong>Samfit Limited</strong> case placed reliance on the standard in BS6472, which in his words "is frequency dependent": see pp.7-8 of the judgment.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> Having regard to the matters aforesaid, I am of the conclusion that the evidence and views expressed by Mr Tsoi is to be adoptedas the basis for determining whether the gravity of the level of noise and vibration in question.</p>    <p class="heading">Nuisance</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> There can be no doubt that noise and/or vibration can constitute the tort of nuisance. The question is whether the noise and/or vibrationamount to a material interference with ordinary comfort. This is a question of degree to be answered by reference to the facts ofeach case: per Lord Halsbury in <strong>Colls v. Home and Colonial Stores</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1904%5d%20AC%20179" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1904] A.C. 179</a>, at 185. It also involves balancing the right of a defendant to use his property for his own lawful purpose and the right of theplaintiff to the undisturbed enjoyment of his property.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> On the basis of Mr Tsoi's findings and analysis, the noise detected at the plaintiffs' premises is of a level that a reasonable manwill be dissatisfied or annoyed. This is so even when only one machine is in operation. Similarly, in relation to the vibration detectedat the godown area of the plaintiffs' premises, the level is such that a reasonable man will be dissatisfied or annoyed. As for theoffice area directly below the defendant's premises, the vibration detected is one that a reasonable man will probably be dissatisfiedor annoyed. Again, this is when only one of the machines is in operation. Accordingly, the combined effect of the noise and vibrationwhen both sets of machine are operated is clearly substantial and serious as will materially interfere with the work efficiency andordinary comfort of the people working on the plaintiff's premises.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> Indeed, it is the evidence of the plaintiffs' employees that they found the noise and vibration intolerable, and that their mood,concentration and efficiency have been adversely affected. There is also the evidence that the 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs had to provideearmuffs for their staff when they work in the godown areas. It is evident from the evidence of the plaintiffs' employees and expertthat the level of noise and vibration is serious and excessive.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> In this case, the defendants argued heavily that because the Building and its surroundings are noisy, the noise and vibration arisingfrom the operation of the 1st defendant's machines should not be regarded as exceeding the reasonably acceptable level.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> In the case of <strong>Rushmer v. Polsue &amp; Alfieri Limited</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1906%5d%201%20Ch%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1906] 1 Ch. 234</a> (approved by the House of Lords in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1907%5d%20AC%20121" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1907] A.C. 121)</a>, Cozens-Hardy L.J. rejected the argument that a resident of a district specially devoted to a particular trade cannot complainedof nuisance by noise caused by the carrying on of a branch of that trade short of proving carelessness and unreasonable use. HisLordship was of the opinion that a resident in a noisy district must put up with a certain amount of noise, and the standard of ordinarycomfort will differ according to the situation of the property and the class of people who inhabit it. The approach is thereforewhether "the addition of a fresh noise caused by the defendant's works may be so substantial as to create a legal nuisance". But"if a substantial addition is found as a fact in any particular case, it is no answer to say that the neighbourhood is noisy": atpp.250-251.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Accordingly, the facts that the Building is an industrial building with noisy undertakings and that it is situated in a busy industrialarea do not per se prevent the plaintiffs from having a cause of action. However, these are relevant considerations in deciding whetherthe situation gives rise to a claim. The plaintiffs will have no cause of action unless they can establish that the noise and vibrationsgenerated by the1st defendant's operation have brought substantial additional noise and vibrations over and above those already inexistence before the 1st defendant commenced its operation in March 1998.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> In this regard, there is the evidence of the plaintiffs' employees that the noise and vibration introduced by the 1st defendant arefar in excess of what they had experienced from the other undertakings in the Building and from the surroundings of the Buildingbefore March 1998. The 2nd defendant had vaguely suggested that the plaintiffs had previously complained of noise from another undertakingin the Building, but the plaintiffs' witnesses had denied that. No evidence had been introduced to make good this suggestion. Thereis no evidence to contradict the evidence of the plaintiffs' employees that the noise level prior to March 1998 was not as seriousas that generated by the 1st defendant's operation. This demonstrates that the 1st defendant's operation have added fresh noise andvibration that are substantial in nature. That being the case, it is no defence to say that the plaintiffs' premises is situatedin a noisy building with noisy surrounding.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> The defendants have also argued that the Building is an industrial building and is not intended to be used as office premises. Itis therefore unreasonable for the plaintiffs to expect an office setting in an industrial setting. In the <strong>Samfit Limited</strong> case (at pp.12-14), Deputy Judge Yeung, in rejecting an argument that using an industrial unit as an office is a breach of the occupationpermit, observed that it is a common feature in industrial buildings in Hong Kong that part of the unit is being used as an office.The Deputy Judge further pointed out that it matters not whether the premises are sued as a warehouse, an office or a factory becausethe occupants cannot be involuntarily subject to excessive noise and vibration.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Having regard to the evidence in this case, I have come to the conclusion that the noise and vibration produced by the 1st defendant'smachines have exceeded the reasonably acceptable limit having regard to all the circumstances of the case. They have interfered withthe proper enjoyment by the plaintiffs of their premises. The 1st defendant's wrongful acts therefore constitute an actionable nuisance.Accordingly, the 1st defendant is liable to the plaintiffs in nuisance.</p>    <p class="heading">Breach of DMC</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> Paragraph 9 of Section IV of the DMC provides, inter alia, that no owner shall do or permit or suffer to be done and each owner willtake all possible steps to prevent his tenants, occupiers or licensees from doing any act, deed, matter or thing which in any wayinterferes with or affects or which is likely to interfere with or affect the proper use and enjoyment of the Building or any partor parts thereof by other owners or occupiers of the Building.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> Paragraph 33 of the same section further provides, <em>inter alia,</em> that no owner shall do anything in any unit whereby excessive noise or vibration or other form of disturbance is created to the detrimentto other persons in the Building, and that in the event of a breach thereto by the owner, such owner shall immediately rectify thedefault and make good any damage caused to the occupants of the Building.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> Having found that the noise and vibrations emitted from the 1st defendant's machines are excessive and have affected the proper useand enjoyment of the plaintiffs' premises, the question that arises for determination in relation to the 2nd defendant is whetherthe 2nd defendant has permitted or suffered to be done and whether he has take all possible steps to prevent the 1st defendant fromemitting the noise and vibration complained of.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> The undisputed evidence shows that the 2nd defendant had as early as July 1998 taken step to try to reduce the level of noise andvibration from the 1st defendant's machines. The 2nd defendant therefore argued that he had done all that he could possibly do. Counselfor the plaintiffs however submitted that the 2nd defendant has not taken all possible steps in that the steps he took did not producethe desired or required results of isolating and reducing the noise and vibration. It was submitted that the 2nd defendant shouldhave imposed conditions on the manner in which the 1st defendant operated the machines.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> I agree that the 2nd defendant has not been totally inactive or irresponsible in tackling the nuisance created by the 1st defendant'soperation. I, however, agree with counsel for the plaintiff that the 2nd defendant has not taken all possible steps to prevent the1st defendant from continuing with the nuisance. It is the 2nd defendant's evidence that he had recently renewed the 1st defendant'stenancy. He could have and should have ensured that the noise and vibration emitting from the 1st defendant's machines be broughtwithin the acceptable level before agreeing to the renewal. Alternatively, as counsel for the plaintiff suggested, he could havemade this as a covenant in the new tenancy agreement.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> In the circumstances, the 2nd defendant should be held liable to the plaintiffs in breach of the DMC.</p>    <p class="heading">The Relief</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> In the Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs seek against the 1st defendant a prohibitive injunction and damages for nuisance.As for the 2nd defendant, the plaintiffs seek a mandatory injunction and also damages for breach of the DMC.</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Injunctions</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> Counsel for the 1st defendant submitted that no injunction should be made against the 1st defendant because it would put an end tothe 1st defendant's business and create serious hardship to him.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> In <strong>Shelfer v.

On the plaintiffs' appeals against the refusal of injunction, both Lord Halsbury and LindleyL.J. in their judgments approved the principle that once a plaintiff has established his right or the fact of violation, unless thereis something special in the case, he is entitled as of course to an injunction to prevent the recurrence of the violation.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> As to what constitutes special circumstances, A.L.

There is no evidence showing that the 1st defendant cannot operate itsbusiness if it is retrained from producing excessive noise and vibration. Quite the contrary, Professor Chan had, in the report endorsedby him, made proposals as to how the situation can be improved. Indeed, it is Professor Chan's evidence that improvement can alwaysbe made to reduce the noise and vibration even when the level is already within the acceptable limit.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> In my view, there is nothing special in the circumstances of this case as to warrant the refusal of the injunction sought againstthe 1st defendant.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> The same is true of the injunction sought against the 2nd defendant. Although the injunction sought is mandatory in nature, thatis justified by the fact that the 2nd defendant is found to be in breach of a restrictive covenant in the DMC.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> In connection with the precise terms of the injunction orders, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the defendants should beasked to reduce the noise level to no more than 10 db(B) above the background noise level and the vibration level to not more than0.4m/s 1.75. These are the acceptable standards under BS4142 and 6472. Counsel also suggested that the restrictions be confined tothe normal working house on working days, and that the defendants be allowed a period of 2 months to meet these prescribed standards.I agree that these terms are appropriate.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Damages</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> The plaintiffs had not particularized the damages sought in the pleading. In his opening submission, counsel for the plaintiffs indicatedthat the damages claimed relate to (a) the costs of installing additional false ceiling in the amount of $13000, and (b) the lossof use of part of the plaintiffs' premises. Counsel expressly stated that the plaintiffs do not peruse a claim in loss of amenities.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> On the claim relating to the costs of installing an addition false ceiling, I have no hesitation that the evidence establishes thatthe 2nd plaintiff had incurred the expenses and that this is as a direct result of the nuisance created by the 1st defendant and/orthe breach of the DMC by the 2nd defendant. The 2nd plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover the sum of $13,000 against the 1stand 2nd defendants by way of damages.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> As to the claim for loss of use of the part of the office area on the plaintiffs' premises, I agree that this is a head of loss thatmay be recovered. I am, however, of the view that the evidence adduced in this case is insufficient to arrive at a proper assessmentof the quantum. There is evidence from Mr Lai that the office where Mr Lo and Mr Chu used to work is about 800 sq. ft. Mr Lai furthertestified that the 3rd plaintiff had been paying $120,000 per month to the 2nd defendant as rent for the use of the plaintiffs' premises.It is unclear from the evidence as to what is the total size of the areas of the plaintiffs' premises that are sub-let to the 3rdplaintiff. Without knowing this, it is not possible to work out what portion of the monthly rental represents the area where the3rd plaintiff's employees used to work. Further, although it has been said by Mr Lai that the area remained unoccupied because MrLo and Mr Chu refused to move back to their previous working area, the evidence does not show that the area has been left completelyvacant and not used, for example, for storing files and records. It is the evidence of Mr Lo that there are filing cabinets and shelveswithin this area for holding customers' documents and records, and that because he is now working from a different area, he findsit inconvenient and difficult at times to lay hands on these documents and records.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> Having regard to the state of evidence on the size and present use or otherwise of the affected area, I am not prepared to awarddamages for loss of use of this part of the plaintiffs' premises.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> For the reasons aforesaid, there will be judgment for all the plaintiffs :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(1) For an order restraining the 1st defendant by itself, its servants or agents or otherwise howsoever from producing and emittingnoises whose level is more than 10 db(B) above the background noise level and vibrations whose level exceeds 0.4m/s 1.75 betweenthe hours of 9a.m. and 5p.m. on Mondays to Saturdays, but excluding holidays.</p>        <p align="justify">(2) For an order requiring the 2nd defendant to forthwith take steps to prevent the emission from the defendant's premises betweenthe hours of 9a.m. and 5p.m. on Mondays to Saturdays, but excluding holidays, noises whose level is more than 10 db(B) above thebackground noise level and vibrations whose level exceeds 0.4m/s 1.75.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> In order that the defendants can arrange for and carry out the necessary improvement work, the injunction orders are not to takeeffect until after 2 months from the date of the handing down of this Judgment. There is liberty to the parties to apply in connectionwith the implementation of the injunction orders.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a> There will also be judgment for the 2nd plaintiff against the 1st and/or 2nd defendants for damages in the sum of $13,000.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> I also make an order nisi that the plaintiffs shall have the costs of the action to be taxed if not agreed.
