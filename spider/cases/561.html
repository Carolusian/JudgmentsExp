The plaintiffinstructed the 2nd defendant, a firm of solicitors, to act for it. It sought assistance in the shape of mortgage finance from the3rd defendant, a bank. On the agreed date for completion the transaction did not proceed. The 1st defendant, alleging breach by theplaintiff, accepted its wrongful repudiation and withheld as forfeited the deposits paid. The plaintiff, denying breach, in due coursecame to accept the 1st defendant's wrongful repudiation, and now sues to recover the deposits and for damages for additional loss.In the alternative the plaintiff is suing the 2nd and 3rd defendants for damages in negligence. The 1st defendant counterclaims fordamages for loss occasioned by the plaintiff's wrongful repudiation. The 3rd defendant claims indemnity against the 2nd defendant,joined as third party, in the event it is found liable for the plaintiff's claim.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The plaintiff is Whale View Investment Limited (Whale View), the 1st defendant is Kensland Realty Limited (Kensland), the 2nd defendantand third party are Tam Pun &amp; Yipp (Tam Pun) and the 3rd defendant is the Bank of East Asia (the Bank). The shop in questionis in Argyle Street, Mongkok (the shop) and the registered proprietor at the material time was Delight Holdings Limited (Delight).</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> On 19 May 1997 Kensland entered into a provisional agreement with Delight to purchase the shop for $53m., the time and date for completionbeing by 5 p.m. on 2 September 1997. On 30 May 1997 Kensland entered into a provisional subsale agreement with Whale View to sellthe shop for $55m., the time and date for completion being by 1 p.m. on 2 September 1997. The terms of the provisional agreementand provisional subsale agreement were respectively absorbed by a formal agreement (the head agreement) signed on 13 June and formalsubsale agreement (the subsale agreement) signed on 20 June.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Pertinent clauses in the subsale agreement are the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"3.

Tam Pun accepted instructionsto act for Whale View in the transaction. Through its founder who was also a shareholder and director Lau Hok Tung (Mr Lau), WhaleView applied to the Bank for mortgage finance. Whale View complied with the deadlines for payment of the deposits of $8.25m.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> On or by 27 August 1997 the Bank approved an advance of $33m. to be secured by registered first charge against the shop's title withguarantees from Mr Lau and his wife, the other director of Whale View, and otherwise on terms and conditions accepted by the parties.By letter dated 29 August 1997 but faxed and delivered the following day (a Saturday) the Bank instructed Tam Pun to prepare thenecessary mortgage documents and guarantees setting out what was needed to be done and what documents were required to be sightedto enable the advance to be released to Whale View or at its direction. One of those conditions was spelt out, under the sub-heading"remarks", as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"8. Kindly arrange to have the draw-down of mortgage money by way of split cheque. Please let us have your specific instruction asto which relevant party/parties the cheque should be issued upon completion."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> I digress here to mention that this is a common conveyancing practice in Hong Kong, approved by the local law society and one whichat clause 37 the parties incorporated into the subsale agreement. There was like provision in the head agreement. The purpose isto enable a purchaser and if applicable his mortgagee to pay in part payment of the purchase price directly to the vendor's mortgageein settlement of the outstanding amount, thus allowing the convenience of completion on solicitors' undertakings in approved formwhilst protecting the purchaser and his mortgagee from possible fraud. Thought it is not spelt out the Bank's prerequisite at no.8 was mandatory for any advance in excess of a specified limit for the solicitors handling the transaction. In Tam Pun's case thisis $5m., so for an advance of $33m. the requirement for draw down by split cheque was inflexible, and forbade the alternative methodof crediting the solicitors' trust account.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> A partner of Tam Pun called Miss Eliza Tam (Miss Tam) was the solicitor overseeing the transaction, though she delegated much ofthe mechanical activity, as she had in other conveyancing transactions before, to her experienced secretary Miss Venus Fung (MissFung).</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The mortgage and other security documents were prepared and Whale View having passed the necessary resolutions Mr Lau and his wifewere requested to attend in the late afternoon of Monday, 1 September the offices of Tam Pun. Under the direction of Miss Tam orMiss Fung they signed where told. By now it was 7 p.m. Shortly after that time Miss Fung faxed a letter of confirmation confirmingcompliance with the Bank's instructions sending also copies of the relevant documents required. Of course these were faxes not originalsand it was well after the time one would expect the Bank's officers to be at their desks. But it was intended to alert anyone stillon duty or otherwise be an early morning indication that things had been done and the originals would soon be forthcoming. The originalletter with enclosures was delivered the next morning at about 9:30 a.m. This was of course 2 September, the day of completion.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> That morning Mr Lau put Whale View's account with Tam Pun in funds to meet the remainder of the purchase price due to Kensland.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Meanwhile, on 29 August, as part of the usual mechanics, Miss Fung had sent a draft assignment to Kensland's solicitors Tai TangChong (Tai Tang) and sought instructions as to how to split the cheques under clause 37 of the subsale agreement. Their responsewas not to be forthcoming until 11:13 a.m. on 2 September, less than 2 hours before the deadline for completion, delayed becauseit was claimed Delight's solicitors had not made their like request until about 9:30 a.m. that day. Delight asked for seven splitcheques. Tai Tang dealt with Tam Pun's request by forwarding Delight's list and adding two more of their own. In processing thosecheques to be drawn against Whale View's credit balance Miss Fung noticed a discrepancy in the addition by a bit over $1,200.00,and told Tai Tang. A correction was faxed at 11:30 a.m.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Meantime there were a series of setbacks at the Bank's branch office at Wan Chai, where Tam Pun's letter of confirmation and enclosureswere under scrutiny pending draw down. The officer delegated the task of checking for compliance was Miss Flora Chan (Miss Chan)who began to do so at 10 a.m. She soon found the Bank's instructions had not been complied with in five ways as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(i) Tam Pun had not enclosed an undertaking which should have been given by one of the guarantors;</p>        <p align="justify">(ii) original undertakings were required by the Bank; certified copies were sent;</p>        <p align="justify">(iii) there was no board resolution of Whale View enclosed;</p>        <p align="justify">(iv) the copy guarantee enclosed with the letter was wrong. The guarantee was in favour of the Kincheng Banking Corporation insteadof the Bank of East Asia Limited;</p>        <p align="justify">(v) the confirmation letter stated that the loan money was to be paid to Tam Pun's client account instead of by cashier order as requiredby the letter of instruction.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Miss Chan telephoned Miss Fung and reported these discrepancies at 10:15 a.m. Subsequent investigation revealed that item (i) wasno longer required. Miss Tam and a Mr Kenneth Tam (Mr Tam), a senior officer of the Bank, had on the Saturday discussed this requirementand Mr Tam had authorized that this was no longer needed. But neither had he noted the file of that and nor had Tam Pun's letterof confirmation made reference to it. Miss Fung made good the other shortcomings including a direction as to how the draw down cashier'sorders were to be split, by letter and enclosures faxed and then delivered. By now it was midday; 60 minutes left. But still therewas a problem. The covering letter referred to a different borrower and a different security; another transaction altogether. Inher haste Miss Fung had pulled the wrong heading from her computer. Another call; another letter. By the time this got to Miss Chanit was 12:20 p.m. Now everything was sorted. But given the size of the advance further, more senior personnel than Miss Chan wererequired to scrutinize the file and countersign the cashier's orders. So it was that the two cashier's orders were not released before12:50 p.m., a scant 10 minutes before expiry of the deadline. Miss Fung and her messenger Miss Donna Lau (Miss Lau) made a valianteffort, but Miss Fung did not present herself at the offices of Tai Tang until 1:06 p.m. Tai Tang acting on instructions refusedto accept the tendered documents and cheques on the grounds they were late.

There is little that is in dispute, and most I have already covered.I shall deal with what I regard is the pertinent remainder.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Mr Lau said that Whale View was one of a number of companies owned and controlled by him, through which over the years he had boughtand sold real estate for profit. Tam Pun had acted for him and the companies in these earlier transactions, which had proceeded toconclusion uneventfully. He described the market as particularly active in mid-1997, and it was his intention to sell the shop oncean offer that yielded a satisfactory gain had been made. On 2 September and than again a week later he received what he describedwere offers to buy at $70m. and $65.5m. respectively, though he conceded that in reality they could not be said to be as concreteas that. He explained that with the market blooming and with prices on the rise, property agents would use this means to get a vendor'scommitment to a price he would take before searching for a purchaser. He said it was his intention to wait for a bit to see whatthe market would allow the shop's worth to rise to.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> It was he who approached the Bank for mortgage assistance which was to lead to the bank offering Whale View $33m. on acceptable terms.He put Tam Pun in funds for the balance.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> When it came to completion he and his wife complied with all their solicitors' requirements including the timetable, and he reliedon them to complete, as he had in the past. When the transaction failed it was through no fault of Whale View or its officers. Itwas because Kensland was in breach or alternatively that Tam Pun and/or the Bank were negligent and were to blame. Being uncertainas to which or whom he has joined all three in his writ.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Miss Yeung said she is and was at the material time a director of Kensland. When Whale View did not tender in time Kensland acceptedits repudiation because of market prospects of a resale at a higher price. Whale View's writ registered as a lis pendens effectivelyput paid to that; then in October the market collapsed. Kensland still owns the shop, worth now much less than what it cost. Kenslandcounterclaims to retain the deposits paid up to the level of 10% of the sale and purchase price.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> In cross examination she denied that Whale View's breach was orchestrated to give Kensland the opportunity to make more money andthat Kensland arranged bridging finance in anticipation before the 1 p.m. deadline.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Miss Tam of Tam Pun confirmed that whilst she had delegated the mechanics of the conveyancing to Miss Fung she was the solicitor/partnerin charge, maintaining close contact, perusing and signing the outward correspondence and generally overseeing the transaction. MissFung had in the past carried out a similar role and was certainly familiar with what had to be done and why.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> She conceded that having negotiated with Mr Tam of the Bank the amended requirements of the Bank set out in the letter of instructions,there was no reference to that in the confirmation letter. She also conceded responsibility for the mistakes that Miss Chan of theBank discovered, including the blatant one that one of the guarantees was made out to a different bank altogether. She also confirmedwhat is apparent from the documents, that she asked that her firm's trust account be credited with the advance though the letterof instruction specified that draw down must be by split cheques. But she said these matters were quickly dealt with once apparent,albeit that the faulty guarantee was repaired by the process of replacing without signature or disclosure to the signatory the errantpage.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> It was her evidence that everything was finally made good by 11:55 a.m., though this time does not accord with that of Miss Chanand Miss Fung, who both said it was 12:20 p.m. Though time was undoubtedly tight, and made the more so because of the avoidable errors,there still should have been time for the Bank to process the cashier's orders and have them available in time to meet the deadline.She blamed the Bank's officers for failing to recognize that a few minutes late was too late; that they would have been able to makethe deadline if only they, the officers, had co-operated.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Then it was the turn of the Bank's personnel. In broad terms I was told of the steps typically undertaken after the solicitors' confirmationletter and supporting documents have been received, which steps were taken in this particular case.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> What is in dispute are their joint and several accounts, compared with those of Miss Tam and Miss Fung, as to how, when and to whatextent they were told by Miss Fung and Miss Tam and Miss Lau of the special need for urgency, namely that delay in presentation ofthe cashier's orders past the deadline might be fatal to the transaction. What is not in dispute is that Miss Tam's letter of confirmationmade reference to completion being today (no time given), and also that on the Bank's file was a copy of the provisional subsaleagreement in which was recorded the completion date and time, but that nobody engaged in the transaction saw fit to look into thedocument to see what that was.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Mr Tam when asked about the telephone conversation he had with Miss Tam agreed he did not note on file the amended requirement asnotice of the approved alteration. However other officers required to deal with the query on this point said it was quickly resolvedas Mr Tam was on hand to confirm it, and little time was added to that taken to process the papers.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> It is against that scenario that I now come to deal with the issues.</p>    <p class="heading">The claim against Kensland</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Kensland exercised its right to call for split cheques, nine in all, but not until 11:13 a.m. on 2 September, 1 hour 47 minutes beforethe deadline for completion. The error in adding up and consequent adjustment to one of the cheques was not fixed until 11:48 a.m.Was there an implied term of the subsale agreement that the requirement for splitting the cheques had to be given in reasonable time?If so, was Kensland too late?</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The question of "reasonable time" was considered by the Court of Appeal in <strong>Cheung Yun-ho &amp; Anor v. Wong Kwan-cheung &amp; Anor</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20HKLR%2090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 HKLR 90.</a> In that case, the appellants contracted to buy a property from the respondents under a provisional sale and purchase agreement. Adeposit was paid upon signing the said agreement; it was also provided that the parties would sign a formal agreement for the saleand purchase and that the appellants would pay a further deposit on a specified date one week after the execution of the provisionalagreement. The draft of the formal agreement was only supplied to the appellants on the day before the stipulated date for signingthe formal agreement. As a result, the formal agreement was not signed on the stipulated date, although the purchasers did tenderthe further deposit one day later. The respondents purported to treat the failure to sign as a repudiation of the contract and purportedto forfeit the deposit and treat the contract as being at an end. The appellants initiated proceedings to seek specific performanceand summary judgment.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> With reference to "reasonable time," Godfrey J (as he then was) said at page 93:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"How can it seriously have been expected that the solicitors for the purchasers, acting in their clients' best interests, should considerthe form of formal Sale and Purchase Agreement submitted by the vendors' solicitors; take their clients' instructions upon it; returnthe formal Sale and Purchase Agreement with amendments for consideration by the vendors' solicitors; agree the final terms; and gettheir clients to sign an engrossment, all in the space of some 24 hours? It is nonsense."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> I respectfully agree with this forthright approach. Indeed it is a matter of common sense that a contracting party required to performunder the contract cannot be in breach for non-performance if he has been given insufficient time and opportunity to do so.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> What is reasonable must depend on the circumstances. Mr Chan S.C. argued on behalf of the plaintiff that what could be said to bea proper yardstick was found in the head agreement, in which the vendor Delight was required to give at least one day's prior noticein writing if it sought to exercise its entitlement to call for split cheques. Mr Chan submitted that reflected what must in theprofession be recognized as a reasonable time. But in that transaction and indeed in all others where the same form has been usedthe contracting parties had the certainty of a specific term to rely upon. In my view what other parties contract for is no moreor less than an agreed term. What must be considered as reasonable is answered by establishing the length of time it would take fora reasonably competent conveyancer to check the figures and then comply with the request and complete, without unusual pressure,before the deadline. The mechanics of compliance with a split cheques requirement are to instruct the writing and signing of chequesand/or cashier's orders as the case may be as to amount and payee as directed. No client's instructions are needed. The funds willbe at hand or provided for; completion is pending. The direction is a usual and expected one; it is invariably, as in this case,contracted for and pursued.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> When the directions came in one and three quarters of an hour before the deadline, with the adjustment half an hour later, clearlythere was little time to spare. But there was no protest, and it seems to me that is because the machinery was in place, as in anyfirm competently run and geared to carry out, regularly, conveyancing transactions, to have the cheques and cashier's orders drawnand signed in terms of the request. Of course history reveals that the deadline was not met, but for reasons as I shall come to notrelated to the split cheques' direction.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In my view the time available was sufficient for the experienced conveyancer to comply without risk of being too late for completion.I conclude that there was an implied term of the subsale agreement that Kensland give its direction for split cheques in reasonabletime, and that Kensland gave directions in reasonable time.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> That deals with the issue of liability as between Whale View and Kensland. Kensland was entitled to accept repudiation and succeedswhere Whale View fails.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> I now turn to consider Whale View's claim to recover the resultant cost of that from Tam Pun or the Bank, or both.</p>    <p class="heading">The claim against Tam Pun</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> This can only succeed if Whale View can prove Tam Pun were negligent and because of that it suffered loss.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Mr Coleman for Tam Pun submitted, utilizing a passage from the judgment of Oliver J in <strong>Midland Bank Trust Co.

But hindsightis no touchstone of negligence. The standard of care to be expected of a professional man must be based on events as they occur,in prospect and not in retrospect. If the standard of care is that of the average prudent solicitor, then I have no doubt whateverthat the defendant was not negligent. Even if the standard of care is that to be attributed to the defendant himself, with somethingof a reputation in the world of authorship, I do not think that he was negligent. On any footing, the duty of care is not a warrantyof perfection."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> With those principles in mind, entrenched but nevertheless in practice difficult to apply, I turn to the facts of this case.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Tam Pun received from the Bank the document headed 'letter of instruction' dated 29 August 1997 but faxed on Saturday 30 August.It was a standard instruction to the solicitors of a successful applicant for mortgage funds, requiring the preparation and executionof the various security documents necessary to protect the Bank's advance. The prospective mortgagor being a company, standard guaranteesand board resolutions were also required. The Bank's own documents were to be used; Tam Pun had a supply, and Miss Tam was familiarwith them. There was nothing to suggest she or any delegated member of the staff would have difficulty in preparing the documentsor otherwise fulfilling the Bank's requirements. On the Saturday Miss Tam negotiated with Mr Tam the amended instructions of whichI have already made mention. Otherwise there is no chronology until late on Monday, after hours, when Mr Lau and his wife came tothe office on invitation and the execution of the documents was concluded. A simple calculation reveals that this was some 56 hoursafter the instructions were received. Pausing here I am not suggesting that Miss Tam should be criticised for being slow to be ready.After all, 44 of those hours comprised the weekend. Even a conscientious and busy solicitor is allowed a break. But the result ofthat timetable was that the letter of confirmation and enclosed security documents were not physically capable of being deliveredto the bank before the morning of the due date for completion, and it was at 9:36 a.m. that they were actually delivered. Miss Tamin her experience would have known that the Bank would require its designated officers to check every detail of the security documentsand letter of confirmation against its instructions before proceeding to draw down the advance. And she would have also been aware,given the size of the advance, that the procedure would involve scrutiny by senior personnel. Given the timetable, then, there waslittle margin for error; certainly much less than had she given herself some grace and had the documents prepared and ready for signinga few hours earlier. It was thus crucial that the documents be in order and that the Bank's instructions be complied with, or elsethere would be suffered the delay associated with making good any defect.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> History reveals that there were a number of mistakes. Miss Tam said they were only clerical. Of course they were; it was a transactionon documents. But she in her experience would know that a bank will require meticulous attention to detail and that includes gettingthe heading of any covering letter right. And one of those "clerical" errors was the wrongly recorded principal in the guarantee.If that had not been spotted the Bank could have been exposed to serious loss. There were a number of mistakes, some serious, someless so. All could and should have been avoided and would have been if ordinary care had been taken. Miss Fung put it down to thepressure of hours; that is my point. The timetable they gave themselves meant there was insufficient time to rectify the mistakes.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Miss Tam has said the cause of their inability to complete in time derives from Tai Tang's tardiness in directing on the split cheques.But it was not that at all. It was that the Bank did not issue the cashier's orders until 12:50 p.m.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Was the Bank to blame, in whole or in part, for that?</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> I shall deal with that question before ruling on Tam Pun's position.</p>    <p class="heading">The claim against the Bank</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Whale View's claim against the Bank derives from the proposition that it failed to make the cashier's orders representing the advanceavailable in time to enable its solicitors Tam Pun to complete in time. Of course that is so. There is a dispute of fact as to whenand the extent to which the various officers of the Bank involved in the transaction were told or reminded of the 1 p.m. deadline.There were or could have been a number of occasions when that happened. But I do not make any express finding of fact about thatbecause in the end I do not believe it changes the outcome. The Bank's officers were on any account doing their best to hurry thingsalong. No one person could be accused of dragging his or her feet. But as an obvious fact the Bank has set procedures in place beforea draw down of an advance can be authorized, and particularly so with one of significant size. Miss Tam from the witness box complainedthat once the errors were found and her firm notified the procedures came to a halt until those errors had been made good. I sayno individual could be criticised, at least not fairly criticised, for not continuing to process the advance in anticipation thatmistakes then discovered would be rectified. The system does not work that way; if it did there would be the risk that the draw downwould proceed without full compliance and the very real risk of drastic consequences to the Bank.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> It was not, as I find, until 12:20 p.m. that Tam Pun had repaired the mistakes that to that point had prevented Miss Chan of theBank from declaring the file in order. Only then and not before could the final act of having the cashier's orders processed andsigned begin. And, given that entailed further scrutiny by senior staff, that it took another 30 minutes for those cashier's ordersto issue was entirely normal and reasonable. The officers of the Bank had an obligation to the Bank's customer to comply with a reasonablerequest for urgency. But their first and primary responsibility was to the Bank. They cannot be criticised for that and nor can theBank.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> It follows, as I find, that whilst it was because the Bank did not release the cashier's orders until 12:50 p.m. Whale View lostthe opportunity to complete, the fault lay not with the Bank in whole or in part but because Tam Pun failed to exercise reasonablecare and skill in the handling of their client's affairs, judged by the standard of what the reasonably competent practitioner woulddo having regard to the standards normally adopted in his profession.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> I find Whale View has succeeded in claiming Tam Pun was negligent and because of that it suffered loss. I find it has failed in claimingthe Bank was negligent in whole or in part and thereby caused or contributed to its loss.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> There remains the claim pleaded that the Bank is liable vicariously, which I come to next.</p>    <p class="heading">The claim against the Bank in vicarious liability</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> This cannot get off the ground unless it can be established that Tam Pun were the Bank's solicitors and thus agent of the Bank, puttingthe Bank liable as principal for its agent's negligence.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> I find Tam Pun were not acting for the Bank in the transaction for two reasons. The first is there was no appointment, or invitationto act. The clearest indication of that comes from the Bank's so called "letter of instruction" to Tam Pun. There were no expresswords of appointment or invitation to act, such as "Please represent the Bank in the preparation etc.". The letter was, as I find,a direction to a customer's solicitors of what was required to be done before their client could be entitled to the draw down. Thesecond is that if the Bank really had instructed Tam Pun to act for it one would expect the Bank to credit its solicitors' accountwith the advance and then rely on it to ensure compliance with its instructions and to safeguard it from risk. The fine tooth scrutinyof the letter of confirmation and enclosures by various levels of the Bank's hierarchy was a far cry from that, with the draw downpermitted only after the Bank's own exhaustive examination authorized it.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> There was no solicitor client relationship and thus no principal agent one. The claim that the Bank was vicariously liable for WhaleView's loss fails. Of course this finding renders the third party claim otiose.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> I come now to consider the extent of damages recoverable by Kensland and Whale View.</p>    <p class="heading">Damages</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> Kensland has pleaded its loss under various heads but in the end limits its claim to its contractual one under clause 13(a) of thesubsale agreement of claiming forfeiture by Whale View of the deposits paid to the extent of 10% of the purchase price, namely $5.5m.No argument against that entitlement has been mounted; Kensland succeeds to that extent. It shall, further, be entitled to retainthe balance of the deposits pending payment of any consequential costs' order.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> As against Tam Pun Whale View has pleaded, inter alia, the loss of the opportunity to bargain for the sale of the shop and therebyprofits of up to $15m. gross.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Mr Lau, as I accept, did cause Whale View to buy the shop in order to sell for a profit on a buoyant market. This, after all, washis modus operandi over the previous few years. However the difficulty in establishing what his profit might have been is havingto second guess what he could have sold for and when. As he conceded, the letters sent to him on 2 and 8 September were not reallyoffers at all, though they had that appearance. And it was he who said that whilst intending to sell, he wanted to wait for a bitwith the market climbing all the while. I cannot find it safe to assume that the queries from the property agents might have materializedas offers and if so at what price and when, and whether Mr Lau would have entertained them. It is as likely he would have held offand then been stuck when the crash came as it did only a month or so after the scheduled completion date.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> What Whale View is entitled to are proven losses consequential upon liability having been established.
