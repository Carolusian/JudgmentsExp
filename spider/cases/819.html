Although the application was made on notice, but the Defendants did notappear at the <i>ex parte</i> hearing.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The <i>ex parte</i> injunction, the terms of which I will describe in greater detail below, effectively restrains Mr Aitken from being involved in certainactivities as part of his present job with CSL and with other persons, and from disclosing or using certain alleged confidentialinformation belonging to PCCW-HKT and PCCW Services (collectively âthe Plaintiffsâ).  The injunction further restrains CSL fromengaging Mr Aitken to do these restrained acts.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In detail, the <i>ex parte</i> injunctive orders obtained by Plaintiffs are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  Mr Aitken be restrained until the trial of the action herein or until further order from having any involvement, whether director indirect, in fixed-mobile interconnection issues related to or arising out of the Statement of the Telecommunication Authoritydated 27 April 2007 entitled âDeregulation for Fixed-Mobile Convergenceâ, including but not limited to (a) negotiation of fixed-mobileinterconnection terms and conditions, (b) actual or contemplated proceedings (including court proceedings and appeals to the Telecommunication(Competition Provisions) Appeal Board) relating to fixed-mobile interconnections, (c) seeking the determinations, determination proceedingsor directions from the Telecommunications Authority under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106" class="autolink_findacts">Telecommunications Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106">Cap 106</a>) relating to fixed-mobile interconnection, (d) issues concerning fixed-mobile interconnection tariffs (including the UnifiedInterconnection and Local Access Service Tariff that was published by PCCW in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region GazetteNo. 32/2007 on 10 August 2007 and the revised terms of Interconnection of Public Mobile Radiotelephone Service, etc. tariff publishedin the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Gazette No. 21/2008 on 23 May 2008).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  Mr Aitken shall keep confidential and not disclose to, or use for the benefit of, CSL or any other person any confidential informationof the Plaintiffs to which he is privy, whether in relation to the above issues or otherwise.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(3)  Mr Aitken shall not discuss or permit to be discussed in his presence anything relating to the above issues.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(4)  CSL shall be restrained (a) from involving Mr Aitken, whether directly or indirectly in any way in the above issues and (b) fromdiscussing or permitting discussion of the above issues in the presence of Mr Aitken and (c) from requiring, permitting or procuringMr Aitken to act contrary to subparagraphs (1) to (3) above.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(5)  The above orders are without prejudice to the right of Mr Aitken and CSL to take legal advice from, and to instruct, their respectivesolicitors and counsel.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(6)  All parties have liberty to apply on notice, if necessary on an expedited basis, to vary this order.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The <i>ex parte</i> injunction was continued by the order of Poon J dated 20 June 2008 until the determination of the Plaintiffsâ Summons, which seekthe same interlocutory reliefs until trial. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  It can be seen from the terms of the above <i>ex parte</i> order that, they are very wide in their scope, and that there are no definition or particulars provided to qualify the referenceto âconfidential informationâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  This is the hearing of the Plaintiffsâ Summons, and the Summonses issued by Mr Aitken and CSL respectively on 25 and 27 June 2008seeking (a) to set aside or discharge the <i>ex parte</i> injunction, and (b) an enquiry into damages suffered by them as a result of the wrongful grant of the <i>ex pate</i> injunction.  Mr Aitken and CSL obviously also oppose the Plaintiffsâ Summons as well.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>II.  Background</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In order to understand properly the meaning of the above orders, and why the Plaintiffs are seeking them, it is necessary for meto first set out the background leading to the dispute and the <i>ex parte</i> application.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Unless otherwise stated, the following background facts are uncontroversial.</p>    <p class="heading">The telecommunications industry and the parties</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The telecommunications industry in Hong Kong is highly regulated.  The Telecommunications Authority (âTAâ) is the body mainlyentrusted with the powers and duties to administer and oversee the regulations in the industry under the Telecommunications Ordinance(âTOâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  PCCW-HKT is member of the PCCW group, and one of the Fixed Networks Operators (âFNOsâ) in the telecommunications in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  PCCW Services is also a member of the PCCW group, and acts as the employment services vehicle for the group, including PCCW-HKT.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  CSL is one of the Mobile Networks Operators (âMNOsâ) in the telecommunications in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The respective FNOs and MNOs in Hong Kong are issued with a relevant licence to enable them to operate the respective fixed lineand mobile networks.  These licences come with the relevant guidelines and regulations governing the operation of the particularnetworks.  There are different licensing rights and obligations for these two types of operators.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Given the two separate and independent fixed and mobile telephone networks, there is the need for interconnections between themfor calls made to and from one network to another.  Under the existing applicable regulations and guidelines, there are charges forsuch fixed mobile interconnection, known as the Fixed-Mobile Interconnection Charges (âFMICâ).  The present regulatory regimefor FMIC is that the Mobile Party Network Pays (âMPMPâ), meaning that it is always and only the MPOs who pay for the interconnectingcharges.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The annual revenue generated under the existing FMIC and MPMP regime is about $600 million, and PCCW (being the major FNO) receivesabout 2/3 of this.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  At the same time, as the market develops with the technological advancement, the distinctions between fixed and mobile networksand services are increasingly becoming blurred.  This phenomenon is commonly referred to as Fixed Mobile Convergence (âFMCâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Mr Aitken is a solicitor admitted to practise in New South Wales, Australia in 1997.  He is however <i>not</i> admitted or registered in Hong Kong to practise as a solicitor or as a foreign lawyer.  Since admission in NSW, he had worked asa solicitor in private practice in Australia for about 5 to 6 years.  He then worked as an âin-houseâ lawyer for an Australiantelecommunications company in Australia for about 2 years.   Between August 2005 and February 2007, he came to Hong Kong and wasemployed by CSL as Legal Advisor, Legal and Regulatory Affairs.  During his work with CSL at that time, he was involved in, <i>inter alia</i>, FMC, FMIC and interconnection regulatory matters.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  By way of an employment contract dated 29 November 2006, Mr Aitken joined PCCW in March 2007 as its General Manager, RegulatoryCompliance.  Although it was PCCW Services which formally offered the employment contract, there appears to be no dispute that MrAitken effectively worked for the PCCW group, including PCCW-HKT. While working for PCCW, Mr Aitken reported to Mr Chiron, Directorfor Regulatory Affairs.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  There was a three-months non compete clause provided in the employment contract, which prohibits Mr Aitken from working with PCCWâscompetitors for a period of three months post termination of the employment contract.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  In taking up the position, Mr Aitken also signed a Confidentiality/Intellectual Property Undertaking (âthe Confidentiality Undertakingâ),where by he undertook not to divulge or disclose any confidential information or trade secrets of the PCCW Group obtained by himvia his employment.  This undertaking is expressly provided to apply during and post termination of Mr Aitkenâs employment.</p>    <p class="heading">The TAâs 2007 Statement</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In April 2007, the TA issued a Statement (âThe 2007 Statementâ) entitled âDeregulation for Fixed-Mobile Convergenceâ aboutthe TAâs decisions on various regulatory changes that concerns FMC.  One of these decisions is that by April 2009, the existingFMIC regime (i.e., the MPMP policy) will expire, and the TA leaves it to the FNOs and MNOs to negotiate amongst themselves for thenew terms and conditions concerning interconnection and interconnecting charges.   At the same time, the TA also decides to retainwhat is known as the Any-to-Any Connectivity (âA2Aâ) regime.  Under the A2A regime, there is an obligation on the FNOs and MNOsto interconnect with each other.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  It is PCCWâs case that, during his employment with it, Mr Aitken had been closely involved in various confidential and privilegedinternal and external discussions and conferences, in which confidential discussions were made on issues arising out from the 2007Statement and a number of legal proceedings taken out by PCCW relating to (a) the 2007 Statement, and (b) matters having an indirectimpact on the FMC and FMIC issues before the 2007 Statement. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The nature of these proceedings is as follows.</p>    <p class="heading">Appeal 25</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  After the issue of the 2007 Statement, in May 2007, PCCW lodged an appeal to the Telecommunication (Competition Provisions) AppealBoard (âthe Appeal Boardâ) against the decisions made in 2007 Statement, seeking the Appeal Board to quash the 2007 Statement,and to make other orders as it considered appropriate.   This appeal is known Appeal 25.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The broad grounds of the appeal under Appeal 25 are that (a) the TA has exceeded its lawful power under the TO in making the decisionsunder the 2007 Statement, (b) the TA has erred in law and/or on facts in making those decisions as it was an unlawful use of itspowers under the Ordinance and/or that there was no or no proper basis to enable the TA to make those decisions, (c) the terms ofthe 2007 Statement are in any event unreasonable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The TA challenged the Appeal Boardâs jurisdiction in hearing the appeal.  Both sides had engaged leading counsel from London toargue before the Appeal Board on this jurisdictional objection. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  By its judgment dated 2 April 2008, the Appeal Board decided that it had <i>no</i> jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  PCCW has made an application o the Appeal Board for a case to be stated to the Court of Appealin relation to this decision.  The Appeal Board has not made a decision on this application, pending written submissions from theparties.</p>    <p class="heading">Appeal 24 and HCAL 6/2006</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  On 7 November 2006, the TA issued a direction relating to the terms of interconnection between PCCW-HKT and another FNO, Wharf T&amp;TLtd.   Soon thereafter, PCCW-HKT lodged and appeal against this direction, and it is said by the Plaintiffs that the appeal toucheson (a) the scope of TAâs authority to regulate the terms of interconnection of FNOs and other operators, (b) the scope of the A2A.  The appeal is known as Appeal 24.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The TA challenged the jurisdiction of the Appeal Board to hear and determine Appeal 24.  In March 2008, the Appeal Board rejectedthe jurisdictional objection.  A trial date has now been provisionally fixed for January 2009 to determine the appeal proper.  PCCW-HKThas retained London leading counsel and Hong Kong counsel to represent them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In January 2007, PCCW-HKT also applied for judicial review of the TAâs above direction under HCAL 6/2007.   Reyes J dismissedthe application for judicial review by a judgment dated 1 June 2007.  In June 2008, by agreement on terms reached between PCCW-HKTand TA, PCCW-HKT withdrew its appeal against Reyes Jâs said order.</p>    <p class="heading">Mr Aitkenâs departure from PCCW and joining of CSL</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  In January 2008, Mr Aitken gave a three-monthsâ notice to terminate his employment with PCCW. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  After tendering his resignation, Mr Aitken also sought in writing PCCWâs consent to waive the three-month non compete clause,as he would be joining CSL, a competitor to PCCW.  He reiterated that he would comply with the Confidentiality Undertaking.   Thewaiver was given by PCCW after Mr Aitken had discussed the same with Mr Chiron.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Mr Chiron says he only gave his consent to the wavier as Mr Aitken told him that he (Mr Aitken) was to take up a role at CSL focusingon corporate affairs, external relations and non-regulatory legal matters.   Mr Chiron understood this to mean that FMIC issues wouldfall outside the ambit of Mr Aitkenâs new role at CSL.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Mr Aitken does not accept Mr Chironâs above version of the conversation.  Mr Aitken says that in the meeting, he told Mr Chironthat at CSL, he would be involved in works that were broader in nature from what he was doing at PCCW.  He would work in areas ofpublic policy, media type work, and ânot only in regulatory compliance but also general regulatory affairs work in the generalsenseâ.   Mr Aitken says that âgeneral regulatory affairs work in the general senseâ by definition includes works relatingto interconnection and FMIC issues.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Mr Aitken eventually joined CSL after leaving PCCW, as CSLâs Head of Regulatory and Corporate Affairs.   It is part of his dutiesunder regulatory affairs to deal with matters concerning FMIC and interconnection issues. </p>    <p class="heading">CSLâs press conference and release on 25 May 2008 and events leading to the present action and the ex parte injunction</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  On 23 May 2008, PCCW-HKT announced an increase in its connection tariff by 25%.   In other words, MNOs have to pay this increasedtariff for calls interconnecting with PCCWâs fixed net works until the MPMP regime expires in April 2009.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  On 25 May 2008, CSL held a press conference, which was attended by CSLâs CEO and Mr Aitken as its Head of Regulatory and CorporateAffairs.   At the conference, CSL opposed and criticized PCCW-HKTâs said âunilateral increaseâ in the interconnection tariff. It also criticized TAâs approval of the same without consultation, in particular in light of the soon to expire FMIC regime andthe overall deregulation approach set out in the 2007 Statement.    CSLâs CEO further said âCSL will not allow this to go uncheckedand will take all legal action in its power to enforce its rights as well as to prevent harm to consumersâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  CSL issued a press release summarizing the above.  It is provided in the release that Mr Aitken was the person to contact for furtherinformation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  On 8 June 2008, CSL lodged and appeal with the Appeal Board against the TAâs decision to approve PCCWâs interconnection tariffincrease.  This is known as Appeal 26.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Mr Chiron subsequently came to be aware of CSLâs press release.

Mr Aitken also said he would be involved in any litigation concerning CSLunder the leadership of CSLâs general counsel.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Mr Chiron says he was concerned after knowing Mr Aitkenâs involvement with these issues at CSL, as he was formerly closely involvedin PCCWâs discussions concerning the same issues. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  After seeking legal advice, the Plaintiffsâ solicitors, Herbert Smith (âHSâ), wrote Mr Aitken and CSL on 5 June 2008. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In the letter to Mr Aitken, it was stated that Mr Aitken was privy to much PCCWâs confidential information relating to the issueson interconnection between PCCW and MNOs.

It then asked Mr Aitken to let them have the details as to the scope of his role at CSL andwhether he had made use of any PCCWâs confidential information while performing his role to CSL.  It also sought a written undertakingfrom Mr Aitken that (a) during his employment with CSL, he would not be involved directly or indirectly in, or to be present in anydiscussions concerning, any fixed-mobile interconnection issues arising out of the 2007 Statement, and (b) not to use or discloseany of the PCCWâs confidential information for the benefit of CSL. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  In the letter to CSL, it attached HSâs above letter to Mr Aitken.

If the answer is negative,no interlocutory injunction would be granted.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  After satisfying with question (1) above, the Court should proceed to ask the following questions:</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:left">(a)  Whether damages would be a sufficient remedy for the plaintiff if the interim injunction is not granted.  If the answer is affirmative,generally no interlocutory injunction would be granted. </p>            <p style="text-align:left">(b) If the answer is negative, then the Court should ask whether damages are a sufficient remedy for the defendant even if the injunctionis wrongly granted.

This is so becausethe defendant employee must know clearly what he could and could not do in relation to certain information.  Thus, in <i>Lock v Beswick</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20WLR%201268" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 WLR 1268</a> Hoffmann J (as he then was) said at 1274B-C:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is therefore of the essence of a claim against an employee for misuse of confidential information that the employer should beable to identify with particularity the trade secret or similar confidential information  to which he lays claim.

Moreover, an interlocutory injunction should only be in such termsto provide what is of minimum necessity for the protection to the claimant until trial against any misuse of the information allegedto be confidential.

An interlocutory injunction, like any other injunction,must be expressed in terms which are clear and certain.  The injunction must define precisely what acts are prohibited.  The courtmust ensure that the language of its order makes plain what is permitted and what is prohibited.  This is a well established, soundlybased principle.  A person should not be put at risk of being in contempt of court by an ambiguous prohibition, or a prohibitionthe scope of which is obviously open to dispute.  An order expressed to restrain publication of âconfidential informationâ orâinformation whose disclosure risks damaging national securityâ would be undesirable for this reason.â</p>                </td>            </tr>        </table>        <table width="648" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="42" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">â111.</p>                </td>                <td width="606" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">I take as my starting point for an examination of this issue the principle that an injunction must always be expressed with precisionand with clarity.  As Lord Deas put in a Scottish case, if an injunction is to be granted at all, it must be in terms so plain thathe who runs may read: Kelso School Board v Hunter (1874) 2 R 228, 230.  This is because of the penal consequences that will followif it is breached.  Then there is another important principle.

See: <i>Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20AC%20222" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 AC 222</a> at 235C-E <i>per</i> Lord Millet.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  However, I cannot accept Mr McLelishâs submissions that there is no serious question to be tried on the existence of the causeof action under contract and breach of confidence.  There is clearly a duty imposed on Mr Aitken not to disclose confidential informationpost termination: </p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  Under the Confidentiality Undertaking, Mr Aitken expressly agreed not to disclose confidential information post termination ofhis employment with PCCW.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  There is an implied duty in his employment not to disclose trade secrets or trade secrets equivalent confidential informationpost termination: see <i>Faccenda Chicken</i>, supra.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  In my view, given these duties, and looking at the evidence in relation to the background set out above, I accept that there isat least a serious question to be tried on the existence of the causes of action in breach of contract and confidence.</p>    <p class="heading">D1.2  The lack of particulars on what is the relevant confidential information and a case of breach of confidence</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  As a start, Mr Burns SC for Mr Aitken and Mr McLeish for CSL fairly accept that, <i>if</i> the Court accepts that there is a serious question to be tried that Mr Aitken is in possession of the relevant confidential informationor trade secrets, there is also a serious question to be tried on whether the identified information could be protected from misuseor wrongful disclosure by a suitably drafted interlocutory injunction.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Mr Burns SC and Mr McLeish however contend that the Plaintiffs have failed to show a triable case of the alleged relevant confidentialinformation.   As far I understand it, there are two principal attacks under this head.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  First, it is said the Plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient particulars of what is alleged to be the confidential informationthat has been imparted to Mr Aitken during his course of employment with PCCW.  Failing this, (it is further submitted) there cannotbe any serious question to be tried on what is the relevant confidential information that could subject to protection by the lawof confidence and an interlocutory injunction. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Secondly, the Plaintiffs have also failed to show a serious question to be tried on the linkage between the so-called confidentialinformation and the scope of injunctive relief sought.  In other words, they have failed to show that the terms of the injunctionsought are appropriate to protect against the disclosure of the information.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  The Plaintiffsâ descriptions and categorizations of the relevant confidential information they say Mr Aitken has been impartedwith, are set out in various parts of the affidavits of Mr Chiron and Mr Crosswell.  As far as I can see, they can be summarizedas follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  Aitken had been privy to confidential information (obtained via various privileged meetings, conferences and communications)as to PCCWâs legal, commercial and strategic positionsin relation to the FMIC issues arising out of and in connection with the2007 Statement.   </p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  Mr Aitken is in possession of privileged and confidential information in relation to the issues arising from Appeal 25, as hehad been privy to the privileged communications between PCCW and its external legal advisers over the period between April and October2007.   He was involved in the meetings discussing possible challenges to the 2007 Statement by way of judicial review.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3)  Mr Aitken was closely involved in the various confidential and privileged meetings, email correspondence and other communicationswith PCCWâs external legal advisers over the period from late March to October 2007 in relation to Appeal 24 and HCAL 6/2007. He is privy to PCCWâs understanding of its legal position and of the relationship between these cases and the broader FMIC issuesas seen by PCCW.  In particular, A2A policy was a central focus in HCAL 6/2007, and Mr Aitken was exposed to considerable highlyconfidential and privileged correspondence between PCCW, Herbert Smith and counsel for PCCW during the course of preparation forits hearing.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(4)  In the months following the publication of the 2007 Statement, Mr Aitken had attended numerous internal meetings as well as externalmeetings and communications with legal advisers, in which the legal and strategic issues in connection with the 2007 Statement andPCCWâs possible responses to it had been discussed.    They include consideration of the market power issues (such as whether theFNOs and MNOs would be considered, legally, to have relevant market power in interconnection negotiations so as to raise the issueof abuse of that market power, a contravention of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106" class="autolink_findacts">Telecommunications Ordinance</a>) and of the enforceability of the obligation of mandatory interconnection that the TA was contending it had power to enforce as againstPCCW.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(5)  On 30 May 2007, Mr Aitken attended a meeting with Mr Chiron, Mr Crosswell (of Herbert Smith), Mr Johnston (of Herbert Smith bytelephone link), Ms Winifred Lo, Mr Kevin Chu, Mr Tang Wing Ho and Ms Cindy Au.  In this meeting, very broad ranging conceptual discussionof legal strategy issues concerning FMC and FMIC, including the position of the MNOs in FMIC negotiations and related competitionlaw issues were held. </p>        <p style="text-align:left">(6)  Mr Aitken was privy to a document circulated by Mr Crosswell on 6 June 2007 entitled âPCCW/FMC Statement Potential Legal Avenuesof Challenge â Scoping Documentâ, which considered in detail potential legal avenues available to PCCW following the issue ofthe 2007 Statement and the legality of the A2A obligation that the TA was relying on in relation to FMIC negotiations between theFNOs and the MNOs.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(7)  On 7 June 2007, there was a meeting between the Herbert Smith Team and the PCCW Team (including MR Aitken) to discuss the abovescooping document.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(8)  On 15 June 2007, Mr Crosswell sent a 59 page draft instruction to counsel containing 29 pages of detailed appendixes to the PCCWteam, including Mr Aitken, which went through a detailed analysis of the 2007 Statement and potential grounds of legal challenge.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(9)  Mr Aitken was privy to the email sent by Mr Crosswell on 20 June 2007 to Ms Winifred Lo and Mr Kevin Chu, seeking further informationfor the draft  instruction to counsel circulated on 15 June 2007.   Mr Aitken was also privy to the final instruction sent to MrPannick QC on the same day.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(10) Mr Aitken was privy to Mr Pannick QCâs advice received by Herbert Smith on 4 July 2007 concerning the grounds on which the2007 Statement could be challenged.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(11) On 5 July 2007, Mr Aitken attended a telephone conference with members of the PCCW Team and the Herbert Smith Team to discussMr Pannick QCâs advice.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(12) On 10 July 2007, Mr Aitken attended a telephone conference with Mr Pannick QC with Mr Crosswell, Ms Cindy Au and Mr Chiron todiscuss the advice. </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  I understand that Mr Aitkenâs case is that, he has obtained <i>no</i> relevant confidential information while working at PCCW at all.  It is also his evidence that his involvement with any of the so-calledprivileged meetings, conferences and communications was at best peripheral, given his prior confidentiality commitment with CSL (ashis previous employer) on FMC/FMIC issues and his many other duties as the General Manager of Regulatory Affairs at PCCW.  I alsonote Mr Aitkenâs evidence that he could hardly remember any of the privileged meetings he had attended whether in relation to thelegal proceedings or other internal discussions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  However, for the present purpose, I am satisfied with the evidence before me, including the documentary evidence exhibited to thePlaintiffsâ various affidavits relating to Mr Aitkenâs involvement and participations in the various meetings and discussions,that there is at least a triable case on whether Mr Aitken was actively and centrally involved in all the above activities and meetingsas alleged by the Plaintiffs.  As such, I am also satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried on whether Mr Aitken wasprivy to the above information as suggested by the Plaintiffs.  It is pertinent to note that Mr Aitken has not denied that thereare these meetings, conferences or communications.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The crucial question I have to decide for these applications, is whether the Plaintiffsâ above evidence provides sufficient particularityto support a triable claim in confidential information, which warrants the grant of an interlocutory injunction to protect it fromany misuse or unlawful disclosure.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  On this question, it should be noted that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  As submitted by Mr Whitehead, SC for the Plaintiffs (which is not disputed), the evidence shows that (a) the telecommunicationsindustry in Hong Kong is highly competitive, in particular as between FNOs and MNOs, and (b) the position held by PCCW as FNO isdiametrically different from CSLâs position under various issues concerning FMC/FMIC and arising out from the 2007 Statement.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  All parties accept in their evidence that FMC/FMIC issues are the single most important issue that affects the telecommunicationsindustry in Hong Kong in the next 12 months or some time to come thereafter.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  After considering the evidence from all the parties in its entirety, and after taking into account of the uncontroversial backgroundmatters set out above and at paragraphs 70(1) to (2), and after reminding myself that this is an interlocutory application, I havecome to the following conclusions:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  The descriptions of the groups or classes of information set out at paragraphs 66(1) to (4) are too general and vague, whichlack in my view sufficient particulars to enable the Court to identify with sufficient certainty and particularity as to what thisinformation is.  As so phrased and described, these classes or groups of information do not constitute arguably any confidentialinformation recognized in and protectable by the law of confidence.  See the general principles set out in paragraphs 51 to 55 above.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  Moreover, I accept Mr Burnsâ submissions that any information obtained from the discussions held by PCCWâs legal teams on,and legal advices given in relation to, HCAL 6/2006 must have been spent by now, and could no longer amount to confidential informationfor the present purpose.  This is so, as all the possible legal arguments must have been already canvassed at the hearing beforeReyes J, and discussed in the learned judgeâs judgment.   PCCWâs decision to withdrawn the appeal under HCAL 6/2006 further showsthat all legal matters and considerations arising thereunder must have been considered by PCCW as no longer live issues.  </p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3)  For the above reasons, I do not think the Plaintiffs have established any triable case on an enforceable right against the informationconcerning the one set out in paragraphs 66(1) to (4) above.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(4)  On the other hand, I find that the classes of information set out at paragraphs 66(5) to (12) are sufficiently particularizedto support at least a triable claim in confidential information.  </p>        <p style="text-align:left">(5)  In light of the circumstances in which it was imparted and the purpose of the information, I am also satisfied that the groupsand nature of this information constitutes at least arguably trade secrets or trade secret equivalent confidential information.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(6)  In my view, the discussions (written or oral) on the legal positions that PCCW could or could not adopt in relation to a potentialchallenge to the 2007 Statement, an important document affecting that PCCWâs legal or commercial rights, and the discussions onthe commercial positions of PCCW vis-Ã -vis the commercial negotiations between FNOs and MNOs for FMIC as anticipated under the 2007Statement, must at least arguably amount to highly confidential information equivalent to trade secrets.  This is particularly sogiven the highly competitive environment of the telecommunications industry in Hong Kong as between FNOs and MNOs, and the diametricalpositions held by PCCW as a FNO and CSL as a MNO concerning FMC/FMIC issues.   Such information thus is arguably highly sensitiveand confidential, and the disclosure of which to CSL would prejudice PCCWâs position and bargaining power in negotiating any commercialterms with CSL.  </p>        <p style="text-align:left">(7)  In the circumstances, I accept that there is a serious question to be tried that (a) the information set out under paragraphs66(5) to (12) above is trade secret or trade secret equivalent, and (b) is thus  âlinkedâ to the need for a protection by wayof a suitably drafted interlocutory injunction.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the Plaintiffs have shown that there is a serious question to be tried that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  Mr Aitken is in possession of confidential information equivalent to trade secret.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  There is a risk of misuse or disclosure of such information.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3)  This information should be protected by a suitably drafted injunction.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">D1.4  The injunctive relief sought amounts to a restrain of trade, and should not be granted</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  It is Mr Burns SCâs submissions that paragraphs 1 and 3 of the interlocutory injunctive reliefs sought by the Plaintiff undertheir Summons amount to a restraint of trade.  As such, they should not be granted as a matter of law.  Further, they are also clearlytoo wide and unreasonable in all the circumstances.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Mr Burns submits that the general law under confidential information is that the equitable remedy of an injunction in the form ofrestrain of trade is not be granted, and the proper way for an employer who prevent competition is by way of extracting a reasonablydrafted restraint of trade clause in the employment contract.  Mr Burns relies on <i>Faccenda Chicken</i> at pp 137G-138A, approving Cross J in <i>Printers &amp; Finishers Ltd v Holloway</i> [1965] 1 at 6, which says as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">ââ¦Although the law will not enforce a covenant direct against competition by an ex-employee, it will enforce a covenant reasonablynecessary to protect trade secrets â¦ If the managing director is right in thinking that there are features in the plaintiffâsprocess which can fairly be regarded as trade secrets and which their employees will inevitably carry away with them in their heads,then the proper way for the plaintiffs to protect themselves would be by exacting covenants from their employee <i>restricting their field of activity</i> after they have left their employment, not by asking the court to extend the general equitable doctrine to prevent breaking confidencebeyond all reasonable bounds.â  (emphasis added)</p>        <p style="text-align:left">See also:  <i>Balston Ltd v Headline Filters</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20FSR%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] FSR 330</a>; <i>G D Searle &amp; Co Ltd v Celltech Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20FSR%2092" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] FSR 92</a> at 99.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Further, Mr Burns says Mr Aitkenâs employment contract did contain a three-months non compete restrain of trade clause.  Thiswas however waived by the Plaintiffs.  They cannot in the name of purported protection of confidential information extract one backwhen they have given it away themselves.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Finally, the injunctive reliefs sought under paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Plaintiffsâ Summons are even wider than the contractualthree-months non complete provision, by effectively lengthening the agreed non complete period.  It is submitted that the Plaintiffscannot possibly obtain something even better than what they could have got under an express restrictive covenant.  It should be notedthat the Plaintiffs seek the same form of permanent injunction in their writ against Mr Aitken.  Mr Burns contends that the Plaintiffscan never obtain such a relief as it amounts to a <i>permanent</i> restraint of activities or trade of a former employee, which no court would grant.  It is thus submitted that if the Plaintiffs cannotpossibly obtain this relief at trial, they could not be in a better position interlocutory.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  There is considerable force in Mr Burnsâ submissions, in particular in light of the authorities of <i>Faccenda Chicken</i> and <i>Printers &amp; Finishers Ltd v Holloway</i> cited above. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Mr Whitehead however submits that for the present case, the guiding principles should be those set out by the House of Lords underthe <i>Bolkiah</i> case, which supports the grant of an injunction to protect confidential and privileged information by restraining a person from carryingout certain acts in his profession.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  In <i>Bolkiah</i>, the plaintiff (Prince Bolkiah) was at one time the head of a secret investment body set out by the government.  While still actingas the head of the investment body, a firm of auditors (KPMG) also acted for the Prince in matters relating to his own litigations. For that purpose, KPMG provided certain services to the Prince usually undertaken by litigation solicitors.  Through such servicesprovided, KPMG obtained the Princeâs confidential information on, <i>inter alia</i>, the whereabout of his assets and their values.  Later, the Prince fell out of favour in the royal hierarchy and was replaced ashead of the investment body.  Then, the government commenced investigations of certain alleged wrongdoings of the Prince while actingas head of the investment body, including misappropriating and siphoning away assets of the government under the investments.  Thegovernment sought to engage KPMG to assist in the investigations in, <i>inter alia</i>, identifying of the alleged wrongdoings of the Prince and the misappropriated assets.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  The Prince applied for an injunction restraining KPMG from acting for the government, so as to prevent KPMG from misusing or wrongfullydisclosing the Princeâs confidential information they had obtained to his prejudice.  There was no dispute that KPMG had the relevantconfidential information.  However, they argued that the Chinese wall implemented within the firm would sufficiently and reasonablyprevent any wrongful use or misuse of the confidential information.  The judge at first instance granted the injunction, which wasdischarged by the Court of Appeal.  On further appeal, the House of Lords reinstated the injunction. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Lord Millet delivered the leading speech.  The relevant principles that can be derived from his speech have been summarized by ClarkeLJ in <i>Koch Shipping v Richards Butler</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20All%20ER%20%28Comm%29%20957" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 All ER (Comm) 957</a> at para 25 (pp 962-963) as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  The court's jurisdiction to intervene is founded on the right of the former client to the protection of his confidential information(per Lord Millett at p.234).</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  The only duty to the former client, which survives the termination of the client relationship, is a continuing duty to preservethe confidentiality of information imparted during its subsistence (per Lord Millett at p.235).</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3)  The duty to preserve confidentiality is unqualified. It is a duty to keep the information confidential, not merely to take allreasonable steps to do so (per Lord Millett at p.235).</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(4)  The former client cannot be protected completely from accidental or inadvertent disclosure, but he is entitled to prevent hisformer solicitor from exposing him to any avoidable risk. This includes the increased risk of the use of the information to his prejudicearising from the acceptance of instructions to act for another client with an adverse interest in a matter to which the informationmay be relevant (per Lord Millett at pp.235-236).</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(5)  The former client must establish that the defendant solicitors possess confidential information which is or might be relevantto the matter and to the disclosure of which he has not consented (per Lord Millett at pp.234-235).</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(6)  The burden then passes to the defendant solicitors to show that there is no risk of disclosure. The court should intervene unlessit is satisfied that there is no risk of disclosure. The risk must be a real one, and not merely fanciful or theoretical, but itneeds not be substantial (per Lord Millett at p.237).</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(7)  It is wrong in principle to conduct a balancing exercise. If the former client establishes the facts in (5) above, the formerclient is entitled to an injunction unless the defendant solicitors show that there is no risk of disclosure.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(8)  In considering whether the solicitors have shown that there is no risk of disclosure, the starting point must be that, unlessspecial measures are taken, information moves within a firm (per Lord Millett at p.237). However, that is only the starting point.The Prince Jefri case does not establish a rule of law that special measures have to be taken to prevent the information passingwithin a firm. On the other hand, the courts should restrain the solicitors from acting unless satisfied on the basis of clear andconvincing evidence that all effective measures have been taken to ensure that no disclosure will occur (per Lord Millett at pp.237-238,where he adapted the test identified by Sopinka J. in <i>MacDonald Estate v Martin</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2077%20DLR%20%284th%29%20249" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 77 D.L.R. (4th) 249</a> at p.269). This is a heavy burden (per Lord Millett at p.239).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  <i>Bolkiah</i> was followed and applied in <i>Marks and Spencer Group PLC v Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%20PNLR%204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] PNLR 4.</a>  In that case, the defendant solicitors had formerly acted for Marks &amp; Spencer in a number of commercial transactions.  The EnglishCourt of Appeal confirmed an injunction granted to restrain the defendant firm of solicitors (Freshfields) from acting for anotherclient who was a potential purchaser to buy out Marks &amp; Spencer, on the basis that Freshfields were in possession of Marks &amp;Spencerâs confidential information which <i>might</i> be relevant to the transaction in the potential buy-out.   To avoid any risk of disclosure, Freshfields must be restrained from actingfor this new client.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Mr Whitehead therefore submits that these authorities clearly support the grant of injunction to restrain a personâs activitiesif he is in possession of highly confidential <i>and</i> privileged information.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  Mr Burns SC and Mr McLeish both submit that <i>Bolkiahâs</i> application is only limited to a solicitor/client relationship, or relationship equivalent to the same (as the auditors in that case). It is so because:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  The language used by Lord Millet in his speech and the facts of the case show that it is a case concerning solicitor/client relationship,which is one of strict confidentiality.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  Moreover, in formulating his test, Lord Millet in his speech relied on Lightman Jâs decision in <i>Re A Firm of Solicitor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20Ch%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] Ch 1</a> at 9.  On that part of Lightman J decision, the learned judge emphasized p9E-H the special relationship of a solicitor and clientin support of the test as follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">âThe compromise reached under English law can I think be formulated in this way.  (1) The basis of the courtsâ intervention isnot a possible perception of impropriety: it is the protection of confidential information: see [various authorities cited] (2) Inview of the <i>special importance of the relationship of confidence between solicitor and client and of the fact that the solicitor is an officerof the court</i>, the court is <i>particularly sensitive</i> to the need to afford the <i>fullest and, where required, special protection</i> to such confidential information: see [authorities cited]. (3) â¦â (emphasis added)</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">See also page 11C-G.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3)  As such, the strict approach to the protection of confidential information afforded in <i>Bolkiah</i> is only warranted and justified because of the very special relationship between a solicitor and client and the fact that a solicitora an officer of the court.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Mr Burns and Mr McLeish therefore further submit that, for a usual employer and employee relationship, the governing principlesin the protection of confidential information are those set out in <i>Faccenda Chicken</i>. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  In reply, Mr Whitehead contends that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  <i>Bolkiah</i> is clearly of general application to protect confidential information which is also privileged.  The principles propounded thereare not relationship sensitive but related to the special nature of this type of confidential and privileged information, which warrantsa strict approach.  This is borne out by the following parts of Lord Milletâs speech at 236F-H:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIt is in any case difficult to discern any justification in principle for a rule which exposes a former client without his consentto any avoidable risk, however slight, that information which he has imparted in confidence in the course of a fiduciary relationshipmay come into the possession of a third party and be used to his disadvantage.  Where in addition, <i>the information in question is not only confidential but also privileged, the case for a strict approach is unanswerable</i>.  Anything else fails to give effect to the policy on which legal professional privilege is based.  It is of overriding importancefor the proper administration of justice that a client should be able to have complete confidence that what he tells his lawyer willremain secret.  This is a matter of perception as well as substance.  It is of the highest importance to the administration of justicethat a solicitor <i>or other person</i> in possession of confidential and privileged information should not act in any way that might appear to put the information at riskof coming into the hands of someone with an adverse interest.â (emphasis added)</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  Alternatively, the principles apply to situations where the person who obtained the confidential information is in an analogousposition of relationship between a solicitor and his client.  In the present case, although Mr Aitken was not employed as a practisingsolicitor, the evidence at least suggests arguably he was engaged in a position equivalent to an in-house lawyer advising and participatingin PCCWâs regulatory affairs, since â[w]hat matters is not the lawyerâs job title but whether he is exercising professionalskills as a lawyer.â As such, the <i>Bolkiah</i> principles still apply.  Mr Whitehead cites in aid Hollander, <u>Documentary Evidence</u> (9<sup>th</sup> ed), paras 11-31 and 11-32.  </p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3)  Mr Whitehead further cites the case of <i>Ablitt v Mills &amp; Reeves</i> (transcript of judgment, 224 October 1995 Blackburne J), where an injunction was granted to restrain a solicitor from acting fora defendant in an ongoing proceedings, on the basis that certain confidential information of the plaintiff in that proceedings hadbeen mistakenly sent to that solicitor (before he was engaged by the defendant).  He submits that this authority supports that ifcircumstances warrant, an injunction could be granted by the court to restrain a person imparted with confidential information fromacting in certain manner or participating in certain activities even though he has obtained such information not via a former professional/clientrelationship.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  I accept Mr Burns and Mr McLeishâs submissions that the principles set out in <i>Bolkiah</i> are only limited to a solicitor/client or an analogous professional relationship, where confidential and privileged information isimparted under a strict confidential relationship.  I have come to this conclusion for the following reasons:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  I accept all the observations made by Mr Burns and Mr McLeish set out in paragraph 84 above.  I accept that a solicitor/clientrelationship is a special one of strict confidence recognised by the law, differing from an ordinary employee and employee relationshipwhere confidential information is imparted via work.   It is this special type of relationship and the fact and a solicitor is anofficer of the court that the Court adopts a strict approach to prevent a solicitor from exposing his client to any avoidable riskof disclosure of confidential information.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  I also note that Mr Whitehead has not disputed Mr Burnsâ submission that all subsequent cases applying <i>Bolkiah</i> are ones involving solicitors obtaining confidential information in the course of their professional commitments.  This supportsthe submissions that <i>Bolkiah</i> principles are only limited to those situations where professional and strict confidence relationships are involved.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3)  It is well accepted that <i>Faccenda Chicken</i> is the leading authority on the categorization of the various forms of confidential information recognised and protected by the law. <i> </i>Therefore, without proper authority to support the same, I cannot accept Mr Whiteheadâs submissions that <i>Bolkiah</i> is a case recognising (and thus creating) a further category of confidential information other than those defined under <i>Faccenda Chicken</i>, which demands a higher and stricter level of protection.  </p>        <p style="text-align:left">(4)  I do not think the case of <i>Ablitt</i> assists Mr Whitehead: </p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:left">(a)  First, Blackburne J in reaching his conclusion relied on authorities all dealing with the grant of an injunction restraininga firm of solicitors from acting to protect confidential information obtained by them.  This therefore does not assist Mr Whiteheadsubmissions.</p>            <p style="text-align:left">(b) Secondly, the case concerns about confidential information in relation to an ongoing litigation passed accidentally into the solicitorâshand, who then sought to act for the opposing party in the very same litigation.   Thus, Blackburne J made the observation at page14 that â[t]his is not a case where there is a risk of leakage of confidential information to the persons acting in the matter.It is those very persons who have the information.â  This is thus a case where the Court must act to protect the sanctity of litigationprivilege information against a solicitor, who was an officer of the court.  It is not an employer and employee case.</p>            <p style="text-align:left">(c)  Third, no restraint of trade arguments were advanced in that case.  As said by Blackburne J at page 14, the defendantsâ counselaccepted that the Court had jurisdiction to make the order in question.  In the premises, this case does not assist this Court inconsidering the general applicability of the principle against the grant of a restraint of trade like injunction in the protectionof confidential information as accepted in <i>Faccenda Chicken</i>.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  Having reached the above conclusion on the applicability of the <i>Bolkiah</i> principles, I now deal with the Plaintiffsâ alternative submissions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  First, I do not accept that the submissions that the reliefs sought under paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Plaintiffsâ Summons do noteffectively amount to any restraint of trade.  Although I agree with Mr Whitehead that the injunctions if granted would not preventMr Aitken from working in the telecommunications field or for PCCWâs competitors generally, the injunctions do have the effectiveof limiting and narrowing down the areas and scope of works that Mr Aitken could engage himself in.  Looking as such, I regard thisas the form of injunction that should be excluded for the protection of confidential information under Cross Jâs judgment in <i>Printers &amp; Finishers</i> as approved in <i>Faccenda Chicken</i> cited in paragraph 74 above.  The learned judge emphasized that if an employer wanted to limit the <i>field of activity</i> of his former employee to protect confidential information that had gone into the employeeâs memory via work, he should exact arestrictive covenant to do so, instead of seeking the aid of an injunction.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Secondly, I also do not accept that the evidence before me support at least an arguable case that Mr Aitken had obtained the relevantPCCWâs confidential information through a relationship analogous to a solicitor/client or the necessary professional relationshipto attract the principles in <i>Bolkiah</i>:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  As a starting point, there cannot be any dispute that the relationship between Mr Aitken and PCCW was one of an employee andemployer relationship created under the employment contract.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  Any information imparted into Mr Aitken during his time with PCCW is thus <i>prima facie</i> obtained through this employment relationship.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3)  Although there is no dispute that Mr Aitken had been asked to participate in various conferences and discussions which were heavilylegal in nature, I do not think there is sufficient evidence to satisfy me that he so participated in them in a professional capacityas a solicitor or lawyer.  In fact, given that he has not been admitted to Hong Kong as a solicitor, by definition he could not haveacted in a professional way in advising, practising or purporting to so advise and practise Hong Kong law. </p>        <p style="text-align:left">(4)  Looking at this from another angle, it cannot be seriously suggested that because Mr Aitken was employed as the General Managerfor Regulatory Affairs, and because it also happened that he held a NSW professional legal qualification, there existed between himand PCCW a duty of strict confidentiality to encourage full and frank discussion and disclosure from PCCW, which exists in a solicitor/clientrelationship.  </p>        <p style="text-align:left">(5)  In the circumstances, I am not persuaded by the evidence before me that there is a serious question to be tried that Mr Aitkenhad acquired PCCWâs confidential information via a professional capacity, and therefore attracts the strict duty of confidentialityimposed upon him, which in turn warrants the strict approach laid down in <i>Bolkiah</i>.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  For all the above reasons:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  I am not satisfied that the Plaintiffs have shown a serious question to be tried that they are entitled to an injunctive reliefin form of paragraphs 1 and 3 of their Summons.  There is thus no question that they be granted an interlocutory injuction in thoseforms and terms.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  I am therefore also satisfied that paragraphs 1 and 3 of the <i>ex parte</i> order should be discharged in any event.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">D1.5  No serious question for trial that CSL has procured or induced Mr Aitkenâs breach</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  The burden is on the Plaintiffs to show at this stage a serious claim against CSL for inducement and procurement of breach of  contractor confidence by Mr Aitken.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  However, there is no sufficient evidence before me to show that <i>before</i> the pre-action letter was sent by HS to CSL:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  CSL was arguably aware of Mr Aitkenâs possession of PCCWâs relevant confidential information.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  CSL has procured or induced or threatened to procure or induce Mr Aitken to disclose or misuse this confidential information.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  There is thus no evidence before me to support an arguable case of alleged inducement or procurement of breach of contract or confidencefor conducts <i>before</i> the pre-action letter.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  Further, even in relation to conducts <i>after</i> the pre-action letter, and after CSL has been put on notice of the allegation of confidential information relating to the FMIC issue,I also have not seen sufficient evidence to support an arguable case of <i>direct</i> inducement or procurement of breach by CSL. As far as I can see, there is no evidence to even remotely suggest that CSL has exertedor has threatened to exert pressure, active persuasion or enticement of Mr Aitken to disclose confidential information.  See: <u>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</u> (19<sup>th</sup> ed), paras 25-41 to 25-52.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  I accept the Plaintiffsâ submissions that CSLâs silence as to whether it would continue to actively engage Mr Aitken to participateand be involved in the discussions and affairs concerning FMIC issue supports an arguable case that CSL <i>would</i> continue to engage Mr Aitken in these activities. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  But that alone in my view is also insufficient to show that there is an arguable case of <i>indirect</i> procurement of breach of confidence.    There is nothing before me to show that CSL <i>intended</i> Mr Aitken to breach the confidence, and with <i>this object in view</i> âdefinitely and unequivocallyâ persuaded, induced or procured Mr Aitken to breach the confidence.  See:  <u>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</u> (19<sup>th</sup> ed), para 25-54.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  For these reasons, I conclude that there is no serious question to be tried for a claim against CSL for inducement of breach ofcontract or confidence.  On this basis, I cannot see why an interlocutory injunction should be granted against CSL.</p>    <p class="heading">E.  Whether damages are a sufficient remedy for the Plaintiffs</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Given this being a case of confidential information, I accept that damages would not be a sufficient remedy for the Plaintiffs ifan interlocutory injunction is wrongfully not granted.  I do not think Mr Burns SC and Mr McLeish are seriously arguing otherwise.</p>    <p class="heading">F.  Whether damages are a sufficient remedy for Mr Aitken</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  Mr Aitken says if restrained, he is âunlikelyâ to be continued to be employed by CSL.  He also says given the specialized natureof the work that he does, and the small size of the Hong Kong market, it is also unlikely that he would be able to find work in HongKong. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  Mr Aitken further says if he could not find any work, he would lose his employee visa in Hong Kong, and unless his wife is employed,the whole family (including his two children who have since settled respectively into their schools here) would have to be relocatedout of Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  For these reasons, Mr Aitken says damages are clearly not a sufficient remedy for him, if an interlocutory injunction is wrongfullygranted against him.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  I do not accept Mr Aitkenâs case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  First, I am not satisfied from the evidence that even if an injunction is to be granted against him, he cannot perform substantiallyhis role at CSL and is likely to be âsackedâ:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  At paragraph 91 of his 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit, Mr Aitken sets out the various and many roles and duties he has to perform as the Head of Regulatory and Corporate Affairsat CSL. </p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  I note that matters that relate to FMIC and interconnection issues constitute only but a few of these many functions and duties. There is no evidence to show that matters concerning these issues constitute effectively the entire or substantially the entireduties he has to perform at CSL.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3)  There is also nothing in CSLâs evidence to suggest that even if Mr Aitken is to be restrained to deal with FMIC and interconnectionissues as sought by the Plaintiffs, CSL would find him not employable and would dismiss him.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  Given I do not accept from the evidence that Mr Aitken would lose his job at CSL by reason of the injunction (if granted), Mr Aitkenâsother grounds to suggest that damages are not a sufficient remedy also fail, since they rest on the fundamental basis that Mr Aitkenwould lose his job at CSL and would not be able to find a job of similar capacity in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  I am therefore satisfied that damages would be a sufficient remedy for Mr Aitken, even if the injunction is wrongfully granted againsthim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  Given my conclusion that damages would not be a sufficient remedy for the Plaintiffs, but would be so for Mr Aitken, I should exercisemy discretion to grant an interlocutory injunction.</p>    <p class="heading">G. Balance of convenience</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  However, if I were wrong on this, and damages were not a sufficient remedy for Mr Aitken, after taking into consideration of allthe circumstance of this case, on the balance of convenience to preserve the <i>status quo ante</i>, I would have also exercised my discretion in favour of granting an interlocutory injunction, in order to preserve the <i>state quo ante</i> (i.e., the confidential information) until trial.</p>    <p class="heading">H.  Material non disclosure</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  Mr Burns SC and Mr McLeish submit that the Plaintiffs are guilty of the following material non disclosure before in obtaining the<i>ex parte</i> orders:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  The Plaintiffs should have but failed to disclose the fact that, before joining PCCW, Mr Aitken had previously worked for CSLin dealing with FMIC/FMC issues.  This is material to the learned judgeâs exercise of discretion since that provides the backgroundto Mr Aitkenâs contention that his involvement in FMC/FMIC issues at PCCW could only be and was peripheral.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  The Plaintiffs misrepresented to the <i>ex parte</i> judge in the evidence, that Mr Aitkenâs work at PCCW was analogous to a solicitor/client relationship by emphasizing Mr Aitkenâslegal qualification as a foreign solicitor, and acted as an adviser to PCCW.  The Plaintiffs so misrepresented the picture so asto boost their misplaced reliance on <i>Bolkiah</i> to support their application for injunctive relief under paragraphs 1 and 3 of the <i>ex parte</i> order.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3)  The Plaintiffs misrepresented the position of their waiver of the non compete clause in Mr Aitkenâs employment contract, inthat they termed it as waiver of garden leave.  They also failed to present the fact that Mr Aitken had bought out one month of histhree months notice period of termination, but misrepresented this as part of the Plaintiffsâ wavier. </p>        <p style="text-align:left">(4)  The Plaintiffs had also failed to draw the <i>ex parte</i> judgeâs attention to the fact that, even if the non compete clause had not been waived, the non compete period would have expiredon 20 June 2008 (only 7 days after the hearing of the <i>ex parte</i> application).  Counsel for Mr Aitken and CSL say that these facts are material to the judgeâs exercise of discretion, since itsupports the argument that the Court would not grant an injunction to restrain use of confidential information which would amountto a non compete clause.  Mr Burns further submits that the Plaintiffs, in discharge of their duty of full and frank disclosure,should have also drawn the courtâs attention to the legal argument against the grant of a restraint of trade equivalent form ofinjunction.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  I will deal with each of these alleged material non disclosure as follows.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  The Plaintiffs would have a duty to draw the Courtâs attention to Mr Aitkenâs previous involvement at CSL, if they were or shouldhave been aware that Mr Aitken might raised the argument that his involvement in the FMC/FMIC issues at PCCW were only peripheraland non essential. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  I am however satisfied that there is nothing to suggest that PCCW was or should have been aware of this potential contention tobe raised by Mr Aitken, given:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  The documentary evidence of Mr Aitkenâs apparent significant degree of involvement in the FMC/FMIC issues at PCCW (as discussedabove), and</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  Mr Aitkenâs own email sent to Mr Chiron on 10 October 2006 before he joined PCCW, stating that he could be involved in FMCand FMC litigation without any restriction,</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  There is therefore no material non disclosure on the Plaintiffsâ failure to bring to the attention of the <i>ex parte</i> judge of Mr Aitkenâs previous employment with CSL.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  Similarly, I do not think the 2<sup>nd</sup> complaint is established.  I have read the respective 1<sup>st</sup> affidavits of Mr Crosswell and Mr Chiron.  I do not get the impression they seek to distort or misrepresent the position of Mr Aitkenâsrole while working at PCCW as alleged.   The picture presented is that Mr Aitken is legally qualified overseas, he was recruitedas the General Manager of Regulatory Affairs, but in addition to his other duties under the post, he had been closely involved invarious legal and strategic discussions concerning the 2007 Statement, and a number of legal proceedings.   In my view, there isno material non disclosure in presenting such a picture.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  I also do not find a case of material non disclosure under the 3<sup>rd</sup> complaint.  In my view, the facts on the waiver and buying out of the notice period are not relevant to the exercise of discretionin deciding whether or not to grant the <i>ex parte</i> order.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  However, I find substance in the 4<sup>th</sup> complaint of material non disclosure.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  For the reasons I have discussed at paragraphs 73 to 91 above, I accept Mr Burns SC and Mr McLeishâs submissions that, to dischargethe strict duty of full and frank disclosure, the Plaintiff should have drawn to the attention of the <i>ex parte</i> judge the legal arguments against the grant of an interlocutory injunction which may amount to a non compete or restraint of tradeclause.  In particular, I think the <i>ex parte</i> judge should have been drawn to the authority of <i>Faccenda Chicken</i> (being the leading authority in confidential information in an employer and employee situation) and the observation of the Courtof Appeal at pp 137G-138A in adopting Cross Jâs judgment in <i>Printers &amp; Finishers</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  In my judgment, it would be material to the <i>ex parte</i> judge to have the benefit of these well known authorities to enable her to properly exercise the discretion in deciding whether togrant or not all the reliefs sought under the <i>ex parte</i> application.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  The failure to draw the <i>ex parte</i> judgeâs attention to these authorities and the potential arguments against the grant of a restraint of trade equivalent injunction,amounts to in my view a material non disclosure.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  In the premises, I will set aside the <i>ex parte</i> orders on this basis.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  However, Mr Burns SC and Mr McLeish have fairly accepted that, even if I am to set aside the <i>ex parte</i> order on the basis of the above material non disclosure, they are not submitting that no interlocutory injunctive orders should bere-granted, on the basis that the Plaintiffs intended to make these material non disclosures, or that they had acted without goodfaith. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  I am therefore free to consider whether to re-grant an interlocutory injunction.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  For the reasons I have set out above in this judgment, I am minded to grant an interlocutory judgment, subject to what I see asthe proper and reasonable terms that should be incorporated to protect the Plaintiffsâ confidential information at this interimstage.</p>    <p class="heading">I.   The terms of the injunction sought are too wide</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  I agree that the terms of the interlocutory injunction sought under the Plaintiffsâ Summons (and thus also under the <i>ex parte</i> order) are in any event too wide and should not be granted on those terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)  In relation to the reliefs sought under paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Plaintiffsâ Summons, for the reasons set out above, theyare clearly too wide and the Plaintiffs are not entitled to them.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)  In relation to the reliefs sought under paragraphs 2 and 4, they are too vague and too generally, which should not be grantedfor the principles set out in paragraphs 51 to 53 above.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">IV.
