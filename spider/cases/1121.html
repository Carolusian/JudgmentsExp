The first was a truck owned and driven by the 1st defendant. The second was a bus owned by the3rd defendant and driven by the 2nd defendant. At this point the Clear Water Bay Road is dual carriage way. It is apparently a newpiece of road, constructed in the interest of safety, at this particular point, which has two down hill traffic lanes in which thesetwo vehicles were proceeding. The leading vehicle initially was the bus. That was travelling in the inner or slow lane. The truckimmediately before the impact was travelling in the outer or fast lane. What happened was that the front near side of the truck hitthe rear off side of the bus quite hard, and bus was, one might almost say, catapulted into the property Las Pinadas. The truck bouncedoff, hit the embankment on the other side, and continued down the road for something like 50 metres.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The first question which arises in this case is whether either of the defendants is liable to the plaintiffs in respect of the damagedone to this property. Now when the case was first came on, a preliminary point was taken by the 1st defendant that the plaintiffshad no right to sue; that the action can only be brought by the owners of Las Pinadas collectively or, by one of the owners as arepresentative; and that the same result could not be achieved by the plaintiffs suing as they sought to do as estate managers.</p>    <p>                </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Now this is one of those points which one can say without any hesitation, has absolutely no merit. It is an obvious convenience ina case of this nature for someone to be there as a representative plaintiff acting on behalf of the owners, so that the case is notbogged down at the outset as to who owns which brick in which of the external walls, and who owns what in the shed where the busfinally arrived. The wrong doers, if any, are fully protected by this sort of proceedings. There would be no question of anybodybeing able to sue them again in the hereafter. The res judicata principle would plainly apply. But the point was raised and I mustdeal with it or rather I must give my reasons for rejecting it at the time.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Two grounds were relied upon. First it was suggested that this was wrong in principle, because the only duty of care owed by eitherdefendant was to the owners and only the owners had suffered damage. I agree entirely. Those are the only persons to whom the dutywas owed, and they are the only persons to have suffered damage. But the plaintiffs do not purport to claim as owners or as the personssuffering damage. They claimed as estate managers. Now if the law had taken a strict line on this that only the owners in these sortof circumstances could sue, and the representative plaintiff was quite unknown, then I would understand the point. As far as I amconcerned the law never has taken that stand. The simplest example is the attorney suing. There are all sorts of other examples,executors are another of people suing in representative capacities. The whole concept of the representative plaintiff or the representativedefendant is intended to insure that justice is done between parties in the most convenient form. The most convenient form here isplainly that there should be a representative plaintiff, and it seems to me that the actual plaintiffs fit that bill very neatly.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The second point taken was that they have not got their tackle in order. Now there is a Deed of Mutual Covenant produced in thiscase and the relevant paragraph is, in fact, set out in extenso in this Statement of claim. It records that the managers should have"the power and authority", those are the governing words in clause 3(1), and then one had to turn on to 19 to find amongst otherthings, ''power and authority to commence conduct and carry on proceedings touching or concerning the estate or the management thereofon behalf of all the owners". Now those words plainly entitle them to do what they are doing here. There is no substance as I seeit in the suggestion that this entitles them to sue in contract and not in tort. The only reason which gave me a pause for thoughtat the time that this submission was being made, was that on the same date as Deed of Mutual Covenant was entered into, there wasanother Deed of Appointment of these self-same managers. For reasons which I am totally unable to understand the draftsman of thatdocument did not refer to the Deed of Mutual Covenant. He picked up about 50% of the Deed of Mutual Covenant and then reproducedthat in the actual Deed of Appointment under the preamble: "the duties of the managers shall be generally to manage and provide servicesto the satisfaction of the owners and at particular but without derogating from the generality of the foregoing to do the following".So this was for reasons which I do not understand, drafted by way of example, and it does not seem to me that I have got to makea nonsense of this situation by treating that Deed as emasculating the Deed of Mutual Covenant, and cutting down the powers to thosewhich are expressly set out in the second document, when that second document is drafted in that form. So for those reasons I rejectedthe basic submission. I will therefore now turn to the question of liability.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Now this is a fairly classic case of res ipsa loquitur. Properly controlled buses do not effect entry through brick walls and intoL. P. Gas stores. Properly controlled lorries do not run into the back of buses. In these sort of circumstances the law takes simplepragmatic line. It says that the fact that you have hit something in this way is a prima facie case of negligence, and the personconcerned has to show that this happened without negligence on his part. The principle was most recently expressed in the decisionin the House of Lords in <u>Henderson</u> v. <u>Jenkins</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%20A%20C%20282" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) A. C. 282</a> which followed and applied <u>Barkway</u> v. <u>South Wales Transport</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281950%29%201%20All%20E%20R%20392" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1950) 1 All E. R. 392.</a></p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Now as far as the 2nd defendant is concerned it seems to me that he can very simply explain that this happened without negligenceon his part, because all that happened was that he was hit in the rear by this truck and pitched into this property. Immediatelybefore this, the 2nd defendant was driving his bus at what seems to me to be a perfectly proper speed, in the order of 30 miles anhour, on his own side of the road; obviously keeping pretty close to the near side edge of the carriage way; running quietly downthis hill, applying his brakes periodically to maintain an overall speed of about 30. There is no way that I can see in which hecan be said to have been negligent in doing that; no way that I can see in which he could possibly have avoided this accident. Variousinteresting hypotheses were put to him in cross examination, and rather to my surprise, were accepted by him. He was maintainingthat he could have done all sorts of things to have avoided this accident. I found the whole exercise both question and answer totallyunreal. As far as I am concerned I acquit this 2nd defendant of any degree of negligence at all.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The 1st defendant is in a very different position because he was the one who actually struck the bus. He seeks to explain that factby a total loss of braking. What he said in evidence was this: he was proceeding down the left hand lane of this carriage way at25 mph in second gear. When he was some three or four lengths away (that mathematically put him between 25 and 35 metres away) hefirst saw this bus. He then applied his brakes. Nothing happened, and there was a "sudden total loss of brake function" in the wordsof the pleading. He swung his vehicle to the right to endeavour to avoid the bus. He failed to do so, and instead ran on down thehill, he said, faster and faster. He sought to attribute the whole of the fault for this accident to a complete loss of braking function.I regret to say that I am totally unable to accept that account or that explanation for this accident.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> First and foremost I cannot accept the hypothesis that his starting speed was 25 mph or that he was proceeding in second gear. Inmy judgment he was much more likely to have been doing at least 40 mph and was almost certainly in fourth, if not fifth gear. Myreasons for so concluding are these: First of all I have heard a good deal about this lorry in the course of this trial: Its engineis capable of 2,400 revolutions a minute. Second gear is a very low gear indeed, it is the ordinary starting gear. It was commonground amongst all of the experts that the maximum speed of this vehicle in second gear was between 20 and 25 mph. Now let us assumethat he was coming down this hill at 25 mph in the second gear, which would have required a considerable degree of throttle on hispart having regard to the gradient. He then takes his foot off the accelerator and applies his brake. Assume again total failureof brakes. It seems to me from what I have heard of this vehicle, that as soon as this defendant took his foot off that accelerator,and the rear wheels started to be effected by the compression of the engine in the second gear as they would have been, then he wouldat once have started to slow down. There is no possible way that I can see, that he would then have gained speed, and rushed downfaster and faster, which is what he said happened and what in fact must have happened.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Secondly the bus itself was travelling, as I find, at about 30 mph. This truck gained on this bus in a very short space of time immediatelybefore the collision and I believe must have been doing at least 10 mph faster than the bus.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Thirdly, there was a considerable tyre mark left on this road, which was some 98 metres in length that in over 100 yards. That tellsits own story for a number of reasons. First of all, consider the length of that trey mark. That is the distance this vehicle requiredto stop. It is very difficult to reconcile that with a starting speed of 25 mph in second gear, but you have to throw in one or twoother things as well. First you have to throw in the impact with the bus; secondly you have to throw in the impact with the embankmentwall which the photographs showed to have been quite considerable; and thirdly you have to throw in another 32Â½ metres from thepoint where it struck the embankment wall while it bounced along with one set of wheels on the road and the other set of wheels onthe verge depositing mud all down the roadway. Now put all those factors together, and in my judgment they are flatly inconsistentwith a starting speed of 25 miles an hour.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The second thing about the mark is its location. This starts almost in the middle of the road. It then swings into the near sidecarriage way, and explains the impact as this lorry veered across the road. Then it swings back following the course the lorry tookafter impact. It is perfectly obviously that when that braking action started the vehicle was in the fast lane not in the near sidelane, as this defendant was seeking to assert.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Thirdly, the width of this tyre mark is instructive. It is a very narrow mark indeed, and is in my judgment totally consistent witha vehicle tending to veer across the road because it was travelling too fast in those conditions, and was attempting to break away.There must have been much greater adhesion between the road and the near side wheels that left this mark, than the off side wheelsat that time, which could well have resulted in considerably reduced braking adhesion. This may explain why this defendant thoughtthat his brakes were at fault, when at the last moment he applied them, as this bus first came into view.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Putting these facts together as best I can, I am totally satisfied that he rounded this corner at a speed much in excess of 25 milesan hour: was somewhat alarmed to find that he was then faced with a bus occupying the whole of the near side carriage way. He triedto steer past it, but having regard to his speed, the loading of his vehicle (I have there the crane in mind) and the gradient ofthe road, he was unable to maintain his course in his carriage way. In the more colloquial terms of the motorist, he "ran out ofcorner". That was, in my judgment the predominant cause of this accident. The quality of his brakes had very little to do with it.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> I turn now to the defense of latent defect, and the condition of the brakes themselves.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> My findings on the evidence are these. First it is quite apparent that there was no total failure of these brakes at all. This couldonly have come about on this vehicle if there had been not one but two major leakages of brake fluid, because there are two mastercylinders and two quite separate system, one for the rear wheels and one for the front wheels. There was no major leakage of anysort at all. I am certainly not prepared to speculate on the possibility that something might have happened like that, which wastotally undetected by the vehicle examiner. As far as the efficiency of the brakes themselves go, I have found this a rather moredifficult matter. Making the best estimate I can I would say they were not 100% but they were somewhere between 80% and 90%.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> There were three things. First they needed adjustment. What I am quite unable to find is by how much they needed adjustment. Theywere looked at on the site and again in a vehicle pound by the vehicle examiner after the accident. Unfortunately he did not tryeither on the site, when it might well have been impossible, or later when it certainly would have been possible, to take any precisemeasurements of the actual clearances. What he did was to put a ruler in through the inspection hole in the wheels, and try to assessthe clearances. I emphasise the word "assess", because he repeatedly told me in this part of his evidence that he was relying onhis experience, and that his experience enabled him to make this assessment. Now experience is one thing, precise measurement issomething in my judgment rather different. So I am certainly not prepared to find that the clearances were of the sizes which hegave me in evidence. I am satisfied that they needed adjustment and possibly that the setting was some way out. I am not preparedto go any further.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> I am certainly not prepared to find that this itself constituted a grave impairment of the braking system of this lorry. Becausethis lorry has not got a simple hydraulic braking system. It has got what is called an "air over hydraulic" braking system. Unlikethe old fashioned hydraulic braking system, you cannot tell by the travel of the brake pedal what the state of your brake liningsare. You cannot feel the dead part of the travel as you depress the brakes until the linings start to take effect on the brake drumps,because on this system as soon as you press the pedal compressed air is released and that does all the work for you. It is powerassisted braking. This mean that if there is a consistent pressure from the air, and if your clearances are too great, it takes slightlylonger for the brakes to operate. But once they operate, there is no very grave impairment of their braking capacity. Now that isthe effect of the evidence about this system as I understand it. So that the first thing wrong was that they needed adjustment, butthis did not gravely affect or seriously affect their capacity as brakes.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Secondly they needed bleeding. There was air in the system. Again I have no idea how much air there was and how serious this wasat the time. Normally air in the system produces a tendency to sponginess in the brakes. It does not so much affect their actualcapacity. It delays the time in which they take to operate. The compressed air which operates the system has not only to force thebrake fluid through to the slave cylinders on the wheels themselves. It also has to go through the motions of compressing the intrusiveair. So again this diminished their capacity, it did not make the brakes useless by a very long way. The extent to which it did thisI still do not know, because it all depends on the quantity of air there, and as to that the vehicle examiner was completely silent.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Thirdly the brake reservoir needed topping up. This is one of the more bizarre parts of the case in some respects because the brakefluid was found to be at a surprisingly low level. It is some-thing of a mystery as to how it reached that level. I am minded tothink that one of the principle causes for that is the fact that this defendant chose to test the level of the brake fluid, not byreading the level through the transparent covering to the cylinder and seeing where the line was, but by taking the cap off, andinserting the index finger of his left hand into the liquid. The index finger of his left hand has plainly suffered an accident,the top, the outer phalanx, having been lost. That necessarily meant that every time he did this a piece of brake fluid was removedfrom this reservoir. When the experts were telling me firmly that there is no great loss of brake fluid and there is no evaporation,none of them was considering a loss from this particular source, because I do not think any of them considered that this was a likelymethod of inspecting. But that, I am quite satisfied in what this defendant was doing, and this, I believe, if continually down,as he said, day after day, may well have had a major hand in reducing this level. Now the level was low. It needed topping up. Itwas not so low that there was a shortage of brake fluid. It was low enough probably to allow air into the system at a sharp angleor over rough ground. It may have been the cause of the air that was in the system. That is all.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> It is with those consideration in mind that I have suggested the brakes in this case were between 80 and 90% efficient not 100%,as being the best figure that I can put on the rather tangled evidence that I have heard. I believe that this defendants accountthat it was brake failure which brought about this accident is really totally unrealiable and I reject it.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Before leaving the question of brakes I should also refer to the question of maintenance. Here I am bound to say that I think I haveheard a good deal of exaggeration from the 1st defendant. It often happens, where an accident occurs like this, and a man has convincedhimself that it was the failure of brakes, then the story about the attempts made before the accident to look after the brakes tendsto get magnified out of all reality.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> First of all I am quite satisfied that he was by no means a reckless man when it came to brakes. He emphasised on several occasionsin his evidence, and I have no difficulty in believing, that he was very conscious of the significance of brakes, and the importancesof brakes both for the safety of himself, his son along side him in the cab and others on the road.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Secondly I am quite satisfied that he was not conscious himself before this accident of any imperfections such as I have tried todescribes in the braking system itself. Because it is power assisted as I have tried to explain, the old fashioned guides to thequality of the brakes have been either lost altogether or very substantially masked. The expert engineer getting into this cab mighthave been able to say: Ah! Yes, you need adjustment. Ah! Yes, there is some sponginess in these brakes. I do not think it by anymeans follows that this defendant could have reached the same conclusion, and I am satisfied on the facts that I have heard, thathe did not.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Thirdly, what he did was to entrust to a Mr. Lau, who runs Ting Hing Motors, the maintenance of his vehicle. I am satisfied havingheard evidence from both him and the defendant that in August 1982 a service was done by Lau on this vehicle which included a checkingof these brakes. This was a reasonable step for the defendant to take, and I do not believe that there is anything else that he shouldthen have done. At the time of the accident he was coming up for his next service, but only just under two months had elapsed sincethe last. There was no sign on that account, which I accept, of obvious neglect.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> In those circumstances I think that the brakes played a fairly minor part in this whole story, and would have played such a minorpart but for the explanation that the 1st defendant chose to give. I think that he has totally failed to explain the circumstancesof this accident, and so has failed to show that it occurred without negligence on his part. More positively I find it was causedby his speed on the road.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Now as far as quantum is concerned the claim as pleaded is for $66,220. There was no serious issue about that save in respect ofone sum which was part of the claim made by Hong Kong L. P. Gas for the damage they suffered in putting things right after the accident.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> It is common ground that he bus went straight into the hut where the L. P. cylinders were kept, and that prior to the accident L.P. Gas was being supplied to the owners of these properties out of large cylinders which were in fact in that hut. Fortunately foreverybody, those cylinders although damaged proved to be repairable. After the whole thing was over, Hong Kong L. P. Gas submittedits own bill to the plaintiffs in the sum of just over $32,000 as being its damage suffered from this incident. What is suggestedis that one of these items is bad, and that what L. P. were doing, was not charging the cost to them of providing gas for the customersin the interim period, but were including in that the cost of the gas itself, and looking for recovery twice, i.e. the cost of thegas from the plaintiff and the cost of gas from the consumers. I do not so read this bill. I can see no good reason from making thatassumption against Hong Kong L. P. Gas Company Limited. For my part, I think that this claim is made out for the sum claimed. Inthose circumstances there must be judgment for the plaintiff against the 1st defendant for that sum, whereas correspondingly theremust be judgment for the 2nd defendant against the plaintiff.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> I then turn to the more interesting and somewhat more difficult issue in the case which arises on the 1st defendant's claim in thethird party proceedings. He now seeks an indemnity against his insurers, the Pacific Insurance Co., the third party, under the policywhich was then in force. Now this was a typical commercial vehicle policy. It provided in section 1 for insurance of the motor vehicleitself; the material terms being "the company will indemnify the insured against loss of or damage to the motor vehicle".   It thengoes on in section 2 to provide third party cover. The material words are: "the company will indemnify ..... the insurer againstall sums ....... which the insurer shall become <u>legally liable</u> to pay in respect of (a) death of or bodily injury to any person and (b) damage to property, where such death or injury or damagearises out of an accident caused by or in connection with the motor vehicle". Now the important words are "legally liable to pay"arising out an incident concerning the motor vehicle.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Two points are taken by insurers under this policy. They both arise under the policy conditions. The policy conditions are introducedby this (which is in fact condition 2): "the due observation and, fulfilment of the terms of this policy in so far as they relateto anything to be done or not to be done by the insured ..... shall be Conditions precedent to any liability of the company to makeany payment under this policy". So what follows are conditions precedent. It is important to make that point because it means thatif there is any breach of these conditions then no payment need be made under the policy, regardless of whether there is any causalconnection between the breach of the condition and the accident itself. That is the difference in insurance parlance between a conditionand a warranty.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Now the first condition which is said to be breached is condition 5 which amongst other things requires this" " every writ, summonsand process shall be notified or forwarded to the company immediately on receipt". Now that arises in this way. Some time on or before26th January 1983, the 1st defendant received a message that his presence was required at the Argyle Street Police Station in theafternoon of the 26th. He duly attended. A document has been put before me showing that I think on something like 1405 hours on thatday, he was then served with a summons returnable the next day and charging him with having had a vehicle on the road, the brakesof which were in a defective condition. I am paraphrasing because I have not got the document in front of me. What the 1st defendanttells me is that he had some discussion about this at the time as to what he was going to do. He was then asked to wait; as he hadto put up $500 bail. By the time he put up bail, it was something like half past five in the afternoon. He then went home. He dulyattended the Court the next day, sat around all day waiting for his case to come on and then he was duly charged, pleaded guiltyand was fined $500.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> It was the next day, the 28th, that he wrote to insurers telling them what had happened. The point is taken against him that he didnot deal with this "immediately". Now I have no doubt in my own mind that the draftsman of condition 5,(it was no doubt done in Londonmany years ago), never in his wildest imagination expected a summons to be served in the afternoon of day 1, returnable on the morningof day 2. Certainly I have never heard of anything like that ever happening in the U.K. and I do not suppose it ever will happen.But it is that simple event in this case, which seems to me to have totally emasculated this condition. The condition required thatthe summons "be forwarded immediately on receipt". If this defendant had remembered all this when he left the police station about5.30, had got himself a photostat copy of the summons and had put it in the post that night, is still would not have reached theinsurers, I suspect, until at least the morning after. It would certainly have been much too late for them to have taken any effectivesteps to influence the course of events that day at the magistrate court.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> I think the short answer to this is in fact be found in what I suppose it might called a definition of the word "immediate" in thiscontext in the judgment of Fletcher Moulton L. J. in <u>Re Coleman's Depositories</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281907%29%202%20K%20B%20798" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1907) 2 K. B. 798</a>, where at page 807 he said this: " The courts have not always considered that they are bound to interpret provisions of this kindwith unreasonable strictness, and although the word "immediately" is no doubt a strong epithet, I think it might reasonably be construedas meaning with all reasonable speed considering the circumstances of the case". I think "all reasonable speed considering the circumstances"in this case was the 28th, the day after his conviction when eventually this defendant had time to get around to notifying the insurersas to what was happening.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> I therefore turn to the much more interesting point which arises under condition 4. Condition 4 is in these terms: "The insured shalltake all reasonable steps to safeguard the motor vehicle from loss or damage" (that is plainly going back to section 1 of the policy)"and to maintain the motor vehicle in efficient condition". What is said here is this; first this motor vehicle was not in efficientcondition and secondly the insured failed to take all reasonable steps to maintain it in efficient condition. It is convenient, Ithink, to deal with the two questions which arise in that order.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Now what is meant by "efficient condition" in these circumstances has been most usefully dealt with by Sellers L. J. who was thetrial judge in a case called <u>Conn</u> v. <u>Westminster Motor</u> <u>Insurance Association</u> (1966) 1 L. L. R. page 123. Sellers L. J. dealt with this on page 127, and he made a number of points. First, he said, that efficientdoes not mean perfect condition. Secondly he said, it has got to be construed in the context of the policy, which is the contractbetween underwriters and the insured, and pointing out that it does not necessarily bear the same meaning in other context as forexample between owner and motor dealer. He then goes on to say; "I think what the policy requires, is that the vehicle should bein a sufficiently efficient condition to be suitable for the purpose for which it was to be used, that is to say used upon the roadway".He is refining a little upon what he had said in an earlier case <u>Brown</u> v. <u>Zurich Insurance Company</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%202%20L%20L%20R%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 2 L. L. R. 243</a> where he had likened the expression to "roadworthy".</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> Therefore, the question I think I have to ask myself in this case is: (it being accepted that the onus is on the insurers) have theinsurers proved that this vehicle was unroadworthy on the day of the accident by reason of its brakes: Was it not in a sufficientlyefficient condition to be suitable for its use on the road? I confess I have found this is a difficult decision in view of the ambiguitieswhich I have already referred to about the actual state of the brakes. I ask myself this: what would have happened if some mechanicalengineer had got into the cab of this vehicle on the morning? Would he have said, "No, this vehicle must be taken straight into thegarage, it is not fit to be driven?" Am I satisfied that this is what he would have said? Having regard to the evidence that I haveheard from this defendant, and from Mr. Lau, I am not satisfied that he would have said that. In other words I am not satisfied thatinsurers have in this context made out that this vehicle at the time was in an inefficient condition within the meaning of the policy.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> But that is very much a knife edge decision. Therefore I am going on to deal with the second matter, upon the assumption that myfinding there is wrong, and I should have concluded that this vehicle was not in an efficient condition; and in fact that I shouldhave totally accepted what the vehicle examiner said about it i.e. that it should have its license suspended. That involves decidingwhat is meant within the context of this policy by taking "reasonable steps to maintain the vehicle in an efficient condition". Thisis not an absolute condition: the insured is not under an absolute or an unqualified obligation to keep the machine in efficientcondition. He has to take reasonable steps to maintain it, and the meaning of that phrase "reasonable steps" has been the subjectmatter of quite a lot of authority.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> It goes back, I think, first of all to a case called <u>Woolfall &amp; Rimmer</u> v. <u>Moyle</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281942%29%201%20K%20B%2066" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1942) 1 K. B. 66.</a> This was a claim arising under a Workman's Compensation Policy. In dealing with that case, Goddard L. J. in the Court of Appeal particularlymade two points. The point at issue in the case was the construction of the phrase "the assured shall take reasonable precautionsto prevent accidents and to comply with all statutory obligations". The first point he made is that this phrase is found in the underwritingcontract, in a contract between underwriter and assured and not in a contract between an employer and the employed, and must be readand construed in that context. Secondly, a construction had to be avoided which would involve "granting an indemnity with one handand taking it away with another".</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> This reasoning was taken up by the Court of Appeal in the case of <u>Frazer</u> v. <u>Furman Productions</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%201%20W%20L%20R%20898" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 1 W. L. R. 898.</a> This was another employer employee workmen's compensation type policy. The position was very closely analysed in an invaluable judgmentby Diplock L. J. in the Court of Appeal. He started by setting out the terms of the indemnity in that case, which was "against liabilityat law for damages and injury or disease" arising out of or in the course of the employment". He also pointed out that, as in thiscase, he was dealing with a condition precedent: His first point was that the condition has to be read in that context. He said this:"When one approaches the construction of the condition one does so in this context; and applies the rule that one does not construea condition as repugnant to the commercial purpose of` the contract". I can see no obvious difference between that case and this,and between the terms of the indemnity in that case and this. Both indemnities relate to liability at law, and both conditions dealwith a situation which could give rise to a claim under that indemnity i.e. personal negligence.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> From that starting point Diplock L. J. then goes on to say that three considerations have to be borne in mind on the wording of sucha condition. He refers first to the personal negligence principle established in the <u>Woolfall &amp; Rimmer</u> case. He then says that the obligation was to take measures to avert dangers in exactly the same way as the obligation here was totake measures to prevent the vehicle falling into a dangerous condition. Then thirdly, "the third word to be construed in this contextis "reasonable" ...... "reasonable" does not mean reasonable as between the employer and the employee.   It means reasonable as betweenthe insurer and the insured having regard the commercial purpose of the contract which is inter alia to indemnify the insured againstliability for his, ( the insured's) personal negligence". Now it seems to me the precisely the same considerations apply here. Thenhaving framed the test in that way the conclusion that he draws is this: "What in my judgment is reasonable as between the insuredand the insurer, without being repugnant to the commercial purpose of the contract, is that the insured, where he does recognisea danger, should not deliberately court it by taking measures which he himself knows are inadequate to avert it. In other words itis not enough that the employer's omission to take any particular precautions to avoid accident should be negligent; it must be atleast reckless, i.e. made with actual recognition by the insured himself that the danger exists, and not caring whether or not itis averted. The purpose of the condition is to insure that the insured will not, because he is covered against loss by the policyrefrain from taking precautions which he knows ought to be taken".</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> That is the clearest possible statement where you have an overlap or potential overlap between the cover and the condition, as tothe way in which the two should be read to bring about a reconciliation. I find it very compelling, not surprising because RoskillJ. came to exactly the same conclusion in <u>Lane</u> v. <u>Spratt</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%202%20QB%20480" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 2 Q.B. 480.</a> This was not a workmen's compensation case. This concerned goods in transit cover. The cover was "against the insured's legal liabilityas carrier for loss of or destruction of or damage to goods" Roskill J. was there construing a due diligence clause which requiredthe insured "to take all reasonable precautions for the protection and safeguarding of the goods". He concluded that the insuredthere were negligent in the sense that they failed to take the precautions normally taken in the trade when taking on a driver, butthat they would not reckless in the sense that that word is used by Diplock L. J. He directed himself in accordance with DiplockL. J. 's judgment.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> So if the matter had ended there, there would be ample authority for saying that I should follow the same direction, the same pathlaid down by Diplock L. J. But it is suggested that the motoring cases specifically have adopted a slightly different approach. Nowthe first of these I have already referred to, <u>Brown</u> v. <u>Zurich</u>, a decision of Sellers J.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%20L%20L%20R%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) L. L. R. 243.</a>  In that case, the insured sought to rely upon the decision in <u>Woolfall &amp; Rimmer</u> and the dicta of Goddard L. J., but they were put on one side by Sellers J. who said that was a different subject matter, differentwording, different type of policy. By a strange coincidence he was the trial judge again, sitting as an additional judge at the Queen'sBench Division, in <u>Conn</u> v. <u>Westminster Motor</u>. He found in favour of the insured taxi driver. That decision was reversed on appeal, and it is the basis of the reasoning in theCourt of Appeal which is the most instructive,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%201%20L%20L%20R%20407" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 1 L. L. R. 407.</a></p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Two points were taken in that case against the taxi driver. First it was said that he had a hopeless braking system, and there wasa lot of evidence led to this effect. The evidence did not differ materially in kind from the evidence that has been led before me,except that the system, I think, was more obviously worse.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Secondly it was said, that he had two bald tyres on the front wheels of his car and those were in themselves dangerous. Now SellersL. J. found in favour of the taxi driver on both because he accepted in the court below that the taxi driver was unaware of any deficiencyin the braking system. With that part of his decision, the Court of Appeal declined to interfere.  But they reversed him on the tyres,and it is instructed to see why they did that.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> First Wilmer L. J., page 412, having gone through the evidence concluded: "I can see no reason why he should not have known of thestate of both of them" and he referring there to both the tyres. Davis L. J. on page 413 poses this question: "Did he know or oughthe to have known the condition of those two tyres. Again it appears that the answer to that is inevitably "yes". It was staring himin the face. He must have known the condition of both tyres. He must have known, as any car driver, and particularly someone whohas been driving a taxi cab for very many years would know, that front tyres in that condition are unroadworthy and indeed unsafe".One can see the double emphasis; the judge is saying: First, I am quite satisfied that he knew that the tyres were in this conditionand secondly that that condition rendered the tyres unsafe.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> To the same effect is Salmond L. J. at page 414. There he pointed out that Sellers L. J. "accepted the plaintiff's evidence that,although it may be that as a rule the sort of defects from which these brakes suffered would have been all too apparent to anyonedriving the car, this plaintiff in fact did not appreciate that the cab was suffering from any such defects and had no reason todo so. It therefore followed on those findings, that although the brakes were inefficient, it could not be said that the plaintiffhad failed to take reasonable step to maintain them". Now one starts there with the conclusion that Salmond L. J. thought that afinding of knowledge was implicitly necessary. Having gone through the evidence on the tyres he concludes on page 415: "It seemsto me that the plaintiff must have known (or certainly should have known) about the conditions of these two front tyres. They weremanifestly dangerous and it was highly riskly to drive a taxi cab around London with tyres in that condition".</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Now that is the way Salmond L. J. puts it, and I come back to the earlier decision in <u>Frazer</u> v. <u>Furman</u> and ask myself what discernible difference is there between the approach in that case and the approach in this case. My answer isI cannot see one. What Salmond L. J. seems to me to be doing is applying exactly the same test as Diplock L. J. was suggesting shouldbe applied. So I think that although the two lines of authority have yet to be brought together in England, I cannot myself detectany difference between them. I think that where you have (1) cover against legal liability which includes liability in negligenceand (2) a condition, an exception which covers part of exactly the same cover, that ones approach to the construction of that conditionought to be that laid down by Diplock L. J. The test is recklessness; refraining from taking precautions against a known danger;or conscious neglect of some patent risk. That is the construction that on these authorities I should put upon this policy.</p>    <p>                   </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> It follows from my findings of fact, that this defense must fail, because I am satisfied that this defendant was not reckless, andhe did not appreciate that there was anything materially wrong or indeed anything wrong at all with the braking system of his vehicleon the day in question. In my judgment therefore he is entitled to an indemnity under his policy.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">( D.S.
