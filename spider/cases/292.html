By this order, the Registrar applied the DistrictCourt Scale for the taxation of the Plaintiffâs costs of this action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Background</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The Plaintiff issued a writ against the Defendants on 15 May 2001 for infringement of copyright and for passing off the toys soldby the Defendants as those sold by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Both the Plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant were manufacturers of war toys.  One type of toys sold by the Plaintiff was called Combat Peace Fighters.  They cost from$3.25 to $16.25 per set.  These toys were packaged in transparent plastic bags.  Each bag of toys also had a colourful header cardthat was part of the packaging.  This card was commissioned by the Plaintiff from an artist.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant infringed the Plaintiffâs copyright in this header card by using a header card that was identical or substantially similarto it for the packaging of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs war toys.  The Plaintiff thus sued the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant for infringement of copyright and passing off.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> Defendants were also sued on the basis that they were the directors and alter egos of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and were responsible for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs acts.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Defendants filed an Acknowledgement of Service of the Writ at the end of May 2001 indicating that they did not intend to contestthe proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  On 6 June 2001, the Defendantsâ solicitors wrote to the Plaintiffâs solicitors advising them that the 1st Defendantâs totalsale of toys with the infringing header card was less than $300,000 and the profit margin was less than 10%.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Judgment was entered on 20 June 2001 against the Defendants for an injunction from infringement of copyright and passing off, anorder to deliver up the infringing items, payment of damagers pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 108</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528" class="autolink_findacts">Copyright Ordinance</a> and inquiry as to damages of the Plaintiff or, at the Plaintiffâs option, an account of profits.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On 23 August 2001, the Plaintiffâs solicitors wrote to the Defendantsâ solicitors and demanded $4,264,264.95 for full and finalsettlement of the action.  This sum was said to be 15% of $28,428,433 alleged loss in sales as a result of the infringement and passingoff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The alleged loss in sales was calculated from the ratio of the total sales in 1996 to 1998 to the advertising expenditure incurredin the same years.  The ratio was $28,538 of turnover per $1 advertising expenditure.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Plaintiff applied the same ratio on the advertising expenditures incurred in the years from 1998 to February 2001 and came tocertain sale figures that they say they should have obtained in the same years.  However, the actual sales figures in those yearswere less than the figures produced by the above ratio.  The Plaintiff therefore said that they had suffered a shortfall in saleat $28,428,433 as referred to above and such shortfall was caused by the 1st Defendantâs infringement and passing off.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The letter of 23 August 2001 did not mention any loss of goodwill and reputation.  However, such alleged loss assumed much significancein the Plaintiffâs claim as it developed to a later stage.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Defendantsâ solicitors wrote back on 10 September 2001 and said that the Plaintiffâs drop in sale was because of the trendin the industry and fierce competition by Mainland competitors.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  On 7 December 2001, the Plaintiffâs solicitors wrote and asked for detailed account of profits from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant for the infringement and passing off.  They also got an order from Master Yuen on 14 January 2002 requiring the Defendantsto file and serve a true account of profits with full particulars of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs gross profits.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On 23 January 2002, the Defendantsâ solicitors delivered three tables showing the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs sale transactions of the toys with the infringing header cards for the years of 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1997, 1 April1999 to 31 March 2000 and 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2001.  Copies of all the contracts and invoices of the sales referred to in thetables were also supplied.  The letter stated that there was no other sale and the profit margin was at 11.8%.  The total sales disclosedin the three tables were at $304,408.40.  Nevertheless, the Plaintiff was not satisfied with the account.  There was further correspondenceon the information disclosed by the first Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On 8 August 2002, the Defendants paid $56,000 into court under Order 22 of the Rules of the High Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Despite the order of Master Yuen on 14 January 2002 requiring an account of profits from the Defendants, the Plaintiff obtainedanother order from another Master for conducting an assessment of damages but without any direction for filing of pleadings.  Theparties then filed and exchanged lists of documents pursuant to this order.  They then continued with their correspondence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  On 5 November 2003, the Plaintiffâs solicitors referred to Master Yuenâs order of 14 January 2002 and alleged that the documents/informationprovided in the letter of the Defendantsâ solicitors dated 23 January 2002 (which was made more than 21 months previously) werewholly unacceptable and unsatisfactory.  There was then further correspondence on quantum of damages and disclosure of more informationand documentation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Eventually on 12 January 2004, the Defendantsâ solicitors wrote to the Plaintiffâs solicitors and pointed out that the Plaintiffwas only entitled to an enquiry of damages or an account of profits but not both and the Plaintiff had to elect for one of them,however, the Plaintiff appeared to be pursuing both.  The Plaintiffâs solicitors still did not make any election but continuedto accuse the Defendants of having provided insufficient and misleading documents and information.  They only elected for enquiryof damages by their letter of 25 May 2004.  They also demanded discovery of a long list of documents and information.  The partiescontinued to correspond on the further discovery. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  On 23 July 2004, the Plaintiff applied by summons for specific discovery of a large number of documents.  On 31 August 2004, theDefendants also issued a summons for directions on exchange of pleadings for the inquiry of damages.  Both summonses were beforeMaster Ho on 4 October 2004.  Master Ho gave directions for exchange of pleadings pursuant to the Defendantsâ summons.  He howeverallowed only a very limited part of the Plaintiffâs summons for specific discovery and dismissed the rest with indemnity costsagainst the Plaintiff. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The Plaintiff filed its Points of Claim on 15 February 2005.  The claim asked for loss of $4,128,386 because of alleged loss ofsales in 1999 to 2001.  Alternatively, it asked for loss of sales at $130,743.55 which was allegedly based on the amount of infringementbusiness of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant plus six more orders between 1999 and 2001.  It further claimed $6,665,928 for injury to the Plaintiffâs goodwill andreputation and $4,128,386 as additional damages under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 108(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528" class="autolink_findacts">Copyright Ordinance</a>.  Taking the larger figure for loss because of alleged loss of sales, the total claim was at $14,922,698. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The Defendants filed their Points of Defence on 18 July 2005.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  On 16 August 2005 the Defendants made a 2<sup>nd</sup> payment in of $94,000 into court under Order 22.  The total sum paid in was $150,000.  The Plaintiff accepted this sum under Order22 on 29 August 2005.  This sum included the interest accrued since 15 May 2001. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Since the amount obtained by the Plaintiff was within the jurisdiction of the District Court, the Registrar in accordance with thedirection in paragraph 22(1) of <i>Lai Ki v B+B Construction Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%203%20HKC%20329" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 3 HKC 329</a> determined on 25 April 2006 that the District Court Scale should apply for the taxation of the Plaintiffâs costs.  The Plaintiffappealed.  The Plaintiff has also filed an affirmation of Mr Chan Tak Shing made on 13 June 2006 to support this appeal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Seagroatt J said in <i>Lai Ki v B+B Construction Co.

To that end thevaluation of the claim must be on the basis of full liability.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(2)   The order by consent, or upon adjudication, for the plaintiffâs costs to be taxed does not carry with it any inference orconstruction that it means costs on a High Court scale.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(3)   For the purposes of deciding the proper forum in which to commence proceedings the amount of the employeeâs compensation paidand received must be deducted.</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">22.   The proper course for the plaintiffâs solicitors to take in a High Court action is as follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(1)   Where a sum of money which is within the District Court jurisdiction is paid into court, and accepted by the plaintiff (withoutagreement by the parties as to the scale of costs to be taxed), the plaintiff must apply promptly by way of summons to a master fora determination as to the scale of costs.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(2)   Where the parties agree a settlement in a sum within the District Court jurisdiction and there is agreement as to the scaleof costs, this must appear in the consent order or in a joint letter to the court.  If there is no such agreement as to costs thenthe Plaintiff must promptly apply by way of summons for the costs issue to be determined by a master.  If the settlement is achievedbefore trial commences or in the course of a trial then the plaintiffâs solicitors must ask the trial judge to decide the issueof the scale of costs.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The Plaintiffâs first argument-automatic taxation at High Court Scale</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The Plaintiffâs first argument on this appeal is that when a High Court action is resolved by acceptance of payment into Courtunder Order 22 (rather than by adjudication or settlement),the Plaintiff is automatically entitled to taxed costs as per the HighCourt Scale.  The Plaintiff submitted that this is a matter of law and what Seagroatt J said in para. 22(1) of <i>Lai Ki</i> should not apply.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mr Yau, counsel for the Plaintiff, referred me to Order 62, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">rules 9(1)</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">10</a>(2) of the Rules of the High Court.

(1) Subject to subsection (2), the tribunal may award to a party costs and expenses, which may include-</p>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(a)      any reasonable expenses necessarily incurred and any loss of salary or wages suffered by that party; and</p>            </blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(b)     any reasonable sum paid to a witness for expenses necessarily incurred and any loss of salary or wages suffered by him,</p>            </blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">in attending the hearing.</p>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(2) In making an award of costs under this section, the tribunal shall include a direction as to the amount to be paid by each partywho is liable to pay costs.</p>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(3) An award of costs shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other award of the tribunal.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  His Honour Judge Yung dismissed the application and held that the Plaintiff was entitled to his taxed costs on the appropriate DistrictCourt Scale. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal.  Keith, JA said at 569H that the words âhis costs of the actionâ in O.62 r.10(2),when read with Rule 9(1), referred to the partyâs taxed costs of the action, and the court has no discretion to direct that thecosts be assessed on some other basis.  The learned Judge drew support for his conclusion from the legislative history of O.62 r.10(2). Before this rule was amended, there were the words âunless the court otherwise ordersâ in this rule.  The learned Judge regardedthe removal of these words by the amendment as the removal of the courtâs discretion to direct that there shall be no taxationfor the Plaintiffâs costs.  The learned Judge also referred to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Hudson v Elmbridge Borough Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20WLR%20880" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 WLR 880</a> which came to the same conclusion that the judicial discretion had been removed.  Mr Yau thus argued that the Plaintiff in the presentcase should be entitled to taxed costs on the High Court Scale automatically.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Mr Yan, SC for the Defendants, drew my attention to the Court of Appeal case of <i>M Beraha &amp; Co.

The Plaintiff/Appellant there claimed the Respondent for return of rental deposit at $52,000.  There was no payment into courtunder Order 22 of the Rules of the District Court.  At the trial before his Honour Judge Lok, the parties settled their claim at$47,130 and judgment was entered against the Respondent for this sum.  On the issue of costs, Judge Lok considered that the Plaintiffshould have instituted the claim in the Small Claims Tribunal and he therefore awarded costs to the Plaintiff in accordance withthe practice of the Tribunal.  The Plaintiff appealed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Woo VP said at paras. 26-28 and 32 of the Judgement:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â26.    It has to be noted, however, that the judge did not say that the costs were to be taxed on the Small Claims Tribunal scale. He merely used that scale as the basis for assessing the costs and awarded a gross sum as a result.  The judge has a wide discretionon costs.  Order 62 r 3(2) provides as follows:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(2)   If the Court in the exercise of its discretion sees fit to make any order as to costs of and incidental to any proceedings,the Court shall, subject to this Order, <i>order the costs to follow the event, except when it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the case some other order shouldbe made as to the whole or any part of the costs</i>.  (<i>Emphasis added</i>)</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">27.   Mr Tracy argues that this rule only allows the judge to order costs other than to follow the event, such as depriving the successfulparty of costs altogether, or to order part of the costs to follow the event and part not so.  We consider that is too restrictivea construction of the rule.  The wording of O 62 r 3(2) is wide enough to give the judge the discretion to make the costs order ashe did.  He is entitled to make any costs order, according to the circumstances of the case before him, which includes an order forcosts not following the event, and also in relation to the whole or any part of the costs.  So long as the circumstances of the casejustify, he can make no order as to costs (equivalent to ordering no costs), he can order a party to have a certain percentage ofthe costs (equivalent to part of the costs) and he can limit costs to be not more than a sum certain (which is within the ambit ofâsome other orderâ and may cover the whole or part of the costs), etc.  Thus, a judge may make an order for costs to be limitedto a certain sum.  In our judgment, O 62 r 3(2) gives the judge a wide discretion.  Insofar he exercises his discretion under thisrule, he is fully entitled to make a gross sum costs order under O 62 r 9(4)(b) in the exercise of his discretion to avoid delayor expense.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">28.

The last one was for $45,000 âall inclusiveâ, but it did not allude to disbursements or costs already incurred.  D madeuse of <i>Calderbank</i> letters, rather than a payment into court, as he contended the claim should have been brought in the Small Claims Tribunal; and ifhe made a payment in, under the Rules of the District Court (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336">Cap. 336</a>, Sub.Leg.), P was entitled to have his costs taxed upon acceptanceon the District Court scale, not the Small Claims Tribunal scale.  P rejected the <i>Calderbank</i> offer.  The Trial Judge gave judgment for P in the sum of $27,260.  D appealed against the awarding of costs to P with costs to theday up to and including the day prior to the trial on the District Court scale, to be taxed if not agreed, and there be no orderas to costs from the day of the trial.  D argued P should be entitled to costs up to the date of the first <i>Calderbank</i> offer on a scale similar to the Small Claims Tribunal scale, and costs thereafter be to D on the District Court scale.  P filed arespondentâs notice to seek an order that it have its cost of the action up to the judgment on the District Court scale; P furthercontended that D should have made a payment into court to obtain the benefit of O.62 r.5(b) of the Rules of the District Court whichD had failed to do.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The Defendants appeal was allowed to the extent that costs be awarded to the Plaintiff on a scale similar to that of the Small ClaimsTribunal.

As the claim is one for a sum of money, the usual and normal course is for the defendant to make a payment into court, althoughwith the consequence of his having to bear the costs up to the time of acceptance automatically on the District Court scale: see<i>Cho Ho Kuen v Yu Kwok Wah &amp; Others</i> (unrep., CACV No 480 of 2000, [2001] HKEC 633).  The only obstacle to a payment in was the defendantâs insistence that the actionshould have been brought in the Tribunal.  As I find that the plaintiff was acting reasonably to reject the <i>Calderbank</i> offer, this obstacle should not be considered as a reasonable excuse for the defendantâs not making a payment into court.  In thecircumstances, I consider that the obstacle to a payment into court was unreasonably self-created and that the defendant âcouldhave protected his position as to costs by means of a payment into court under O.22â which he failed to do.  In my judgment, therefore,in the exercise of his discretion on costs, the Judge was acting contrary to the decision of this Court in <i>The Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Hotels Ltd v Choi Bing Wing</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20HKLRD%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 HKLRD 472</a> and was wrong in taking into account the <i>Calderbank</i> letters, which he expressly stated in the first few sentences of para. 3 of his ruling to have done.

In my judgment, the proper scale of costs of the action including the hearing for assessing the quantum of damages should bethat similar to that of the Tribunal, which will fairly reflect the amount of damages awarded and have the desirable effect of discouraginglitigants from unreasonably selecting the District Court as the forum for a claim of damages that are well under the Tribunalâsjurisdictional limit.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Mr Justice Woo was thus of the opinion that the defendant could have protected his position by a payment into court under Order22.  He was however of the further view that the plaintiff was unreasonable in launching the claim in the District Court.

However, the second purpose of the offer could not be achieved by payment into court because under the RDC, if there waspayment in, the plaintiff was entitled to have his costs taxed upon acceptance and the defendant was not entitled to argue on thescale of costs because no judgment would be entered on acceptance of payment in. In such an event, in my view, the <i>Calderbank</i> offer was the only means the defendant might rely upon to protect his position.  On this basis the Court was entitled to considerthe <i>Calderbank</i> offer.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">38.    I do not need to address the question whether an âopen offerâ as distinct from a <i>Calderbank</i> offer ie an offer âwhich is without prejudice save as to costsâ may overcome the technical hurdle of O.62 r. 5(d).  I only needto say that ultimately one must look at the substance of the offer itself.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">The learned Judge took the view that the <i>Calderbank</i> letters were not drafted in reasonable terms and it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff to reject them.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The learned Judge continued to say in paras 44, 45 and 47:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â44.    However, even if the <i>Calderbank</i> offer was to be ignored, that was still not the end of the matter because the plaintiff eventually obtained a judgment the amountof which was within the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal.

Ultimately the question is whether it was reasonable to commence the action in the District Court.  I fully recognise the expertiseof District Court judges in dealing with personal injury cases but I do not agree that these claims should only be initiated in theDistrict Court on account of this expertise even if the monetary claim comes within the Small Claims Tribunal jurisdiction.  To doso will be contrary to the provision of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 5(1)</a> and the Schedule of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a> which expressly confer jurisdiction on the Small Claims Tribunal on claims in tort of not more than $50,000.

In the circumstances, it was unreasonable for the plaintiff to persist in pursuing the matter in the District Court, particularly,when the defendant had drawn his attention to the fact that the matter should be dealt with in the Small Claims Tribunal.  The onlyproper way of exercising the discretion was to award costs to be assessed in a manner similar to the costs allowed in the Small ClaimsTribunal.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Cheung JA did not suggest that the defendant could have protected his position by a payment into court under Order 22.  Nevertheless,the common theme of the judgments in this case is that if the defendant should have made a payment into court under Order 22 andthe plaintiff accepted the payment, the plaintiff would automatically be entitled to costs of the action taxed as per the DistrictCourt Scale.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  On this reasoning, if a plaintiff should launch an action in the High Court when the quantum would justify it to be in the DistrictCourt, the resolution of the action by acceptance of payment into court would automatically entitle the plaintiff to have costs ofthe action taxed as per the High Court Scale.  If the action should be resolved by adjudication or settlement, the plaintiff mayonly obtain costs taxed as per the District Court Scale.  Mr Yau for the Plaintiff admitted this to the case.  Mr Yan, SC said tothe contrary. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Mr Yan said that no matter whether the resolution is by acceptance of payment in or by adjudication or settlement, the costs consequenceshould be the same.  He submitted that <i>Cho Ho Kuen</i> was a decision on the costs of a claim brought in the District Court when it should have been brought in the Small Claims Tribunal. There was no taxation of costs in the Small Claims Tribunal and no Small Claims Scale of costs for taxation.  <i>Cho Ho Kuen</i> merely decided that the District Court can only âtaxâ the costs of an action and cannot âassessâ the costs as in the SmallClaims Tribunal.  He therefore submitted that the Court of Appeal in <i>Cheung Yu Tin</i> had misread <i>Cho Ho Kuen</i> when it said that the Plaintiff, after accepting a payment in, would have an automatic entitlement to costs taxed as per the scaleof costs of the court in which the action was brought.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Mr Yan further submitted that this case is not in a <i>Cho Ho Kuen</i> type of situation.  The parties agree that there should be taxed costs and not assessment of costs as per the Small Claims TribunalScale.  The only argument is whether this court can, in an acceptance of payment in situation, order the costs to be taxed as perthe District Court Scale.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  He referred to O.62 r.3(2) of the Rules of the High Court.  He said there are two parts in this rule which are important to thiscase.  I repeat this rule and highlight the two parts:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 3</a> (2)     <i>If the Court in the exercise of its discretion sees fit to make any order as to the costs of or incidental to any proceedings</i>, the Court shall, subject to this Order, order the costs to follow the event, <i>except when it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made as to the whole or any partof the costs</i>.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  He said the courtâs discretion in the first part could apply to an acceptance of payment in situation.  Furthermore, the acceptanceof payment in is a particular situation covered by the second part which would warrant the court ordering costs to be taxed as perthe District Court Scale.  If this argument should be correct, I would apply it in this case as it is obviously fair to do so.  However,I do think this argument is incorrect. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  If we should take a careful look at O.62 r. 10(2), r.9(1) and the definition of âtaxed costsâ in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 1</a>, the conclusion will be clear and inescapable.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 10(2)</a> provides that if a Plaintiff should accept money paid into court, he shall be entitled to his costs of the action up to the timeof giving notice of acceptance.  The entitlement to costs is thus conferred by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 10(2)</a> and not by any order of the Court. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 9(1)</a> says that, subject to Order 62, whereby or under the rules or any order or direction of the court costs are to be paid to any person,that person would be entitled to his taxed costs.  That means the Plaintiff who is entitled to costs under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 10(2)</a> would be entitled to taxed costs. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Finally, under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 1</a>, taxed costs mean costs taxed in accordance with Order 62 of the Rules of High Court and not any other order in these rules or inthe Rules of the District Court. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  If I should say that acceptance of payment in is a particular situation contemplated by Rule 3(2) and then proceed to order coststo be taxed in accordance with the District Court Scale, I would be infringing the statutory scheme outlined above by making an orderof costs when the entitlement to costs is automatically governed by Rule 10(2).  I would further infringe the scheme by requiringthe costs to be taxed not in accordance with Order 62 of the Rules of the High Court.  For these reasons, I cannot agree with MrYan.  I do not think the Court of Appeal in <i>Cheung Yu Tin</i> had misread <i>Cho Ho Kuen</i>.  I also do not think that the direction in para. 22(1) of <i>Lai Ki</i> is workable.  I have to allow the Plaintiffâs appeal though not without misgiving.  I do not think the end result produced by thestatutory scheme in this case is fair. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The Plaintiffâs second argument- High Court Scale costs should be allowed by discretion</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Though Mr Yau has succeeded on his first ground, I should also deal with his 2<sup>nd</sup> ground in case my conclusion on the 1<sup>st</sup> ground were wrong.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Mr Yau argued that there were other reasons that justified the action to be launched in the High Court despite its quantum.

Secondly, the Plaintiff had goodreasons not to be satisfied with the 1st Defendantâs disclosure of the sale of infringing toys (or toys bearing the infringingheader cards).  Thirdly, the Plaintiff had claimed and the Defendants had agreed to pay additional damages under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 108</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528" class="autolink_findacts">Copyright Ordinance</a>.  The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a> has no jurisdiction to award such damages.  It is therefore necessary to bring and continue the action in the High Court.  The 4<sup>th</sup> point was on the amount of interest.  Five years have elapsed since judgment on liability and the amount of interest accrued shouldbe about 50% of the principal sum of the award.  The 5<sup>th</sup> point was the complexity of the case.  Mr Yau submitted that assessment of damages in a copyright cum passing off action was notas straightforward as in personal injuries cases.  He referred to <i>Oriental Press Group Ltd v Apple Daily Ltd (No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%202%20HKC%20525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 2 HKC 525 (Rogers</a> J as he then was and the Court of Appeal) and  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%204%20HKC%20131" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 4 HKC 131 (CFA)</a> which was on the damages payable for the infringement of an exclusive photo of a pop singer in pregnancy.  He also referred to <i>One Price Trading Co. Ltd v Leung Chui Mui trading as Jade Fountain Trading Co.</i>, HCA 2327/1997 by Master B Kwan who referred to the paucity of cases for reference with regard to quantum on passing off cases.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Mr Chan Tak Shing of the Plaintiff has also said in his affirmation that up to the acceptance of payment in, the Plaintiff had incurredlegal costs of nearly $2.45 million and had to pay the Defendants $140,000 pursuant to Master Hoâs discovery order.  It was becauseof the uncertainty as to how much more costs had to be incurred for the enquiry of damages that the Plaintiff accepted the sum of$150,000 paid into court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  On the 1<sup>st</sup> point, I do not think the stakes were high.  It was about a paper header card used in the package of war some toys.  The price ofthe toys only ranged from $3.25 to $16.25 per pack.  The Plaintiff claimed that it had suffered loss of profit because of allegedloss of sales of the toys of more than 28 million, but the method of quantification of loss was dubious.  The sales by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant of toys with the same or similar header cards were only slightly over $300,000.  I have no reason to disbelieve the Defendantson this.  No matter how I look at this action, I cannot say that the stakes were high. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  On legal costs, Mr Yan asked me to bear in mind that when the action started no counsel was involved.  The Defendant did not evencontest liability.  The Defendants only brought in counsel when the Plaintiff sought damages for loss of sales of $28 million.  Alot of legal costs were incurred by the Plaintiffâs relentless but unreasonable pursuit of the Defendants.  The Plaintiff triedto make a mountain out of a molehill.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  I also do not think the 2<sup>nd</sup> point on discovery has any substance.  The Plaintiffâs attempt to have elaborate discovery was blocked by Master Hoâs order whichrequired the Plaintiff to pay the Defendants indemnity costs.  There was no appeal against this order.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  In order to understand the 3<sup>rd</sup> point and Mr Yanâs answer to it, it is useful to set out <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 31</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">32</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">107</a>(2) and (3), <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">108</a>(2), <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">109</a>(1), <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s111.html" class="autolink_findacts">111</a>(1) and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s134.html" class="autolink_findacts">134</a>(1) and (2) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528" class="autolink_findacts">Copyright Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528">Cap. 528</a>:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â31.

It is by section 134 that the District Court can also make orders under sections 109(1) and 111(1).  However, section 134 does notenable the District Court to order additional damages under section 108 and the District Court has no power to do so.  It was thereforenecessary to bring this action in the High Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Mr Yanâs approach starts with a careful comparison of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 31</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">32</a> with section 109.  Such comparison reveals that only the act of having in possession, custody or control of an article specificallydesigned or adapted for making copies of a particular copyright work, knowing or having reason to believe that it is to be used tomake infringing copies is an offence.  All other acts and conduct described in section 109 are not offences and the common law doesnot give the copyright owner any relief in respect of them.  Sections 109 and 111 filled in the gap and provided the copyright ownerwith relief for them.  However, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a> only provides the District Court with jurisdiction to hear and determine any action founded on contract, quasi-contract or tort wherethe amount of the Plaintiffâs claim does not exceed $1,000,000.  It has not conferred on the District Court jurisdiction to makeorders under sections 109 and 111.  The relief in these two sections is not to remedy any breach of contract or quasi-contract ortort.  It is therefore necessary to have <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s134.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 134</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528" class="autolink_findacts">Copyright Ordinance</a> so as to confer jurisdiction on the District Court to make orders under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 109</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s111.html" class="autolink_findacts">111</a>. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  However, the additional damages given under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 108</a> are also damages for tort.  The District Court can surely award such damages under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a>.  It is therefore unnecessary to bring this case to the High Court just for the sake of the additional damages in section 108.  Iagree with Mr Yan.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  I do not quite understand the 4<sup>th</sup> point.  When the action was commenced, I do not think either side had wanted to prolong it or to have it pending for five years. The Defendants in fact conceded on liability right from the start.  I cannot see any connection between the bringing of the actionin the High Court at the start and the interest accrued so far.  I also note that the $150,000 paid into court by the Defendantsincluded the interest accrued for the five years elapsed since commencement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  On the last point, I cannot see any complexity of this case.  It only involved a simple header card for some war toys.  I also notethat copyright and/or passing off cases are frequently brought in the District Court.  I do not think this case involved any degreeof complexity which would have required or justified it to be brought in the High Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Mr Yau further argued that if the Plaintiff should fail to convince me that the High Court Scale should apply throughout the conductof the action, then the Plaintiff should have two fall back positions which are dates up to which the Plaintiff should obtain costson the High Court Scale.  This submission is based on the alleged difficulty in assessing quantum of damages.  The 1<sup>st</sup> fallback position is the date of filing of the Points of Defence in the enquiry of damages on 18 July 2005.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> fallback position is sometime in November 2004 when discovery pursuant to Master Hoâs order was completed.  Again I cannot seeany significance of these two dates or the events which happened on or about these dates in so far as quantum of the claim is concerned.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Decision</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  In the light of the discussion above, but for the statutory scheme on costs upon acceptance of payment into court, I would havedismissed the appeal.  However because of the statutory scheme, I have no choice but to allow the appeal.  I also order the costsof the appeal be to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(L.
