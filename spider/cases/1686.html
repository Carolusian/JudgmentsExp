guilty to both charges and the trial took place before Mr W.C. Li in Eastern Magistracy. After trial, thelearned Magistrate found both offences proved and he sentenced the appellant to a total term of five months. The appellant now soughtto appeal against both the convictions and sentences.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The trial was originally conducted in Chinese, although counsel for the prosecution had made his final address in English. And onappeal, the appellant's solicitors applied to have the matter heard "bilingually" as counsel for the appellant would be submittingin English. The application was granted. The case had then been adjourned a number of times for different reasons and the appealwas finally heard in English in this court on 10 November 2003. As the written and oral submissions were done in English, I shallalso give my judgments in English. However, when I refer to the Statement of Findings, I would quote the original Chinese.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The appellant was represented by Mr Martin Lee, on a <em>pro bono</em> brief, leading Mr K.T. Kwok. They had prepared very thorough written submissions to assist the court. At the hearing, Mr Lee hadfurther explained his grounds. He had cited a number of authorities and he had covered all the relevant parts in the transcript.The crucial piece of evidence at the trial, i.e. the video tape, had been played for my benefit in open court</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Factually speaking, this is not a complicated case. It was about an incident which had taken place on 11 August 2001. The appellant,and a group of people, about 40, took part in a rally. They gathered first at Chartered Garden and then walked to the Police Headquarterat Arsenal Street. There they continued to shout slogans, stating that it was their rights to protest and conduct demonstrations.The purpose of the rally was not a relevant consideration and this was rightly emphasized by the Magistrate.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The number of participants in the group had exceeded 30, but it appeared that the organizer(s) had not issued a notice to the policecommissioner beforehand and that would, on the face of it, constitute a breach of section 13 of Public Orders Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/245">Cap. 245</a>.But that was not the main concern of the trial. The appellant had not been arrested or charged with any offences under the PublicOrders Ordinance. In fact, none of the participants was arrested except the appellant. It was the prosecution's contention that theappellant's specific conduct towards two police officers present at the scene had constituted the offences of wilful obstructionand assault while the officers were in due execution of their duty. These two officers had been called to testify and the appellanthimself had given evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">The Grounds of Appeal</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The appellant sought to rely on two main grounds of appeal. They were stated in the Amended Perfected Grounds of Appeal dated 22May 2002. Regarding the first charge of Wilful obstruction, the appellant argued that :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">"1.</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%" class="quote">The learned Magistrate erred in law when he applied <em>Rice v Connolly</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%202%20QB%20414" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 2 QB 414</a> and <em>Lewis v Cox</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20QB%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] QB 509</a> in that he failed to direct himself that 'lawful excuse' must be disproved by the Prosecution, once a prima facie case of lawfulexcuse was raised by the Defence."</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> In relation to the second charge of assaulting the police, the appellant argued that :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="2%">                    <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>                </td>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">6.</td>                <td valign="top" width="83%" class="quote">In the oral verdict, the learned Magistrate convicted the Defendant of battery on the basis that he had been deliberate in using theloudhailer as a medium against PW2, without, however, making any specific finding as to whether there was any 'bodily contact', 'unlawfulforce' or 'personal violence' on PW2.

It was said that there wasclear evidence before the court that the appellant believed that Inspector Au was not acting in due execution of duty at that moment,and the appellant honestly believed that he was trying to frame up Mr Lo, who was the person in purple-colour garment as shown inthe video, and framing up somebody, or to find a scapegoat was not part of an officer's proper duty.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The appellant argued that the law would and should recognize an honest mistake on the part of the citizen. Hence, if the Magistratehad accepted that the appellant had an honest belief that the Inspector was abusing his power and thus acting outside the scope ofhis duty, then there could not be any <em>mens rea</em> as there was no wilfulness. The appellant need not show, on balance, that there was such a belief, but the prosecution must disproveit. Base on the findings made, the Magistrate should have acquitted the appellant. In this regard, the appellant placed special relianceon the two paragraphs on pages 6 and 7 of the Statement of Findings to illustrate the point. It was contended that what was statedtherein indicated that the Magistrate had accepted the appellant's testimony of an honest mistake or at least he had not rejectedit. It was submitted that if the appellant was found to have the honest belief, albeit a mistaken one, and as long as it was nota mistake of law, then the defence of a lawful excuse should have been considered.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> In light of these submissions, it would be necessary to find out what the learned Magistrate had really said. In the paragraphs referredto by the appellant, the Magistrate stated (commencing on page 6 until the next paragraph on page 7) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" ä¸è¨´äººæ²æç¯ç½ªç´éãæ¬å¸­èæ®ä»çè­è©çå¯ä¿¡æ§(credibility)ï¼ä»¥ååä»éé¡æ²æç¯ç½ªç´éçäººå£«çç¯ç½ªå¾å(Propensity)æï¼åææéèªå·±æé'<em>Barrada</em>'ä¸æ¡çè­¦åãæ¬å¸­èªçºä¸è¨´äººä¸¦éä¸åèª å¯¦çè­äººãæ¬å¸­ä¸ç¸ä¿¡ä»ä¸ç¥éæ­ç£å¯åè¢«èªçºæ¯è©²éæççµç¹äººç§åçèª¿æ¥æ¯å¨å·è¡è·åï¼äº¦ä¸ç¸ä¿¡ä»æææè²å¨å¨è­¦å¡58819è³éå¤§åæçççä¸å°è©²åè­¦å¡ã</p>        <p class="quote">æ¬å¸­æ¯«ç¡åççé»å°ç¢ºä¿¡ä¸è¨´äººç¥éè­¦æ¹å¨èª¿æ¥éæ¬¡æªç¶è­¦æ¹æ¹åçéè¡ï¼èåèéè¡èå¯è¢«æª¢æ§ãæ¬å¸­æ¯«ä¸æ·çä¸è¨´äººç¥éæ­ç£å¯è¦æ±èç§åçè«è©±æ¯å¨å·è¡éæ¹é¢çè·åãåæ¨£ï¼æ¬å¸­ä¹æ¯«ä¸æ·çç¶æç¤ºå¨èåæ¬ä¸è¨´äººè©¦åæ©è­·ç§åçï¼ä½¿æ­ç£å¯ç¡æ³åç§åçé²è¡èª¿æ¥ãä¸è¨´äººå¨è­ä¾ä¸­ç¨±ï¼æ­¤èæ¯çºé¡¯ç¤ºä»å°äºä»¶ææçæåº¦åç«å ´ãä»èªçºä»åææ¬é²è¡ç¤ºå¨ï¼èéé æ¬å©æ¯ç¡éè­¦æ¹åè¨±çãèä¸ï¼ä»äº¦èªçºæ­ç£å¯çåæ³ä¸ç¶ï¼å çºä»èªçºæ­ç£å¯æèª£é·ç§åçï¼æ¾ä»ä½ä»£ç½ªç¾ç¾ãéæ¯ä¸è¨´äººçä¸»è§çæ³ãç¶èï¼ç±æ¼ä»éåçæ³ï¼æ¬å¸­ç¢ºä¿¡ä»ç¥éæ­ç£å¯ç¶ææ­£å·è¡è·åèª¿æ¥éæ¬¡æ¶å«éæ³çéæï¼åç®¡ä»ä¸èªåæ­ç£å¯çåæ³ï¼ä»äº¦æ¸æ¥ç¥éæ­ç£å¯å¨åçéº¼ã..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> I have read these paragraphs repeatedly. In the final analysis, I do not agree that the learned Magistrate had, as Mr Lee contended,accepted the appellant's evidence that he had made an honest mistake as to the Inspector's intention and conduct. These two paragraphsshould be understood in its proper context. It must not be forgotten that the Magistrate had made it quite clear, from the beginning,that he did not consider the appellant to be an honest witness. He did not believe that the appellant was not aware, <em>inter alia</em>, that Inspector Au's approach to Mr Lo, who was taken to be the organizer of the rally, was for investigation and therefore in dueexecution of his duty. These findings must necessarily mean that any suggestion by the appellant that he was harbouring an honestmistaken belief was not accepted. The Magistrate's further comments in the same paragraph on page 7 was also inconsistent with thepossible acceptance of the notion of an honest mistaken belief.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> It was true that the Magistrate had referred to the appellant's testimony about his belief of a possible frame up. The Magistratesaid dismissively that it was only the appellant's subjective view. The Magistrate further commented that such a view actually showedthat he knew that Inspector Au was indeed approaching in the capacity of a police officer. I could not accept that these observationscould be taken to mean that the Magistrate had not rejected the claim of honest mistaken belief. What the Magistrate was doing herewas simply evaluating the evidence of the appellant and tried to point out the inherent weakness of his statement.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> On the proper reading of the Statement of Findings as a whole, I found that the Magistrate had not accepted the appellant's evidencethat he had an honest belief. He must have rejected it. In fact, by stating directly that he did not find the appellant to be anhonest witness, it would be rather puzzling that he would on the other hand, accept that the appellant had an honest mistake.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> There remains the question as to whether the Magistrate had correctly applied the law. On the legal meaning of "wilful obstruction",the leading authority is no doubt <strong>Rice v. Connolly</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%202%20QB%20414" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 2 QB 414.</a> There the Court of Appeal was dealing with a similar provision in section 51(3) of the Police Act 1964. Lord Parker CJ held that"obstructs" ....., meant the doing of any act which made it more difficult for the police to carry out their duty, and "wilful" meantnot only "intentional", but without lawful excuse.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Another leading case on the subject is <strong>Lewis v. Cox</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%201%20QB%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 1 QB 509.</a> This is a case on the same point, i.e. section 51(3) of the Police Act 1964. It was held by the court that "a person wilfully obstructeda police constable in the execution of his duty within the meaning of (the section), if he deliberately did an act which, thoughnot necessarily 'aimed at' or 'hostile to' the police, in fact prevented a constable from carrying out his duty or made it more difficultfor him to do so, and if he knew and intended (whether or not that was his predominant intention) that his conduct would have thateffect; and that the motive with which the act was committed was irrelevant unless it constituted a lawful excuse for the obstruction.....;".</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> I do not think there can be any dispute about these basic principles and also that a mistaken belief could amount to a lawful excuse.In the case of <strong>Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely County Council v. Rust</strong>, Lord Widgery CJ, having analysed a number of authorities on the application of "lawful excuse", gave the following interpretationof the term in his judgment :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" I think that in order for the defendant to have lawful excuse for what he did, he must honestly believe <em>on reasonable grounds</em> that the facts are of a certain order when, if they were of that order, he would have an answer to the charge, and indeed his conductwould be lawful and not contrary to the law. I do not believe at any time one can have lawful excuse for conduct because one is mistakenas to the law; everyone is supposed to know the law, but a mistaken of fact of the kind which I have described seems to me to amountto lawful excuse."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This formulation of the principle was expressly approved by Yang CJ (as he then was) in the case of <strong>The Queen v. Li Wing Tat and Others</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20HKLR%20731" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 HKLR 731.</a> This was also a magistracy appeal case involving the use of a loudhailer, but the focus was different. On the meaning of "lawfulexcuse", the Chief Justice stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The contention here is that because the police over a long period of time, some 18 years or more, have not prosecuted any personunder either of the two sub-sections, save for one single occasion when a boutique was summonsed for using a loudspeaker withoutpermit to attract passers-by, the defendants had an excuse in using loudhailers, honestly and reasonably believing that it was permissibleso to do. Similar arguments were advanced in respect of the sub-s. (17) offences.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In this connection I need only refer to <em>Cambridgeshire v. Rust</em> [1972]2 QB 426. There Lord Widgery, C.J. sitting with Saw and Wien, JJ, described the word 'excuse' as a reasonable belief that youhave the right to do what you seek to do. A defendant therefore has a lawful excuse if, <em>on reasonable grounds</em>, he is honestly mistaken as to a fact (at p. 433 E, p. 434B). He went on to say, 'I do not believe at any time one can have lawfulexcuse for conduct because one is mistaken as to the law; everyone is supposed to know the law, but a mistake of fact of the kindwhich I have described seems to me to amount to lawful excuse.'"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> However, recent judicial views appear to be that the defence need not show reasonable grounds for the mistaken belief but that wouldbe a relevant factor for the trial judge to take into account, when such defence was raised, as to whether there was such a beliefon the part of the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In the noted case of <strong>R. v. Thomas</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%203%20NZLR%20141" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 3 NZLR 141</a>, the appeal court in New Zealand had to deal with a similar issue. The facts are useful for our purpose and what happened was this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"At 4 am on a Sunday morning police cars, chasing a stolen vehicle, forced it to stop in Porirua. The accused and a number of otherswere drinking at a nearby house and were attracted to the scene by the noise coming from there. Several policemen were strugglingwith a 'fit young man' who 'took some handling'. The accused thought that the police were using undue force and beating up the manand so she intervened, along with a male associate. The District Court Judge found that she tried to pull one of the policemen awayand was restrained and told to go but that she persevered and intentionally tried to interfere with the arrest. He found that heractions amounted to obstruction and that the police were acting in the execution of their duty. The accused appealed to the HighCourt where it was held that the justification of honest mistake (as to whether the police were using excessive force) was not opento the accused and it was further held that she could not rely on the defence of 'self-defence' provided by s 48 of the Crimes Act1961. The accused appealed to the Court of Appeal."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In his judgment, Casey J stated the following :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In the present case the apparent finding of the Judge that these people believed the driver was being beaten up disposes of any suggestionof a wilful shutting of the eyes or indifference. The accused's evidence obviously provided a sufficient foundation to rebut anyassumption that she knew the police were acting in the execution of their duties. She knew they were policemen and that they werelegally entitled to use necessary force in making an arrest, so that there could be no suggestion she was under a mistake of law.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It is now settled law in New Zealand that in the ordinary class of case where the prosecution must prove <em>mens rea</em> 'an honest belief in a state of affairs or as to the existence of a fact, which if true would make the act innocent, will providea defence itself. <em>It is not then incumbent on an accused to establish reasonable grounds for such belief although such may be relevant in testing thehonesty of the belief in the first place'</em> - per McMullin J in <em>Millar v Ministry of Transport</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%201%20NZLR%20660" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 1 NZLR 660</a>, 673. It is for the prosecution to prove that the accused had no such belief once an evidentiary basis for it had been established,and the finding of the District Court Judge to which we have adverted - that in the eyes of the accused's party what was happeningseemed to amount to a police beating up - clearly left the case in a state of reasonable doubt, if it did not entirely exonerateher. <em>She may have been lucky to get such a finding in her favour, having regard to the way she and her associates jumped so quickly totheir conclusion about a police beating up</em>. But on an appeal confined to questions of law this Court must accept the finding on which the judgments in the two Courts belowproceeded."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The present case was entirely different from a situation where a citizen actually saw some officers using violence on another citizenand he then had an honest belief that the police officers involved were using excessive force. If the appellant had not even allowedthe Inspector to complete what he wanted to say or do, in circumstances which none of the officers present were showing the slightestsign of aggression, it would be difficult to see how the appellant could justifiably form an honest mistake. It was therefore notsurprising that the learned Magistrate had disbelieved him. Although the Magistrate did not say so specifically, but as I said earlier,having rejected the appellant as an honest witness, honest mistake and therefore the defence of lawful excuse would not be an issue.In my view, the Magistrate's failure to mention the defence of lawful excuse is neither here nor there. He did not fail to considerthe defence but the matter simply did not arise due to his rejection of the appellant's evidence. There is nothing unsafe about thisconviction.</p>    <p class="heading">The Second Charge</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> As to the second charge, the appellant had really raised two points. The more interesting one involved the definition of battery.The core question I had to decide is whether it is a battery if a defendant shouts through a loudhailer which is placed very closeto someone's ear and thereby causing the "victim" discomfort but not bodily injury. The prosecution argued that it is a kind of batteryand the learned Magistrate agreed. And upon the further finding that the victim was a police officer in due execution of his duty,the offence of the second charge was therefore said to have been made out.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> It has been stated that whereas the essence of assault is the creation of fear or apprehension in the mind of the victim, the essenceof battery is physical contact, direct or indirect, between the defendant and the victim (<em>Offences Against The Person</em>, Stone, at page 110). The case of <strong>DPP v. K</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20All%20ER%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 All ER 331</a> has decided that a battery can be committed through an indirect contact between the victim and the defendant, but physical contactremains to be an essential element for the offence of battery. The appellant had argued forcefully that there was no battery committedhere because there was no contact.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> In this area of the law, there is the interesting recent authority of <strong>R. v. Ireland and Burstow</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20AC%20147" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] AC 147.</a> The question raised was whether a person who made silent phone calls which caused the receiver to have a condition of psychiatricillness could be guilty of the offence of assault. The House of Lords said yes and it was in the apprehension sense of assault, notbattery.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> In his judgment, Lord Slynn of Hadley made the observation that it was not feasible to enlarge the generally accepted legal meaningof what is a battery to include the circumstances of a silent caller who causes psychiatric injury (at page 161). Lord Hope of Craigheadstated firmly that there was plainly no element of battery in the circumstances, as at no time was there any kind of physical contactbetween the appellant and his victims (at page 165). These comments do seem to support the appellant's argument that "no physicalcontact, no battery".</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The logic of the decision in the case of <strong>Ireland</strong> has been questioned. A commentator has argued that the description of the situation in that case really shows a situation of battery,not the assault which the court professed to be discussing, as it referred to an injury actually inflicted, not one apprehended,and that "assault" and "battery" are two distinct crimes, with a different <em>actus reus</em> and a different <em>mens rea</em> (Article entitled "Assault" in <em>Criminal Law Review 1997</em> at page 435). If the commentator's view was to be preferred, then even silent calls, with no contact between the victim and the defendant,could constitute a battery especially when there was actual injury. In the present case, we are not really dealing with such an abstractsituation. We are simply concerned with the effect of unnatural, amplified sound. Can it be said that there was no physical contactbetween the defendant and the victim and therefore the essential element of the offence was missing?</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> In the case of <strong>Kaye v. Robertson</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20FSR%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) FSR 62</a>, Glidewell LJ made the obiter comment that he thought setting off a camera flash-bulb may be a battery where a bright light is deliberatelyshone into another's eyes and injures his sight. But the learned editor of <em>Winfield and Jolowicz on Tort</em> said that this might be a practical approach, but it is difficult to reconcile with the fact that trespass is actionable <em>per se</em> (15th edn 1998, page 64, Note 40). The editor further stated that whether the infliction of such things as heat or light or blowingsmoke upon a person would be held to be battery is uncertain (Page 64).</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> I agree we are moving into an uncertain area here and there are no decided cases to assist on this issue. But surely, as a matterof common sense, we do feel heat, see light and hear sound. These forms of energy must be constantly touching us, through our differentorgans. Of course, I agree with Mr Lee that if we take this to the extreme, then a person can commit battery by talking to another,and a lawyer might commit the offence of battery when addressing the court. But we are not talking about normal impact of sound.There must be an implied consent in the ordinary normal situation for us to be "touched" by the sound from people talking to us.We have to accept that as a part of our everyday living. However, would we consent to be "touched" by amplified sound when the loudhaileris being placed next to our ear? The answer must be no, unless in some idiosyncratic situations. I would conclude that when a loudhaileris used as an implement to send out amplified sound at close range of someone's ear without the consent of that person, it must bebattery. And it would be wounding if actual bodily injury had occurred as a result. I do not agree that his conclusion would meanan extension of the principle, it is only an application of the basic elements of the offence.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Unfortunately, the matter does not end here.

I have read the relevant partsof the oral judgment and the Statement of Findings several time, and I come to the view that there was a shift of the basis of theconviction, at least it appears to be so on the face of the record. Assault and battery are distinct offences, and for that reasona conviction of 'assault and battery' or of 'assault or battery' will be quashed because a person cannot be convicted of more thanone offence or of alternative offences in one information. I note that the respondent have conceded on this point. (<em>Criminal Law, Card, Cross, and Jones</em>, 15th edn, page 163).</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> The further complication in this case was that the officer said quite clearly in his evidence that he was not apprehensive of anybodily injury or harm being done to him by the appellant. He said that he did not expect the appellant to hit him with the loudhaileror use his body to bump against him (page 130 of Bundle). In light of such evidence, it would appear that a conviction of assaultbased on apprehension is not really appropriate in any case. I fear that the failure to clarify the basis of conviction and the apparentdifferences in the oral judgment and the Statement of Findings had rendered the conviction of the second charge unsafe and unsatisfactory.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusions</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> In the circumstances, although I totally agree with the learned Magistrate's observation that the use of a loudhailer by the appellantin such a way, i.e. placing it so close to the officer's ear and deliberately shouted loudly, causing the officer to experience temporaryear pain, was a case of battery, I have to allow the appeal on this second charge in view of what I have said about the basis ofthe conviction. Consequently the sentence of the second charge has to be set aside.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Coming back to the first charge, I would dismiss the appeal as the Magistrate was right in convicting the appellant. I have furtherconsidered the submissions on sentence, and I would agree with the respondent that this is a case of deliberate and hostile obstructionagainst the Inspector which was totally uncalled for. It is a bad case of its kind. I found no merit in the appeal against sentenceand I consider that the sentence of two months is entirely appropriate. The appeal on both the conviction and sentence regardingthe first charge is therefore dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> There is an outstanding matter. When the appeal came before Nguyen J on 7 February 2002, he allowed the application for adjournmentso that the respondent could translate their reply into English. Mr Lee for the appellant had opposed the application but he declinedto accept an arrangement of having the case go part-heard. Nguyen J also made an order that the costs thrown away could be dealtwith by himself or by this court. On my part, I would be most reluctant to remit the case back to Nguyen J just to deal with thismatter. But the difficulties I have is that as I happen to be able to read Chinese as well, the adjournment on that occasion mightnot be necessary, but I hasten to add that it does not mean that the adjournment should not have been granted. On reflection, asthere was the offer to have the case go part-heard and it was not acceptable by the appellant, I tend to think that in the circumstancesthere should perhaps be no order as to costs. But I have not heard counsel on this.
