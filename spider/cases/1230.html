In July 2007, <b>Hui</b>, the Applicant, started to drive container tractor for Pine Logistics.  On 7 September 2007 while he was in the course of work, atraffic accident happened and he was injured.  He now claims compensation pursuant to the Employeesâ Compensation Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  There is no real dispute that Hui was injured in the course of his work for Pine Logistics.  The dispute lies in whether the companywas at the time Huiâs employer and, if yes, the quantum of compensation.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Huiâs case</b></p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Hui was educated in the Mainland up to Secondary Two.  In Hong Kong, he had worked as a driver of goods vehicles for over 10 yearsby the time of accident.  In late July 2007, his friend introduced him to work as a container tractor driver for Pine Logistics. Pine Logistics was a subcontractor of container hauling services at the Container Terminal No.9.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  On 24 July 2007, the captain (è»é·) of Pine Logistics informed Hui that he would be contacted for an interview.  A staff of PineLogistics later contacted and met with Hui.  Hui was provided some safety training records of the container terminal to sign.  Hewas informed of the terms of his work and pay.  He was asked to sign a written service agreement.  He signed the agreement but, accordingto him, without paying attention to its terms.  He believed he was employed by Pine Logistics.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Hui was also asked whether he had a mandatory provident fund account.  As requested, Hui also gave HK$840, as Hui understood, forthe purpose of the company arranging insurance for him.  The captain called Hui the following day, instructing him to start workingon 28 July 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  As a night shift driver, Hui had to work for 12 hours from 7 pm to 7 am the following day per shift.  Normally, at about 3:45 pmto 4:45 pm, the captain would call to ask Hui to work that evening.  Hui would join the other drivers who assembled at the publiclight bus stop at Mei Foo.  The company coach would take them to the container terminal for work.  If Hui received no call, thismeant there would be no work for him for the night.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On board the company coach, the captain would assign the drivers to drive the various tractors of the company and distribute workschedules to the drivers.  Each driver would also be distributed a pager for receiving communication of instruction from the controlroom of the company during work.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Pine Logistics had a fleet of not less than 40 container tractors.  The company was also responsible for all the operating costof the tractors such as fuel, licence, insurance, maintenance and repair.  Hui was only responsible for driving the tractor to transportcontainers between the pier and other spots within the terminal area (known asç¢¼é ­åé).</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Hui got paid twice monthly.  The remuneration was calculated according to an index, namely, number of containers / number of workinghours.  This was his only remuneration for his work.  He was required to sign an âinvoiceâ prepared by the company for the paymentof his remuneration.  Taking leave required approval of the company.  But it was not up to him to find substitute driver to takehis place.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Hui called <b>Lee</b> as a witness.  Lee was also a container tractor driver of Pine Logistics.  Lee gave evidence similar to that of Hui.  Their differencewas that Lee started working for Pine Logistics a year earlier (in July 2006) and was then on a daily wage basis.  In February 2007,Lee was asked too by the company to sign a written service agreement similar to the one that Hui has signed.  He was then given tounderstand that this was brought about by the change in the remuneration structure.  He also started to receive the âinvoiceâfrom the company that he was required to sign for the payment of his remuneration.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Pine Logisticsâ case</b></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  <b>Lau</b> is the manager of Pine Logistics.  He recalled that Hui was introduced in July 2007 to one of the captains employed by the company. Hui was said to be have worked as a contract driver for another company operating at the container terminal.  Hui had a mandatoryprovident fund account as a self-employed driver.  Hui was asked to approach the insurance company that Pine Logistics was familiarwith in order to take out personal accident insurance coverage.  On 24 July 2007, Pine Logistics and Hui entered into the writtenservice agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Lau admitted that his company provided all the container tractors that the drivers drove.  The fuel came from a supplier nominatedby its main contractor.  Pine Logistics employed the captains mentioned above to liaise with the drivers needed.  The captains wouldcontact the drivers to come to work and it would be up to the drivers to decide whether to take the job.  Lau confirmed that thedrivers had to follow the instructions sent to them via their pagers during work.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Lau explained that the demand for container hauling service by its main contractor varied substantially daily.  It was thereforeflexible and cost-effective to engage the drivers as self-employed.  Meanwhile, the drivers retained the freedom to work for othercompanies.  He suggested that the drivers might even gain a profit out of hiring other drivers to carry out the work.  Thereforehe reckoned that the arrangement should be beneficial to both Pine Logistics and the drivers.  He reiterated in court that therewas no element of exploitation of the drivers in the arrangement.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Nevertheless, Lau admitted in court that since June 2008, all the drivers of Pine Logistics have ceased to work as self-employedbut are now contracted as employees.  But there is no suggestion that the drivers are working in any manner different from before. Lau explained that the change was brought about by the improvement of the business environment and the more steady demand for containerhauling services and thus container tractors and drivers.  He believed that the change also helped to avoid further dispute betweenhis company and the drivers.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Discussion</b></p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  <i>Poon Chau Nam v Yim Siu Cheung</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%201%20HKLRD%20951" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 1 HKLRD 951</a> is the often cited authority in this context.  The final court (at 961B-F) set out the guidelines for determining whether a contractis one of service or for service.  The modern approach is to examine all the features of the relationship between the parties concernedagainst the background of the indicia developed in the case law with a view to deciding whether, as a matter of overall impression,the relationship is one of employment <i>for the purpose under consideration</i>.  It involves a nuanced and not a mechanical approach.  Not all details are of equal weight or importance in any given situation. They may also vary in importance from one situation to another.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The written service agreement between Pine Logistics and Hui dated 24 July 2007 provided that the driver was an independent contractorof Pine Logistics and there was no employment or agency relationship between them (clause 7.1).  The allegation of Hui that he hadpaid no attention to such terms of the service agreement before signing, even if true, does not suffice to vitiate the agreement. However, I accept his evidence that he signed the agreement with the simple view to getting the job.  Practically, he could onlychoose to take it or to leave it.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  How the parties chose to label their relationship is but one factor to be taken into account.  Experience tells that such labelis not conclusive and could sometimes be deceiving.  The final court also made clear (at 973E-974G) that if on the facts of the case,viewed objectively and the indicia of employment applied, the person injured at work is properly to be regarded as an employee, anyexpress agreement seeking to effectively contract out of the employerâs statutory obligations and removing such person from theprotection as an employee is void.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The indicia of employment includes: the degree of control exercised by the alleged employer; whether the person performing the servicesprovided his own equipment; whether he hired his own helpers; whether he had to take any financial risk and to what degree; whetherhe was responsible for investment or management and to what degree; and whether and how far he had an opportunity of profiting fromsound management in the performance of his task.  What were the features of the relationship between Pine Logistics and Hui <i>as a matter of fact</i>?</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  It was said that the drivers had the liberty to work for other companies. In my view, whether this was true is neither here northere.  Notwithstanding the formality of a service agreement, the nature of the working relationship between Pine Logistics and thedriver did not differ much from a casual one.  The driver would be called only if and when they were needed.  But the driver couldbe an employee of more than one employer on this basis.  The reality was that when Hui and Lee were driving for Pine Logistics, therewas no likelihood of their providing service to any other companies because a night shift lasted for 12 hours from 7 pm to 7 am thefollowing day.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  It was said that it was always up to the drivers to decide for themselves whether to take the job from Pine Logistics when asked. Reference was made to the express provision of such discretion of the drivers in the service agreement (clause 3.1).  Lau explainedthat the captains employed by the company had a list of the drivers that they might contact.  If a driver refused to take the job,the captains simply moved along the list and contacted other drivers until the necessary number of drivers was secured.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  I doubt whether what Lau said was the reality.  Whilst this sounds like a flexible arrangement; this was at the same time double-edged. There is no dispute that Pine Logistics often needed to meet the demand of its main contractor in short notice.  This also explainswhy for night shift drivers like Hui and Lee, the captains normally called them only in the afternoon when they were needed in thesame evening.  Pine Logistics must have some expectation, if not control, over whether the needed number of drivers could be assembledin short notice as and when required.  Lau said in court that there were about 100 drivers on the lists of the captains to choosefrom.  But this, in my view, does not matter.  What matters is how the captains in fact dealt with the drivers.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  According to Hui and Lee, they were expected to come to work when asked by the captains unless they have obtained approval for leave. In the case of Lee, he had the experience of refraining from seeking sick leave upon the indication of the captain that he had tocome to work.  Hui also expressed his understanding from other drivers that taking leave without approval of the captain could haveconsequences.  The concern was that the captain might choose not to ask him to work anymore.  In this regard, Lau had no personalknowledge as to how the captain instructed the drivers in reality.  I accept the evidence of Hui and Lee in this respect.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  If Hui and Lee were running their own business by providing driving service, one would have expected that they might hire and provideother drivers than themselves to drive for Pine Logistics.  Under the service agreement, this seemed to be possible (clause 2). In his statement, Lau even suggested that the drivers might gain profit out of this.  However, according to Hui and Lee, they neverdid so.  The fact was that it was not up to them to do so.  The drivers empanelled by Pine Logistics had to possess the relevantpermits to work in the terminal area.  Only Pine Logistics could obtain such permits for them.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  It is clear from the evidence that apart from driving, the drivers had no control over the work arrangement at all.  In court, Huiadded that even taking breaks during work needed the consent of the captain because the drivers could not leave the tractors unattendedas they wished.  The drivers did not provide any equipment or incur any expenses in connection with work.  According to the serviceagreement, Pine Logistics was also responsible for meeting any liability to third parties that arose in and out of the driversâwork (clause 5).</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Pine Logistics as the owner of the container tractors was probably expected to take out third party risk insurance in any event. However, it cannot be denied that Pine Logistics did assume the kind of risk that one would have expected a professional driverto take if he were running his own business.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The risk associated with the driverâs work that Pine Logistics assumed was more extensive than this.  Even in case of damage tothe container tractor due to the negligence of the driver, the service agreement limited the driverâs liability to compensate PineLogistics to a maximum of HK$1,000 (clause 5).</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Pine Logistics also tried to ensure that various arrangements that ought to have been the concern of Hui and Lee, if they were self-employed,were or would be made.  First, Pine Logistics ensured that Hui had a mandatory provident fund account as a self-employed.  Accordingto Hui, he did have such an account that was opened at the request of another operator of the container terminal for which he usedto drive container tractor.  Except for 2 to 3 instalments, Hui has not made any contribution to the account.  Pine Logistics hasnot asked for any further details either.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Second, the service agreement provided that Hui should take out insurance covering the drivers and staff that he would provide (clause3.3).  Apparently Pine Logistics did not consider such definition of the responsibility for taking out insurance sufficient for itspurpose.  Pine Logistics asked Hui to pay and arranged the personal accident insurance for Hui.  Both Hui and Lee said that theyhad never received a copy of the insurance policy thereafter.  In Huiâs case, he received a copy of the policy by post from PineLogistics upon his discharge from the hospital after the accident.  In the notice of accident under the motor policy insuring PineLogistics, Hui was stated to be a self-employed driver.  But Hui and Lau confirmed in court that it was Lau who filled in the formand had him sign it.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Third, Pine Logistics prepared invoices (ç¼ç¥¨) for the Hui and Lee that contained the breakdown of the amounts that they werereceiving.  They were required to sign the documents.  The impression created by the documents is that the drivers issued them tobill Pine Logistics for their service.  In court, Lau had to accept that as the documents were prepared and presented by his companyto the drivers to sign; and they were more like receipt to the drivers.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  All of these arrangements should have been the concern of Hui and Lee, if they were self-employed and running their own businessesof providing the driving service.    In court, Lau did not deny that his company would not have engaged Hui, if he did not have amandatory provident account as a self-employed.  When asked why this was his companyâs concern that the drivers took out personalaccident insurance, Lau explained that this was to ensure that they knew that they were contractors, not employees.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  I cannot help suspecting that by taking upon itself the making of these arrangements for Hui and Lee, Pine Logistics was servingits own purpose of ensuring that evidence of all the features indicative of the self-employed status of the drivers were there.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  I accept the evidence of Hui and Lee in respect of their engagement by Pine Logistics and the work arrangement.  I prefer theirevidence in case of conflict with that of Lau.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Indeed Pine Logistics made no secret of its intention that the person being engaged was not wanted as an employee.  It took thestance that person was entirely free to choose whether to accept such terms of engagement; but once that person has accepted theterms, he would be bound by them.  I do not accept that <i>in the circumstances of this case</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  There is no question of Hui or Lee ever investing in a business of their own in providing their service to Pine Logistics.  Thereis no question of their taking any business risk or making any profit or loss out of a business of providing service to Pine Logistics. There was no real bargaining between Pine Logistics and the drivers.  The drivers were given the service agreements already preparedand in terms dictated by Pine Logistics.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  From the point of view of the drivers, the so-called freedom of contract practically meant that they either took it or leave it. They took it but expected nothing more than having to drive and to get paid for that.  This was an employment relationship.  Allthe circumstances objectively viewed, this is in fact the overall impression of the true relationship between the drivers and PineLogistics.  Pine Logisticsâ resort to the notion of freedom of contract to regulate the true relationship between the parties wasin my view self-serving.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Double compensation</b></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  As a result of the accident, Hui has filed claim with the insurance company with which a personal accident insurance in his namewas taken out as mentioned above.  It was argued on behalf of Pine Logistics that the claim for employeesâ compensation, if awarded,would amount to double compensation to Hui.  This was also argued in terms of Huiâs duty to mitigate his loss so that any compensationawarded in these proceedings ought to give credit to the amount that he has received under his insurance policy.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  There is no merit in the argument on behalf of Pine Logistics in this respect.  The fact that Pine Logistics has to pay compensationto Hui is a matter of statutory liability as an employer.  This is not liability in tort, as Mr Wong suggested in his submission. The fact that the insurance company has to pay the insured amount to Hui is a matter of contract between them which was maintainedin Huiâs name for his own benefit.  The insured amount so received is the fruit of the present payment of insurance premium withforesight for the protection.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The amount of insurance payout ought not to be taken into account in assessing the statutory compensation payable by Pine Logistics:see <i>Parry v Cleaver</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] AC 1</a> at 14E; <i>McGregor on Damages</i> (18<sup>th</sup> ed) at 35-151 and <i>Tang Kwong Chiu v Lee Fuk Yue</i>, CACV 22/1980 (23 July 1980) at pp.4-5.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In his submission, Mr Wong added that taking out personal accident insurance was a condition precedent to the conclusion of theservice agreement between Pine Logistics and Hui.  <i>Therefore</i>, it was an implied term of the service agreement that in case of accident at work, Hui had to claim against his insurance companyfirst.  As Hui has received the insurance moneys under his personal accident insurance policy, he could no longer claim to have anyloss.  Without loss, there should be no compensation under the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The answer to this argument is actually contained in the discussion of the principles in <i>Poon Chau Nam</i>.  If Pine Logisticsâ argument is accepted, this would mean an employer may contract out of its obligation to pay compensation byproviding that the employee has to take out his own personal accident insurance.  This cannot be right.  The situation might havebeen different, if it was the employer who paid for the employeeâs personal accident insurance coverage: see <i>Hussain v New Taplow Paper Mills</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20AC%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] AC 514</a>; <i>McGregor on Damages</i> (above) at 35-152.  In such a scenario, the employer obviously did not seek to contract out of its statutory obligation.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Of course, Hui may be liable to account the compensation awarded, or any part of it, to his insurance company which has paid theinsured amount on account of this accident.  Whether there is basis for such liability of Hui to account is still a matter of contractbetween them; and certainly nothing to do with Pine Logisticsâ liability under the Ordinance.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>DCEC 555/2008</b></p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  On 26 April 2010, i.e., 3 days before this trial, the court handed down the judgment in another employeesâ compensation case DCEC555/2008.  In that case, Pine Logistics was the Respondent while the applicant was in fact Lee.  Pine Logistics also disputed thatLee was its employee when Lee was injured at work in August 2007.  Hui was called as a witness for Lee.  Lau was the witness forPine Logistics.  Even the partiesâ respective legal representatives are identical in both cases.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  In the judgment, the evidence adduced on behalf of the parties were recited and discussed in detail.  According to the record inthe judgment, the evidence was not materially different from what was heard in the present case.  The learned Judge accepted theevidence of both Lee and Hui.  She applied the same legal principles discussed above found that Lee, and effectively Hui, were theemployees of Pine Logistics.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In view of the above, I raised the question of issue estoppels in its broad sense, though the applicants in these two cases aredifferent.  At the end of the day, and quite irrespective of whether Pine Logistics is estopped from re-litigating similar factualdispute, I did consider the evidence in the present case and came to my own conclusion adverse to Pine Logistics.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  By pressing ahead with its defence and insisting on a full trial notwithstanding the factual findings and conclusion in DCEC 555/2008,Pine Logistics utilised this trial as a second chance of testing potentially similar evidence and basically similar contentions witha view to obtaining a different result from that in DCEC 555/2008.  The attempt fails.  Such conduct of proceedings was unreasonable,if not an abuse of process, in the circumstances.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Quantum</b></p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  As a result of the accident, Hui was sent to the hospital.  He complained of transient amnesia.  He suffered from a fractured rightpatella but no distal neurovascular deficit.  His right forearm also had multiple abrasions.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Hui received debridement with open reduction and fixation with circulage wiring to the right patella.  2 weeks later, partial patellectomywas performed and fragments were removed.  The implants were removed at the end of May 2008.  This was followed by a course of physiotherapyand occupational therapy.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In June 2009, Hui was examined by the Employeesâ Compensation (Ordinary Assessment) Board (â<b>MAB</b>â).  Due to the fracture of right patella resulting in residual right knee pain, Hui was assessed to have suffered 1% permanentloss of earning capacity.  The assessment was reviewed and confirmed in September 2009.  Hui appeals against such assessment pursuantto section 18 of the Ordinance.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Medical expert opinion</i></p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  On 6 November 2009, Hui was examined by Dr Tony Hung Siu Lun and Dr Lam Kwong Chin, the orthopaedic experts engaged on behalf ofthe Hui and Pine Logistics respectively.  The experts produced their joint report dated 16 November 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The experts agreed that Hui had open comminuted fracture of the right patella, probably with mild head contusion and right forearmmultiple abrasions during the accident.  The treatment received was appropriate.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  At the time of the examination, Hui still complained about on and off right knee pain as well as upper back pain and numbness. Dr Lam opined that the muscle-wasting and instability upon weight bearing on his right side single-legged or tiptoes could be partlydue to his right foot injury in 2003 when he had his big and second toe amputated.  Dr Hung disagreed.  He relied on Huiâs confirmationthat he has recovered well from the right big toe injury and that there was no functional deficit.  He opined that it was the traumaof the patella that has caused the quadriceps muscle-wasting.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The experts noted that the complaint about upper back pain by Hui was neither revealed in the initial visits to the hospital norverified by subsequent X-ray and MRI of the spine.  The complaint was mainly about mild tenderness at the upper neck.  Yet movementwas good and evidence of neurological deficit was lacking.  If this was related to the accident, this could only be a minor backcontusion involving soft tissue only.  As to the complaint about upper limb numbness, both experts believed that this was unrelatedto the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The experts agreed that Hui has reached maximal medical improvement and no further treatment would be required.  Sick leave givenuntil 29 October 2008 was acceptable.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Dr Lam considered that Hui should be able to return to his pre-accident work as a container tractor driver.  He recommended intermittentrest during prolonged driving; but the overall adverse effect should be mild.  Adverse effect on activities of daily life would beminimal.  Dr Lam assessed Huiâs impairment of the whole person to be 4% and loss of earning capacity to be 4% as well.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Dr Hung expressed his concern that due to pain and weakness in squatting and stair climbing, Hui could have problem getting intothe driverâs seat of the container truck as that would involve bending and weight bearing of the knee.  Hui might also have problemin object lifting and getting up from a squatting position.  His condition would deteriorate with time probably in terms of yearsor decade; and that would badly affect his right knee function.  Dr Hung assessed Huiâs permanent impairment and loss of earningcapacity to be both 6%.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Mr Wong for Pine Logistics submitted that this court could not be bound by the expertsâ expression of opinion on the percentageloss of earning capacity.  He cited <i>Tang Shau Tsan v Wealthy Construction Co Ltd</i>, CACV 58/2000 (5 April 2000) in support.  He further submitted that this court should not depart from the assessment by the MAB.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  However, both expertsâ opinion tends to suggest that the permanent loss of earning capacity suffered by Hui, even not in termsof percentage, should exceed the degree assessed by the MAB.  Mr Wong asked me to disregard the opinion of not only the expert engagedon behalf of Hui but also that engaged on his clientâs behalf.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  5 months after the sick leave expired, Hui managed to find a driving job in a construction site.  But he was sacked after workingfor 9 days.  He attributed that to his inability to handle the physical demand of the job.  Another 5 months later, Hui was employedas day-shift container tractor driver at the container terminal.  The job nature was similar to his pre-accident job.  He earneda bit less than before.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  During the trial, Ms Tjia for Hui confirmed that she no longer pursued the argument that there are special circumstances in thepresent case that warrants the application of the formula in <i>Hong Kong Paper Mills Ltd v Chan Hin Wu</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20HKLR%20556" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] HKLR 556</a> in assessing the permanent loss of earning capacity.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Considering all the evidence, I am satisfied that the section 18 appeal should be allowed; but I am not convinced that Huiâs allegedphysical inability to work to his full pre-accident capacity and his permanent loss of earning capacity would exceed that as Dr Lamassessed.  I find that Hui suffers 4% loss of earning capacity for the purpose of assessment of his compensation.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Section 9 compensation</i></p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  There is no dispute that Huiâs pre-accident monthly income was HK$16,030.  At the time of the accident, Hui was 31 years old. Pursuant to section 7(1)(a) of the Ordinance, the compensation under section 9 should be HK$16,030 x 96 months x 4% = HK$61,555.20.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Section 10 compensation</i></p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Sick leave given until 28 October 2008 was certified by the MAB.  As mentioned above, the orthopaedic experts were ad idem thatsick leave given was reasonable.  There were 417 days.  The compensation under section 10 should be HK$16,030 x 4/5 x 417/30 = HK$178,253.60.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Section 10A compensation</i></p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  At the beginning of the trial, parties agreed that the medical expenses were HK$8,830.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Summary</i></p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  The award is therefore:</p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="10%"> </td>            <td width="40%">Section 9 compensation</td>            <td width="40%">HK$  61,555.20</td>            <td width="10%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td> </td>            <td>Section 10 compensation</td>            <td>HK$178,253.60</td>            <td> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td> </td>            <td>Section 10A compensation</td>            <td><u>HK$    8,830.00</u></td>            <td> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td> </td>            <td style="text-align:right">Total: </td>            <td>HK$248,638.80</td>            <td> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The above sum shall carry interest at half judgment rate from the date of accident until today.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Order</b></p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Judgment is entered against Pine Logistics in the sum of HK$248,638.80 with interest as aforesaid.
