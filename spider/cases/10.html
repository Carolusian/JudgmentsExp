However, these are only mental symptomsof mild intensity, not amounting to any depressive episode. In short, there is temporary depression, with mental symptoms raisingconcern but not amounting to mental illness. The plaintiff was exaggerating and dramatizing the symptoms.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="82"><p><a class="para" id="p39" name="p39">39.</a> Dr Yu said the plaintiff also suspected him to be a policeman. It is very rare for mental patients to disbelieve doctors, let alonethink they are police.

They will also be slow in speech and low in volume. Moreover, with true phobia,the patients will be so fearful once the subject of police is mentioned, and will avoid the source of fear by asking others to turnoff the television or to take away newspapers with such subject mentioned.

However, in Dr Cheng's report dated 17 July 2000, it was stated there was no psychotic symptoms, whichwould include paranoia <brs_term brs_term_id="103" brs_term_type="9">delusion</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="84"><p><a class="para" id="p41" name="p41">41.</a> Further, while the referral note of PMH dated 2 June 2000 mentioned suicidal idea, it was negatived in all subsequent reports.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="85"><p><a class="para" id="p42" name="p42">42.</a> Dr Yu said the interview was dominated by Wah.

Dr Yu said the plaintiff was able to speak fluently, and during the MMSE, the plaintiff volunteeredthat she also did the <brs_term brs_term_id="18" brs_term_type="3">Series-7 test</brs_term> with Dr Ho.

By reason of the inconsistencies which led himto conclude the plaintiff was exaggerating and dramatizing, Dr Yu also ruled out depressive episode of moderate degree. He said theplaintiff was very angry and dissatisfied.

She said she is fearful of the police. Dr Li said the plaintiff is notsuffering from phobia of police, but only severe depressive episode. Dr Yu said that the plaintiff was exaggerating and dramatisingher fear of the police. I have observed the plaintiff closely when she gave evidence. She was verbose and forceful. She was not fearfulwhen she mentioned the police and the expatriate inspectors. I <brs_term brs_term_id="48" brs_term_type="9">find</brs_term> that it is inconsistent with phobia of police.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="97"><p><a class="para" id="p50" name="p50">50.</a> Dr Li said when he first saw the plaintiff, he asked her about her report of <brs_term brs_term_id="19" brs_term_type="3">delusion of persecution</brs_term> to A&amp;E of PMH on 2 June 2000. She said the police was nasty to her, following her. Dr Li said the plaintiff's account of the<brs_term brs_term_id="111" brs_term_type="9">delusion</brs_term> was mainly being followed, but it was inconsistent each time. In answer to the question as to why Dr Cheng's reports stated thatthere was no psychotic symptoms (such as <brs_term brs_term_id="112" brs_term_type="9">delusion</brs_term>) and there was no record of investigation of the <brs_term brs_term_id="110" brs_term_type="9">delusion of persecution</brs_term> by Dr Cheng, Dr Li said perhaps on 2 June 2000, the plaintiff was still very angry with the police and she felt aggrieved and emotionallyupset, and she might have expressed her feelings in a more serious way. I <brs_term brs_term_id="49" brs_term_type="9">find</brs_term> that Dr Li was suggesting that the plaintiff might possibly be exaggerating her complaints because of her anger with the police.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="98"><p><a class="para" id="p51" name="p51">51.</a> There was also inconsistencies as to whether the plaintiff had suicidal ideas. Apart from the referral note of PMH dated 2 June 2000,all other medical reports negatived suicidal ideas. When the plaintiff was giving evidence, she casually mentioned that she thoughtof committing suicide by throwing herself off the building when she failed to collect the debts, but did not do so because she thoughtof her children.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="99"><p><a class="para" id="p52" name="p52">52.</a> I also find it quite disturbing that the plaintiff is withholding the report of Dr Ho Pang Nin. Looking at her medical history broadly,Dr Cheng's 1st Report dated 17 July 2000 diagnosed her with <brs_term brs_term_id="113" brs_term_type="9">moderate depressive episode</brs_term>. Dr Cheng's 2nd Report dated 12 February 2001 stated that she had improved upon treatment, but since she defaulted follow up sinceOctober 2000, her current condition could not be ascertained save that permanent disability was not expected. Then on 26 February2001, the plaintiff resumed follow up and complained increased irritability. According to Wah, the plaintiff saw Dr Ho sometime betweenApril and May 2001. Dr Cheng's 3rd Report dated 26 May 2001 stated that the plaintiff's condition improved upon treatment and permanentdisability was not expected. Then on 11 July 2001, the plaintiff reported that she had the <brs_term brs_term_id="114" brs_term_type="9">delusion</brs_term> that Dr Ho was a policeman (back in April or May). It seems that Dr Ho's medical report is a crucial missing link. Further, as pointedout by Mr Shum for the 2nd defendant, it seems more than co-incidental that the plaintiff only thought Dr Ho and Dr Yu were policemen,but not Dr Cheng and Dr Li.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="100"><p><a class="para" id="p53" name="p53">53.</a> For the purpose of <brs_term brs_term_id="117" brs_term_type="9">credibility</brs_term> and <brs_term brs_term_id="116" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term>, I have considered whether the plaintiff was exaggerating and dramatizing her symptoms. Taking into account the inconsistencies mentioned,I accept the opinion of Dr Yu. Besides, Dr Yu is a qualified specialist in psychiatry and has given expert evidence over 100 times.Dr Li has only the general qualification of a Licentiate of the <brs_term brs_term_id="115" brs_term_type="9">Medical Council</brs_term> with clinical experience in psychiatry. He has only given evidence once before in the magistracy. He has seen the plaintiff threetimes of about 10 to 15 minutes before writing his medical report. He relied on the medical reports of Dr Cheng without discussingwith Dr Cheng. He admitted that he had not received training to detect whether a mental patient is exaggerating or dramatising. I<brs_term brs_term_id="50" brs_term_type="9">find</brs_term> the evidence of Dr Yu of much higher quality.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="101"><p><a class="para" id="p54" name="p54">54.</a> Wah was also an exaggerating witness. He was convinced that there was a conspiracy between the 1st defendant and the police. He claimedthat the maternal uncle of the 1st defendant was the &quot;No.1&quot; or person in charge of TST Police Station.

Peterson J said at p.89:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="129"><p class="quote">&quot;A threat is only an intimation by one to another that unless the latter does or does not do something the former will do somethingwhich the latter will not like. But it is impossible to say whether such a threat is or is not lawful until it has been ascertainedwhat it is that is threatened to be done. If the threat is to use violence to person or property, it is obviously an intimation thatthe threatener intends to use unlawful means for the purpose of attaining his end : and no one would doubt that a threat to do thatwhich is unlawful cannot be defended. Where the threat is part and parcel of a conspiracy or unlawful combination, it may be affectedby the illegality of the conspiracy. But omitting cases of conspiracy or combination, I do not understand the legal basis for contendingthat it is unlawful for a man to threaten to do merely that which he is entitled to do.

If a threat amountsto intimidation or a <brs_term brs_term_id="226" brs_term_type="9">menace</brs_term> of violence it cannot be defended; but assuming that it does not, the question remains whether it does in fact exercise pressureof an unlawful kind.
