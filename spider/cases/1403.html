No distinctionhas been made as regards their roles in relation to the claim made in this action.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  This action concerns an article appearing on p. A13 (with a page-heading âHong Kong newsâ) of Ming Pao published on 10 April2008 (â<i>the suit article</i>â).  It is a relatively short article and is attached to this judgment for ease of reference.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The plaintiffs have divided the suit article into 4 component parts: (starting from the top) the photograph, the photographâscaption, the article heading and the body of the text (respectively â<i>the photograph</i>â, â<i>the caption</i>â, â<i>the heading</i>â and â<i>the text</i>â).</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In short, the suit article has the appearance of a news article reporting the demonstration of a Chinese male outside the High CourtBuilding.</p>    <p class="heading">The Suit Article</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The photograph of the suit article shows a Chinese male wearing a cap with his face masked.  His left hand leads the readersâattention to a banner near the right side of the photograph.  The Chinese characters of the banner are reasonably readable.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The caption under the said photograph is a one-line caption.  Under it is a one-line heading, followed by the text.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The suit article measures about 18cm high by 16cm wide.

The background of Ma will be set out in more detail below.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  There is a passage in the text of the suit article concerning Ma being injured when he was assaulted by clubs outside the prisonimmediately upon his release.  There is another passage about Ma stating he wanted to see if anyone would dare to ignore the lawand assault him at the front door of the High Court.  These passages are however not relied upon as words defamatory of the plaintiffs.</p>    <p class="heading">Defence</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Three lines of defence were raised in the amended defence:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     it is denied the suit article is referable to the plaintiffs;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     in view of the background of Ma, the public would associate him as a person of dubious character and a convicted criminal. A reasonable reader would not consider his words to be credible, or take his words seriously.  The way in which the suit articlereported Maâs acts and words is also important.  Consequently, the suit article bears no defamatory meaning;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     the suit article is covered by what can be called the <i>Reynolds</i> privilege (also known as the âresponsible journalismâ defence).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  At the time of trial, the line of defence summarised in sub-para.

Threats were again made by Ma.  Ma was later convicted in 2008 of 2 offences of criminalintimidation, based in essence on the contents of the said letter and the inspectorâs testimony.  His appeal against the convictionswas dismissed.

Taking that into account, the suit article must have been referable to them.</p>    <p class="heading">(b)     How the Ordinary Reader Understands the Suit Article</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  While the defence does not dispute the repetition rule (especially as regards the banner appearing in the photograph) or that theordinary and natural meaning of the words in the banner is defamatory, it contends that the suit article would not convey a defamatorymeaning to an ordinary reader when read in its entirety.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  In particular, the defence relies on the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     the suit article is nothing more than an objective piece of news report, with no or minimal investigative or editorial workon the defendantsâ part; it does not contain their opinion either;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)    the references to Maâs nickname and the criminal intimidation incidents should deprive Maâs accusations of any credibility. Ma is and was a notorious criminal.  An ordinary reader will not give weight to these accusations.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  For the reasons set out below, I disagree with the above contentions.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  First, as a general observation, an ordinary reader is quite justified to think a newspaper of Ming Paoâs reputation or standingwould not select news items (i) at random, or (ii) (worse still) which have no worth or credibility.  Indeed, it will be a sad dayfor our community if he needs constantly to remind himself such may be the case.  Such a reader is in fact quite justified in inferringthat news items (such as the suit article) have been selected for good reasons.  The suit article also mentioned that Ma was interviewedby Ming Paoâs reporter.  If anything, this has the inclination of giving an appearance Maâs story was worthy of investigation.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Secondly, it is important to note that, in the text, Maâs nickname was mentioned together with the criminal intimidation incidents;but the poisoning incidents were omitted.  Maâs convictions in 2008 for the former incidents took place much closer in time tothe suit article than his convictions in 2002 (his appeal was heard in 2004) for the latter incidents (about several months as opposedto about 4 to 5 years).</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The temperament of the ordinary reader has been set out above.  Further to those qualities, his memory of past events is often imperfect,and he may not make the effort to remind himself of the accuracy of those events.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  With the above qualities in mind, after reading the suit article, the ordinary reader would very probably connect Maâs nicknameto the criminal intimidation incidents, rather than the poisoning incidents.  In other words, the ordinary reader may not rememberâHong Kong bin Ladenâ or Ma was the person responsible for the last-mentioned incidents.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The ordinary readerâs imperfect memory of the past events would be of importance when considered together with the matters setout in para. 40 below.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  As regards the credibility of Maâs accusations (and hence the suit articleâs defamatory imputations), the ordinary readerâsassessment would be affected by the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     the matters set out above under this sub-heading;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     the reference to Ma being assaulted immediately upon his release from prison for the criminal intimidation incidents.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  As stated in para. 13 above, the matter referred to in sub-para. (2) above is not relied upon as part of the plaintiffâs causeof action.  Nevertheless, it should be taken into account in considering the imputations of the suit article.  This is because unlessthe ordinary reader considers the assault to be a pure coincidence (which is unlikely), his:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ capacity for implication or drawing inferences... [and to read] in an implication much more freely ...â (see para. 25 above)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>would be fueled by the reference to such an incident.  He:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ is especially prone to do so when it is derogatoryâ (see para. 25 above).</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In this connection, the matter set out in para. 35 above is repeated.</p>    <p class="heading">(c)     The âStingâ of the Libel</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Having taken into account the matters set out under this heading, I conclude that the meaning and âstingâ of the suit article(which is essentially the same thing in the context of this action) is as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     the plaintiffs have fabricated evidence to incriminate Ma;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)    the plaintiffs have committed the offence of forgery;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)    the plaintiffs have conspired with a prosecution witness to fabricate evidence against Ma;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d)    the plaintiffs have committed the offence of bribery of a public officer;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(e)     the plaintiffs have committed the offence of perverting the course of justice in procuring the conviction of Ma for criminalintimidation.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Such meaning or âstingâ falls within the definition of âdefamatoryâ summarised in para. 23 above.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  I am satisfied the plaintiffs have established liability against the defendants.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum of Damages</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  CK Ma seeks damages totalling $3.15 million, being $3 million by way of general damages and $150,000 by way of aggravated damages.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Oriental seeks damages totalling $300,000, being $150,000 by way of general damages and $150,000 by way of aggravated damages.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The defence contends that general damages should be âminimalâ (the amount should be substantially less than $150,000 for CKMa) and no aggravated damages should be awarded.</p>    <p class="heading">(a)     Mitigation of Damages</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The plaintiffs assert that it is not open to the defence to mitigate the quantum of damages because (i) of the lack of particularsin the pleading to this effect, and (ii) the defence has not adduced any evidence to this end.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  The matters put forth by the defence in this regard are:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     the suit article was not endorsed by the defendants: <i>Gatley</i>, para. 35.49;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     the defendants were not the originator of the defamatory words: <i>Gatley</i>, para. 35.50;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     in any event, the defamatory imputations in this action are only a <i>tendency</i> to lower the plaintiffsâ reputation.  Because an ordinary reader does not believe Maâs allegations (alternatively, does not takethem seriously), the defamation is only âtechnicalâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Here again, I do not agree with the defence.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  As regards para. 48(1) above, there is no evidence of valid reasons for selecting the suit article for inclusion in the Hong Kongnews section of Ming Pao.  The matters set out in para. 35 to 41 above show that the suit article has been edited in a manner whichdoes not sit entirely comfortably with the lack of malice.  There is no basis to suggest the defendants honestly believed in Maâsallegations (it is rather their case neither they nor any sensible person ever believed Ma).</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Similar considerations are applicable to para. 48(2) above.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  As regards para. 48(3) above, it was observed in <i>Charleston</i>, above:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ [Two] principles â¦ are basic to the law of libel.  The first is that â¦ the ânatural and ordinary meaningâ to be ascribedto the words â¦ is the meaning, including any inferential meaning, which the words would convey to the [ordinary reader]. â¦ Thesecond principle, which is perhaps a corollary of the first, is that, although a combination of words may in fact convey differentmeanings to the minds of different readers, the jury in a libel action, applying the criterion which the first principle dictates,is <b><i>required to determine the single meaning</i></b> which the publication conveyed to the<b><i>notional reasonable reader</i></b> and to <b><i>base its verdict</i></b> and <b><i>any award of damages</i></b> on the assumption that this was the <b><i>one sense which all readers</i></b> would have understood itâ (emphasis supplied) (at p. 71).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Because of what has been set out in para. 35 to 43 and 50 above, I conclude that the defamatory imputations go beyond what can properlybe called âtechnicalâ.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Thus, leaving aside if this aspect should suffer from a pleading defect, I reject it as having no substantive merits.</p>    <p class="heading">(b)     General Damages</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  The purpose of general damages is to restore the plaintiff, as far as money can do, to the position he would have been in if thetort had not been committed.
