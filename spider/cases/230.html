The plaintiff allegedthat the defendant should have returned the diamonds to it within reasonable time upon demand after the Department of Justice ("DOJ")advised on 1 February 1999 that no criminal prosecution was to be instituted, and that the defendant had wrongfully detained thediamonds in order to ascertain whether there were other claimants making adverse claims.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> On 10 August 2000, the defendant issued an interpleader summons naming 12 claimants. On 31 October 2000, the 1st claimant withdrewits claim. On 8 March 2001, the interpleader summons was heard before Yeung J (as he then was). The 2nd to 12th claimants also withdrewtheir claims. The defendant undertook to return the diamonds to the plaintiff within three days. The summons was dismissed with noorder as to costs against the 12 claimants. Costs between the plaintiff and the defendant on the interpleader summons was made costsin the cause of the action herein. The plaintiff perused the claim on damages for conversion.</p>    <p class="heading">I. LIABILITY</p>    <p class="heading">The facts</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The following facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff is a licenced money lender. It is in the business of, <em>inter alia</em>, lending money to diamond traders on the pledge of diamonds.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Between January and May 1997, 18 diamond merchants including the 12 claimants had sold diamonds worth over $15 million to Chan CheungChun ("Chan") representing Walco Development Co. Ltd ("Walco"). Chan further sold the diamonds to one Mrs Lin.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> On 16 February and March 1997, Mrs Lin's husband Lin Han Hung ("Lin") entered into four loan agreements with the plaintiff to borrow$1 million, $1 million, $1.1 million and $1.25 million respectively totalling $4.35 million and pledged four lots of diamonds withdeclared values of $1 million, $1 million, $1.1 million and $1.25 million respectively as security. The four loan agreements wereidentical in terms. The repayment date under the first two loan agreements was 16 August 1997, and the repayment date under the lasttwo loan agreements was 11 September 1997. The diamonds were in 50 packets with over 25,000 pieces weighing 938.7 carats.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Clause 5 of the loan agreements provides that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In the event of default of repayment by the Customer, whether in whole or in part of the said loan, the Company (without prejudiceto its other rights under common law or any legislation then in force) is and will be entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of thesaid Diamonds or any part or parts thereof in such way or ways as the Company may see fit and without any court order or any priornotice (whether oral or written) to the Customer and to reimburse itself (i.e. the Company) the said loan and interest thereon togetherwith all the costs and expenses incurred in such a sale or disposition. Any surplus arising from such sale or disposition (afterdeducting all the costs and expenses to incurred) will be refunded to the Customer within 30 working days (Saturday and Sunday excluded)after the completion of such sale or disposition without interest."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Between 6 and 11 June 1997, the 18 diamond merchants reported to the police that Chan had failed to pay them for the diamonds. Theclaimants stated the purpose for making the report as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The 2nd, 8th, 9th, and 10th claimants stated that they would like to either get the money or the diamonds back.</p>        <p>(2) The 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 11th and 12th claimants stated that they would like to get the money back.</p>        <p>(3) The 1st claimant said the payment of the price was not yet due and did not state any purpose.</p>        <p>(4) The 7th claimant did not state any purpose.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> On 15 August 1997, 16 diamond merchants including the 2nd to 12th claimants commenced proceedings in HCA 8575/1997 against Walcofor the price of the diamonds. On 10 September 1997, default judgment against Walco was obtained.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> On 16 August and 11 September 1997, payment under the four loan agreements fell due and remained unpaid.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> On 23 February 1998, officers of the defendant executed a search warrant on the plaintiff's office and seized the four loan agreements.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> On 12 March 1998, the plaintiff wrote to Lin giving notice that unless $4.35 million were repaid within three days, it would sellthe mortgaged diamonds for the recovery of the arrears under the loans.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> In the Affirmation of Sgt Chan Kin Ki dated 10 August 2000 on behalf of the defendant in support of the interpleader summons, itwas stated that as Lin could not repay the money to the plaintiff in August and September 1997, the plaintiff had forfeited the diamonds.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> On 13 March 1998, officers of the defendant executed another search warrant and seized the diamonds pledged by Lin under the fourloan agreements.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Between 5 and 12 May 1998, officers of the defendant invited the diamonds merchants to inspect the seized diamonds and the followingclaimants had made positive identification :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The 2nd claimant stated that to the best of its understanding, part of the diamonds in seven packets were of the same quality,size and colour as sold by it and it still had to collect payment from Chan.</p>        <p>(2) The 3rd claimant stated that to its understanding, part of the diamonds in one packet were similar in size, colour and qualityto those sold by him and stated that up to then, it had not received payment from Walco or Chan and it wanted the money back.</p>        <p>(3) The 4th claimant stated part of the diamonds in three packets were probably the goods sold by it and stated it still had to collectpayment from Chan.</p>        <p>(4) The 1st claimant stated that one whole packet of diamonds matched the quality, colour and size of goods sold by it and it stillhad to collect payment of the above goods from Chan.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Both the 2nd and 4th claimants identified three packets in common. In the case of 2nd, 3rd and 4th claimants, the identified andunidentified portions of the diamonds were not separated but remained mixed in the same packet.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> On 1 February 1999, the Prosecutions Division of the DOJ advised that no criminal proceedings should be taken against Chan, and adviceshould be sought from the Civil Division as to disposal of the diamonds.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> On 17 February 1999, the officer in charge of the case sought advice from the Civil Division, DOJ.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> On 12 March 1999, the Civil Division advised as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"2. You seek our advice on the proper disposal of property, namely packets of diamonds, seized by police during investigation of asuspected case of obtaining property by deception.</p>        <p class="quote">3.

At present, the case is still under review by this department. Upon receipt of theirrecommendations all parties claiming ownership of the diamonds will be contacted with a view to settling the matter."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> On 25 May 1999, the plaintiff wrote to the defendant :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" We regret that the diamonds taken away from our company cannot be returned to us even there is no prosecution action to be undertaken.We hold a different view that the matter of ownership has no concern with the Civil Litigation Unit of the Department of Justice.The subject article was taken away from our company and it should be returned to us. Any dispute in the ownership of the said articlesshould be decided by the Court of Justice but not from the said Department. We demand for the return of the said article forthwith."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> On 22 June 1999, the defendant sent a sample letter to the diamond merchants ("1st sample letter") :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" We have during the investigation of the captioned case taken possession of certain diamonds from a company to whom the diamondswere said to be pledged.</p>        <p class="quote">We have finished our investigation of the captioned case and no prosecution action is taken.</p>        <p class="quote">As it is expected that there are a number of potential claimants to the diamonds and our investigation has revealed you might be apotential claimant of the diamonds, we are considering instituting interpleader proceedings to seek the court's order as to how thediamonds are to be disposed of.</p>        <p class="quote">Before we proceed to institute interpleader proceedings, please confirm in writing within 14 days from the date of this letter whetheryou wish to claim the diamonds. If in the affirmative and more than 1 claimant claims the diamonds, you will be named as one of theClaimants in the interpleader proceedings and you will be asked to appear (or represented by your legal representatives) in courtat the hearing of the interpleader proceedings to pursue your claim. You may wish to note that in the interpleader proceedings theunsuccessful Claimant(s) may be liable to pay our costs and the costs of the successful Claimant(s) of the proceedings. If we donot receive your confirmation by such time, we will assume that you do not claim the diamonds."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The letter was also sent to the plaintiff. On 20 July 1999, the plaintiff wrote to the defendant stating that it did not see thatinterpleader proceedings were required and demanded the return of the diamonds.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Between 21 July and 3 September 1999, all the 12 claimants replied to the defendant. Their indications were as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th claimants confirmed that they would make claims on the diamonds;</p>        <p>(2) Other claimants sent an identical letter as follows :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">" Contents have been noted, however we feel it is very unfortunate that we have been put in a position were (<em>sic</em>.) we are expected to pay for the court proceedings, in case we are unsuccessful.</p>            <p class="quote">As far as we are concerned, we would like to see that the property seized is sold, and the proceeds thereof split between the claimants.This is the only way that we feel it would be fair to all parties.</p>            <p class="quote">We took a writ out against Walco Development Co Ltd in 1997, copies of which are with the Police Department. There were in total 16plaintiffs, as such we feel that any property that belonged to Charles Chan (directly or indirectly) should fairly be distributed.</p>            <p class="quote">The company that the goods were seized from, should have no legal claim against the goods, as the goods were part of ill-gotten gains."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> On 6 November 1999, the defendant sent another sample letter to those claimants suggesting the splitting of the proceeds of saleon the diamonds ("2nd Sample letter") :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" As there are a number of claimants who have indicated that they will claim the diamonds, we will take out interpleader proceedingsfor the court to decide the appropriate way of disposing of the diamonds. Please clarify and confirm in writing within 14 days fromthe date of this letter whether you wish to claim the diamonds... If we do not receive your confirmation by such time, the aforesaidletter of you will be taken as that you wish to claim the diamonds and you will be named as a Claimant in the interpleader proceedings."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> In the meantime, the defendant wrote to various claimants verifying their capacity and/or appropriate addresses for service in preparationof the interpleader summons.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> On the other hand, the plaintiff's solicitors wrote to the defendant demanding the return of the diamonds, and complaining, withoutprejudice that interpleader proceedings were inappropriate, the delay in issuing such summons.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> On 20 May 2000, the plaintiff applied for leave for judicial review of the defendant's decision in refusing to return the diamonds.Leave was refused.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> On 13 July 2000, the writ herein was issued and served. On 10 August 2000, the defendant took out the interpleader summons.</p>    <p class="heading">The plaintiff's case</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The plaintiff accepted that the initial seizure of the diamonds under the search warrant was lawful. However, upon the decision ofno prosecution on 1 February 1999, and allowing for reasonable time to take proper legal advice, the diamonds should then be returnedto the plaintiff. Failure to do so upon demand amounted to conversion and/or trespass to goods.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Mr Law, counsel for the plaintiff, submitted that at all material times, the defendant could not expect to be sued for or in respectof the diamonds by anyone except the plaintiff, and taking out the interpleader summons did not provide a defence to conversion.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Mr Law submitted that as at 12 March 1999 when legal advice was given, there was no basis for any interpleader proceedings :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Only the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th claimants had made positive identification of the diamonds but they said they still had to collectpayment of the diamonds;</p>        <p>(2) The 8th, 9th and 10th claimants said they either wanted payment or the diamonds but they had not identified any diamonds.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> It is common ground that at all material times, the defendant has never received any threats or intimation of legal action by anyclaimant. Mr Law submitted that as there was no claim on the diamonds by those who had made identification, and those making claimscould not point to any specific goods, the defendant could not expect to be sued for or in respect of the diamonds by anyone exceptthe plaintiff at that stage. The advice on 12 March 1999 to take out interpleader summons was misconceived.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Mr Law further submitted that while as at 22 June 1999 there was no or no valid claimants on the diamonds, the act of sending outthe 1st sample letter was to invite claims on the diamonds. Mr Law also submitted that the wording of the letter was misleading :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) "Our investigation has revealed you might be a potential claimant of the diamonds" might have given the claimants a hope thatthey had a proprietary claim over the diamonds notwithstanding that they had already obtained default judgment on the price of thegoods;</p>        <p>(2) "If we do not receive your confirmation by such time, we will assume that you do not claim the diamonds" might also have encouragedthem to make a claim.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr Law submitted the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th claimants were invited by the defendant to claim for the diamonds.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The 2nd sample letter went even further in deeming the remaining claimants as making a claim on the diamonds. By then, the claimantshad provided copies of the writ in HCA 8575/1997 to the defendant. If the defendant had been careful in their investigations, itought to have known that the claimants had sued for the price of the goods, and judgment had been obtained, and the claimants hadno proprietary claim on the diamonds. Any fear of being sued by the claimants was without real foundation.

Iraqi Airways</em> [1999] CLC 31, <em>per</em> Mance J). To be liable the defendant need not intend to question or deny the claimant's right; it is enough that his conduct is inconsistentwith those rights."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At para.14-10, the learned authors cited the wrongful retention of goods as a mode of conversion, and "wrongfully" for those purposesmeans without the actual permission of the owner.</p>    <p>And at para.14-27 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"Refusal only evidence of a conversion</em></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Refusal to deliver up on demand is not as such a conversion, but only evidence of it. It is necessary to consider whether the refusalis unconditional or not, and to decide whether in either case the refusal is justifiable. Upon unconditional refusal it is normal,however, to infer denial of the claimant's title."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>And further at para.14-29 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"Refusal must be unconditional</em></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The refusal must also be unconditional. A person on whom a demand for goods is made may not have them immediately available even thoughthey are under this control; he may be the agent of another, or he may be under the belief that he has himself some right or titleto the property. In all these cases he cannot be required to act at a moment's notice, or refuse at his peril. He is entitled toa reasonable time to get the goods into his own hands, and where necessary to consult his principal. So a warehouseman's employeeis not liable in conversion if he refuses to give up goods while he checks with higher authority; again, a person in possession ofanother's goods has the right to a reasonable opportunity to check whether the person asking for them really is entitled to them.On the other hand, a refusal does not cease to be unconditional if the defendant, while admittedly in possession of goods and whilenot disputing the claimant's right, claims time to do something to the goods other than taking steps towards their return. Thus in<em>Secretary of State for Defence v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd</em> (The Times, December 16, 1983 (Scott J)), the defendants were held liable for conversion when they refused to hand over secret documentsthat had come into their possession before they had obliterated all marks that might identify their source."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>And also at para.14-76 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"Defendant's ignorance of claimant's title generally irrelevant</em></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The general rule is clear: a defendant is liable in conversion whether or not he knew, or had reason to know, that what he was doinginfringed the claimant's rights. A claimant who proves (a) a dealing with the goods in a manner inconsistent with his rights, and(b) an intention in the defendant to deny his right or to assert a dominion which is in fact inconsistent with such right, has madeout the ingredients of the tort, whatever the state of knowledge of the defendant.

The mere keeping of another's goods does not amount to detinue and it isnot conversion by detention merely to be in possession of a chattel without title, as where a finder reduces goods into his possessionor a bailee holds over after the period of the bailment has expired. Where, however, a person has possession of the goods of anotherand a valid demand is made for them by the owner, an unqualified and unjustified refusal to deliver them up entitles the owner tosue in detinue and is evidence of conversion."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"[380.410] What amounts to a demand.</em></p>        <p class="quote">The demand for the return of goods must be specific.

Thus, there is no evidence ofconversion where the person in possession of the goods refuses to deliver them up on the ground that he does not know to whom theybelong and keeps them until he can ascertain the owner. Similarly, where the goods are in the possession of an employee who refusesto deliver them up without an order from his employer, the employee's refusal is not evidence of conversion against the employeror the employee. Where, on the other hand, the person in possession of the goods refuses to deliver them up on the ground of a claimof right by a third person which is not substantiated, or where he refuses to deliver them up unless the owner complies with somecondition which the person in possession has no right to impose, or where he fails, without lawful excuse, to deliver them up, thisis evidence of conversion. Thus, if a person who has possession of the goods of another is requested by the owner to send them toa particular place and not only refuses to send them to that place but says generally that he will not deliver them up unless paymentof a debt due to him from the owner is guaranteed, the general refusal is evidence of a conversion, even though he might not be boundto send the goods to any particular place. A person may be guilty of detinue when he refuses to deliver up goods until the cessationof an industrial dispute on the grounds that he genuinely and reasonably fears retaliatory action by his employees; and liabilityfor detinue may follow even though the defendant unequivocally acknowledges the plaintiff's ownership of the goods if the defendantseeks to detain the goods for an indefinite period."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> There is no dispute that the passages cited above are correct statements of the law.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> There is no dispute that the plaintiff has demanded the return of the diamonds.

Smith (op. cit.)</strong>, ï¿¡15,000 were invested in consols in the name of the defendant and other trustees in trust to pay Maberly the dividends duringhis life, remainder over to his wife and issue of the marriage. In 1829, Maberly assigned his interest in the dividends to his sonin law, George Robert Smith, nephew of the defendant. In 1832, Maberly became bankrupt, and the defendant, at the request of hisnephew, went to the Bank of England, himself received the dividend. Instead of entering the money into the account of Maberly orGeorge Robert Smith kept at the defendant's banking firm, the defendant entered it in an account of the firm for sums which theyhad no specific appropriation. Maberly's assignees, impeaching the validity of the assignment to George Robert Smith, sued the defendantfor the amount of the dividend. A rule <em>nisi</em> was obtained under the Interpleader Act, 1 &amp; 2 W.4 c.58, calling on the plaintiffs to exonerate the defendant, who had no interestin the affair, and to try the question with George Robert Smith. The words of the statute are :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"That upon application made by or on the behalf of any defendant sued in any of his Majesty's courts of law, in any action of assumpsit,debt, detinue, or trover, such application being made after declaration and before plea, by affidavit or otherwise, shewing thatsuch defendant does not claim any interest in the subject-matter of the suit, but that the right thereto is claimed or supposed tobelong to some third party, who has sued or is expected to sue for the same, and that such defendant does not in any manner colludewith such third party, but is ready to bring into Court, or to pay or dispose of, the subject-matter of the action in such manneras the Court (or any Judge thereof) may order or direct, it shall be lawful for the Court, or any Judge thereof, to make rules andorders calling upon such third party to appear, and to state the nature and particulars of his claim, and maintain or relinquishhis claim; and upon such rule or order to hear the allegations, as well of such third party as of the plaintiff; and in the meantime to stay the proceedings in such action; and, finally, to order such third party to make himself defendant in the same or someother action, or to proceed to trial on one or more feigned issue or issues; and also to direct which of the parties shall be plaintiffor defendant on such trial, or with the consent of the plaintiff and such third party, their counsel or attornies, to dispose ofthe merits of their claims and determine the same in a summary manner; and to make such other rules and orders therein as to costs,and all other matters, as may appear to be just and reasonable."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Upon showing cause, the plaintiff contended that the defendant had unnecessary interposed by receiving the dividends at the requestof his nephew, and to serve his nephew's interests, that therefore was not entitled to a relief which it was in the discretion ofthe Court to concede or withhold. The defendant urged that as a trustee for Maberly, he was responsible for the dividend, and thereforejustified in receiving it. He had acted for his own protection, and being a trustee, could not be deemed a volunteer. Tindal CJ dischargedthe rule <em>nisi</em> and held that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The act of parliament is not compulsory, but authorises the interposition of the Court at its discretion upon proper occasions; andour duty is to, see that the party applying for the exercise of our discretion, has not voluntarily put himself into the situationfrom which he calls on the Court to extricate him."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> It has not been challenged that the plaintiff was entitled to possessory as well as proprietary interest over the diamonds. Thereis no evidence before the court that the plaintiff was suspected of any fraud, collusion or even notice of non-payment of the priceby Chan at any time. There is not even evidence why the defendant had <em>bona fide</em> doubt as to the plaintiff's interest save the claimants has made a report to the police. I find that the plaintiff was entitled toa right of immediate possession of the diamonds at the close of the criminal investigation.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> It is agreed that at all material times, none of the claimants had threatened or intimated that they would sue the defendant if thediamonds were not returned to them.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Mr Kwok argued that the defendant was entitled to take out an interpleader summons because it expected at least to be sued by theplaintiff if it had returned the diamonds to the claimants. With respect, the words of Order 17 are "is, or expects to be, sued foror in respect of that debt or money or those goods or chattels by two or more persons making adverse claims thereto". If it wereotherwise, the rule would have read "is, or expects to be, sued by ... <em>any of</em> two or more persons making adverse claims thereto." This argument cannot succeed.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> At the close of the criminal investigation, some of the claimants had indicated that the purpose of making the reports to the policewas they wanted to have either the payment or the diamonds back, and others simply wanted payment. I find that it was merely theirwish that the police might assist them to get payment or the diamonds back from Chan. For those who have made some kind of identificationof the diamonds, their stance was that they still had to collect payment. Those claimants who said they wanted the goods back asan alternative had never made any identification. Mr Kwok agreed that expectation of some potential claimants is not equivalent toexpectation to be sued. Even assuming that the defendant was unaware of the writ or the default judgment at that stage, it couldhave no real foundation to expect to be sued by any of the claimants before it sent out the 1st sample letter.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> Upon legal advice, the defendant sent out the 1st sample letter. Para.14 of the Affirmation of Sgt Chan stated as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"To dispose of the diamonds, letters were sent by the defendant to the potential claimants including the 18 merchants, Walco, Mr.Chan, Ms. Lam (i.e. Mrs. Lin), Mr. Lin, Po Kwong Company and the plaintiff in or about June 1999 asking them whether they want toclaim the diamonds."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> I find that the defendant had embarked upon the course of searching for potential claimants while there were no actual valid claimants.The 1st sample letter stated that it was expected that there were a number of potential claimants to the diamonds and police investigationhad revealed the addressee might be a potential claimant. I find that more probable than not, it had induced the claimants to havefalse hope of a proprietary claim on the diamonds notwithstanding default judgment had been obtained by them against Walco for theprice.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> After the 1st sample letter, the 1st, 3rd 4th, 5th and 6th confirmed that they wished to claim on the diamonds. Looking at all thestatements and correspondence, the only conclusion was that they wished to claim against Chan, which they had effectively done soby issuing the writ against Walco. I can see no indication that they would sue the defendant if it did not return the diamond tothem.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> As to the 2nd sample letter, all those claimants deemed to be making a claim by default had made no identification.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> If the defendant were actually sued or threatened to be sued by the claimants for the return of the diamonds, then regardless ofthe merits of the claimants' claims, it ought to be entitled to interpleader relief. However, there was no such threats or intimations.Hence, in assessing whether there is any expectation to be sued, the defendant must ensure that any such fear is not unfounded ormisconceived.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> I find that the defendant did have knowledge of the writ in HCA 8575/1997 at the latest by 31 July 1999 as evidenced by the referencein the replies of the claimants who wanted to split the proceeds. The defendant ought to have realised that none of the claimantshad shown any proprietary interest on the diamonds. The defendant could have no real foundation to expect to be sued by the claimants.The defendant was, by his own act, placed in a situation to be sued by the plaintiff, and could not call on the Court for reliefunder the interpleader proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> Hence, I find that the plaintiff's application for interpleader proceedings was misconceived.</p>    <p class="heading">Conditional, qualified or justifiable refusal</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> Mr Kwok submitted that even if the interpleader summons were misconceived, the defendant's refusal to return the diamonds to theplaintiff at once was conditional, qualified or justifiable, pending its enquiry as to true ownership. There was a public duty orexpectation for the police to act in an obviously responsible manner in returning the diamonds to the rightful owner, and it wasreasonable for the defendant to clear up any doubt on the ownership of the diamonds before parting with them, and the period of time,up to and until the determination of the interpleader summons was reasonable. He relied on <strong>Vaughan v. Watt</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281840%29%206%20M%20%26%20W%20492" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1840) 6 M &amp; W 492.</a> The facts are as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The goods in question were pledged with the defendant, a pawnbroker, by a female of the name of Hubbard, in the name (as the defendantunderstood it) of Mary Warne, and the duplicate was so made out. On the next day he was sent to by that person, (whom he did notthen know, but who afterwards proved to be the plaintiff's wife), to say that she had lost the duplicate, and she demanded and obtainedfrom him a copy thereof, and also a form of a declaration of the loss of it, pursuant to the stat. 39 &amp; 40 Geo. 3, c.99, s. 16(a)and 5 &amp; 6 Will. 4, c.63, s. 12.(b) Some days afterwards, upon an allegation that this document also was lost, she obtained fromthe defendant another similar form. On the 6th of August, the plaintiff Vaughan produced the duplicate to the defendant, and demandedthe goods, tendering the amount of the pledge and the interest. The defendant refused to give them up, on the ground of the declarationhaving been obtained from him. On the 7th, the plaintiff made an application to the police magistrate at Hatton Garden, for the purposeof compelling the restoration of the goods, and a summons was granted for the defendant's appearance on the following day, when heattended accordingly, but was compelled to go away before the case was called on. On the 9th, however, the parties again attendedbefore the magistrate; and the plaintiff then stated that it was his wife by whom the goods had been pledged. The magistrate, however,after hearing the circumstances, declined to interfere. The plaintiff then brought this action, the writ being sued out on the 21stAugust. It was contended for the defendant, that there was no evidence of such an absolute refusal by him to deliver up the goodsto the plaintiff, as constituted a conversion; and that he was justified in refusing to do so, by the circumstance of the declarationshaving been obtained by another party claming to be the owner. The learned Judge thought that the mere fact of these documents havingbeen obtained was no defence as against the real owner of the goods, who might, in that case, never have it in his power to recoverpossession of them : and under his Lordship's direction, a verdict was found for the plaintiff, damages ï¿¡10, leave being reservedto the defendant to move to enter a nonsuit.

The defendant was entitled to reasonable time to seek legal advice on the disposal of the diamonds. Atall material times, there was no threats nor intimation by any claimants that they would sue the defendant if the diamonds were notreturned to them. There was no real foundation for the defendant to fear or expect to be sued by any of the claimants. The decisionto take out interpleader proceedings was misconceived. Reasonable time for enquiry elapsed when the Civil Division of the DOJ gavethe advice on 12 March 1999. The defendant should have returned the diamonds to the plaintiff when the plaintiff tendered its writtendemand on 24 April 1999. There was no justification for the defendant to hold any further enquiry to ascertain whether there wereadverse claimants against the plaintiff. The retention of the diamonds ceased to be conditional or qualified upon the expiry of reasonabletime for enquiry and any further detention was inconsistent with the right of the plaintiff. The defendant must act at its own perilagainst the owner of the diamonds if it chose to act on misconceived legal advice given.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> I find that the defendant is guilty of conversion against the plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">Trespass to goods</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> According to <em>Bullen &amp; Leake &amp; Jacob's Precedents of Pleadings</em> (13th Edition, 1990) at p.955 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"Nature of trespass to goods</em></p>        <p class="quote">Trespass to goods is a tort of far greater importance to legal historian than to present day practitioners.

Mr Wong Fung Hing, a director of the plaintiff explained that the diamonds were not yet sold because there was an economic downturn,and as the plaintiff was a diamonds trader, there was no hurry to sell the diamonds. I am satisfied that the plaintiff intended tosell the diamonds when it became entitled to regain possession of them.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> Mr Kwok submitted that the plaintiff had failed to prove the value of the diamonds, or indeed the plaintiff had suffered any lossof interest.

It is not known whether the diamonds were kept or sold, and if sold, at what price. It wassubmitted that under clause 5 of the loan agreements, the plaintiff was entitled to charge both principal and interest on the saleproceeds of the diamonds.

The London &amp; North Western Railway Company</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281879%29%202%20Bing%20NC%20310" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1879) 2 Bing NC 310.</a> There, the plaintiffs sought to recover ï¿¡230 and interest for the value of the corn which the defendants have predelivered, andfor which the plaintiffs have not been paid. Thesiger LJ stated the facts at p.197 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I have entertained some doubt whether this action can be maintained even for nominal damages. But upon consideration I think it canfor this reason. Stripping the case of all accidental circumstances the facts are, that the defendants, being in possession of certaingoods of the plaintiffs, as bailees, were bound to keep them until they obtained the authority of the plaintiffs, the bailors, todeliver them; notwithstanding that duty they delivered to certain persons, without any order from the plaintiffs: it is true thata delivery order would be received from the plaintiffs, and in point of fact it was received a few days afterwards. I am of opinion,however, that the previous unauthorised act, whether it is called a misdelivery or a predelivery, whether it constitutes technicallyspeaking a conversion, or only a breach of the contract of bailment, of the duties which flow from the bailment, was a wrongful actin respect of which a right of action vested at once in the plaintiffs, and that right of action once vested was not divested bythe plaintiffs afterwards giving the delivery order under which the defendants might have delivered the goods, and which, in truth,had been then already delivered. I think that the unauthorised act, whether it be a conversion, or whether it be a breach of contract,or a breach of duty did vest the right of action, and that there was sufficient damage in the eyes of the law to enable the plaintiffsto sue, for this reason, that they were for some days deprived of the control of their goods, to which they were entitled by theircontract with the defendants, and the law presumes a damage in respect of that unlawful act."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>His Lordship further held at p.200 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It appears to me, therefore, to follow from the ordinary rules which are applicable to actions of trover that the plaintiffs areentitled to recover damages for the deprivation of their control over the goods from the time of the unauthorised delivery; but inasmuchas it is admitted that during that period the plaintiff sustained no damage they can only recover nominal damages."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Bramwell LJ, who formed the majority with Thesiger LJ, held at p.195 that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I think, therefore, that the plaintiffs are entitled to nominal damages, because a conversion cannot be purged, and if a defendantis guilty of conversion he must pay some damages. A return of the goods undoubtedly might be shewn to reduce the damages in the caseof a conversion, not only where the owner voluntarily received back the goods, but where he took them back against his will. In anaction of trover or conversion the practice was for a defendant to apply to the Court for a stay of proceedings on the delivery upof the goods, and on payment of nominal damages and costs; but if the plaintiff refused to accept delivery, and insisted on proceedingwith his action for substantial damages, he did so at his peril, and if he failed to get substantial damages he was made to pay thecosts of action. It is clear, therefore, that on the return of the goods the plaintiff would recover, not their value, but the damageshe had sustained by the wrongful act, which was called the conversion."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> Mr Kwok did not argue with the principle in <strong>Hiort</strong>, but submitted that justice requires that it should not be followed. He referred to <em>McGregor on Damages</em> (16th Edition, 1997) para.421 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The best statement as to the meaning and incidence of nominal damages is given by Lord Halsbury LC in <em>The Mediana</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1900%5d%20AC%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1900] AC 113</a>, 116 where he said :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">'"Nominal damages" is a technical phrase which means that you have negatived anything like real damage, but that you are affirmingby your nominal damages that there is an infraction of a legal right which, though it gives you no right to any real damages at all,yet gives you a right to the verdict or judgment because your legal right has been infringed.'</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Thus nominal damages may be awarded in all cases of breach of contract and in torts actionable <em>per se</em>. Furthermore, at least nominal damages should be awarded in such cases, but not all decisions appear to adhere strictly to this (<em>Pagnan &amp; Fratelli v.

The sellersran into difficulties and could not pay the freight and insurance premiums, money for which was advanced by the buyers. Shipmentwas seriously delayed. The sellers were unable to tender bills of lading within the period allowed notwithstanding extensions oftime, the last expiring on 22 August 1965. The buyers did not treat the contract as at an end, but orally agreed with the selleron 21 September to accept and pay the contract price (as varied) for the cargo if they were satisfied with its conditional on arrivalat the designated port. If not satisfied they were entitled to reject it. The ship arrived on 19 October, part of the cargo was damagedand the buyers rejected the whole. Meanwhile, the buyers obtained a decree of sequestration from an Italian court relating to partof the cargo as security for the sums advanced for freight and insurance premiums and in respect of their claim against the sellersfor breach of contract. The sequestration order was lifted on the sellers repaying the freight and insurance premiums, but it remainedin force on certain cargo to cover the claim for damages. On 13 November 1965, the buyers bought the whole cargo at a reduced price.Their claim for damages went to arbitration, and the sellers admitted the breach of contract. The appellate tribunal found the Novemberpurchase was part of a continuous course of dealing between the parties, and by such purchase the buyer had "diminished and mitigated"their loss and notwithstanding the sellers' breach they were not entitled to damages. Roskill J upheld that decision. On appeal bythe buyers, the only question for the court was whether, on the facts found and the true construction of the contract, the tribunal,in assessing damages, was entitled to take into account the November purchase. Salmon LJ said at p.1316D :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Damages for breach of contract are awarded for loss suffered. Here, the buyers suffered no loss. It is only by looking in isolationat the sellers' failure to deliver sound goods that the buyer's claim is even arguable. This failure cannot in my view properly belooked at in isolation because together with the purchase of November 13 which arose out of the situation in which the buyers foundthemselves, it formed one continuous dealing between the same parties in respect of the same goods. As a result of this dealing,looked at as a whole, the buyers, notwithstanding the sellers' breach, made a profit and no loss. To allow the buyers' claim wouldin my view be contrary alike to justice, common sense and authority."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> Mr Kwok submitted that the plaintiff had adduced no evidence on whether a loss or profit was realized on the diamonds. To allow theplaintiff nominal damages would be contrary to justice and common sense.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> I find that the dicta in <strong>Hiort</strong> is direct and clear : a conversion cannot be purged, and if a defendant is guilty of conversion he must pay some damages. A plaintiffis entitled to recover damages for deprivation of its control over the goods from the time of the wrongful detention until its return,but inasmuch that during that period the plaintiff suffers no damage, it can only recover nominal damages.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> On the other hand, <strong>Pagnan &amp; Fratelli</strong> was a case on breach of contract, and was decided on the facts that the parties' dealings did not terminate upon the failure to deliverthe goods at the extended shipment date, but continued up to the subsequent purchase at reduced price by the buyers whereby therewas no loss. I do not find that the reasoning in <strong>Pagnan &amp; Fratelli</strong> is applicable to <strong>Hiort</strong> or indeed the present case. There is no injustice in the plaintiff not proving substantial damages and resorting to nominal damagesonly.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> The plaintiff is entitled to nominal damages for conversion of $1 against the defendant.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> At the request of counsel for the defendant, I shall hear parties as to costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">( B.
