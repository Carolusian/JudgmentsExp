only Wong Tze Yuk and have nothing to do with the present claim as the plaintiff has no right to bring an actionon his behalf.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> It would appear from the Statement of Claim that, as the plaintiff had complained to the IPCC and instituted HCA 2689/2006, the policecarried out the allegedly unlawful stop and search operations as a revenge on him and his younger brother. At trial, however, theplaintiff clarified that this was not his case. The plaintiff also submitted that the stop and search by the police contravened Articles6, 8 and 28 of the Basic Law. However, Article 6 concerns the protection of private property rights and has nothing to do with thepresent case; Article 8 governs the applicability of the laws previously in force in Hong Kong and is not directly relevant to thepresent case; and Article 28, which serves to protect the freedom of the person of Hong Kong residents, is also not relevant to thepresent case as the plaintiff is not alleging that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a><a><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">4</a></a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a><a>3</a> is unconstitutional.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> As a matter of fact, the plaintiffâs chief cause of action is that a police officer must have reasonable suspicion against a personbefore he can ask that person to produce his identity card for inspection or before he can search him in a public place, but on theoccasions in question, the police officers had no reasonable suspicion against him and his younger brother but still requested themto produce their identity cards and searched their persons, contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a>. Furthermore, the plaintiff claims that whether such reasonable suspicion exists, a police officer is not allowed to record or collectthe personal particulars contained in the identity card of the person intercepted, because such an act contravenes Article 39 ofthe Basic Law and Article 14 under section 8 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance<a>5</a> (hereinafter âthe Bill of Rightsâ), both of which provide for the protection of the privacy of citizens, as well as paragraph2(a) of Data Protection Principle 1 (purpose and manner of collection of personal data) under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/486" class="autolink_findacts">Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance</a><a>6</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The plaintiff asserts that the unlawful acts of the police officers constituted illegal acts of tort including misconduct in publicoffice, unlawful detention, unlawful arrest, property damage and intimidation. The plaintiff says he has suffered harm, includingmental distress, as a result of those acts, and he is claiming damages in the sum of HK$1,888,888 against the Commissioner of Policeand the Secretary for Justice.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> In essence, the defence raised by the Commissioner of Police and the Secretary for Justice is that the acts of stopping and searchingthe plaintiff or the two brothers were done solely in lawful execution of the police officersâ duties and did not constitute anyillegal acts of tort, and that the recording of their personal particulars in the police notebooks following a lawful stop and searchwas neither unconstitutional nor contrary to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/486" class="autolink_findacts">Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p class="heading">Main issues</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The main issues are that, in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th and 7th incident:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) Whether the police officers were acting unlawfully in demanding the plaintiff to produce his identity card or even to search hisperson; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) Whether the police officers were acting unconstitutionally or unlawfully in recording the personal particulars contained in theplaintiffâs identity card.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The validity or otherwise of the other causes of action stated in paragraph 6 above depends on whether the police could lawfullyinvoke <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54(1)</a> or <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">54</a>(2) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> I shall start by discussing the legal principles applicable to the two main issues.</p>    <p class="heading">Legal principles</p>    <p class="heading">(1)     Power to stop and search</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 54</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a> provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) If a police officer finds any person in any street or other public place â¦ at any hour of the day or night, who acts in a suspiciousmanner, it shall be lawful for the police officer â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) to stop the person for the purpose of demanding that he produce proof of his identity for inspection by the police officer;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b) to detain the person for a reasonable period while the police officer enquires whether or not the person is suspected of havingcommitted any offence at any time; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) If a police officer finds any person in any street or other public place â¦ at any hour of the day or night, whom he reasonablysuspects of having committed or of being about to commit or of intending to commit any offence, it shall be lawful for the policeofficer â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) to stop the person for the purpose of demanding that he produce proof of his identity for inspection by the police officer;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b) to detain the person for a reasonable period while the police officer enquires whether or not the person is suspected of havingcommitted any offence at any time;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c) to search the person for anything that is likely to be of value (whether by itself or together with anything else) to the investigationof any offence that the person has committed, or is reasonably suspected of having committed or of being about to commit or of intendingto commit; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d) to detain the person during such period as is reasonably required for the purpose of such a search.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> According to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54(1)</a>, a police officer may exercise the powers conferred upon him against any person whom he finds to be acting suspiciously. In <i>HKSAR v.

It seems that the officer may âsubjectivelyâ consider someone to be âactingsuspiciouslyâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>As I understand it, in the above passage Deputy Judge Barnes was simply quoting the original text of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54(1)</a> to point out its literal meaning. This is not to say that the police officer could act arbitrarily without regard to the actual circumstancesat the material time; otherwise, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54(1)</a> would be open to abuse.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> In my view, while it is for a police officer to form a subjective judgment that someone is acting suspiciously, he must have regardto the relevant objective facts â such as the time, location, circumstances at the scene, and the demeanour, conduct and acts ofthe person â and then apply his professional training and knowledge to decide whether the person is acting suspiciously. In otherwords, a police officer who seeks to exercise the power under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54(1)</a> must rely on some objective facts as the basis of his conclusion that the person stopped and searched by him has acted suspiciously.Mr. Shum, Counsel for the defendants, has also agreed that this is the correct interpretation of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54(1).</a></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> As regards <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54(2)</a>, the reasonableness of any suspicion that a police officer has against a person must be determined by reference to the objectivefacts at the material time<a>8</a>. These facts are similar to those required under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54(1)</a>,  namely the time, location, circumstances at the scene, the demeanour, conduct and acts of the person, and other relevant facts.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> On the correct interpretation of the Ordinance, when a police officer stops and searches a person:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) If he relies on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54(1)</a>, he must have relevant evidence to support his judgment that the person is acting in a suspicious manner.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) If he relies on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54(2)</a>, he must have relevant evidence to support the reasonableness of his suspicion of the person.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>When I examine the evidence hereinbelow, I will consider whether, in each of the âstop and searchâ incidents, there was sufficientevidence to enable the police officers to rely on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54(1)</a> or <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">54</a>(2).</p>    <p class="heading">(2)     Power to record personal particulars shown on identity card</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Article 39 of the Basic Law provides that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">The provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [hereinafter âICCPRâ] â¦ as applied to Hong Kong shallremain in force and shall be implemented through the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">The rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents shall not be restricted unless as prescribed by law.

HKSAR</i><a>9</a>. One of these established principles is that the term âprivacyâ in Article 17 of the ICCPR has a wide definition which encompassesthe identity, such as the name and gender, of a person: see <i>U.N. Convention on Civil and Political Rights CCPR Commentary</i><a>10</a>. In my view, âpersonal identityâ should also include the unique particulars that serve to ascertain or verify the identity ofan individual.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The personal particulars set out on the identity card of a citizen, including his/her name in Chinese and English, gender, date ofbirth and identity card number, can be regarded as unique as well as the most useful pieces of information that can be relied onto ascertain or verify the âpersonal identityâ of an individual. Accordingly, I hold that the personal particulars set out onan identity card form part of the âprivacyâ of a citizen and are protected by Article 39 of the Basic Law, Article 17 of theICCPR and Article 14 of the Bills of Rights.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Mr. Shum cites the case of <i>Reyntjens v. Belgium</i><a>11</a> and submits that the name of a person is not necessarily covered by the term âprivacyâ. In <i>Reyntjens</i>, the issue before the European Commission of Human Rights was whether the Belgium police had infringed Article 8 of the EuropeanConvention of Human Rights by inspecting identity cards and recording information thereon in the absence of a reason. Article 8 providesas follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life<a>12</a>, his home and his correspondence.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with thelaw and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of thecountry, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights andfreedoms of others.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The European Commission of Human Rights held that the duty of a citizen to carry his/her identity card and to produce it to the policeupon demand did not contravene Article 8 because, pursuant to the relevant statutory provisions, an identity card bore only its holderâsname (and, where applicable, his/her spouseâs name), gender, date of birth and residential address. It did not bear any informationon the âprivacyâ of the holder<a>13</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The European Commission of Human Rights did not explain why the personal particulars on an identity card were not âprivacyâ information.As I stated above, âpersonal identityâ, one of the key elements of âprivacyâ, should include the unique particulars thatcan be used to ascertain or verify the identity of an individual, such as the particulars set out in an identity card. Therefore,I do not intend to follow the decision in <i>Reyntjens</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> In my view, before the police can record in their notebooks the personal particulars on the identity card of a person interceptedby them, two basic requirements must be satisfied:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) What they do is prescribed by law â see Article 39 of the Basic Law; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) What they do will not constitute unreasonable/arbitrary or unlawful interference â see Article 17 of the ICCPR and Article 14of the Bill of Rights.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> In respect of the âprescribed by lawâ requirement, the plaintiff first submits that there must be statutory provisions whichexpressly empower the police to record the personal particulars set out on the identity card of a person intercepted by them.  Therebeing no such express provisions in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a>, what the police did was, the plaintiff submits, not prescribed by law.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 10</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a> provides that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">The duties of the police force shall be to take lawful measures for â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>â¦<br />        preventing and detecting crimes and offences;</p>        <p>â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <p>What constitutes âlawful measuresâ depends on the circumstances of the case.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> As stated above, in lawfully exercising the power under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a> to stop and search a person, a police officer must either consider that the person is acting suspiciously or reasonably suspect thatthe person has committed, is about to commit or intends to commit a crime. In other words, the person intercepted by the police haseither acted suspiciously or has caused the police to reasonably suspect that he has committed, is about to commit or intends tocommit a crime. Under such circumstances, a police officer can rely on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a> and demand the intercepted person, a suspect, to produce his identity card for inspection so that the police can verify his identityand the relevant personal particulars. Although this will interfere the âprivacyâ of the intercepted person, it is a necessaryand lawful measure âfor preventing and detecting crimes and offencesâ. In my view, when the police officer goes on to recordin his notebook the personal particulars of the suspect as shown on his identity card, it is also a lawful measure âfor preventingand detecting crimes and offencesâ provided that it satisfies the requirement of not constituting an âunreasonable interferenceâ.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The plaintiff also submits that âprescribed by lawâ requires the relevant legal provision to express clearly and sufficientlythe scope of the power in question and to be accessible to the public so that they can regulate their behaviours accordingly: see<i>Leung Kwok Hung v. HKSAR</i><a>14</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> As stated above, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 54</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">10</a>(b) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a> clearly provide that a police officer can record in his notebook the personal particulars shown on the identity card of a personif and only if he finds the person acting suspiciously or harbours reasonable suspicion against him. The statutory provisions areopen to the public, who can certainly regulate their behaviours accordingly.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> For the above reasons, the âprescribed by lawâ requirement has in my judgment been satisfied.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> As for the âunreasonable/arbitrary or unlawful interferenceâ requirement, the term âunlawfulâ means that no interferencecan take place except as envisaged by the law, and that the legislation in question must comply with the provisions, aims and objectivesof the ICCPR: <a>see <i>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Cases, Materials and Commentary</i>,at paragraph 16.08</a><a>15</a>.  The aim of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 54</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">10</a>(b) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a> is to prevent and detect crimes, but those provisions also govern the use of the relevant police powers. This type of provisions,which seek to strike a balance between the need to maintain peace and order and the need to guard against the abuse of police powers,is indispensable in a civilized region such as Hong Kong. The provisions in question are certainly in compliance with the provisions,aims and objectives of the ICCPR.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> As for âunreasonable/arbitraryâ, the term means that the interference in question must be reasonable in the particular circumstancesof a given case, and reasonableness implies that any interference must be proportional to the end sought and be used for the solepurpose of achieving that end: see <i>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Cases, Materials and Commentary</i>,at paragraph 16.12<a>16</a>. The undisputed evidence in the present case is that the personal particulars recorded by the police officers do not go beyond thenames, dates of birth and identity card numbers of the intercepted persons. These particulars are the most basic information neededfor ascertaining or verifying the identity of a person. Recording such basic information is proportional to the purpose of preventingand detecting crimes. The evidence also shows that the information is merely recorded in the police notebooks and not put to anyother use. This shows that the making of such records in the police notebooks is no more than a measure for the purpose of preventingand detecting crimes, and the interference that it causes to the âprivacyâ of the intercepted person is, it can be said, minimal.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> For the above reasons, I hold that the requirement of not causing âunreasonable/arbitrary or unlawful interferenceâ has alsobeen satisfied. </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> In my judgment, <a>following the lawful stop and search of a person pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a>, the recording in the police officerâs notebook of the name, date of birth as shown on the identity card and the identity cardnumber of that person pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10(b)</a></a> does not contravene Article 39 of the Basic Law, Article 17 of the ICCPR or Article 14 of the Bills of Rights.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Paragraph 2(a) of Data Protection Principle 1 under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/486" class="autolink_findacts">Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance</a> provides that personal particulars must be collected in a lawful manner.

At the end, therefore, the key issue is:in each of the stop and search incidents, was there sufficient evidence to enable the police to invoke <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54(1)</a> or <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">54</a>(2)?</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> I will now examine the evidence adduced by both parties.</p>    <p class="heading">Evidence</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> The plaintiff and his younger brother testified in court.

At about 12 oâclock on or about 21 October 2006, I left the fitness products company which I owned as sole proprietor andwhich was located in Sheung Wan. I then went to the vicinity, i.e. Lan Kwai Fong, on foot to attend a party. When I walked past 35Gage Street, I was stopped by a police officer of the Police Tactical Unit (PTU). The officer indicated that I had to produce myHong Kong identity card and undergo a search of my person. I produced my Hong Kong identity card and handed it to the officer, whothen said that he had to write down my personal particulars, including my name and Hong Kong identity card number, in his policenotebook. I refused to let him do so. He also said that he suspected I had dangerous drugs on me and that he had to conduct a searchon my person pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232">Cap. 232</a>, but I also refused to let him do so.

Upon seeing us, the man suddenly went behind a vehicle and then walked out of the rear of the vehicle and hurriedaway. He was acting suspiciously. We went up to intercept him and then told him that he was suspected to be possessing dangerousdrugs. We demanded him to show his identity card and undergo a search of his person. He then showed me his identity card for inspection.I checked the information on the identity card against the information in the Nominal Index Computer System and also conducted asearch on his person, but nothing was found. So I recorded his particulars in my notebook. The whole incident lasted two minutes,from 0007 to 0009 hours, in the course of which no dispute arose. â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>4.

At about 1745 hours on 8 February 2007, when I was patrolling along Java Road near North Point Road, I saw two men comingup in my direction. Something seemed to be protruding underneath their clothes at the waist area and they were both acting furtively.Then I went up to intercept them and said that they were suspected to be possessing contrabands. I demanded them to produce theiridentity cards and undergo a body search. They refused to cooperate and challenged my authority. PC 53565, who was by my side, assistedme by explaining to the two men the powers of the police. Following our repeated explanations, the two men finally produced theiridentity cards, but they refused to be searched on the spot or at North Point Police Station. They insisted that the searches hadto be carried out inside Police Headquarters. In the meantime, the two men raised a hue and cry at the scene and shouted that theywere being violently treated by the police. A number of passers-by gathered around and watched. I warned them that if their behavioursbreached the peace and caused obstruction to others, they were liable to be arrested for disorderly conduct. At about 1755 hours,the two men (or one of them) called the console by dialing 999, alleging that they were being violently treated by the police. PC53565 and I informed CAR10 and asked for assistance. At about 1806 hours, Station Sergeant 23770, Station Sergeant 855 and PC 52662arrived at the scene to enquire about the incident. Station Sergeant 23770 made enquiries with the two men, whereas Station Sergeant855 made enquiries with PC 53565 and me. PC 52662 gathered information from those in the vicinity who might have witnessed the courseof the event. At about 1825 hours, Station Sergeant 23770 explained to the two men the relevant powers of the police and the proceduresof lodging a complaint against the police. The two men indicated that they were very familiar with the procedures of lodging a complaintagainst the police but had no complaint or dissatisfaction over the incident. Believing that the incident arose from a misunderstanding,Station Sergeant 23770 let the two men go.

Station Sergeant855 made enquiries with PC 51635 and PC 53565, PC 52662 collected information in the vicinity of the scene, and I made enquirieswith the two men. After making enquiries, I came to understand that the abovementioned police officers had intercepted the two menand demanded them to produce their identity cards and undergo a search, but the two men were not satisfied with the reason givenfor the interception and purported search. Accordingly, I explained our authority and procedures again to the two men, and they seemedto be satisfied with my explanation. Then I explained to them that if they had any dissatisfaction, they could lodge a complaintin accordance with specified procedures. They said they were very familiar with the procedures for lodging complaints against policeofficers but they had no dissatisfaction and complaint in respect of this particular incident. I believed the incident arose fromsheer misunderstanding, so I let the two men go.
