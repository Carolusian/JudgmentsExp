Clause 1(e) expressly provided foran unfettered discretion to the defendant in the way it could enforce the terms.  Of relevance in the present case was its electionto enforce the repayment of the loan as an unsecured creditor. It was consistent with the common law position that a secured creditormight so elect.  The plaintiff was and is arguing that the defendant had done so out of ignorance of the correct legal position (asa secured creditor) at the material time.  As soon as it became aware of the correct legal position as advised by DOJ, it ought tohave made retrospective deductions.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> My findings were that the defendant owed no duty, whether under contract or tort, to prefer the plaintiff's interest to other creditors'interest.  Even if the DOJ's advice had become available before the 39 months in question, the defendant could still have refused,as it did, to make any deductions for that same period.  The aforementioned clause (and the common law in any event) would excludethe defendant from such a complaint. </p>    <p class="heading"><i><b>Ground 1 (para. 2 of plaintiff's affirmation)</b></i></p>    <p class="heading"><i><b>The defendant's ignorance and unawareness</b></i></p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The plaintiff now submits that the defendant should have made retrospective deductions.  The non-deductions arose from the defendant'signorance and unawareness of its proper legal rights, namely its priority as a secured creditor over unsecured creditors. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> I found that the defendant could elect, but was not bound, to enforce its secured housing loan in priority over unsecured creditorsduring the defendant's bankruptcy.  The plaintiff had no remedies for the defendant's election to suspend the monthly deductionsduring the defendant's bankruptcy.   </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>   I do not think the plaintiff's submission is arguable because Clause 1(e) of the Loan Agreement stipulated that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p><i>â¦ the Government shall not be obliged to exercise or resort to any of its rights or remedies under this Agreement â¦</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is clear that this clause is applicable.

It is not permissible for the defendant to change its stancefrom an unsecured creditor to a secured creditor or vice versa without taking necessary remedial steps. </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  I do not think this submission is arguable because Clause 1(e) of the Loan Agreement stipulated that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p><i>No delay or omission of the Government in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall impair such right, poweror privilege, or be construed as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any suchright, power or privilege preclude any further exercise of them or the exercise of  any other right, power or privilege.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b><i>Ground 3(para. 4-8, 10-11, 14-16 of plaintiff's affirmation)</i></b></p>    <p class="heading"><b><i>The defendant's wrong steps in the wake of DOJ's advice</i></b></p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The plaintiff now submits that I should not construe DOJ's written advice as advising on a non-retrospective action on the partof the DAS.

Otherwise he would not have instituted the presentproceedings.  </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>   The plaintiff also submits on how the advice should be construed by the DAS.  The DAS had correctly withdrawn its proof of debtsand repaid the monies previously received.  It ought to have made retrospective deductions along the same line.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>   I see no point in either my or the plaintiff's expressing an agreement or disagreement of the way the DAS acted upon the advice. The fact was that upon receiving the advice, the DAS proceeded to make deductions after the suspension but would not make any retrospectivedeductions.  The DAS might be right or wrong in pursuing its remedies in such a way.  However, the Loan Agreement and the commonlaw as aforementioned, which the plaintiff never disputed, would be a complete answer to the plaintiff's case. </p>    <p class="heading"><b><i>Ground 4 (para. 9 of plaintiff's submissions)</i></b></p>    <p>The defendant cheating him</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The plaintiff now submits that whether intentional or not, the DAS had cheated him by treating him as an unsecured creditor.  TheDAS should have known of its rights as a secured creditor.  If it had told him in time, he would have repaid it or <i>forced</i> it to make the deductions. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>   I regard that the plaintiff had had full opportunity to seek legal advice.  In any event, the plaintiff had been asked to pay buthe was unable to repay.  He now says that he would have repaid.  This is against the evidence as found.  Besides, he cannot forcethe DAS to make deductions.  The Loan Agreement and common law aforementioned, which the plaintiff never disputed, would not allowsuch <i>forcing</i>. </p>    <p class="heading"><b><i>Ground 5 (para. 12 of plaintiff's submissions)</i></b></p>    <p>The defendant not benefiting him at the expense of other creditors</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>   The plaintiff now feels that it seemed that my judgment regarded him as a greedy person.
