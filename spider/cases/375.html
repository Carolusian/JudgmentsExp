Further,parts of the fees were payable either for no work or work which was properly unnecessary/irrelevant to the grant of probate or theadministration of the Estate.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  For the same reason, D2 should properly have advised D1 against entering into the fee agreements.  In any event, D2 should not haveentered into the said fee agreements.</p>    <p class="heading">Background Facts</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Deceased was, relative to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff (â<i>P1</i>â), the father and, relative to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff (â<i>P2</i>â), the grandfather.  He passed away in August 1933 and left behind 8 sons including P1.  At the time of the writ herein, P1 wasaged 73 and P2 (now a retired general surgeon) was aged 70.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The Deceased owned quite a few pieces of land in the Yuen Long area.  Parts of those land have been resumed by the Government commencingin the 1980's; the major resumptions however took place later in 1989, 1993 and 1995.  Large sums have been paid by the Governmentas a result by way of compensation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Deceased left an English will dated 11 July 1930 and a Chinese codicil dated 4 March 1932.  But administration of the Estatewas not granted until June 1994, more than half a century later.  D2 was the solicitor responsible for obtaining the grant.  Theadministrator's affidavit stated that the gross value of the Estate was $54,000 (and a net principal value of $53,000).  On thatbasis, estate duty and interest thereon was assessed at some $14,600 and paid subsequently.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Although the Deceased left behind the said will and the said codicil, in 1932 he in fact divided his real properties and distributedsome of them among his 8 sons.  However, at the time of the Deceased's death, there were still real properties (fish ponds, paddyfields and houses located in the Tung Shing Lane area in Yuen Long and some properties in the Mainland) which remained undistributed(â<i>the undistributed properties</i>â).  The said codicil provided they were to be held and managed in perpetuity for ancestral worship.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Deceased's descendants gathered to discuss the distribution of the undistributed properties in 1946.  They were grouped into8 âfongsâ which basically were consisted of members coming from the family of each of the Deceased's sons.  The discussion resultedin the execution by the heads of the âfongsâ a document known as the Deed of Family Arrangement or âDFAâ for short.  The1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff is a member of the 8<sup>th</sup>  âfongâ whereas the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff is a member of the 6<sup>th</sup> âfongâ. D1 is a member of the 4<sup>th</sup> âfongâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  By the 1990's, disputes arose among the âfongsâ regarding the validity of the DFA.  Two sets of litigation were instituted in1995 and 1996: one camp of the various âfongsâ contending for its validity whereas the other camp contending otherwise.  Thelatter group argued the undistributed properties (and hence the Government compensation) should be divided equally, instead of beingdistributed as provided for in the DFA.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  There is no direct evidence about the actual motive behind the litigations.  But it is not difficult to imagine that there musthave been increase or decrease in the land value of the undistributed properties respectively held by the âfongsâ between 1945and 1996.  The change in land value would very probably mean some of the âfongsâ would benefit more if the DFA was valid andbinding; the converse would be true for the other âfongsâ if the undistributed properties were to be divided equally.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  One of those civil actions ended in the Court of Final Appeal, which in essence decided that the DFA is valid and enforceable: FACV15/1999 (27 March 2000).  The practical result was that the respective share of each âfongâ was to be valued in accordance withthe DFA.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Three fee agreements were signed by D1 for fees payable to D2.  They were respectively dated 29 November 1994, 7 November 1995 and13 July 2000 (respectively â<i>the Nov 94 agreement</i>â, â<i>the Nov 95 agreement</i>â and â<i>the Jul 00 agreement</i>â and collectively â<i>the said fee agreements</i>â).</p>    <p class="heading">The Said Fee Agreements</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The relevant parts of the said fee agreements are relatively short.  In view of their importance to this action, those parts willbe quoted below.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The Nov 94 agreement provides:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ [D1] hereby agree to [D2's] legal costs (exclusive of disbursements) at <b><i>2% (TWO PERCENT) of the gross value</i></b> of [the Estate], such value to be determined at the time of completion of [D2's] work or distribution of [the Estate] whichever isthe greater payable upon receipt of proceeds of cash compensation or sale proceeds or distribution of the whole or part of [the Deceased's]properties.  The gross value upon which [D2's] legal cost at 2% is based may be agreed â¦ or in default of agreement [be determined]by an independent valuer â¦ â (emphasis supplied).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The Nov 95 agreement provides:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ [D1's] instructions to [D2's] firm to <b><i>check the devolution of title</i></b> of each of the lots and/or portions â¦ and to <b><i>ascertain particulars</i></b> of the various lots comprised in [the Estate] and to instruct surveyors and other professionals to <b><i>ascertain the sizes and areas</i></b> of portions â¦ [D1] hereby agree to [D2's] legal costs (exclusive of disbursements) of [D2] at the rate of HK$5,500.00 per hourfrom 1<sup>st</sup> April, 1992 up to conclusion of this matter subject to a maximum amount of <b><i>2% (TWO PERCENT) of the gross value</i></b> of [the Estate].  The gross value of [the Estate] is to be determined at the time of completion of [D2's] work or distribution of[the Estate] <b><i>whichever is the greater</i></b> payable upon receipt of proceeds of cash compensation or sale of the whole or part of [the Deceased's] properties.  The value fordetermining [D2's] legal cost at 2% may be agreed â¦ or in default of agreement [be determined] by an independent valuer â¦ â(emphasis supplied).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">In October 2000, the words âwhichever is the greaterâ were deleted.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The Jul 00 agreement provides:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â[D1] refer to [the Nov 94 agreement] and [the Nov 95 agreement] and confirm [D1's] agreement with [D2] for determining the valueof the <b><i>gross value</i></b> of [the Estate] for the purpose of calculating the amount of your legal costs at 2% and 2% respectively <b><i>be at HK$1,000,000,000.00</i></b> and that the total of the aforesaid 2% and 2% legal costs payable [D2] from [the Estate] be at HK$40,000,000.00â (emphasis supplied).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">It appears from the evidence there was a basis for valuing the gross value of the Estate at $1 billion.  In any event, no complainthas been raised about this figure <i>per se</i> in this action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The plaintiffs say that the combined effect of the said fee agreements is the Estate is liable to pay to D2 a total sum of $40 million. This in short is denied by the defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  There are numerous points of dispute raised in relation to what the true nature of each of the said fee agreements, such as whetherthey were âfixed feeâ agreements, or whether there was a variation of agreement.  Because I am able to reach a conclusion onthe plaintiffs' claim without the need to determine these points, I will proceed on the assumption that the plaintiffs' contentionregarding the combined effect of the said fee agreements is correct (as a matter of construction based purely on their wordings). This is of course subject to the discussions relating to the availability of taxation of the fees (and the adequacy and appropriatenessof such a remedy).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The said fee agreements were first disclosed to the plaintiffs in 2000.  It is disputed if they were so informed in mid-2000; butthere is no dispute they were informed latest by October 2000.  The exact time of the disclosure is immaterial for present purposes.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  It was confirmed by D2 at trial that no payment had been received by him pursuant to the said fee agreements.</p>    <p class="heading">Were the Fees Charged Excessive and/or Unreasonable?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  As stated in para. 6 above, the whole the plaintiffs' case is premised on the gross and manifest excessiveness of the fees payableunder the said fee agreements.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  It is contended that the total fee payable, which has been agreed to be $40 million, is by itself grossly and manifestly excessive. Further, the agreed rate of payment (that is, 2% of the gross value of the Estate) is also grossly and manifestly excessive.  Thesame applies to the hourly rate of $5,500.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Secondly, the Nov 95 agreement covered work which has already been performed, or work which was irrelevant/unnecessary.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The defendants' defence is common over this aspect.  First, there is no or insufficient evidence of grossly and manifestly excessivefees having been charged.  Secondly, in any event, the fees payable under the said fee agreements are subject to taxation by thecourt and hence cannot possibly be excessive.  Thirdly, the work set out in the Nov 95 agreement was proper work.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(a)     Sufficiency of Evidence</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I agree with the defence that the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that the fees payable under the said fee agreements are <i>grossly and manifestly excessive</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  There is no evidence of what is (or was) the usual (or usual range of) fees actually charged for legal services provided to estates(especially services for obtaining grants) with a gross value in excess of $50 million.  The defence argues that, in the absenceof such evidence, there is no yardstick against which the reasonableness of the amount of fees set out in the said fee agreementscan be measured.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The plaintiffs' response to this argument is simply that there is no need to adduce such evidence.  They say, provided it can beshown:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âby reference to objective criteria, that the fees charged come nowhere near what could be regarded as reasonable remunerationâ(para. 26, plaintiffs' closing submissions in reply),</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">it suffices for present purposes.  They have not identified what the âobjective criteriaâ are.  In this action, the relevant amountspayable under the said fee agreements are:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)     the hourly rate of $5,500;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)     the rate of 2% of the gross value of the Estate; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)     the sum of $40 million. </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">But while some people may consider these sums to be on the high side, there is still no standard to enable a proper assessment tobe made regarding excessiveness.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  There are, however, some materials showing the fees charged in relation to works concerning estates.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  First, there are documents which show that trustee companies usually charge an acceptance fee (which ranges from 1 to 2% on grossasset value), an administration fee (which ranges from 1 to 4% (usually on a descending scale)) and/or a withdrawal fee (which rangesfrom 1 to 1.5%).

Where there is a <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> agreement, if the fees payable under the said fee agreements are nevertheless still subject to ânormalâ taxation (and if theplaintiffs can raise objections thereat), the plaintiffs' case regarding excessive fees fails because, on taxation, the court willonly allow reasonable fees to be charged.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The gist of the defence argument is that, when the solicitor (D2 in this action) has delivered a bill of costs to his client (D1in this action) (despite the existence of a <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> agreement), the taxation provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159">Cap. 159</a> (including the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso) are engaged.  In this connection, the defence asks the court to note the taxation of costs referred to in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso is:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ on <b><i>any</i></b> taxation of costs â¦ â,</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">and not:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âon any taxation of costs ordered by the court pursuant to [the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso] or the court's inherent jurisdictionâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  On the other hand, the plaintiffs argue that, where a <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> agreement has been entered into between solicitor and client, the solicitor's right is governed entirely by contract: <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56(4)</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159">Cap. 159</a>.

The <i>Walton</i> case involved an action brought by a solicitor who has entered into an agreement which was in the nature of a <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> agreement.  The cause of action was based entirely on such an agreement and no bill of costs was delivered (even though earlier therewas a bill of costs which brought about the subsequent execution of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> agreement).  It is also important to note the <i>Walton</i> case was determined as a claim based on a binding agreement to compromise existing rights: p. 1239C.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The defence contends that the true ambit of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso can be ascertained from the other passages of the <i>Rutter</i> case.  First, Lord Evershed said there:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIs [the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso] in the modern legislation â¦  intended to be a qualification on the right of a solicitor to sue on a [s. 56 agreement]and, therefore, intended to give to the court some jurisdiction only to be invoked when a solicitor does so sue, or is it in somesense, and, if so, what, an independent provision? â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">But authorities â¦ which â¦ are binding on this court, have â¦ qualified or put a gloss on the reading of [s. 56(4)] â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">[In <i>Re Palmer</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281890%29%2045%20Ch%20D%20291" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1890) 45 Ch D 291</a>, the] relevant Act was [an equivalent of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56(4)]</a> â¦  The question in that case was whether [the client] â¦ could go behind an agreement which he had made â¦ to pay a lump sumâ¦ to his solicitor â¦  The argument was that an agreement for a lump sum bill could be no bar to the right of a person to havea solicitor's bill of costs taxed â¦  But â¦ this court itself dealt with it on a broader ground â¦ for this is the language ofCotton LJ:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">'Then it is said that, having regard to [s. 56(4)], this agreement ought to be referred to the taxing master.

But, said the lord justice, such a power in the court will not be exercised merely because the clientasks for it â¦ â (pp. 18I to 19B);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIt seems, therefore, to me quite plain that, as a matter of general principle, it is <b><i>not right</i></b> to say that a client who has made an agreement for paying a lump sum â¦ has an <b><i>unqualified right</i></b> to ask for a bill of costs.  His right to require a bill is limited to cases where he can show, on the facts â¦ ,  to the satisfactionof the court that there is something into which, as a matter of general principle or private right or both, the court ought to lookâ(emphasis supplied) (p. 20B-D).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Hence, the limits are concerned with the client's right, not the court's jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  The plaintiffs' second argument under this heading is, even if such a special form of taxation can be ordered, according to the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso, only âthe clientâ can raise objections to the fees.  In relation to the legal work provided to the Estate, only D1 hasbeen D2's client.

In any event, even at common law, they can commence an action for such purpose and join D1 (asthe administrator) if necessary: <i>Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks on Executors, Administrators and Probate</i> (2000) 18<sup>th</sup> Ed., para. 62-34; <i>Gandy v.

If the plaintiffs' argument on the meaning of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss. 67</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">68</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159">Cap. 159</a> be correct, objections relating to <i>locus</i><i> standi</i> to oppose the taxation can be raised.  And the right to object will have to depend on who happens to apply for taxation.  This cannotright.  But even if somehow such a narrow construction should be adopted, the court's power to join necessary parties can adequatelydeal with the matter.  In this connection, the court's power at common law to order a bill of costs to be delivered (declared instatutory form by way of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 65(1)</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159">Cap. 159</a>) should also be noted; a bill of costs may be ordered to be delivered to the affected beneficiaries, if necessary.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Finally, the plaintiffs argue that the taxing master's jurisdiction is more restricted (compared to that in a ânormalâ taxationundertaken pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss. 67</a> and/or 68, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159">Cap. 159</a>) where the taxation involves the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso.  This is because the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso lays down that he has no power to make any determination regarding the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> agreement; what he can do is only to inquire into the facts and certify his findings.  The cancellation of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> agreement and/or the reduction of the fees payable (and/or other consequential directions) can only be ordered by the court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In any event, so the plaintiffs contend, since this court has all the relevant facts before it in this action, this court can dealwith the matter.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Again I disagree.  Whether there is a need to invoke the powers conferred by the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso depends on whether the said fee agreements will be relied on by D2 on taxation (it can be assumed that if he does, they willbe objected to by D1 and/or the plaintiffs).  If D2 does not do so at the taxation initiated by him, there will be no need for thetaxing master to invoke the power conferred by the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso.  If the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso is engaged (because D2 relies on the said fee agreements), even though the prescribed procedure may involve a longer process,there is no basis to say it somehow should affect the court's power to reach a just result.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Hence, irrespective of whether there is a need to invoke that power, the court's powers under the other provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159">Cap. 159</a> (suchas <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss. 67</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">68</a>) to tax bills of costs will not be affected.  A discussion of the taxing master's powers under Ord. 62 (which in many ways are similarto his power to tax non-contentious costs) can be found, for example, in <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2006</i>, para. 62/App/18 to 62/App/27, 62/App/67 and 62/App/74.  In a ânormalâ taxation, the powers of the taxing master are not onlyto assess the quantum of the fees as regards rates of charge and time spent, but also whether it was proper for the work to be done. I do not see any valid reason for thinking somehow he should have less powers over those matters where the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso is engaged.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Secondly, it is incorrect to say all materials necessary for the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by the taxation provisionsof <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159">Cap. 159</a> have been placed before this court.  Upon the plaintiffs' application (which was opposed by the defence) for the questionof quantum to be tried separately from liability, I acceded to that application.  Hence, parties have properly adduced evidence relatedonly to liability in the course of the trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  By reason of the matters set out above, I find that taxation of the fees payable under the said fee agreements is a sufficient answerto the plaintiffs' allegation that the Estate has been made liable to pay excessive fees:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)     <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 68(1)</a> and (2), <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159">Cap. 159</a> ensures the plaintiffs' right to be heard.  To that extent, they will not suffer from any procedural disadvantageby the mere reason that the powers conferred by the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso may be invoked;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)     the taxing master's powers are not adversely affected by the power conferred on him by the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 56</a> proviso.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  In brief, the answers to points (1) and (2) in para. 41 above are in the affirmative and the answer to point (3) is in the negative.</p>    <p class="heading">Were There Breaches of Duties?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Having concluded that no excessive fees can be charged under the said fee agreements, the cornerstone of the plaintiffs' primaryclaim against both defendants is removed.

This caused problems to the 8 âfongsâwhen tenants challenged their legal title;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)    many lawyers have been consulted about the problem since the mid-1970's with no fruitful result;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)     by the 1990's, the general impression of the 8 âfongsâ was that it was difficult (both legally and financially) to obtaina grant of representation of the Estate;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d)    part of the difficulties arose from the lack of title documents relating to some of the properties;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(e)     such a perception of difficulties can be shown by a letter sent by Mr. Lau Yue Sum, a member of the 8<sup>th</sup> âfongâ who is himself a solicitor, representing that obtaining probate would be a very difficult matter;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(f)     there were no funds available in the Estate to meet the expenses needed for obtaining legal services or paying estate duties;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(g)     by around March 1993, when the Government resumption became known, there was an urgency to obtain grant of representationbecause of the statutory time limit to lodge a claim for compensation.  The urgency was also related to the interest payable forthe compensation;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(h)     it was understood by the âfongsâ that the amount of compensation was in terms of millions of dollars;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(i)      in February 1994, D2 successfully obtained a grant of probate of the estate of D1's father for which D1 agreed to a fee of2% of the gross value of the estate;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(j)      between December 1993 and July 1996, D2 successfully negotiated for a reduction of the value of the estate of D1's fatherfor estate duty purposes by 70%.  D2 also successfully negotiated for an increase of the amount of compensation for D1;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(k)     since 1979, all the 8 âfongsâ have been consulting D2 and no other solicitors.  D2 has been advising the family effectivelyfor the last 2 decades;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(l)      in the valuation put forth by Messrs. Vigers to the Estate Duty Office for the Estate, D2 suggested to reduce the valuationfrom about $1.8 million to less than $56,000.  D2 later obtained estate duty clearance in May 1994 based on the low value.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Further to the above, the defence also asks me to note that D2 has up to now not yet been paid by the Estate and the knowledge thatD2 was willing in effect to give a lengthy credit period should be taken into account in deciding this aspect.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  D1 also testified to the effect he had considered the prescribed minimum fees of the Hong Kong Law Society and the usual chargesof the trust companies in Hong Kong before entering into the said fee agreements.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Finally, the defence relies on D2's statement to the effect that, if there is any complaint regarding the fees charged, the mattercan be referred to court for quantification.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  D1 argues that it was reasonable for him to enter into the said fee agreements bearing in mind the matters set out above and thefact that he was only a layman.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  The plaintiffs have made various detailed and forensic criticisms of the matters set out above.  I do not consider it necessaryto repeat them in detail.  In short, it is implicit in the plaintiffs' contentions that, when considering this aspect on an objectivebasis, each of those matters should be considered separately and, when one does so, they are individually inadequate.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  That approach is incorrect.  When looking at the reasonableness of a person's conduct in the context of the surrounding circumstances,it is generally inappropriate to assess the issue assuming that he must analyse the situation with the degree of precision contendedfor by the plaintiffs.  People do not usually act like that in real life.  It should not be taken from the above, however, that Iagree with the plaintiffs that each of the above matters is inadequate.  One or two matters relied upon by D1 may not stand up todetailed scrutiny in their entirety; they have been into account in the overall assessment of this aspect.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Having considered the whole circumstance:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)     the test for determining this issue is more accurately stated by the plaintiffs.  D1's duty is to act as if he was dealingwith his own affairs, and not merely a duty to take reasonable care (as is applicable in ordinary negligence).  The former duty ishigher than the latter (although it may not be a lot higher);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)     applying the higher duty, I do not find D1 to have acted unreasonably in entering into the Nov 94 agreement; hence, I do notfind him to have breached that duty.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Subject to the matters set out below, I do not find anything significant enough to justify a different conclusion as regards the Nov95 agreement or the Jul 00 agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  In relation to the Nov 95 agreement, there is a further attack as regards the propriety of the scope of work.  The plaintiffs arguethat:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)     checking the devolution of title of each of the lots and/or portions;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)     ascertaining particulars of the various lots comprised in the Estate;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)    instructing surveyors and other professionals to ascertain the sizes and areas of portions,</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">were not work properly to be performed by an administrator.  There is no need to give good title to the beneficiaries.  Further, someof the work have in fact been done in other context and/or by other professionals.  For example, work done by Messrs. Vigers relatingto the claim for compensation for the Government resumption.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  D1 puts forth in gist two points in reply.  The first is that, as a layman, he was not in a position to know what work was or wasnot necessary but has to rely on the lawyer about that.  Secondly, the work was needed in connection with the distribution of theEstate.  In the factual context of this action, there was a need to identify the undistributed properties (in distinction to theproperties respectively owned by the 8 âfongsâ).  There was also a disparity between the land boundaries as appeared in the documentsand the actual boundaries which needed to be resolved.  There were other reasons why the work was needed, but in short, the workspecified in the Nov 95 agreement was needed to find out what each âfongâ has already obtained (and what they should still beentitled to as a result), before distribution could properly be carried out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  As regards whether there was double-charging, the arguments set out above (that is, the fees payable are subject to taxation andD1's reliance on D2's view) are equally applicable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  I agree with the defence.  The plaintiffs have over-simplified the work of the defendants in administering the Estate.  They havealso approached the matter almost on the assumption that a lay client when acting as an administrator should be suspicious of workwhich the solicitor has advised should be done.  That cannot be right.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  This cause of action has not been made out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">          (2)     Negligence</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  Insofar as the plaintiffs should rely on negligence as a separate cause of action, the matters set out under the previous sub-headingâ(a)(1) Fiduciary Dutyâ equally applies.  I will not repeat them here.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  I do not find this cause of action has been established.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(b)     Plaintiffs' Case against D2</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  As stated (in para. 5) above, the cause of action against D2 is founded in an alleged breach of fiduciary duty.  The breach is saidto have arisen from:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)     D2 has made a profit out of the assets of the Estate by charging grossly and manifestly excessive fees;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)    D2's failure to advise D1 (in relation to the Nov 95 agreement) the scope of legal work which was necessary (as opposed todesirable) for the due administration of the Estate;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)     D2's failure to advise D1 the appropriate level of fees payable for the services to be provided.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  In relation to para. 86(a) above, it is said that, because he is the intended recipient of the fees payable under the said fee agreementswhile being the only person advising D1, he has placed himself in a position of conflict of interest.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  Bearing in mind it is never part of the plaintiffs' case either defendant has been guilty of the matters referred to in para. 67above, I do not consider the propositions in para. 86(a) and 87 above to have merits.  Charging of fees by the professionals (bethey lawyers, accountants, surveyors or bankers) when they act in essence as fiduciaries is a well recognized exception to the ruleagainst conflict of interest: <i>Re Peregrine Investments Holdings Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%203%20HKC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 3 HKC 1</a>, 10B-C.  Income from professional fees is accepted as a proper reward to the professionals for the services they provide.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  The plaintiffs rely on the <i>Peregrine</i> case and the decision in <i>Mirror Group Newspapers plc v. Maxwell and Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20BCC%20324" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] BCC 324</a> in support of their argument that charging grossly and manifestly excessive fees amounts to a breach of fiduciary duty on which acause of action can be founded.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  I disagree with the argument.  Whatever criticisms the courts might have made regarding professional fees in the decisions in the<i>Peregrine</i> case (for example, at pp. 5-6, 16-17, 22 and 24) or the <i>Maxwell</i> case (for example, at pp. 331 and 346-347), I do not understand the courts to be saying there that merely charging excessive fees<i>per se</i> should amount to a breach of fiduciary duty such as to ground a claim against the intended recipient.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  In relation to the contention summarized in para. 86(b) above, because of the earlier finding that the work cannot be consideredto be unnecessary, it is also rejected as having no merits.  Apart from the matters set out above in support of that finding, I alsoagree with D2's submissions regarding this aspect (set out in D2's closing submissions).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  The contention summarized in para. 86(c) above is rejected.  It has not been established the fees payable are grossly and manifestlyexcessive.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  Finally, I do not agree D2 has knowingly assisted D1 to breach his duties for the simple reason that D1 has not been found to havebreached his duties.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(c)     Informed Consent of the Beneficiaries</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  It is unclear if the plaintiffs put this forward as a separate and independent cause of action.  Insofar as they do, I do not findthat this has any merit.  I agree with the defence that, if the defendants have not breached any of the duties contended for by theplaintiffs, the lack of consultation does not add anything to the plaintiffs' claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  I also agree with the defence that informed consent may in appropriate cases be raised as an additional defence to a claim of breachof duties.  This point, however, does not arise in the present factual context.</p>    <p class="heading">Should D1 be Removed?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  This aspect is based essentially on the plaintiffs' case that D1 has breached his duties as an administrator.  Because I have foundthat this has not been established, this claim also fails.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  The plaintiffs also argue that hostility between the trustee and the beneficiaries can be a ground for removing the trustee.  Thisargument is premised on their case concerning excessive fees and should therefore also fail.</p>    <p class="heading">Should D1 be Barred from Claiming Remuneration?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  This matter originates from D1's letter dated 24 October 2000 in which he sought the plaintiffs' view regarding his intention toclaim remuneration for the work he had performed as administrator of the Estate (at 1% of the gross value of the Estate).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  The dispute between the plaintiffs and D1 is whether this is the proper forum to determine that issue.  The plaintiffs say yes whereasD1 says otherwise.  In essence, the plaintiffs submit that it is an exception to allow remuneration to an administrator.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  D1 argues that the appropriate time to consider the matter would be after the completion of the administration of the Estate.  Thisis because only then will it be known for certain the nature and amount of work performed by him.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  Further, it is only when D1 has decided whether he wishes to make such a claim that he will adduce evidence to substantiate theclaim.  Because he has not decided yet, there is no such evidence before this court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  I agree with D1.  I also agree that, since the court's jurisdiction to allow remuneration is set out in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 60</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/10">Cap. 10</a>, it is arguable whether the decisions in the UK, where the powers are founded in inherent jurisdiction, are applicable toHong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  For those reasons, I disagree with the plaintiffs regarding this aspect.</p>    <p class="heading">Other Matters</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  The following matters are stated below to avoid any doubt.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  Regarding the credibility of the defence witnesses, subject to any express findings made herein to the contrary, I accept theirtestimony to be truthful and reliable.  In assessing credibility in order to make a finding of fact, the tests adopted for such assessmentare as those stated in the judgment of <i>Star Glory Investment Ltd. v. Kai Tuo (H.K.) Technologies Co. Ltd. and Others,</i> HCA 3523/2002:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe assessment of a witness's credibility and/or reliability is a task frequently undertaken by the court in litigation (in fact,very often an essential task).  I consider the following to be the appropriate test to adopt:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">'There are two objective tests for assessing a witness's credibility regarding a matter to which he has testified:-</p>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(a) whether that part of his testimony is inherently plausible or implausible;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(b) whether that part of his testimony is, in a material way, contradicted by other evidence which is undisputed or indisputable (anexample often given of such evidence is contemporaneous documents).</p>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">Further, where it is shown that a witness has been discredited over one or more matters to which he has testified (using the abovetests), this fact is relevant to the assessment of his overall credibility.  Likewise, regard may be had to a witness's motive fordeliberately not giving truthful testimony.  For example, telling the truth may prejudice his interest, or a just determination ofthe litigation may affect his interest'.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(See, for example, the decisions in <i>Chiu Chi Tong v. Lau Chong Sai</i> HCA 765/2002 (para. 28) and <i>Yu Ming Investment Ltd. v. Pang Ru Chuan, Richard</i> HCA 814/2002 (para. 13))â.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Any testimony of the plaintiffs which is inconsistent with the above is rejected.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  Although not all the points made by the parties (whether set out in their respective written submissions or verbally during thehearing) have been expressly referred to above, I have considered them.  Subject to indications to the contrary, and insofar as itmay be necessary to so decide (further to what has expressly been stated in the above paragraphs), I prefer the points made by thedefence to those made by the plaintiffs which have not been expressly dealt with above.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  Two additional matters are worthy of consideration (set out below).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(a)     D2's Statement Regarding Taxation</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  It is the defence case that, before the Nov 94 agreement was entered into, D1 was advised by D2 that if the fees payable were complainedto be unreasonable, the matter could be referred to court for quantification.  This has been referred to in the closing submissionsas âthe Assuranceâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  In a ruling made on 12 July 2005, I found that this had been admitted by the plaintiffs in their reply (especially in para. 5 thereof). In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs contend that there are two inconsistencies:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)     D1 testified to the effect that the complaints against the fees could include complaints by the other beneficiaries of theEstate whereas D2 testified that the complaint should come from D1;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)     D1 testified to the effect that the Assurance was an advice given to him by D2 but D2 testified that the Assurance was notonly an advice, but also a term of the said fee agreements or a collateral agreement thereto.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">The plaintiffs say that the inconsistencies show that the defendants are untruthful.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  I do not agree.  As correctly pointed out by the defence, the Assurance took place a long time ago and any difference in recollectioncould well have been the result of imperfect memories (which I find to be the reason for the âinconsistenciesâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  The absence of the Assurance from the said fee agreements (or any documents of a contemporaneous nature) is also relied upon insupport of the attack on credibility.  I have taken this into account when assessing the credibility of this part of the defencetestimony.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  However, I accept the plaintiffs' submission that the Assurance was in the nature of an advice rather than something with contractualforce.  But this finding does not affect the outcome of this action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(b)     Delay in Taxation</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  The plaintiffs also argue that, because of the delay in proposing taxation of the fees, the defendants are disentitled from claimingtaxation should be the preferred remedy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  The argument is difficult to comprehend.  First, this is not a case where the plaintiffs have agreed to taxation of the fees uponthe remedy being proposed by the defence.  The claim that the fees payable are gross and manifestly excessive is maintained throughout,despite the proposal to tax having been made.  In pursuing that claim, it is part of the plaintiffs' arguments that taxation is unavailableas a matter of law and, in any event, the remedy is inadequate (for the reasons set out above).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  Second, delay in proposing taxation of fees has not been put forth as a breach of duty either in equity or in tort.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  I have however taken into account the delay when assessing the credibility of the defence witnesses.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  The plaintiffs' claims sought in the writ are dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs Order <span style="font-style:normal">Nisi</span></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  There is no apparent reason to depart from the usual rule that costs should follow the event.
