The plaintiff did not attend. Apparently she had to attend the Family Court at the same time in connectionwith the divorce proceedings. In her absence, the adjourned hearing was fixed to be heard on 4 January 2007.

On 16 October 2006, Master Lung adjourned both summonses for argument. The plaintiff appealedagainst the Order.

In addition, the plaintiff complainsthat the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had provided mortgage finance to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in the purchase of the Belleve Court Property and had thereby condoned the cohabitation of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and Mr Lau.</p>    <p class="heading">The 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs striking out application</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs application to strike out the Statement of Claim was made under Order 18 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/527/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 19</a> of RHC and also pursuant to the Courtâs inherent jurisdiction. It is the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs case that the Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable cause of action against it, is frivolous and vexatious and/or is an abuse of the process of the Court.

As the Deputy Judge had noted, it is only in plain and obvious cases that the Court will exerciseits summary power to strike out a pleading and dismiss an action.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  It is the duty of a plaintiff to state in his Statement of Claim a reasonable cause of action. By that, it means, a cause of actionwith some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleading are considered: <i>Drummond-Jackson v. British Medical Association</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%201%20WLR%20688" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 1 WLR 688.</a>  In the present case, the Statement of Claim only contained the headings and amounts of the plaintiffâs monetary claim. It didnot give any particulars as to the reason or basis for suing the defendants. It simply did not disclose what the plaintiffâs causeof action was, let alone a reasonable cause of action. For this reason alone, the Statement of Claim is liable to be struck out.It should be noted that when considering whether the Statement of Claim should be struck out for not disclosing a reasonable causeof action, the Court is only permitted to look at the pleading and cannot consider the affidavit evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  As to the other grounds on which the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant made its striking out application, it is permissible to look at the affidavit evidence to discern what is the plaintiffâscase against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  In summary, there are two main planks in the plaintiffâs claim. The first is vicarious liability. The second is themortgage that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had granted to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant for the purchase of the Belleve Court Property.  We will deal with them in turns.  </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Under the common law, in order to mount a claim in vicarious liability, not only must there be an employer-employee relationship,but it must also be shown that the torts of the employee were committed in the course of the employeeâs course of employment. Whethera wrongful act is within the course of employment is ultimately a question of fact. Generally, an act is deemed to be done in thecourse of employment if it is a wrongful act authorised by the employer, or a wrongful and unauthorised mode of doing some act authorisedby the employer: see <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>, 19<sup>th</sup> edition, paras.6-25 &amp; 6-26.    </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  For the purpose of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs striking out application, it is not necessary to consider whether the plaintiff will be able to make out a case intort against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  Assuming that the plaintiff will be able to show that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had committed some torts or wrongful acts in law, it must also be shown that these acts were committed in the course ofthe 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs employment with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. From the affidavits and materials that the plaintiff had put before the court, there is nothing to indicate that whateveracts the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had done in relation to Mr Lau and/or the plaintiff, they were authorised by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant or could be said to be a mode of doing acts authorised by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  We agree with the Deputy Judge that whatever had developed and happened between the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and Mr Lau, they were personal matters and did not involve the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in its capacity as the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs employer.  There is no perceivable connection between the alleged wrongful acts of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and her employment with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The plaintiff argues that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has a duty in law to sort out problems of its employees, including family problems, and is further under a legal duty todisallow improper relationship to develop among its employees and/or within its employeesâ families. The plaintiff further arguesthat despite being repeatedly informed of the situation, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had done nothing to stop the alleged wrongful acts of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. We do not accept these arguments. We see no legal basis for saying that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as an employer or otherwise is under a legal duty to sort out the matter between Mr Lau and the plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and/or to take any action about it. The plaintiffâs claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant insofar as it is based on vicarious liability is unsustainable and bad in law.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  As to the mortgage the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant granted to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, it was a contractual and commercial arrangement between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant merely acted as a financier for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. The creation of the mortgage does not constitute any wrongful act or legal wrong that the law recognises and providesa remedy. It matters not that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant knew or ought to have known that Mr Lau was married to the plaintiff when granting the mortgage to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, as mortgagee, is not involved in and cannot be held legally liable for the use put to the mortgaged property by the mortgagor.The plaintiffâs claim insofar as it relies on the provision of the mortgage is also unsustainable and bad in law.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  In the circumstances, the plaintiffâs claim is frivolous and vexatious and amounts to an abuse of the court process.  For thisreason as well, the Statement of Claim should be struck out and the action dismissed as against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.             </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Upon the action against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant being dismissed, the plaintiffâs summons dated 20 September 2006 insofar as it related to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would have to fall away.</p>    <p class="heading">Chung Jâs Order dated 10 November 2006</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  We now turn to the grounds of appeal advanced by the plaintiff.  The first relates to the Order of Chung J made on 10 November 2006.The matter before Chung J was the appeal against Master Lungâs Order of 16 October 2006.  Accordingly, the subject matter of theChung Jâs Order of adjournment is just the appeal. The plaintiff is misconceived when she argues that it amounts to a general adjournmentand that the case of HCA1819/2006 has been adjourned and should not be proceeded with.     </p>    <p class="heading">The fixing of date for the adjourned hearing of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs striking out summons</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The plaintiffâs second major complaint relates to the fixing of the date for the adjourned hearing of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs striking out application. The complaint probably stems from the plaintiffâs misunderstanding or lack of understandingof the civil litigation practice and procedure. In accordance with the usual practice and procedure, when an application or summonsis adjourned for argument to a date to be fixed, the party that initiates the application or summons will write to the other party(copied to the court) inviting him to go before the listing officer of the court to fix the hearing date on the date and time indicatedin the letter. This is known as a listing appointment. The applying party needs not, and he usually will not, consult the other partybefore naming the date and time for the listing appointment. If the other party intends to appear at the listing appointment, butfinds the date and time named inconvenient, he may request to reschedule the listing appointment. Although this will usually be accommodated,especially if there is a genuine and good reason for the request, it does not amount to procedural irregularity if the listing appointmentproceeds as scheduled and the hearing date is fixed in the absence of some of the parties.              </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  In the present case, the plaintiff contends that there should be bilateral arrangement to fix date. As explained above, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs solicitors are not obliged to consult the plaintiff before naming a date and time for the listing appointment. TheOrder of Master Ho given on 20 September 2006 also did not mandate the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to consult the plaintiffâs availability before naming the date and time for the listing appointment. The plaintiff alsoclaims that she had explained in âBatch 2â of her affidavit dated 25 September 2006 of the time clash between the listing appointmentand the ancillary relief hearing in her divorce proceedings. The Court does not have record of an affidavit dated 25 September 2006. The plaintiff had sent to the Court a document dated 26 September 2006 entitled âPlaintiff answering 1<sup>st</sup> named Defendantâs interrogatories dated 21/09/2006â enclosing, among other documents, an order in FCMC11418/2004 which providedfor the ancillary relief disputes to be heard at 11am on 28 September 2006.  However, in the document, the plaintiff did not expresslypoint to the time clash.  Be that as it is, the fact that the hearing date was fixed in the plaintiffâs absence is not a proceduralirregularity that would invalidate the hearing before Master Yu and/or his Order. It is unfortunate that the listing appointmentclashed with the hearing in the Family Court, but that does not lead to the conclusion that there was a conspiracy to injure theplaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  What is important is that the plaintiff does not dispute that she had been informed and was fully aware of the hearing date of 4January 2007, and that she consciously decided not to attend the hearing. It was not because she was otherwise engaged or unavailablethat she was absent. Apart from her own fear of a conspiracy, the plaintiff has not given any other reason for being absent.  Inthe circumstances, she cannot complain of injustice when the hearing was held as scheduled and an order was made in her absence.It is within the Masterâs discretion and power to decide whether to proceed with a hearing when one party is absent. The fact thatshe could not attend the listing appointment and the hearing date was fixed in her absence does not afford her a ground of appeal. Neither does the fact that Master Yu proceeds to hear and determine the merits of the applications before him amount to a groundfor overturning his Order.  The references to the various provisions in RHC and the Bills of Rights Ordinance and the Basic Law areirrelevant and do not assist the plaintiff. </p>    <p class="heading">The Order dated 4 January 2007</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The plaintiffâs complaints about the sealed order for the hearing on 4 January 2007 probably also result from a misunderstandingand lack of understanding of the practice and procedure. Firstly, although it was a hearing adjourned from 20 September 2006, theOrder of the 4 January 2007 hearing will not recite nor make reference to the hearing of 20 September 2006. A separate Order forthe hearing on 20 September 2006 had already been sealed.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Secondly, after Master Ho adjourned the plaintiffâs summons dated 18 September 2006 to 4 October 2006 for the plaintiff to effectservice on the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, there was no need for the plaintiff to file another summons (which will amount to an issue of a fresh summons) seekingidentical relief, but stating the new/ adjourned hearing date.  What she was only required to do was to serve the summons dated 18September 2006 on the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant together with a covering letter or note indicating the new/ adjourned hearing date. When she proceeded on 22 September2006 to file a new document dated 20 September 2006, the plaintiff had indeed issued a fresh summons. The plaintiff says she couldnot be blamed for filing the second summons dated 20 September 2006 because she was acting in person and had no assistance. Notwithstandingthis, the fact remains that that there were two summonses before the court that were dated differently, but seeking identical relief. At the same time, the plaintiff did not attend court to argue her summons. Accordingly, it is open to the Master to dismiss thesecond summons.  It is also not an error for the Order dated 4 January 2007 to recite in the opening part: âUPON â¦ the applicationof the plaintiff by way of summons filed on 22 September 2006â.  </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Thirdly, in respect of the hearing before the Registrar on 4 October 2006, the court file shows that Registrar Chan had endorsedon the plaintiffâs summons dated 20 September 2006 that it was adjourned for hearing to 4 January 2007 at 2:30 p.m. after the hearingof the application by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and that costs were reserved. It is therefore not the case that the hearing on 4 January 2007 only related to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs striking out application. Accordingly, on 4 January 2007, Master Yu was not in error when he went on to deal with theplaintiffâs summons dated 20 September 2006 and to make an order on it. The Second Affirmation of Fung Kam Sing is an affirmationof service of the 1<sup>st</sup>  defendantâs striking out summons and the notice of the date of the adjourned hearing. It is plainly relevant and should be readby Master Yu and recited in the sealed order, especially when the plaintiff was absent at the hearing. In short, there is no substancein the plaintiffâs ground of appeal relating to the Order dated 4 January 2007.</p>    <p class="heading">The Decision and Order of 6 March 2007</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The plaintiff also complains that the Order of 6 March 2007 did not recite or refer to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs skeleton submissions, although the Deputy Judge had read and relied on them. The short answer to this is that generallyan order only recites the relevant documents filed with the court that had been considered by the court. It is not the practice torecite the skeleton submissions lodged by the parties. There is nothing irregular for the Order dated 6 March 2007 not to recitethe 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs skeleton submissions.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Further, it is incorrect for the plaintiff to suggest that the Deputy Judgeâs Decision is identical to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs skeleton submissions. It is not. To the extent that the Deputy Judge agreed and accepted the arguments and legal propositionsput forward by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, it is entirely appropriate for him to adopt the submissions. It is not a cause for complaint or a ground of appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  We also do not agree with the plaintiff that the Deputy Judge had misquoted or distorted what she said in her affidavits, especiallyin connection with her basis or reasons for claiming against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  </p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  For the above reasons, the appeal against the Order striking out the Statement of Claim and dismissing the action against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant fails. Similarly, there are no merits in the appeal against the Order dismissing the plaintiffâs summons dated 20 September2006. Accordingly, we dismiss the plaintiffâs appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  On the costs of the appeal, the plaintiff argues that they should be paid out of public funds. She says it is because her claimcarries importance for the legal system of Hong Kong and its role as an international financial centre and that she is pursuing theappeal on behalf of the public. We see no basis for the argument. There is no proper ground to depart from the normal rule of costsfollow event. We therefore make an order that the plaintiff pays the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant the costs of this appeal to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="1" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Robert Tang)<br />            Vice President</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(C Chu)<br />                Judge of Court of First Instance</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">The plaintiff, unrepresented, appeared in person.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Miss Winnie Tsui instructed by Messrs JSM for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, unrepresented, in attendance.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2008/108.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
