It is further alleged that of the appliances thereunder supplied some 10,656 toasters, 78 knives,72 mixers and 186 can openers were "neither fit for their purpose nor of merchantable quality (within the meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s16</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26" class="autolink_findacts">Sale of Goods Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26">Cap. 26</a>)"; and that the defendant had "failed to provide any or adequate spare parts components or cartons to enable normal repairsto be conducted in the United Kingdom" as was required by a term in the contracts. The statement of claim then sets out an unsuccessfulattempt to compromise, in the course of which some of the items mentioned above were returned by the plaintiff to Hong Kong, wherethe defendant continues to retain them. In the final paragraph are claimed damages for breach of contract, and further and in thealternative, trespass to goods, conversion and detinue. Particulars of the loss and damage are liquidated to a total sum of ?6, 122.15.The prayer claims damages in that amount, damages generally, interest and costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> A defence was filed in June. Although denying in general that the appliances supplied were defective, save as to those already returned,which it blamed a customer abuse rather than manufacturing fault, the main issue raised was that no transaction had taken place betweenthe plaintiff and defendant prior to a date probably a little before 8th March 1989. It is suggested in argument, as it was apparentlyat all stages below:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(a)</td>            <td width="89%">                that all sales prior to that date were between the plaintiff and a particular company in United Kingdom, for whichthe plaintiff incurred no liability, albeit the company was its wholly owned subsidiary; (It is not accepted, as both the masterand the judge perhaps having regard to a document dated 2nd February 1986, not surprisingly found, that at all times before 8th March1989 the U.K. company had authority to act as agent of the defendant.) and                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(b)</td>            <td width="89%">that the defective items derive entirely from those earlier transactions.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Order 14 proceedings in general form were initiated in October last year, supported by affidavits from the general manager of theplaintiff, which did little more than repeat the statement of claim, and from the solicitor for the plaintiff, who exhibited variousletters and faxes. An affirmation from Mr. W.L. Wan, the managing director of the defendant, merely confirmed the formal defencefiled earlier. The master after hearing counsel for both sides, gave leave to defend the claim in tort, with directions in the eventthe claim were pursued, but ordered that "interlocutory judgment be entered in favour of the Plaintiff for damages to be assessedpursuant to paragraph 5 of the Statement of Claim". His reasons, recorded in a note taken by the solicitor for the plaintiff, canbe shortly put as "bad pleading; good case". In particular he was satisfied "that contractual liability made out. Was an agreementbetween parties". By that we understand him to mean that he was satisfied, as it were on a preliminary point of law, that the defendantwas party to all the contracts alleged.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The note as to quantum of damages is too obscure to be helpful. But the fact that the master ordered damages to be assessed wouldindicate that he was not satisfied that they were indisputably due as claimed. That is by no means surprising. Even after furtheraffidavits were filed for the purpose of an appeal to Hooper, J., the evidence remained entirely inadequate. As to the appliancesother than the toasters, there was no evidence at all; and that in relation to the toaster themselves was vague and unspecific. Itis to be observed that at no time was a surveyor's report put forward, either with regard to those appliances admittedly returnedto Hong Kong or to those said still to be stored in England.</p>    <p style="text-align:center"> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> But what the master appears to have overlooked is that his approach sits uncomfortably, indeed impossibly, with the reference inhis order to paragraph 5 of the statement of claim, which pre-supposes that all the appliances in question were defective by reasonof manufacturing faults and that judgment for the liquidated sum claimed ought therefore to have been awarded. Hooper, J, dismissedthe appeal of the plaintiff, highlighting the difficulty we have mentioned by express findings of fact.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> With respect to those who earlier advised the plaintiff, in our view the Order 14 application was misconceived. By that order a plaintiffmay obtain summary judgment on the ground that the defendant has no defence to a claim included in the writ. He may obtain similarjudgment with respect to "any particular part of such claim", but the notes to the Rules of the Supreme Court at paragraph 14/1/7indicate that this can only be where the parts in question can be clearly identified, and must be so identified in the summons. Itis immaterial that the defendant admits liability in general: see <u>Associated Bulk Carriers Ltd v. Koch Snipping Inc</u> [1978] 2 All E R at 254, an authority to which Mr. Oderberg, who now appears for the plaintiff, very properly draws our attention.Thus in the present instance, once it is accepted, as Mr. Oderberg felt bound to concede, that the plaintiff cannot establish thateach and every appliance in question was defective due to a manufacturing fault, it is apparent that Order 14 proceedings were inappropriate.</p>    <p>          </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> That they were so can be illustrated by the hypothesis that the master who eventually entertains the assessment of damages comesto the conclusion, perhaps unlikely in the circumstances but not necessarily so, that no recoverable damage has been proved. Thatconclusion in a normal trial would mean dismissal of the claim. But here judgment has already been entered in the plaintiff's favour.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> For these reasons we allow the appeal and set aside the order of the judge below. We make an order nisi that the defendant have itscosts here, below and before the master.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(Sir Derek cons)<br />            Vice President</td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(K.T.
