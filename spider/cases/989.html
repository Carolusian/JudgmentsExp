The guarantee was given by the plaintiff and the defendantjointly and severally.

The question whether [the equivalentof our <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> of Chapter 388] applies to a claim for contribution between co-sureties is one on which the textbooks appear to take different views."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> His Lordship did not himself express a view.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> <strong>Halsbury</strong>, at paragraphs 255 and 278, says "It is not clear whether [Chapter 377] applies to claims between co-guarantors.".</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Although in its broadest sense, "damage" means loss ( the root is the Latin "damnum" meaning "loss"), it is clear that the Law Commission(Report 79; March 9, 1977; paragraph 29), when recommending the changes in the law brought about by the statute, did not intend thatthe word "damage" should cover debt, and recommended that the law regarding contribution between persons jointly liable for the samedebt, such as joint guarantors, should remain unchanged.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In <strong>Goff and Jones;</strong> <em>The Law of Restitution, Fourth Ed.</em>, at page 305, the authors express the belief that the statute does not apply "where persons are jointly liable for the same debt",as with co-obligors, such as co-sureties.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> At page 771, it is said -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Any claim for contribution which arises from a contract between two parties will be barred after six years, since it is an action"founded on simple contract" . . . Not all contribution claims, however, depend on contract. Indeed the genesis of the right of contributionin equity was . . . unjust enrichment, and contribution between co-obligors, such as co-sureties, were sustained even though therewas no contract between them. In these circumstances [the equivalent of our <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4</a> of Chapter 347] would appear to be inapplicable, unless it could be said that, as soon as the claim lies, a debt arises between theparties. This reasoning is artificial, and it may be more attractive to hold that the equitable doctrine of laches should apply.It is an open question whether equity will then follow the analogy of [section 4 of Chapter 347], when the limitation period is sixyears, or [section 6 of Chapter 347] . . ."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> It seems to me that, as things appear now, neither <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4</a> nor <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> of Chapter 347 apply, by their terms, to the plaintiff's action. In this case, as the authors of <em>The Law of Restitution</em> suggest, it may that one or the other should be applied by analogy. Or, perhaps not. To some extent, laches does not depend onlyon delay, but the effect of the delay on the defendant's position. This is a matter of evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> This is not a question, in my view, that should be decided on an application under Order 14.</p>    <p class="heading">Non-joinder</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Another complaint by the defendant is that the plaintiff has failed to join the principal debtor in the action.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> In this respect, Mr Poll relies on <strong>Hay v Carter</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1935%5d%201%20Ch%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1935] 1 Ch 397</a>, in which Lord Hanworth MR said, at page 405 -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Now the upshot of all this appears to be that the rule in <em>Lawson v Wright</em> [in which the Master of the Rolls said that, the insolvency of the principal debtor not having been proved, he would have refusedrelief if the principal debtor had not been made a party to the action] must be affirmed and applied but that its observance canbe avoided if there is evidence that no useful purpose would be served by having the principal debtor before the Court by reasonof his insolvency."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> In a defence dated 17 September 1986, the plaintiff stated that the principal debtor offered to pledge its assets as security forthe debt, that the principal debtor had a contract "which in the course of one year can pay off the debt with interest" and thathe and the principal debtor had offered to pay the debt by instalments of nearly $15,000 per month. The defendant held 51% issuedshares in the principal debtor, which were transferred to the defendant. As the result of judgment by Barnett J. delivered on 13March 1991, the defendant was compensated, Mr Coleman told me, in the sum of $176,000 in respect of these shares; this being theirvaluation on a net asset value basis. So it appears that, when this compensation was assessed, the net asset value of the principaldebtor was something like $345,000. Although it seems that the principal debtor was in financial difficulties, it is not clear thatit was insolvent. It is certainly not clear that "no useful purpose would be served by having the principal debtor before the Court".On the contrary, it seems that, at some time after 13 March 1991, the principal debtor had sufficient net assets to pay the wholeof the debt due. It may be, of course, that the situation has changed since then, but this is matter that should be investigatedat trial, as should the question of why it is that the principal debtor has not been proceeded against by the plaintiff earlier,and whether the defendant has been prejudiced by this.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> In any event, these are matters that can be properly decided only at trial.</p>    <p class="heading">Other Defences</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The defendant has raised other defences. He raised, as well as the point of time-bar, "inducement by representation" and estoppelbefore the Master, and he has raised, as well as the point of non-joinder, matters of laches and undue influence before me. In viewof my findings on the limitation and joinder points dealt with above, it is unnecessary to deal with these other defences here. Iwill say that, taking into account the findings of Barnett J. in the trial concerning the parties in 1990 and 1991, one of whichwas that "[the plaintiff] could manipulate [the defendant] as he pleased", that, in his defence to the action by the bank, the defendantsaid that ". . . the responsibility of guarantor at the [bank] has been already been assumed by me personally", and the unexplaineddelay, between 15 August 1986 and 6 April 1988, when the plaintiff paid the bank, and December 1992, when the plaintiff issued hissummons against the defendant, there may well be other defences to the plaintiff's claim that should be fully investigated at trial.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> In the result, the judgment against the defendant cannot stand. It is set aside, and the defendant is given unconditional leave todefend. On the face of it, there seems no reason why costs should not follow the event. Accordingly, I make an order <em>nisi</em> that the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <div style="text-align:center">        <center>            <table border="0" width="100%">                <tr>                    <td width="50%"></td>                    <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">JK FINDLAY</td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="50%"></td>                    <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">Judge of the High Court</td>                </tr>            </table>        </center>    </div>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Russell Coleman, instructed by Messrs Robert WH Wang &amp; Co, for the plaintiff.</p>        <p>Mr Michael Poll, instructed by Messrs Robin Bridge &amp; John Liu, for the defendant.</p>        <p> </p>        <p> </p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/1995/346.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
