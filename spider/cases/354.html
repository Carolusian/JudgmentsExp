As I understand the note of his judgment, thejudge rested his decision on the grounds that the Hague Rules were incorporated, that the time limit under those rules had expiredand that there was no jurisdiction to extend the time once that time limit had expired.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The facts</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The Plaintiffs, Kalimantan Timbers Co. (the Appellants before us), sued the defendant shipowners in respect of the loss of cargoin the King Dragon I. We now know that the action is brought upon a bill of lading dated 2nd February 1978 and executed in Singapore.This was in fact intended to replace a bill of lading issued in Indonesia in exchange for mate's receipts. That bill was negotiatedto the Plaintiffs' bank in Singapore. The substitution was made to avoid "delay experienced in processing shipping documents forshipments from Indonesia to Hong Kong". The new bill of lading provided that "this bill of lading shall be construed and governedby English law". Condition 1 was, so far as was material, in these terms:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="10%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">          "If at the place of shipment of the goods there is in force any Statute Ordinance or Law controlling or restricting thefree right to contract for the carriage of goods by sea the Statute Ordinance or Law shall if so provided on the front hereof bedeemed to be incorporated in this Bill of Lading and to override any terms conditions or exceptions herein that may be in conflicttherewith.</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">          If at the place of shipment of the goods no such Statute Ordinance or Law is in force, the Bill of Lading shall be subjectto the rules contained in the Schedule to the Statute of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland entitled the Carriageof Goods by Sea Act 1924 [the Hague Rules], and the carrier shall be entitled to the benefit of the provisions contained in Clauses2,5 and 6(2) of the said Act in the same manner as he would have been entitled if the said Act had applied to this Bill of Lading."</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">The voyage was from a port in Indonesia to Hong Kong, but, one day out, the vessel sank on 5th February 1978 with the loss of allthe cargo. The notify party was named as Cosmos Enterprise Corporation Ltd., the party it was sought to join as 2nd Plaintiff. Theaction was brought on 20th May 1978 and an application to join Cosmos - to which, of course, the consent of Cosmos had necessarilybeen obtained - was granted on 5th October 1978. The Registrar ordered that the writ be re-served and that the appearance which hadbeen entered should stand as an appearance against Kalimantan only. Under 0.20 r.9 the Plaintiffs should have amended the writ inaccordance with that order within fourteen days, but they failed to do so. On 24th January 1979 they applied for an enlargement oftime to 10th February 1979 for amendment of the writ. The return date was 7th February 1979 and the summons was endorsed "Estimatedtime: not exceeding 3 minutes". It must have been apparent that that estimate could not be right unless the application were unopposedand it would seem that the Plaintiffs assumed it would be unopposed. They were mistaken, for on 6th February the Defendants' solicitors,who had on the previous day written a letter which (as it seems to me) questioned the propriety of the order for joinder, gave noticethat they were instructed to contend that there was "no justification for the court to exercise its discretion in favour of the Plaintiff":they said they anticipated that the argument would take half an hour and enquired whether the Plaintiffs would agree to "such anadjournment". By that I think they must have meant such an adjournment as would inevitably be ordered as soon as the Registrar learnedthat the application could not be disposed of within approximately three minutes. This was not, as Mr. Litton has submitted, a requestfor consent to an adjournment to accommodate the Defendants, but, in effect, a request for an admission that the length of the hearingof the application had been wrongly estimated. When the case was called on before the Registrar, it was adjourned by consent to adate to be fixed. It was apparently appreciated that, if the date fixed were subsequent to 10th February, an order in terms of thesummons could not be made, but the summons was not amended. It was not appreciated that any time limit for bringing suit againstCosmos might expire before the application was heard. Not until 9th March was a new date fixed and it was then fixed for 3rd April.On that date the Registrar made his order extending the time. It is not now disputed that before 3rd April 1979 one year must haveelapsed from "the date when the goods should have been delivered".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> It may assist in understanding all that is involved if I indicate how it came about that the application to join Cosmos was made.Kalimantan sued "as owners of cargo and/or the holders and/or endorsees of bills of lading". It would seem that they had insuredthe cargo with the People's Insurance Co. of Malaya Ltd. Kalimantan sold the cargo to Cosmos and the new bill of lading was endorsedby Kalimantan to the Chartered Bank and by the Chartered Bank to the Hang Lung Bank Ltd., Cosmos's bank. Cosmos signed a letter ofsubrogation in respect of all their rights and remedies relating to this cargo in favour of the insurers, who had presumably receiveda similar letter from Kalimantan, because the Plaintiffs' solicitors say that their instructions in the matter came from the insurers.What precisely the respective rights of Kalimantan and Cosmos are alleged to be we do not know, but the Registrar who made the orderfor joinder must have been satisfied that Kalimantan had shown the existence of a question to be decided which fell within 0.6 r.2(b)(ii).The Plaintiffs' solicitors say that they delayed "filing the amended writ of summons" until they had received confirmation from theDefendants' solicitors that they had instructions to accept service of the amended writ. The Notice of Appeal before us incorrectlyrecites that Mr. Registrar Barnett ordered on 3rd April 1979 that Cosmos be added as 2nd Plaintiff. That order was made on 5th October1978 and there has been no appeal against it. The error originated in the Defendant's Notice of Appeal dated 20th April 1979 to thejudge in chambers, which similarly mis-states the terms of the order of 3rd April 1979. It would have saved this court a great dealof trouble had the order been included in the appeal record, as it ought to have been included.</p>    <p align="left"><u>Are the Hague Rules applicable?</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The answer to this must depend upon Condition 1 of the bill of lading, the terms of which I have already set out. There is no directevidence whether at the place of shipment there was in force "any Statute Ordinance or Law controlling or restricting the free rightto contract for the carriage of goods by sea". The learned judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "It was argued that the defendant should have adduced evidence that no Indonesian law applied. I agreed with the defendant'scounsel that the defendant was entitled to assume, in the absence of any other evidence, that Indonesian law is the same as thatof Hong Kong."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Mr. Litton submits that it was wrong to make that assumption and that there was an onus on the Defendant to prove that there was nosuch law in Indonesia as was contemplated by the condition. Whether the assertion by the solicitor that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "By the terms of the Bill of Lading exhibited as 'DAF-8' to the Affidavit of David Alastair Fraser filed herein on the 1stMarch, 1979, the Hague Rules applied to the Contract of Carriage evidenced thereby."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">is to be taken as impliedly asserting that the law of Indonesia was the same as that of England is immaterial, because there was noindication that the solicitor was qualified to speak to the law of Indonesia.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In my judgment Cons, J. came to the right conclusion on this point.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> It is then argued that the Rules may nevertheless not be applicable by reason of a deviation and that it would be wrong at this stageto assume that, if the Rules would otherwise apply, they can necessarily be relied upon by the Defendant: the possibility of a deviationwould be a matter for enquiry at the trial. We are told that the judge rejected this argument because there was no evidence beforehim that deviation or other fundamental breach was in issue. Mr. Mills-Owens contended not only that it was for the Plaintiffs toshow that a prima facie case of fundamental breach could be made out, but also that, even if that were wrong, the immunity couldbe claimed in spite of a fundamental breach, that being the true interpretation of Article III r.6. As I understand <u>Suisse Atlantique Societe D'Armement Maritime S.A.</u> v <u>N.V. Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1967%201%20AC%20361" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1967 1 A.C. 361</a> and <u>Photo Production Ltd.</u> v <u>Securicor Transport Ltd.</u> 1980 The Times Feb. 19, that is correct. Mr. Mills-Owens has cited authorities from other jurisdictions which show that this viewhas been adopted there, but I do not think it is necessary to refer to them. I see no reason to think that the construction contendedfor by the Defendant is unreasonable: see <u>The New York Star</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1979%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1979 1 Lloyd's Rep. 298</a>, 302. Even if a fundamental breach would be material, I agree that the mere fact that the vessel sank is not evidence from whicha fundamental breach could properly be inferred and that it was for the Plaintiffs to raise the issue.</p>    <p align="left"><u>Does Article III r.6 of the Hague Rules cover actions in tort?</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The material part of this rule is:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... the carrier and the ship shall be discharged from all liability in respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought within oneyear after delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">It is contended on behalf of the Plaintiffs that the immunity conferred by the rule is confined to liability for damages for breachof the contract of carriage and that, as the present action is framed also in tort, it would be wrong to refuse an extension of timesolely on the ground that the extension would defeat that limited immunity. Mr. Mills-Owens submits, on the other hand, that theimmunity conferred by the rule is a complete discharge ''from all liability in respect of loss or damage" and that there is no justificationfor a restrictive interpretation of those words. He relied upon <u>The Makefjell</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1976%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%2029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1976 2 Lloyd's Rep. 29</a>, where the Court of Appeal in England interpreted the words "claims arising under this bill of lading" as applying to a claim intort as well as to a claim in contract: he submitted that the wording of the rule is even wider than that. He relied also upon <u>The Sindh</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1975%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1975 1 Lloyd's Rep. 372</a>, but I think that case can be distinguished because it concerned a French contract which was to be construed in accordance with Frenchlaw, and according to that law the exclusive jurisdiction clause required the dispute to be determined in one of two French tribunals.It would have been contrary to the intention of the parties to permit an action in tort to be brought in the English courts.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In my judgment there is no reason to give the rule the restrictive interpretation argued for by the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p align="left"><u>Has suit been brought within one year?</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> This question resolves itself into the further question, By whom must suit be brought? It is submitted on behalf of the Plaintiffsthat, as Kalimantan took out their writ on 20th May 1978, "suit had been brought" within the year: it mattered not that Cosmos wasstill not party to the suit, the order of joinder being in effect nothing more than an order giving leave to join and the joindernot having been effected in accordance with such leave. Mr. Mills-Owens contended that that was too wide an interpretation of therule and that suit must have been brought by the person against whom the time bar was pleaded. Here, he said, Cosmos was even nownot party to any claim against his client and its right to damages had therefore been discharged.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> It must be accepted that the words "loss or damage" are ambiguous: see Carver's Carriage by Sea 12th edition 193 (224). However,one must have regard to the intention of the rule, which was to relieve the carrier from liability to an action for damages, andan action must always be founded upon the particular loss or damage alleged to have been suffered by the plaintiff. There will becases where, by reason of subrogation, another person may sue in respect of that selfsame loss or damage and I apprehend that, ifthe party in whom the original right of action was vested brought his action within one year, it would be no answer to a claim bythe person who had come to stand in his shoes that that person had not commenced proceedings until the year had elapsed. I thinkit was on a similar basis that <u>Firestone Plantations Co.</u> v. <u>The United States of America</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1945%20AMC%20746" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1945 A.M.C. 746</a> can be explained, for there the rights of the intervener were, by assignment, the same as those of the libellant. So long as thecondition attached by the Registrar remains, that is on all fours with the present case. Cons, J. does not mention the American caseand it would seem not to have been drawn to his attention. Different considerations would apply if the condition were not attachedand, of course, different considerations might apply where the claim was such that the plaintiff to be joined had suffered greaterdamage than the original plaintiff. It is true that in <u>The Merak</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1965%202%20WLR%20250" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1965 2 W.L.R. 250</a> it was said that "suit" should be given a wide interpretation, so as to include an arbitration, but the object of the rule does notrequire that a suit to establish a different liability, although arising in respect of loss or damage to the same cargo, should beexcluded from the time bar. Davies, L.J. said at p. 273:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The object of Article III, rule 6, of the Hague Rules would appear to be not to specify any particular mode of procedure for thesettlement of disputes but rather to ensure that such disputes are speedily notified and speedily settled."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In a case such as <u>Firestone Plantations Co.</u> v <u>The United States of America</u> the original writ is indeed "in respect of the whole loss", to use Mr. Litton's words, but in other cases it is the particular liabilityof each possible claimant which is discharged: there "the dispute" between the intervener and the defendant must, as it seems tome, be different from that between the plaintiff and the defendant, although there may, of course, be issues common to both disputes,and that is why the Rules of Court permit intervention in an existing suit instead of insisting upon the bringing of a separate action.We have not been referred to the French text of the rules and I derive no assistance in the present case from <u>James Buchanan &amp; Co. Ltd.</u> v <u>Babco Forwarding &amp; Shipping (U.K.) Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1978%20AC%20141" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1978 A.C. 141.</a> Mr. Litton is correct when he says that Cons, J.'s decision involves construing the word "suit" as "suit brought by the person concerned",but Roskill, J. (as he then was) was able to construe "unless suit is brought within one year" as "unless suit is brought <u>before the court</u> within one year": <u>Compania Colombiana de Seguros</u> v <u>Pacific Steam Navigation Co.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1965%201%20QB%20101" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1965 1 Q.B. 101.</a> Indeed, at p.129 he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"'Suit brought' must mean suit brought by the person properly entitled to bring it."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">That was a case of subrogation, but I think his words are applicable.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> I agree with the judge that Cosmos did not become a party upon Kalimantan's applying, with the consent of Cosmos, to join it as aparty, nor upon the order that it be joined as a party, nor upon the filing of the application for enlargement of the time for amendingthe writ: it would not become a party until the writ was in fact amended (O.15 r.8(4)(a)), but in respect of a claim for loss ofthis cargo I think time stopped running under the rules when suit was brought by Kalimantan in the same capacity, i.e. as owner.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The Discretion</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> What I have said is enough to dispose of the appeal, for it has not been suggested that, if the time has not expired, it would bejust to refuse an extension of time, but, lest it be held that the time limit did expire, I go on. It is not, I think, in disputebefore us that there is a discretion to extend time in spite of the limitation period although the judge took the view that therewas no discretion and consequently did not consider this aspect of the case. With respect to him I think there is a discretion. Itwas so held in <u>The Puerto Acevedo</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1978%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%2038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1978 1 Lloyd's Rep. 38</a>, 40:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"R.S.C., 0.15, r.6, gives a wide discretion to the Court to add a defendant. That discretion extends to a case where, on the faceof it, the one year limitation under the Hague Rules has gone by. If justice requires it, the additional defendant can be joined,even though it does mean depriving him of the time bar under the Hague Rules".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">It is true that the matter was there dealt with ex parte and the court recognized the possibility that objection could be taken ata later stage, but that does not alter the fact that the court had no doubt the jurisdiction existed. Bridge, L.J. thought the matter"beyond argument".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> It therefore remains for decision whether the circumstances are such that it would be right to give the Appellants a locus poenitentiae,Mr. Litton relies upon the question from the judgment of Bowen, L.J. in <u>Cropper</u> v <u>Smith</u> (1884) 26 Ch. D. at p.710 which appears in the 1979 Supreme Court Practice 345 (20/5-8/6):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "It is a well established principle that the object of the Court is to decide the rights of the parties, and not to punishthem for mistakes they make in the conduct of their cases by deciding otherwise than in accordance with their rights . . . I knowof no kind of error or mistake which, if not fraudulent or intended to overreach, the Court ought not to correct, if it can be donewithout injustice to the other party. Courts do not exist for the sake of discipline, but for the sake of deciding matters in controversy,and I do not regard such amendment as a matter of favour or grace. . . . It seems to me that as soon as it appears that the way inwhich a party has framed his case will not lead to a decision of the real matter in controversy, it is as much a matter of righton his part to have it corrected if it can be done without injustice, as anything else in the case is a matter of right".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">However, that leaves the question whether an extension of time can here be granted "without injustice". For his part Mr. Mills-Owensrelies upon <u>Mabro</u> v <u>Eagle, Star &amp; British Dominions Insurance Co. Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1932%201%20KB%20485" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1932 1 K.B. 485</a>, a case under the Limitation Acts. The party sought to be added was alleged to be the person really interested in the insurance inquestion. Scrutton, L.J. said at p.487:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In my experience the Court has always refused to allow a party or a cause of action to be added where, if it were allowed, the defenceof the Statute of Limitations would be defeated. The Court has never treated it as just to deprive a defendant of a legal defence.If the facts show either that the particular plaintiff or the new cause of action sought to be added are barred, I am unable to understandhow it is possible for the Court to disregard the statute. It has been suggested that we might allow the joinder without prejudiceto any defence against the claim, but I cannot see why the parties should be put to the expense of allowing an action to proceedwhich is barred in law".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">That is a principle which has been applied in more recent cases. <u>Braniff</u> v <u>Holland &amp; Hannen and Cubitts (Southern) Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1969%201%20WLR%201533" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1969 1 W.L.R. 1533</a> was another case under the Limitation Acts. There the plaintiff obtained leave to amend its writ and statement of claim for the purposeof joining a second defendant. As in our case the writ was not amended within the time allowed and application was made for an extensionof time. By then the period of limitation had expired. Although the proposed second defendant was aware of the intended claim againstit, it was held that the extension of time ought not to have been granted. However, it is argued that our case is distinguishablein that the application for an extension here was made, but not heard, within the limitation period. This seems to me an importantdistinction. Whilst it is truly said that Cosmos could have safeguarded its position by instituting an action, that would not havebeen necessary had it been possible to hear the application for an extension of time on the day it was filed, or even on the returnday. I think that was a ground upon which, in the exercise of the court's discretion, it would have been proper to depart from thestrict rule. The learned Registrar did depart from the strict rule and, for my part, I think he was entitled so to do. It mattersnot that Kalimantan and Cosmos have no joint interest and that the application to join Cosmos and the application for enlargementof time were made by Kalimantan. I would allow the appeal and restore the order of the Registrar with the addition of a time limitof four days from today.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">22nd April 1980.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">Litton, Q.C. &amp; R.
