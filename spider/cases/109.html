This is because the <brs_term brs_term_id="272" brs_term_type="9">pleading</brs_term>, in particular, the new paragraph 6, does not clearly identify what act or acts the Plaintiffs are relying on in support of theircase based on <brs_term brs_term_id="267" brs_term_type="9">misfeasance</brs_term>. Paragraph 6 pleads to the Defendant's reliance upon &quot;the results of the study&quot; pleaded in paragraph 2a &quot;togetherwith its subsequent course of action&quot; as constituting the <brs_term brs_term_id="270" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> of <brs_term brs_term_id="268" brs_term_type="9">misfeasance</brs_term>. What the Defendant's &quot;subsequent course of action&quot; was has not been specifically pleaded, nor have any particulars beensupplied. Counsel for the Plaintiffs orally informed the Court at the hearing that this included everything that happened subsequentlyleading to the <brs_term brs_term_id="273" brs_term_type="9">Interpretation</brs_term> made by the <brs_term brs_term_id="266" brs_term_type="9">Standing Committee</brs_term> so far as it was attributable to the Defendant as its act or <brs_term brs_term_id="269" brs_term_type="9">omission</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="158"><p><a class="para" id="p24" name="p24">24.</a> The second reason why Mr Fok or the Defendant is embarrassed by the <brs_term brs_term_id="274" brs_term_type="9">amended</brs_term> <brs_term brs_term_id="276" brs_term_type="9">pleading</brs_term> is that it does not plead any causal connection between the <brs_term brs_term_id="275" brs_term_type="9">misfeasance</brs_term> complained of (regardless what it actually comprises) and the resulting &quot;<brs_term brs_term_id="67" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> of livelihood and consequential damages&quot; (paragraph 7), apart from saying that the same happened &quot;by reason of the mattersset out above [i.e. the matters pleaded prior to paragraph 7]&quot;.

Put another way, the real question here is: Didthe act of the <brs_term brs_term_id="332" brs_term_type="9">State Council</brs_term> or the <brs_term brs_term_id="330" brs_term_type="9">Standing Committee</brs_term> <brs_term brs_term_id="87" brs_term_type="9">constitute</brs_term> a <em><brs_term brs_term_id="107" brs_term_type="9">novus actus</brs_term></em> of such impact that it obliterated the wrong-doing of the Defendant, since <em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em> the Defendant, the State Council and the Standing Committee may be regarded as third parties?

As pointed out by <em>Clerk and Lindsell</em> in para 17-135: &quot;the court's strict approach to what claimants must prove by way of the defendant's state of mind acts as aformidable practical constraint on the <brs_term brs_term_id="361" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term>'s actual development&quot;.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="180"><p><a class="para" id="p38" name="p38">38.</a> But each <brs_term brs_term_id="97" brs_term_type="9">case</brs_term> depends on its own facts. In <strong>Tang Nin Mun</strong>, the difficulty facing the plaintiff there was that he had to plead that the defendant constable was subjectively aware that hisfabrication of evidence (i.e. the <brs_term brs_term_id="363" brs_term_type="9">misfeasance</brs_term> complained of in that case) would &quot;in the ordinary course of events, lead to the plaintiff suffering psychiatric disorders ofthe type of which he complain[ed]&quot; (page 329J). One can immediately see why even at a <brs_term brs_term_id="365" brs_term_type="9">strike out</brs_term> stage the Court of Appeal found it unrealistic to say that the plaintiff was in a position to make such an allegation in his <brs_term brs_term_id="364" brs_term_type="9">pleading</brs_term>.
