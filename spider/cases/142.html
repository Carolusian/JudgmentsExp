Indeed, at the hearing, counsel were content to advancetheir arguments based on the proposed re-amended draft.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> In addition, the Plaintiffs further provided Voluntary Particulars of their proposed Re-A-PoC.

It follows therefore that time has not come forthe Plaintiffs to file their Reply.  However, counsel for the Plaintiffs had very helpfully provided the Court with a draft Pointsof Reply for the purpose of the present hearing so that the arguments on the issues could be better focused.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The 3 Plaintiffs were members of the New China Hong Kong Group of companies.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff (<b>âNCHKGpâ</b>) was incorporated on 8 September 1992.

Some of these companies were in fact owned or controlled by directors of NCHKGp.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> At the time of the liquidation of NCHKGp, the 7 Debtors were, in terms of the amount owed, the top 7 debtors of NCHKFin.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> As at 31 December 1994, it is alleged that of the total sum $716,666,153 advanced by NCHKFin to its clients, $609,690,818 was advancedto the 7 Debtors.  For the following year ending 31 December 1995, of the total sum $982,209,494 advanced, $895,135,177 was advancedto the same 7 Debtors.  It is further pleaded that in the case of Topview alone, as at 31 December 1995 the sum owed to NCHKFin represented54.75% of the total assets of NCHKFin, and 22% of the total consolidated assets of NCHKGp.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The Plaintiffs further allege that insufficient security was taken in respect of the substantial advances to these 7 Debtors.  Asa result, in most cases, the only security held by NCHKFin was the securities purchased with the advances.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Further still, in respect of the margin loans to the 7 Debtors, margin calls were not made even when the net amount due in respectof such margin loans exceeded the accepted value of the securities.</p>    <p class="heading">Plaintiffsâ claims against E&amp;Y</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The gravamen of the Plaintiffsâ complaint is that E&amp;Y, with knowledge of the above matters, had failed to report such mattersto the companiesâ management or the Executive Committee or warn them of the same.  But instead, for each of the years in 1994 and1995, E&amp;Y had given an unqualified opinion that the financial statements of the Plaintiffs represented a true and fair view ofthe companiesâ state of affairs in all material respects.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> In addition, the Plaintiffs complained that when the respective consolidated accounts for 1994 and 1995 were laid before the AnnualGeneral Meetings of the shareholders (which took place respectively on 27 October 1995 and 18 February 1997), E&amp;Y had failedto warn, report or make disclosure of the imprudent, reckless or improper manner in which NCHKFinâs business was being conducted.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Apart from the above failings, the Plaintiffs further allege that many aspects of conflict of interest had arisen from the differentroles of E&amp;Y and Wu in their dealings with the Plaintiffs.  Such conflict is said to have arisen from the roles of E&amp;Y andWu as a member of the Executive Committee, as well as being a shadow or <i>de facto</i> director of the Plaintiffs on the one hand, and their role as auditor of the Plaintiff companies on the other.  It is alleged thatconflict also arose by reason that E&amp;Y had provided audit and other professional services to a number of companies associatedwith some of the directors of NCHKGp, and several of the 7 Debtors.  It is said that neither the directors nor shareholders wereproperly advised or apprised of such conflicts.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> The Plaintiffs contend that had the various aspects of the conflict been disclosed to the management or the Executive Committee,the latter would have recommended to the shareholders to appoint an independent firm of auditors.  Had the Executive Committee beenapprised of the true financial position of NCHKFin as well as its imprudent manner of conducting business, steps would have beentaken to obtain security from the margin shortfall debtors; and also if the Executive Committee were not to take such steps, a reportby E&amp;Y or Wu to the Securities and Futures Commission would at least have resulted in the SFC insisting that effective measuresbe taken to rectify the deficiencies.  And should the debtors fail to make up the margin shortfall or provide additional security,their security in the possession of the Plaintiffs would have been realised.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> According to the Plaintiffs, had timely remedial actions been taken in respect of 1994 shortfall, securities of substantial valueheld by 5 of the 7 Debtors (whose accounts revealed significant margin shortfall) would have been realized <i>on or before 31 March 1995</i>.  In addition, subsequent advances to these debtors from April 1995 to January 1999 would not have been made.  Thus, it is said thatloss was occasioned as a result of the failings of E&amp;Y and Wu, being the loss of the value of the securities which would havebeen realised, plus the aggregate amount of the further advances which would have been avoided.  Such loss is quantified at $399,742,716.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> An alternative claim is made on the basis that if proper information had been presented in the 1994 consolidated accounts which werelaid before the AGM on 27 October 1995, similar remedial measures would follow to deal with any margin shortfall.  Substantial valuewould still be recovered in realising the securities <i>by 30 November 1995</i>, and further advances to the margin shortfall debtors would have ceased.  On this basis the loss is quantified at $387,562,842.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Similarly, for the 1995 accounts, the loss to the Plaintiffs is quantified at $367,813,463, being the value of the securities whichwould have been realized on or before <i>31 March 1996</i>, and the subsequent advances between April 1996 and January 1999 would have been avoided.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> As a similar alternative, a claim was made on the basis that had proper information of the consolidated accounts been laid beforethe AGM on 18 February 1997, steps would have been taken and securities of the margin shortfall debtors would have been realized<i>by 28 February 1997</i>.  Again further advances from March 1997 to January 1999 would cease.  The loss on this basis is quantified at $344,652,573.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> The Plaintiffs contend that the loss were occasioned by E&amp;Y and Wuâs breaches of their <i>common law duties</i> owed to the Plaintiffs as well as breaches of <i>their fiduciary duties</i> as auditors, financial adviser, an officer and shadow or <i>de facto</i> director of the Plaintiffs, and/or as a member of the Executive Committee.  The Plaintiffs claim common law damages for the lossas well as equitable compensation (<b>âthe Corporate Debtors Claimâ</b>).</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> In addition, NCHKGp claims to be entitled to repayment of $6,400,000, being the retainer and other professional fees paid to E&amp;Ybetween February 1993 and December 1997 in respect of work performed by Wu prior to the incorporation of NCHKGp in raising fundsin Mainland China for establishing the group of companies.  It is contended that any contract for such work was never ratified orapproved by NCHKGp or the Executive Committee; that payments were made in breach of the articles of association of the company; thatneither Defendants had performed any work for NCHKGp which justified the payments; and that the payments were accepted by E&amp;Yand Wu in breach of their fiduciary duties towards the Plaintiffs.  The Plaintiffs seek recovery of this sum from both Defendants(<b>âthe Retainer Fees Claimâ</b>).</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> The Plaintiffs further claim against E&amp;Y for the return of $5,055,426 being audit fees paid by NCHKGp, and $2,854,684 paid byNCHKCap between February 1993 and 30 January 1999 (<b>âthe Audit Fees Claimâ</b>).</p>    <p class="heading">Plaintiffsâ claims against Wu</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> The Corporate Debtors Claim and the Retainer Fees claim are also made against Wu.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> In addition there are 3 claims against Wu in relation to accounts allegedly held by him with NCHKCap (<b>âthe Accounts Claimsâ</b>).</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> The first of these Accounts Claims concerns the transfer of a sum of $11,190,783 to a company allegedly controlled by him in thename of Galvanic Limited (<b>âGalvanicâ</b>).  The sum was originally shown to be due from Wu in the account of NCHK<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/31">Cap as at 31</a> December 1994.  It is alleged that as a resultof the transfer, Wu was released from personal liability for the said indebtedness to the detriment of NCHKCap (<b>âthe Galvanic-Transfer Claimâ</b>).</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> The second concerns a claim of $44,049,295 which is said to be  payments improperly transferred out of Wuâs account with NCHKCapon Wuâs instructions during the period between 30 April 1994 and 31 December 1995.  (<b>âthe Payment-Outs Claimâ</b>).</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> The third concerns a payment by NCHKCap to Wu of $1,085,724 on 31 March 1995 and further payments totalling $150,093 made between22 May 1995 and 5 December 1995, ostensibly as payment of interest to him, but allegedly had not been authorised by NCHKCap or membersof the board (<b>âthe Unauthorised Interest Claimâ</b>).</p>    <p class="heading">Limitation</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> These proceedings were commenced first against E&amp;Y <i>on 30 July 2004</i> (HCCL 41 of 2004), and later against Wu <i>on 24 January 2005</i> (HCCL 2 of 2005).</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> E&amp;Y and Wu both contend that the causes of action for the Corporate Debtors Claim, whether at common law or in equity, have already<i>accrued before 29 July 1998</i>, more than 6 years prior to the issue of the writ.  As against them, they say, these claims are time-barred.  The same applies tothe Retainer Fees claim.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> As for the Audit Fees Claim against E&amp;Y, it is contended that insofar as the payments were made before 29 July 1998, such paymentsare similarly out of time.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Wu also contends that all the Accounts Claims against him are statute-barred.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> The Plaintiffsâ main contention in response can be summarised thus :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)  For the Corporate Debtors Claim, the cause of action in negligence is not constituted until damage is suffered.  NCHKFinâsdamage did not arise until the accounts were reckoned and the outstanding indebtedness of the 7 Debtors proved unrecoverable.  Theloans to the 7 Debtors were not ascertained to be unrecoverable until NCHKFinâs liquidation, that is, <i>25 January 1999</i>.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)  Further, the duties owed by the Defendants were continuing duties, and breaches of such duties were continuous breaches.  Inrelation to the 1994 and 1995 Accounts, at least some of the loss was attributable to additional advances made as late as <i>January 1999</i>.  As each of the advances was the result of a separate breach, at least part of the claim is not barred whether in negligence orin contract.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)  Accordingly, the causes of action based on breach of common law duties did not first accrue beyond the 6-year primary limitationperiod under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)  In any event, even if some aspects of the Plaintiffsâ negligence claims accrued more than 6 years before the commencement ofthe respective Actions, the Plaintiffs did not have knowledge of the facts relevant to the causes of action.  The secondary limitationperiod under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 31</a> of the Ordinance is engaged.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)  Further or alternatively, the relevant facts were deliberately concealed from the Plaintiffs by the Defendants.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 26(1)</a> applies to postpone the running of the period of limitation.  As a further alternative, the breaches of duties were committed bythe Defendants knowingly and deliberately within the meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26(3).</a>  The Plaintiffs did not discover the concealment or the facts involved in the said breaches of duty until <i>early 2005</i>, that is, after reviewing the documents disclosed pursuant to the section 221 proceedings.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6)  Insofar as the claim is based on breach of fiduciary duties, such claim is not barred under the Ordinance.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4(7)</a> of the Ordinance has no application and the limitation periods provided for in the Ordinance do not apply by analogy to such a claim.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(7)  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 20(1)</a> applies and no limitation period is applicable.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Similar arguments based on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.26</a> and s.<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">20</a>(1) are advanced in respect of the other claims, which will be discussed in more detail below.</p>    <p class="heading">Approach</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> The principles governing a strike-out application are well established.  It is not disputed that the jurisdiction to strike out appliesonly to plain and obvious cases.  I have been reminded by Mr. Scott, S.C. (representing the Plaintiffs) that these applications mustnot be turned into a trial upon affidavits, and that disputed facts should be taken in favour of the party at the receiving end ofthe strike-out application, in this case, the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> These principles are not contentious.  What the Defendants have submitted (through Mr. Yu, S.C. for E&amp;Y, and Mr. Strachan forWu) is that even on the facts as the Plaintiffs have asserted, the Court should still come to a view that the various causes of actionare time-barred and liable to be struck out as being frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of the process of the court.  In particular,where the Court comes to the conclusion after full argument that the case is plainly and obviously unsustainable, the Court shouldnot decline to strike it out just because the issues are difficult or complicated: <i>Byjoy Ltd. v. Thorogood Estates</i><a>[1]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> Arguments have been advanced in the course of hearing as to the proper approach that the Court should adopt in a strike-out applicationon the ground of limitation.  The Defendants referred to the observations of Stephenson LJ in <i>Ronex Properties Ltd. v. John Liang Construction Ltd.</i><a>[2]</a>, which I would respectfully adopt as the correct approach :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThere are many cases in which the expiry of the limitation period makes it a waste of time and money to let a plaintiff go on withhis action.  But in those cases it may be impossible to say that he has no reasonable cause of action.  The right course is thereforefor a defendant to apply to strike out the plaintiffsâ claim as frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court,on the ground that it is statute-barred.  Then the plaintiff and the court know that the Statute of Limitations will be pleaded;the defendant can, if necessary, file evidence to that effect; the plaintiff can file evidence of an acknowledgment or concealedfraud or any matter which may show the court that his claim is not vexatious or an abuse of process; and the court will be able todo, in I suspect most cases, what was done in <i>Riches v. Director of Public Prosecutions</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%201%20WLR%201019" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] 1 W.L.R. 1019:</a> strike out the claim and dismiss the action.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Mr. Scott, while not disagreeing that in a proper case it is appropriate for a defendant to apply to strike out on the ground oflimitation, argued that it would be wrong to allow such an application to be used as a means to force the plaintiff to set out hiscase on affidavit.  This is so, especially, when a defence has not been filed and the defendantâs case on limitation has not beenpleaded.  Mr. Scott referred to the following observations of Donaldson LJ (as he then was) in <i>Ronex<a>[3]</a></i> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAuthority apart, I would have thought that it was absurd to contend that a writ or third party notice could be struck out as disclosingno cause of action, merely because the defendant may have a defence under the Limitation Acts. â¦â¦ [It] is trite law that theEnglish Limitation Acts bar the remedy and not the right; and, furthermore, that they do not even have this effect unless and untilpleaded.  Even when pleaded, they are subject to various exceptions, such as acknowledgment of a debt or concealed fraud, which canbe raised by way of reply. â¦â¦ Accordingly, authority apart, I would have unhesitatingly dismissed the application to strike outupon this ground.  The answer might well have been different if [the third party in that case] had relied upon any ground other thanfailure to disclose a reasonable cause of action, but in that event all concerned could have adduced evidence and we would have beenable to explore the factual basis upon which it is said that the Limitation Acts do, or as the case may be do not, apply.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> It appears to me that what Donaldson LJ warned against is the attempt, when invoking limitation as a ground to strike out, to basethe application solely on the plaintiffâs failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action.  However, in a case where the othergrounds are relied on and evidence filed, I do not read the learned judgeâs observations as in any way comprising the need forthe plaintiff to adduce sufficient evidence to support a case either that his cause of action does not accrue outside the relevantlimitation period, or that for other reasons provided in the statute, the running of time should be postponed.  The fact that a plaintiff,faced with an argument that his action is time-barred â hence frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of the court process â is requiredto adduce evidence sufficient to raise the issue of secondary limitation period (or as to time of accrual of his cause of action,as the case may be), is nothing exceptional or exceptionable.  It is but an instance of the general approach that a party who facesa strike-out application on these grounds should adduce sufficient evidence to meet his opponentâs case.  The Court will, havingregard to all the evidence, determine whether it is a case that the plaintiffâs cause or causes of action are plainly or obviouslytime-barred, whether by reference to the primary limitation period, or any applicable secondary limitation under the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> I do not consider the observations of Shaw LJ in <i>Ronex<a>[4]</a></i> to be inconsistent with the above.  Shaw LJâs remark that a strike-out is appropriate âonly when it is manifest that there isan answer immediately destructive of whatever claim to relief is madeâ is, like Donaldson LJâs, directed against an applicationbased solely on the ground of failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> Nor do I read the observations of Godfrey J in <i>Lam Kee On v. Lam Hing</i><a>[5]</a>as casting any doubt on the approach propounded by Stephenson LJ in <i>Ronex</i>.  In the passage of the judgment at p.320, the learned judge was merely cautioning that the courtâs power to strike-out shouldbe exercised only in plain and obvious cases, and where there is room for serious argument whether or not the limitation point isa good one, the application to strike out fails.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> In the present case, all the grounds under Order 18, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 19</a> are deployed by the Defendants in their strike-out applications.  The objection against basing the application solely on the groundof no reasonable cause of action is not applicable.  The question for the Court is whether, having regard to all the materials presented,the Plaintiffsâ pleaded causes of action are plainly and obviously time-barred, whether under the primary limitation periods orthe secondary limitations as provided for in the Ordinance.</p>    <p class="heading">Accrual of Cause of Action â Tort and Contract â Corporate Debtors Claim</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> provides that an action in negligence and an action in contract shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the dateon which the cause of action accrued.

He argued that in relation to loans advanced by the lender, the lenderâsloss occurs only when the loans are ascertained to be unrecoverable.  Until then, the lender has not suffered actual loss.  Lossis only contingent.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Mr. Scott referred to the draft Limited Scope Review prepared by E&amp;Y (<b>âthe draft LSRâ</b>), which was a report commissioned by the Securities and Futures Commission (<b>âthe SFCâ</b>), NCHKFin and NCHKCap in August 1997 to review NCHKFinâs money lending activities and its internal control and risk managementsystems and procedure.  He submitted that the loans advanced to the 7 Debtors were performing loans, at least as at 31 July 1997. According to the draft LSR, Mr. P.C. Chiu, the finance director of NCHKGp, was confident about the likelihood of recoverabilityof the majority of the outstanding balances.  In the same vein, Mr. Scott pointed out that no provisions were made in the Plaintiffsâfinancial statements to indicate any impairment of recoverability of the outstanding loans.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Mr. Scott argued, therefore, that in relation to the loans advanced to the 7 Debtors, the indebtedness only became unrecoverablewhen NCHKFin went into liquidation, that is, 25 January 1999.  The cause of action in negligence did not accrue before that date.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> The general principles on when an action in negligence accrues are set out in the following passages in the judgment of the Courtof Final Appeal in <i>Kensland Realty Ltd.

A plaintiff suffers damage when that person incurs a liability to pay damages, and that is so even though the quantificationof the damage is not then ascertainable:  <i>Wardley Australia Ltd v.

Thus, when a defendantâs negligent breach of a duty of care causes physical harm to the plaintiff or the plaintiffâsproperty, the defendant incurs a liability to pay damages from that moment.  The time for bringing the plaintiffâs action runsfrom the moment that the plaintiff suffers damage.  That the damage cannot be quantified, or is not known, at that moment is notrelevant.  If the plaintiff acquires a benefit at the same time as acquiring the liability, however, it may not be possible to determinewhether the plaintiff has suffered damage until an adverse balance is struck between the benefit and the burden of the liability:<i>Wardley Australia Ltd v State of Western Australia</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 514</a> at 536 per Brennan J.  Similarly, if the damages are not payable until the happening of a further event, the plaintiffâs liabilityis contingent only and damage is not sustained until the event occurs : <i>Wardley Australia Ltd v State of Western Australia.</i>  Personal guarantees are cases that usually fall within this category.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> The first point to note is that the argument now advanced by Mr. Scott departs substantially from the proposed Re-A-PoC.  In theproposed pleading, the Plaintiffs have made clear in the Prayer that they are claiming damages, against both Defendants, under paragraphs41, 45, 67 and 71.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Paragraph 41 sets out how the alleged loss of $399,742,716 is arrived at.<a>[7]</a>  Such loss is the culmination of the matters pleaded in paragraphs 39 and 40.  By claiming to be entitled to damages under paragraph41, the Plaintiffs are asserting that the loss suffered as a result of the failings of E&amp;Y and/or Wu in respect of the 1994 Accountsconsists of: (i) the loss of the opportunity to realise the securities of the respective debtors <i>by 31 March 1995</i>, which would have been worth $134,916,347 as of that date; and (ii) the loss representing the value of the additional advances tothe debtors between <i>1 April 1995 and 25 January 1999</i> totalling $264,826,369, which could and would have been avoided.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Thus, on the Plaintiffsâ pleaded case (in paragraphs 39 to 41), there is no question but that damage has arisen by <i>31 March 1995</i> as regards the 1994 Accounts.  By 31 March 1995, the Plaintiffs have already suffered real detriment in having missed the opportunityto realise the debtorsâ securities.  Such detriment, as pleaded, is hardly negligible or minimal.  Clearly, subject to the discussionof the point in the next section, the Plaintiffsâ pleaded cause of action culminating in a claim in paragraph 41 has <i>prima facie</i> accrued at the latest on 31 March 1995.<a>[8]</a></p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> Similar analysis applies to the Plaintiffsâ claim under paragraph 45.  Paragraph 45 sets out the claim for damages in respect ofthe 1994 Accounts on the alternative basis<a>[9]</a>.  This claim is based on matters pleaded in paragraphs 42 to 44.  On this alternative basis, the Plaintiffsâ loss consists of:(i) the loss occasioned by missing the opportunity to realise the securities <i>by 30 November 1995</i>, which would have been worth $98,033,800 as of that date; and (ii) the loss representing the value of the additional advances tothe debtors between <i>1 December 1995 and 25 January 1999</i> totalling $289,529,042, which could and would have been avoided.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> For the same reason discussed in the preceding paragraph, the cause of action culminating in the claim in paragraph 45 has <i>prima facie</i> accrued at the latest on <i>30 November 1995</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> The same applies also to the claims for damages under paragraphs 67 and 71.  These are claims against the Defendants in respect ofthe 1995 Accounts, put on two bases in the alternative.  For the same reason as above, the Plaintiffsâ pleaded causes of actionregarding the 1995 Accounts would have accrued, <i>prima facie</i>, respectively on <i>31 March 1996</i><a>[10]</a> and <i>28 February 1997</i><a>[11]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> But even if the Plaintiffs were allowed to depart from the claim as formulated in paragraphs 41, 45, 67 and 71, on the basis of thefacts set out in the Re-A-PoC it is still difficult to see how the Plaintiffs can mount an arguable case that damage is not suffereduntil the debts were ascertained to be irrecoverable on liquidation.  It is the Plaintiffsâ case that the indebtedness of the 7Debtors were âbad debts in the accounts of NCHKFinâ.  It is further asserted that the true financial position of NCHKFin wasthat bad debts had accrued to the order of $284,573,198 as at 31 December 1994, and $598,923,558 as at 31 December 1995.  As Mr.Yu has pointed out, it is the foundation of the Plaintiffsâ case in negligence that the debtorsâ covenants for repayment wereworthless.  It is the debtorsâ inability to discharge the indebtedness that has given rise to the Plaintiffsâ complaint againstthe Defendants for failure to warn the management against the imprudent manner of NCHKFinâs business and the necessity to makesubstantial provision for the bad debts, and/or reported the matter to other proper authorities.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> For the Plaintiffs now to advance a case on the basis that the borrowings of the 7 Debtors were actually <i>performing loans</i> would not only be inconsistent with the factual assertions presently pleaded, the Plaintiffs would essentially be advancing a fundamentallydifferent case against the Defendants.  The Plaintiffs would, in essence, be advancing a case that notwithstanding the fact thatthe debtors were <i>good on their covenants</i> to repay, it is still a breach of duty on the part of the Defendants not to warn or report the manner in which the business of NCHKFinwas being conducted.  But just how such a duty arises or the way it is breached is not immediately discernible from the case as pleaded.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> I do not propose to recast the case for the Plaintiffs.  Suffice it for me to say that on the basis of the pleading as presentlydrafted, I do not think it is open to Mr. Scott to graft onto it an argument that the Plaintiffs did not suffer actual loss on thebasis of the supposed uncertainty as to the recoverability (or un-recoverability) of the loans until liquidation of the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Furthermore, as the foundation of the Plaintiffsâ pleaded case is that the borrowersâ repayment covenants were worthless, anyfurther advances to the borrowers would be a loss immediately sustained the moment such an advance is made.  Clearly, for every suchadvance, the lenders are financially worse off.  This is a scenario analogous to that of the lenderâs loss in <i>Nykredit Mortgage Bank Plc v. Edward Erdman Ltd. (No.2)</i><a>[12]</a>, who had advanced money on the strength of an overvalued security.  In such a case, where the borrower had defaulted at once, theirlordships were of the view that loss was suffered at once when the loan transaction was entered into, rather than at a later timewhen the loss became crystallised upon realisation of the security<a>[13]</a>.  Therefore, on the basis of the case as pleaded, it would not be open to the Plaintiffs to contend that any loss would depend uponrecoverability of the indebtedness.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> It must, therefore, follow that Mr. Scottâs argument that the nature of the loss is merely contingent and not actual, also fails. The discussion as to contingent loss in the case of <i>Law Society v. Sephton &amp; Co.</i><a>[14]</a> does not arise for consideration.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>Continuing Duty, Continuing Breach</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> The essence of this argument is that the duty owed by the Defendants is a continuing duty so that every further advance amounts toa fresh breach of duty, both in contract and in tort.  Of relevance to E&amp;Y are the advances made between July 1998 and January1999 which, on this argument, would be within the 6-year period before the commencement of the Action against them.  For Wu, therelevant advances are those allegedly made on 25 January 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> In my view the characterisation of the duty as a continuing duty is untenable.  As Mr. Yu has submitted, the essence of the dutyin the position of the Defendants is to exercise reasonable care and skill when performing their audit work and in relation to theviews expressed in the audit reports.  Any breach of duties arises from failures to exercise such care or skill, and a breach iscommitted the moment when such failures occur.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> The question when a breach takes place must be distinguished from when the resulting damage arises.  In the present case, to saythat every further advance amounts to a fresh breach is to confuse the two distinct concepts.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> More specifically, it is the Plaintiffsâ pleaded case that the Defendants have committed breaches of duties at specific pointsin time.  In relation to the 1994 Accounts, the allegation is that the breach by failing to warn or report occurred at the latestby the end of February 1995.  As an alternative, it is alleged that the breach lies in the failure to present in the audit reportsthe true financial position of the NCHKFin.  Such breach would have occurred at the time when E&amp;Y signed the accounts and gavetheir unqualified opinion in respect each of the Plaintiffs, that is, 6 May 1995 in the case of NCHKGp; 28 April 1995 in the caseof NCHK<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/18">Cap; and 18</a> April 1995 in the case of NCHKFin.  In any event, such breach would have occurred at the latest when the reportswere laid before the AGM of NCHKGp on 27 October 1995.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> In relation to the 1995 Accounts, the relevant breaches are said to have occurred at the latest by February 1996, or alternatively,by the time of the following AGM on 18 February 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> The argument that every further advance gives rise to a separate breach and a separate cause of action is a substantial departurefrom the pleaded case.  Without a properly formulated pleading on the point, such departure adds an additional hurdle in the Plaintiffsâway.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>Conclusion on Accrual of Cause of Action â Tort and Contract</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> For the foregoing reasons, I take the view (subject to any argument on application of secondary limitation) that the Plaintiffsâcauses of action in contract, in relation to the 1994 Accounts, must <i>prima facie</i> have accrued by the <i>end of February 1995</i> or alternatively by <i>27 October 1995</i>; and in relation to the 1995 Accounts, by the <i>end of February 1996</i> or alternatively by <i>18 February 1997</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> I also take the view that the Plaintiffsâ causes of action in negligence, in relation to the 1994 Accounts, must have already accruedby <i>31 March 1995</i> or alternatively by <i>30 November 1995</i>; and in relation to the 1995 Accounts, by <i>31 March 1996</i> or alternatively by <i>28 February 1997</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> In each case, the causes of action in contract and tort have accrued more than 6 years before the commencement of the respectiveActions against the Defendants.</p>    <p class="heading">Knowledge under Section 31â Corporate Debtors Claim</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> The Plaintiffs invoke <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 31</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>.

Despitethe many details (including those set out in the draft Reply), the essence of the Plaintiffsâ complaint in respect of the 1994and 1995 Accounts is that the Defendants had wrongfully given unqualified opinion in respect of both sets of accounts; and in thebroader context had failed to give warning as to the imprudent or reckless manner in which NCHKFin was conducting its business, thuscausing the Plaintiffs to become unable to realise the securities, but instead have made further advances which could have been avoided.

Securities Commission</i><a>[16]</a>, the Privy Council stated that for the purpose of determining the rights and obligations of a company, one begins by ascertainingthe primary rules of attribution with reference to the companyâs constitution and the rules implied by company law.  These primaryrules are built upon by adopting principles of agency.  In addition, there may still be circumstances where the court would haveto fashion a special rule of attribution, for instance, as a matter of interpretation of a particular statute.  This is what LordHoffman said<a>[17]</a> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe companyâs primary rules of attribution will generally be found in its constitution, typically the articles of association,â¦â¦ There are also primary rules of attribution which are not expressly stated in the articles but implied by company law.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">These primary rules of attribution are obviously not enough to enable a company to go out into the world and do business.  Not everyact on behalf of the company could be expected to be the subject of a resolution of the board or a unanimous decision of the shareholders. The company therefore builds upon the primary rules of attribution by using general rules of attribution which are equally availableto natural persons, namely the principles of agency.  It will appoint servants and agents whose acts, by a combination of the generalprinciples of agency and the companyâs primary rules of attribution, count as the acts of the company.  â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The companyâs primary rules of attribution together with the general principles of agency, â¦â¦ are usually sufficient to enableone to determine its rights and obligations.  â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦ [In exceptional cases] the court must fashion a special rule of attribution for the particular substantive rule.  This is alwaysa matter of interpretation: given that it was intended to apply to a company, how was it intended to apply?  Whose act (or knowledge,or state of mind) was <i>for this purpose</i> intended to count as the act etc. of the company ?  One finds the answer to this question by applying the usual cannons of interpretation,taking into account the language of the rule (if it is a statute) and its content and policy.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> The general rules of imputing to a principal knowledge acquired by an agent is summarised as follows in <i>Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency<a>[18]</a></i>:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â    <u>Knowledge Acquired Through Agent</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  The law may impute to a principal knowledge relating to the subject-matter of the agency which the agent acquires while actingwithin the scope of his authority.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)  Where an agent is authorised to enter into a transaction in which his own knowledge is material, knowledge which he acquiredoutside the scope of his authority may also be imputed to the principal.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)  â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)  Knowledge is not attributed to the principal where it is acquired by an agent who is defrauding the principal in the same transaction.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> The above principles were further explained by Leggatt LJ in <i>R. v. Rozeik</i><a>[19]</a>.  The learned judge affirmed the application of the general agency principle with regard to attribution of knowledge when he said<a>[20]</a> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhether or not a company is fixed with the knowledge acquired by an employee or officer will depend on the circumstances.  It isnecessary first to identify whether the individual in question has the requisite status and authority in relation to the particularact or omission in point. â¦.  An employee who acts for the company within the scope of his employment will usually bind the companysince he <i>is</i> the company for the purpose of the transaction in question â¦...â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>  The learned judge went on to explain the âfraud exceptionâ when the company is the victim of the fraud<a>[21]</a> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦.. But different considerations apply where the company is the victim, and the employeeâs activities have caused or assistedthe company to suffer loss.  The company will not be fixed with knowledge where the employee or officer has been defrauding it â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In such a case knowledge of a manager is not to be imputed to his employers if the manager is acting in fraud of his employers andthe knowledge which he has is relevant to the fraud. â¦.  The reason why the company is not visited with the managerâs knowledgeis that the same individual cannot both be party to the deception and represent the company for the purpose of its being deceived. Unless therefore it was proved that the managers were party to the fraud, with the result that their knowledge can be disregarded,their knowledge must be imputed to the companies â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> First, in the context of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 31</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, I believe there is no room for doubt that the provision is meant to apply not only to individuals, but also to companies.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 31</a> is modelled on section 14A of the Limitation Act 1980, which was introduced by the Latent Damage Act 1986 to reverse the effect ofthe decision of <i>Pirelli General Cable Works v.

Insofar as knowledge of corporate bodies are relevant for the purpose of section 31, there appearsnothing in the provision â whether as a matter of policy or interpretation of the language â to require the general rules ofattribution to be displaced or adjusted.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> As apparent from the above, there are two aspects of the general agency principles which are of special relevance to the presentcase.  One is that in order for an officerâs knowledge to be imputed to the company, the person concerned must have the requisitestatus and he must be acting within the scope of his authority.  The other is what may be conveniently called the âfraud exceptionâwhen knowledge of the person concerned is not imputed to the company by reason that his act, in respect of which the knowledge isrelevant, is a fraud on the company.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>The âFraud Exceptionâ â the Authorities</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> Mr. Scott submitted that knowledge acquired by a director does not necessarily become the knowledge of the company of which he isa director.  Where directors are acting <i>in breach of their duties</i> to the company, it would be contrary to justice and common sense to treat the knowledge of such person as that of the company.  Forthese propositions, he relied on the following authorities: <i>Re Hampshire Land Co.</i><a>[23]</a>; <i>JC Houghton and Co. v. Nothard, Lowe and Wills Ltd.</i><a>[24]</a>; <i>Arab Bank plc v. Zurich Insurance Co.</i><a>[25]</a> and <i>China Everbright-IHD Pacific Ltd. v. Châng Poh</i><a>[26]</a>, and also <i>Moore Stephens (a firm) v. Stone &amp; Rolls Limited (in liq)</i><a>[27]</a> (the last of which is a recent decision delivered by the English Court of Appeal, and further written submissions have been receivedfrom the parties on that authority after the hearing).</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> I will first consider <i>JC Houghton and Co. v. Nothard, Lowe and Wills Ltd</i>.  Mr. Scott made the point that the operation of the âfraud exceptionâ is not confined to cases where the agent or officer ofthe company is guilty of actual fraud.  He contended that the exception extends to cases where the agent or officer is guilty of<i>breach of duty</i> or <i>delinquency</i>, relying on the following passage from the speech of Viscount Sumner<a>[28]</a> in support:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ On the other hand, the Lowes knew everything all along, and if by their keeping the matter to themselves, their companycould be estopped from denying that it was bound by the 70 per cent. arrangement, they would have relieved themselves and Mr. Prescottfrom personal liability under their guarantee at the sacrifice of their companyâs interests.  Their silence was accordingly a notablebreach of duty.  It has long been recognized that it would be contrary to justice and common sense to treat the knowledge of suchpersons as that of their company, as if one were to assume that they would make a clean breast of their delinquency.  Hence, forthe purpose of estopping the company, some knowledge other than theirs has to be brought home to other directors, who can be presumednot to be concerned to suppress it.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> <i>JC Houghton and Co.</i> concerns 2 directors (the Lowes) of the respondent company who entered into arrangement with a fruit trade broker.  The essence ofthe arrangement was that the broker should make certain advances to another company belonging to the 2 directors (N. Co.) in returnfor a pledge that the broker would receive all the apples consigned to the respondent and be allowed to deduct parts of the proceedsin reduction of the advances.  Against these facts, the House of Lords held that the respondent was not bound by the arrangementas it was not a transaction which the company had authorised; and that the respondent was not estopped from denying the existenceof the arrangement by the knowledge of the Lowes as they were parties to the wrong done to the company.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> It is clear from the facts of the case that the <i>breach of duty</i> or <i>delinquency</i> referred to was in fact an act <i>amounting to equitable fraud on the company</i>.  Viscount Dunedin said<a>[29]</a> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ It may be assumed that the knowledge of directors is in ordinary circumstances the knowledge of the company. â¦...   Butwhat if the knowledge of the director is the knowledge of a director who is himself particeps criminis, that is, if the knowledgeof an infringement of the right of the company is only brought home to the man who himself was the artificer of such infringement? ...â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>After referring to <i>Re Hampshire Land Co.</i><a>[30]</a> and <i>Lacey v. Hill</i><a>[31]</a>, his Lordship said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThis law, in my view, applies to the present case.  The only knowledge brought home to the company is through the Lowes and thesecretary.

Zurich Insurance<a>[32]</a></i>.  That was a case involving actual dishonesty and fraudulent conduct of the managing director.  The reference to âwrongdoingâto which my attention was drawn<a>[33]</a> was a recitation of counselâs submission.  It does not appear that the judgment of Rix J directly deals with the scope of the applicationof the âfraud-exceptionâ.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> <i>Re Hampshire Land Co.</i>, was a case concerning a borrowing by a company from a building society.  The borrowing was unauthorised by the company because therelevant resolution was defective.  The question in that case was whether the knowledge of one Mr. Wills (the secretary common toboth the company and the society) as to the irregularity should be imputed to the society, so as to preclude the society from recoveringthe loan.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> In his judgment, Vaughan Williams J first found that it was not the duty of the secretary, as officer of the society, to receivenotice of the irregularity.  Further, the learned judge said<a>[34]</a> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦. The case is very much more like the one which [counsel for the society] had to admit was an exception to the general rulethat they sought to lay down, for they admitted that if Wills had been guilty of a fraud, the personal knowledge of Wills of thefraud that had had committed upon the company would not have been knowledge of the society of the facts constituting that fraud;because common sense at once leads one to the conclusion that it would be impossible to infer that the duty, either of giving orreceiving notice, will be fulfilled where the common agent is himself guilty of fraud.  It seems to me that if you assume here thatMr. Wills was guilty of irregularity â a breach of duty in respect of these transactions â the same inference is to be drawnas if he had been guilty of fraud.  I do not know, I am sure, whether he was guilty of actual fraud; but whether his conduct amountedto fraud or to breach of duty, I decline to hold that his knowledge of his own fraud or of his own breach of duty is, under the circumstances,the knowledge of the company.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> My reading of <i>Re Hampshire Land Co.</i> is that the case is not really concerned with the question of attribution or the exclusion of an agentâs knowledge to <i>his own principal</i>, but whether the knowledge of an agent for one principal could be imputed to another of whom he is also an agent.  It is in relationto the situation of common agency that the question of exclusion, based on fraud or irregularity, was discussed.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> However, it appears from the judgments in <i>Moore Stephens v. Stone &amp; Rolls Ltd.</i> that <i>Re Hampshire Land Co.</i> was taken as laying down the principle regarding the operation of the âfraud exceptionâ.  <i>Moore Stephens v. Stone &amp; Rolls Ltd.</i> involved a claim brought by the liquidators against the companyâs auditors.  The company in question was a one-man company, controlledand run by one Mr. Stojevic.  The company was used by Stojevic as a vehicle for defrauding a Czech bank (âKBâ).  KB succeededin its claim against the company.  The liquidators sued the former auditors for failure to expose the fraud.  The auditors invokedthe maxim <i>ex turpi causa non oritur actio</i>, arguing (but unsuccessfully) that the companyâs loss was caused by its own fraud.  At issue was whether Stojevicâs fraud canproperly be attributed to the company.  The judges discussed the <i>Hampshire Land</i> principle in some detail.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> At paragraph 39, Rimer LJ said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe essence of the principle is therefore that a company will not have attributed to it knowledge of a fraud when fraud is beingpractised on the company itself.  The law does not attribute knowledge of a deception to the person who is being deceived.  Why shouldit make such an attribution when its agent engaged on deceiving would not himself disclose his perfidy?â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At paragraph 48, the learned judge said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe critical question is this: should the court regard the company as villain or victim?  If it is to be regarded as the victimof Mr Stojevicâs dishonesty, the effect of the <i>Hampshire Land</i> principle is that his dishonesty will not be attributed to it, it will not be tainted with it â¦â¦ â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At paragraph 54 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â...â¦ in considering the range of the <i>Hampshire Land</i> principle, a common sense approach is required.  The task is to consider at whom the fraud is directed.  If it is directed at thecompany, the exception will apply.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At paragraph 73 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn these circumstances, I am of the opinion that this is not a case in which the <i>Hampshire Land</i> principle has any application.  The essence of the case is that it is one in which the sole directing mind and will of the companyprocured it to enter into fraudulent transactions with banks.  It was the company that dealt with the banks and, so it seems to me,clear that, as between the company and the banks, the principles of attribution require the dishonesty of the companyâs sole humanagent to be imputed to the company. â¦â¦ It is not therefore a case in which the company was the target, or the victim, of itsagentâs dishonesty.  It was itself the fraudster, it was not the target of the fraud â¦â¦ â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> Relying on <i>Moore Stephens</i>, Mr. Scott submitted that in the present case, the Plaintiffs were, or at least arguably so, victims of the wrongdoing because itwas the Plaintiffsâ assets which were lost as a result of the wrongdoing.  Knowledge of the individual directors should not beattributed to the companies.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> On the other hand, Mr. Yu urged me to read the decision in context.  The case was one of fraud and it does not support a propositionthat the <i>Hampshire Land</i> principle has wider application to wrongdoings falling short of equitable fraud against the company.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> Mr. Yu further submitted, which I accept, that <i>Moore Stephens</i> was essentially concerned with the fraud of the sole controlling director of the company which had been practised against the victimbank, KB.  It was not a case of a company itself being an innocent victim of deception by its officers.  As it is apparent from paragraph73 of Rimer LJâs judgment, the company was party to the fraud, not an innocent victim of it<a>[35]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> Having considered the authorities referred to above, and in particular, the statement of the principle by Leggatt LJ in <i>R. v. Rozeik</i><i>,</i> it seems to me unnecessary to define the exclusionary rule under the âfraud exceptionâ by reference to fraud or equitable fraud,or breach of duties, or delinquency, or some other shades of irregularity or wrongdoing.  As the authorities have shown, the applicationof the exclusionary rule is, to a large extent, based on degree and commonsense.  As I understand it, essentially, the rule operatesto prevent an officerâs knowledge from being imputed to the company if the relevant knowledge is that pertains to the officerâswrongful act directed against the company and of which the company itself is the victim.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> Mr. Scott also referred to passages in Yuen Jâs judgment in <i>China Everbright-IHD Pacific Ltd. v. Châng Poh</i><a>[36]</a>, and argued that where there was a constant turnover in membership of the board, knowledge of one or more directors should not readilybe attributed to the company.  However, as Mr. Yu pointed out, the passages in the judgment are not concerned with the principlesof attribution, but rather whether the company, with <i>reasonable diligence</i>, could have discovered the fraud.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>Evidence of Knowledge</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> Before I turn to discuss the evidence, I wish to make a preliminary observation.  When a plaintiff invokes section 31, as in thepresent case, it is he who bears the onus of setting up a case that he does not have knowledge of an essential fact so that the limitationperiod should be postponed<a>[37]</a>.  It is therefore incumbent upon the Plaintiffs to identify clearly any such fact(s) in respect of which they say knowledge is wanting. Only when that is done would the Court be in a position to assess, on all the materials available, whether it is at least arguablethat the Plaintiffs did not acquire knowledge of the facts relevant to their causes of action at the time in question.  In this regard,I think it is a fair criticism by the Defendants that the Plaintiffs have failed to pinpoint the critical fact(s), as distinct frommatters of detail, which they contend were unknown to them at the material time. </p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> I now turn to examine the available evidence in the present case.  The Defendants have drawn my attention to the composition of theExecutive Committee of NCHKGp, and the respective boards of directors of NCHKCap and NCHKFin between 1993 and 1998.  As earlier noted,the executive and management powers of NCHKGp have been delegated to the Executive Committee, and among its members, Mr. P.C. Chiuhas been the finance director on the committee from 18 February 1993 up to the companiesâ liquidation.  On the other hand, thenumber of directors on the boards of NCHKCap and NCHKFin is relatively small.  Among the directors, the following are common to bothNCHKCap and NCHKFin:  Franco Ho<a>[38]</a>, William Kwong<a>[39]</a>, Anthony Wong<a>[40]</a> and Patrick Wong<a>[41]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> In addition, there was a Credit Committee comprising P.C. Chiu, Anthony Wong, Franco Ho and William Kwong.  The Credit Committeewas charged specifically with monitoring the operations and credit risks of the group, and approving all trading credits grantedto clients.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> The Defendants invited me to have specific regard to the following matters which, they say, show conclusively the Plaintiffsâ knowledgeof the matters now complained of.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> The first are 2 memoranda from P.C. Chiu to William Kwong, dated 4 January and 6 June 1995.  In them, P.C. Chiu set out the outstandingindebtedness, among others, of 6 of the 7 Debtors (with the exception of Eternal March which was a non-securities trading client). It is clear from the information that the outstanding indebtedness vastly exceeded the market value of the securities, and in somecases, also exceeded the approved credit limit.  In the latter memorandum, P.C. Chiu wrote :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI like to draw your special attention on the debt level that it is higher than we can tolerate and it also increases the Companyâsexposure on doubtful debts.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> There is also the E&amp;Yâs âmanagement letterâ dated 15 March 1995 to the board of NCHKCap.  The letter set out the deficienciesin the accounting systems and internal controls of the group as was observed during their interim audit for the period ending 31December 1994.  Among the weaknesses identified was a warning</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ that several corporate customers had failed to deposit the required margin when they were called upon.  In addition, customersâsecurities and open contacts were not sold or liquidated as a result of the shortfall in margin.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> Further, there are the 2 draft LSRs (one of which has already been referred to earlier).  They were produced by E&amp;Y pursuantto their engagement to conduct a review of NCHKFinâs money lending activities.  It is an extensive review and I do not proposeto set out in detail the contents of the 2 reports.  It suffices to note that in section 6.1 of the 1<sup>st</sup> draft LSRs, there was a detailed review of the credit application, the vetting, approval and monitoring procedures for the loansextended to a number of the securities trading clients with balance of more than $25 million as at 31 July 1997.  Six of the 7 Debtorswere among those whose margin financing position was individually analysed, and they each showed that their outstanding positionswere substantially under-secured.  The following section in the report (section 6.2) contains a similar review of the non-securitiestrading clients with outstanding loan balances of more than $25 million.  Among them was Eternal March with an outstanding balanceover $75 million.  Other than personal guarantees, no specific security was identified.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> The Executive Summary in the 1st LSR contains the following observation :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1.4 Our review has highlighted a number of issues, all of which are accepted by NCHK and are being addressed.  They key ones being:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a)  Especially in the light of the recent market crash, the Group as a whole is exposed to a very real risk of default on some ofits outstanding margin financing activities â¦â¦;</p>            <p class="quote">(b)  â¦â¦ The debt provisions are hard to assess given the fact that NCHK do have verbal agreement from most, if not all, of theiroutstanding debtors as regards repayment.  Our concern stems from the recent market volatility and whether some of the debtors retainthe ability to repay.  The provision has been suggested against two specific debts being, Golden Bridge and Great Merit, althoughin essence it should be seen as more of a general provision to address potential credit losses against the entire book.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> The 2<sup>nd</sup> draft LSR contains the up-dated position with respect to the various debtors.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> In addition, NCHKFin produced monthly statements and they were available to the management.  The statements, according to the liquidatorsâown evidence, show that âthe 7 Debtors were consistently short on security and there was no or no adequate marginâ.  These monthlystatements had been examined by the liquidators upon their appointment in 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> The correspondence shows that Patrick Wong and P.C. Chiu were closely involved in E&amp;Yâs preparation of the LSRs, as well asliaising with the SFC in relation to the review.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> On the basis of the contents of draft LSRs, I have no difficulty accepting Mr. Millsâ remarks (one of E&amp;Yâs partners) thatthose documents have clearly revealed various aspects of concern in NCHKFinâs business, including, that the loans made by NCHKFincomprised a material part of the NCHKGpâs net current assets as at 31 July 1997; that a large part of those assets representedloans made by NCHKFin to a small number of major clients (including the 7 Debtors), which loans were substantially under-collateralised;that in many cases, the only collateral for margin financing was the securities purchased with it and the market value of the collateralwas far less than the outstanding balance of the loans; that the margin call procedures were discretionary and subject to Managementoverride, and were considered ineffective and inadequate for NCHKFin to manage its margin finance business.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> The 2 LSRs were commissioned by NCHKCap and NCHKFin.  According to the LSRs, Patrick Wongâs appointment as a director for bothNCHKCap and NCHKFin, had strengthened the senior management, and he had devoted a lot of time and effort in reviewing the systemof internal control within the group.  He had obviously played an important role in the review.  There can be no doubt that his knowledgederived from his close involvement must be knowledge of the respective companies.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> I do not think it can be suggested â in my view not even arguably â that the reports were not known to NCHKCap and NCHKFin. In any event, it is not a question whether these reports actually came to the knowledge of the directors.  Knowledge of these reportswould clearly have been imputed to the respective boards by virtue of section 31(7). </p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> Further, as the evidence shows, all the matters stated in the reports were plainly known to the finance director of the ExecutiveCommittee, P.C. Chiu, who was also a member of the Credit Committee.  He himself was the author of the 2 memoranda to William Kwongin 1995.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> As would be remembered, the Executive Committee was delegated with powers of management of the group business, whereas the CreditCommittee was specifically charged with monitoring the credit risks of the group.  In such positions, P.C. Chiuâs knowledge ofthe matters stated in the reports (in particular, in relation to matters concerning the credit positions of the various clients ofNCHKFin, including, relevantly, the 7 Debtors) was plainly attributable to the Executive Committee and the Credit Committee.  Assuch, I do not think it is arguable that knowledge acquired by P.C. Chiu was not knowledge of NCHKGp.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> I do not think the fact that NCHKGp has a board of 50 members and not each of them had actual knowledge of such matters; or that2 of the Executive Committee members (Messrs. Tian and Yu) did not attend meetings or take any active part in the management of thegroupâs business; or even the fact that some shareholders had written to the chairman to complain about lack of corporate informationfrom the Executive Committee to the board of directors<a>[42]</a>, is any answer to the point.  The question is not whether some of those in the management might not have the requisite knowledge,rather the question in the present case is whether by operation of the general rules of attribution, the knowledge acquired by thosespecifically charged with monitoring the credit positions of the clients should be imputed to the company.  My view on this questionis a clear affirmative.</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> In light of the discussion above, I think it is beyond argument that prior to the liquidation of the companies, the first of theEssential Facts â that the business of NCHKFin was being conducted in an imprudent or improper manner, and more specifically, thatsubstantial indebtedness had accrued by the 7 Debtors, who had not provided sufficient security and who did not otherwise possesssubstantial assets â must have been within the knowledge (actual or imputed under section 31(7)) of NCHKCap, NCHKFin, the CreditCommittee, the Executive Committee, and NCHKGp.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> Furthermore, it must also be known to them, or they must be taken to know by reason of section 31(7), the fact that E&amp;Y had givenunqualified audit reports and that no advice had been given as to making provisions for the loans to the 7 Debtors.  It must furtherbe known to them as a fact, or they must again be deemed to know, that the securities held from these debtors had not been realisedat the various points in time in question, and that further advances were continued to be made to these debtors.  I do not see anyof the Essential Facts could arguably be unknown to them (in the section 31 sense), before liquidation.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> This is not a case where the âfraud exceptionâ applies to prevent the knowledge of one or more directors from being attributedto NCHKCap, NCHKFin, the Credit Committee, the Executive Committee or NCHKGp.  Clearly, neither of the 2 key figures, P.C. Chiu andPatrick Wong have been accused of having conducted themselves fraudulently, dishonestly or have otherwise committed breaches of duties<i>against the respective companies</i>.  Also insofar as the knowledge acquired from the LSRs by the boards of NCHKCap and NCHKFin is concerned, apart from William Kwong(in relation to whom there will be further discussion in this judgment) none of Franco Ho, Anthony Wong, and others making up theboards have been accused of any wrongdoing whatsoever.</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a> I have been referred to what is called the âSandy Black Reportâ.  Mr. Black was engaged by the liquidators to review the E&amp;Yworking papers to see if there was evidence of negligence and to help formulate the claims against the Defendants.  An extensivereport was produced.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> In the discussion of the role of Wu, the report highlights<a>[43]</a> the fact that Wu had close relationships with the chairman, T.T. Tsui, and William Kwong.  Allegedly, because of the relationship,certain unusual transactions involving Wu were processed through the accounts of NCHKFin and NCHKCap.  However, insofar as the transactionsinvolving the 7 Debtors are concerned, there is nothing to suggest that William Kwong acted in breach of duty, let alone dishonestlyor fraudulently.  On the contrary, the Re-A-PoC refers to a memorandum from William Kwong in January 1995, alerting Wu to the marginshortfalls of Golden Bridge and Topview<a>[44]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> Taking all matters into account, I do not think it is open to the Plaintiffs to argue that NCHKCap, NCHKFin or NCHKGp did not haveactual or imputed knowledge of all the Essential Facts pertaining to what the Plaintiffs now complain of regarding their CorporateDebtors Claim.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> In any event, upon the appointment of the liquidators in early 1999, they would be fixed with knowledge, actual or imputed, of allthe Essential Facts.  As the Defendants have submitted, the liquidators have admitted that they had knowledge of the state of NCHKFinâsaccount and also the under-collateralisation of the loans soon after their appointment.  Given the low threshold for triggering theapplication of section 31(5)(a), the Plaintiffs have clearly failed to set up an arguable case that one or more of those EssentialFacts were unknown to or could not reasonably have been ascertained by the liquidators so as to postpone the running of time untila moment within 3 years of the commencement of the respective actions.</p>    <p class="heading">Deliberate Concealment under Section 26 â Corporate Debtors Claim</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> Section 26 provides :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1)    Subject to subsection (4), where in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by this Ordinance,either â</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a)  â¦â¦..</p>            <p class="quote">(b)  Any fact relevant to the plaintiffâs right of action has been deliberately concealed from him by the defendant;</p>            <p class="quote">(c)  ..â¦. </p>            <p class="quote">the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the â¦â¦ concealment or could with reasonablediligence have discovered it.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)  For the purpose of subsection (1), deliberate commission of a breach of duty in circumstances in which it is unlikely to be discoveredfor some time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in that breach of duty.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(6)  Sections 31 and 32 shall not apply to any action to which subsection (1)(b) applies (and accordingly the period of limitationreferred to in that subsection, in any case to which either of those sections would otherwise apply, is the period applicable undersection 4(1)).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> The crucial phrase âany fact relevant to the plaintiffâs right of actionâ in subsection (1)(b) was explained by the EnglishCourt of Appeal in <i>Johnson v. Chief Constable of Surrey</i><a>[45]</a>.  <i>Johnsonâs case</i> concerned a claim for damages for false imprisonment, and a question arose as to whether material facts had been concealed from theplaintiff so as to attract the application of the equivalent of our section 26(1)(b) to save the action from being time-barred. Rose LJ said the following :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ The crucial question is as to the meaning of the words in section 32(1)(b) [equivalent of our section 26(1)(b)] âany factrelevant to the plaintiffâs right of action.â  It is to be noted that the statute does not refer to âthe plaintiffâs actionâbut to his âright of actionâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">For my part, I accept Mr Glasgowâs [counsel for the defendant] submission that, in construing the section, there is no middle groundbetween facts and evidence.  It may be that the plaintiffâs case following the quashing of the convictions would be evidentiallystronger and have a better prospect of success.  But I am unable to accept Mr Hytnerâs [counsel for the plaintiff] submission thatthe quashing of the convictions adds anything to the plaintiffâs knowledge of facts relevant to his right of action.  Facts whichimprove prospects of success are not, as it seems to me, facts relevant to his right of action. â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a> Similarly, Russell LJ in <i>Johnson</i> spoke of giving the words a narrow interpretation, and any fact in question must be relevant to the plaintiffâs âright of actionâand not to âthe plaintiffâs actionâ or âhis caseâ or âhis right to damagesâ.  Neill LJ said those words meant âanyfact which the plaintiff has to prove to establish a prima facie case.â  See also Buxton LJ in <i>The âKriti Palmâ</i><a>[46]</a> at para. 453; and Neill LJ in <i>C. v. Mirror Group Newspapers</i> <a>[47]</a> at p.138 G-H.</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> Further, the authorities of <i>Sheldon v. R.H.M. Outhwaite Ltd.</i><a>[48]</a> and <i>Ezekiel v. Lehrer</i><a>[49]</a> establish clearly that there can be no question of âconcealmentâ when the plaintiff is already aware of the facts relevant tohis right of action.  In <i>Sheldon</i>, Lord Browne-Wilkinson said<a>[50]</a> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFor myself, I do not find it absurd that the effect of section 32(1) [equivalent of our section 26(1)(b)] is to afford to the plaintiffa full six-year period of limitation from the date of the discovery of the concealment.  In such a case, the plaintiff must havebeen ignorant of the relevant facts during the period preceding the concealment: if he knew of them, no subsequent act of the defendantcan have concealed them from him.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In <i>Ezekiel</i>, Jonathan Parker LJ similarly said<a>[51]</a> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âLord Browne-Wilkinsonâs reference [in <i>Sheldon</i>] to âthe period preceding the concealmentâ is plainly a reference to the period beginning with the accrual of the cause of action. In my judgment a Claimant who was at some point during that period aware of the fact which he alleges was subsequently concealedfrom him cannot avail himself of section 32(1)(b) [equivalent of our section 26(1)(b)].â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> The particulars for deliberate concealment are given in the Plaintiffsâ draft Reply.  However, despite the extensive particulars,they do not clearly point to how it is said that the Plaintiffs lacked knowledge of any fact(s) essential to their complaint forbreach of duties.  I do not propose to repeat here my reasons for concluding that the Plaintiffs <i>did have knowledge</i> of all the Essential Facts.  On the basis of the knowledge already acquired by the Plaintiffs, (and subsequently by the liquidatorsupon their appointment) I also conclude that the Plaintiffs have failed to set up an arguable case that there has been concealmentof fact(s) relevant to their right of action.  In this connection, it should also be borne in mind Lord Browne-Wilkinsonâs statementin <i>Sheldon</i> that âfacts relevant to the plaintiffâs right of actionâ do not include facts which improve the plaintiffâs prospect of success. The liquidatorsâ complaint as to concealment of details of E&amp;Yâs audit work; destruction of the audit working papers; orthe obstruction or opposition to the section 221 proceedings, are therefore clearly irrelevant for the present purpose. They arenot essential matters or ârelevant factsâ for the purpose of section 26(1)(b).</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> On the other hand, insofar as the Plaintiffs also allege that there was deliberate concealment of the conflict of interest by reasonof Wuâs membership on the Executive Committee as financial adviser and E&amp;Yâs position as auditors, such a fact was in factstated expressly in NCHKGpâs financial statements.  I fail to see any credible argument that conflict of interest has been concealed.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> The Plaintiffs further contend that the breaches of duty committed by the Defendants were committed deliberately and section 26(3)is engaged.  However, the short answer is that section 26(3) merely provides that âdeliberate commission of a breach of duty inwhich it is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in that breach of dutyâ. On my earlier finding that the Plaintiffs did have knowledge of the facts essential to their complaint and such knowledge had renderedallegations of deliberate concealment irrelevant, there is no room for the operation of section 26(3).  The allegations of deliberatebreach of duty therefore do not assist the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p class="heading">Claim in Equity &amp; Equitable Compensation â Corporate Debtors Claim</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> In addition to putting their case on contract and negligence, the Plaintiffs also pleaded breach of fiduciary duties on the partsof the Defendants, based on their position as auditors, and as an officer and shadow or <i>de facto</i> director of the Plaintiffs.  The essence of the Plaintiffsâ complaint is that the Defendants have placed themselves in a positionof conflict of interest, and had ultimately failed to conduct themselves in the best interest of the Plaintiffs.  The Plaintiffsclaim equitable compensation for breach of such duties.</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a> As the Defendants have submitted, where a claim is made in equity which corresponds to a claim at common law, the statutory limitationperiod applicable to the common law claim will be applied to the claim in equity, albeit that no limitation period is expressly prescribedby statute in respect of the equitable claim.  Section 4(7) of the Ordinance provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(7)    This section shall not apply to any claim â¦â¦ for other equitable relief, except in so far as any provision thereof maybe applied by the court by analogy in like manner as the corresponding enactment contained in the Limitation Act 1980 is appliedin the English Courts.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> The corresponding provision under the Limitation Act 1980 is section 36(1), which is in the following terms :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1)    The following time limits under this Act [for actions founded on tort and simple contract] shall not apply to any claimâ¦â¦. for other equitable relief, except in so far as any such time limit may be applied by the court by analogy in like manneras the corresponding time limit under any enactment repealed by the Limitation Act 1939 was applied before 1 July 1940.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a> The authors of <i>Snellâs Equity</i><a>[52]</a>explain thus</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFor the purpose of determining appropriate limitation period, a breach of fiduciary duty is treated as equivalent to a breach oftrust.  In general, therefore, a six-year limitation period applies to claims against fiduciaries for breach of fiduciary duty, eitherby direct application of the Limitation Act 1980 or by analogy with that statute.  Where a claim for breach of fiduciary duty isbased on the same facts as a claim for breach of contract or a claim in tort, and there is âcorrespondenceâ between the remediesavailable, the six-year limitation period is applied by analogy.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a> In <i>Cia de Seguros Imperio v. Heath (REBX) Ltd.</i><a>[53]</a>, which was a claim for compensation for dishonest breach of fiduciary duty, Waller LJ said</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn my view the authorities cited by Mr. Gross and the broad principles set out in the above quotations support the submission thatequity would have taken the view that it should apply the statute by analogy to a claim for damages or compensation for a dishonestbreach of fiduciary duty.  I say that because what is alleged against Heaths as giving rise to the dishonest breach of fiduciaryduty are precisely those facts which are also relied on for alleging breach of contract or breach of duty in tort.  It is true thatthere is an extra allegation of âintentionâ but that does not detract from the fact that the essential factual allegations arethe same.  Furthermore, the claim is one of âdamagesâ.  The prayer for relief has now been amended with our leave to add a claimfor âequitable compensationâ, but the reality of the claim is that it is one for damages, the assessment of which would be nodifferent whether the claim was maintained as a breach of contract claim or continued simply as a dishonest breach of fiduciary dutyclaim.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Clarke LJ expressed a similar view<a>[54]</a> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI would certainly have expected a court of equity to apply the common law time limits by analogy on the facts of this case.  AsWaller LJ has pointed out, â¦â¦. the essential nature of the pleaded case is the same whether it is put as damages for breach ofcontract, damages for breach of duty or damages (or compensation) for breach of fiduciary duty.  The only additional element is thedefendantâs alleged intention, which on the facts here adds nothing of substance to the claim for damages.  Indeed it would bequite unnecessary to include this claim if it were not thought necessary to do so in order to advance the time bar argument.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a> In the present case, the relief sought for breach of fiduciary duties in relation to the Corporate Debtors Claim, although claimedas equitable compensation, is plainly founded on essentially the same factual matters as the claims in negligence and contract. Quoting the words of Clarke LJ, the conflict of interest element here âadds nothing of substance to the claim for damagesâ. The equitable claims are clearly subject to the same limitation periods by analogy under s.4(7).</p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a> The Plaintiffs pointed to the so-called âTriangular Debt Arrangementâ as an illustration of the Defendantsâ breach of duties. It is alleged that E&amp;Y had wrongly treated a sum of over $493 million due from Topview to NCHKFin, and the equivalent sum owedby NCHKFin to NCHKGp as âback to back loansâ.  The error, it is said, arose from the fact that it was Century City and RegalHotels who provided the funds for NCHKGp to be advanced to NCHKFin and then to Topview, and that Century City and Regal Hotels hadbeen erroneously treated as equivalent to Topview.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a> It is alleged that because of E&amp;Yâs failure to warn or their concealment of the existence of the Triangular Debt Arrangement,it has led to a number of steps having been taken to the serious detriment of NCHKGp (including the disposal of valuable assets toa subsidiary of Century City; the appointment of Kenneth Ng (a director of Century City) to the Executive Committee; and the ExecutiveCommitteeâs approval of certain power of attorney and declaration of trust).  All these steps eventually resulted in NCHKGpâsloss of the opportunity of avoiding its liability vis-Ã -vis Century City and Regal Hotels by way of set-off<a>[55]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a> However, as Mr. Yu submitted, although the Triangular Debt Arrangement is said to support the allegation of breach of fiduciary duties,in substance it is no more than a claim that E&amp;Y has negligently failed to properly advise the Plaintiffs in respect of thattransaction.  The fact that the failure to advise has led to the entering into new arrangements with Century City and Regal Hotelsto the detriment of the Plaintiffs, does not cloth the claim with fiduciary characteristics.</p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a> In any event, even if the breach arising from the Triangular Debt Arrangement is fiduciary in nature, that does not have the effectof avoiding the application of the primary limitation periods as in the case of actions founded on contract and negligence: <i>Cia de Seguros Imperio<a>[56]</a></i>.</p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a> The Plaintiffs, however, contend that even if the equitable claims fall within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(7)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> by analogy, they are claims by a beneficiary under a trust in respect of fraud or fraudulent breach of trust to which a trustee wasa party or privy, and by reason of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20(1)</a>, no limitation period applies.  Mr. Scott further submitted that the nature of the fraud need only be pleaded in the Reply as andwhen the Defendants raise a defence of limitation, citing <i>Lewin on Trust</i>, 17<sup>th</sup> edition, para. 44-10 and <i>Banque Commerciale S.A. v. Akhil Holdings Ltd.</i><a>[57]</a> (a decision on the Australian legislation equivalent to our <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20(1)(a)).</a></p>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a> However, as the pleadings presently stand (including the draft Reply) I am unable to discern exactly how the case of fraud againsteach of the Defendants is framed.  My comment is not simply confined to matters of pleading.  More importantly, on the materialsbefore me I do not see the basis of the argument that the claim for breach of fiduciary duties here involves the element of fraudon the part of the Defendants.  On the Corporate Debtors Claim, the Sandy Black Report certainly does not go so far as to suggestfraud on the part of the Defendants.  As I see it, even if my conclusion as to application of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(7)</a> by analogy is wrong, the claim for breach of fiduciary duties is nevertheless governed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20(2)</a>, where a 6-year limitation period still applies.</p>    <p class="heading">The Retainer Fees Claim</p>    <p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a> This claim is made by NCHKGp against both Defendants for restitution of the fees paid to E&amp;Y between 1 February 1993 and 24 January1997, totalling $6.4 million.  This claim is made up of 3 sums, 2 specific sums of $500,000 each, and other monthly fees aggregating$5,400,000.  The gist of the claim has already been outlined earlier in this judgment<a>[58]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a> Insofar as NCHKGp claims not to be liable for such fees (whether on the ground that the works had not in fact been performed by Wuand E&amp;Y; or by reason of their being pre-incorporation expenses; or that they were paid in breach of the articles without properauthority of the company) the nature of such a claim is restitutionary on the basis of money had and received.  As such, it is subjectto the same 6-year limitation period as actions founded on contract: <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank v.

As Mr. Strachan pointed out, the liquidators themselves made reference to the fact that the invoices forthe 2 sums were in fact among E&amp;Yâs correspondence files.  It is for the Plaintiffs to make out a case that the company whomade the payments was either not aware of its own payments or the purpose of such payments.  The question is not whether E&amp;Yhad concealed the fact of these payments <i>from the liquidators</i>.  The question is whether NCHKGp has set up a case that the Defendants had concealed these payments from the company <i>when they were made</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a> Mr. Strachan further pointed out that there is evidence from Mr. Mills that the invoices were settled by NCHKGp on or around theirrespective dates.  NCHKGpâs bank accounts were operated by any two of the authorized signatory directors.  Those who had signedthe cheques would have knowledge of the payments.  Such knowledge would be knowledge attributable to the company.  Unless NCHKGpis able to adduce credible evidence that those responsible for making the payments did so to commit a wrong against the company,knowledge on their parts being knowledge of the company, would preclude the application of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26:</a> see <i>Sheldon v.

Lehrer</i><a>[63]</a> discussed above.</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a> My view is that the Plaintiffs have failed to properly set up a case of deliberate concealment in relation to the retainer fees. Such failure makes it difficult, if not impossible, to assess whether there is at least an arguable case that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26</a> might be engaged, or whether it is defeated by the fact that NCHKGp itself should be treated as already in possession of knowledgeof the essential fact(s).</p>    <p class="heading">The Audit Fees Claim</p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a> This claim is made only against E&amp;Y.  The sum pleaded in paragraph 80 of the Re-A-PoC as fees and disbursements paid to E&amp;Yis $27,862,673.  However, only 2 specific amounts, namely, $5,055,426 and $2,854,684 are claimed by NCHKGp and NCHKCap respectively<a>[64]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a> For the same reason as in the Retainer Fees Claim, I am of the view that the applicable limitation period is 6 years from the respectivepayments of those fees. </p>    <p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a> However, these fees are said to have been paid between February 1993 and 30 January 1999.  There is no breakdown as to when paymentfor each sum was made.  As far as E&amp;Y is concerned, any payment after 30 July 1998 would not yet be out of time.  For the purposeof E&amp;Yâs strike out application, NCHKGpâs claim for $5,055,426 and NCHKCapâs claim for $2,854,684 are not plainly and obviouslytime-barred.</p>    <p class="heading">The Accounts Claims</p>    <p><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a> The Plaintiffs make 3 claims against Wu in respect of the unusual transactions in his accounts allegedly held by him with NCHKCap.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>The Galvanic-Transfer Claim</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a> In this claim, it is alleged that Wu had a short term loan account with NCHKCap.  As at 31 December 1994, an amount of $11,190,783was due and owed by Wu in this account.</p>    <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a> It is pleaded that âon a date after 1<sup>st</sup> January 1995, the entire sum of $11,190,783 â¦â¦ was, without commercial reason, transferred to another account with NCHK Financein the name of Galvanic Limited, â¦.. which at all material times was owned and controlled by [Wu]â<a>[65]</a>.  It is further alleged that the sole or predominant purpose of the transfer was to release Wu from personal liability for the indebtedness.</p>    <p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a> On behalf of Wu, Mr. Strachan argued that insofar as the claim is made in contract or for restitution, a 6-year limitation periodapplies.  Insofar as the claim is based upon Wuâs breach of fiduciary duties, applying <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(7)</a> or <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20(2)</a>, the limitation period is still 6 years.  The cause of action, he submitted, accrued on 31 December 1994 at the latest.</p>    <p><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a> In my view, the causes of action did not accrue on 31 December 1994 (which was only the date of the state of Wuâs account as shownin NCHKCapâs ledgers), but on the date of the wrongful transfer.  Although paragraph 88 of the Re-A-PoC does not pinpoint the date,it appears from the liquidatorsâ evidence that the transfer took place on 1 January 1995<a>[66]</a>.  That was more than 6 years before the commencement of the Action against Wu.</p>    <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a> The Plaintiffs rely on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20(1).</a>  It is alleged that the transfer to Galvanicâs account constituted a fraudulent breach of trust, or a secret profit by Wu<a>[67]</a>.  Mr. Strachan first raised a procedural objection that there was no plea of fraud in the Re-A-PoC and no reference to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20(1)</a> in the draft Reply.  However, as Mr. Scott has submitted, the Plaintiffs would still be entitled to rely on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20(1)</a> in their Reply in response to the Defendantsâ plea of limitation: see paragraph 150 above.  It is therefore important to considerthe evidence whether it supports an arguable case of fraudulent breach of trust in relation to the impugned transfer from Wuâsaccount to Galvanicâs.</p>    <p><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a> The liquidatorsâ evidence is set out in paragraph 74 of the Affirmation of Chan Wai Dune (one of the joint liquidators).  It isalleged that there is nothing in the minutes of the board of directors of NCHKCap to show any authorisation of such a transfer, norwas the company aware of Wuâs connection with Galvanic.  However, these are more in the nature of assertions rather than evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a> I have examined the Sandy Black Report.  There is a section in the report headed âGalvanic Account in Capital in 1995â<a>[68]</a>, but it concerns preferential rates of interest being granted by NCHKCap in respect of Galvanicâs account.  It has nothing to dowith the allegation concerning the transfer of Wuâs account to Galvanicâs.</p>    <p><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a> I have also considered the section headed âTreatment of Year End Balanceâ<a>[69]</a>.  I am unable to associate what is stated in that section with the present allegation I am dealing with.</p>    <p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a> I am quite unable to see any evidential basis for the assertion that the transfer was for the sole or predominant purpose of releasingWu from personal liability and hence a fraud, or fraudulent breach of trust.  My view is that NCHKCap has failed to set up even anarguable case that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20(1)</a> is engaged.</p>    <p><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a> Likewise, in order to invoke <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26(1)(b)</a>, it is for NCHKCap to identify the fact(s) relevant to its right of action alleged to have been deliberately concealed.  I do notwish to repeat essentially the same reasoning as in the case of the retainer fees.  The question is not whether Wu had concealedfrom the liquidators the fact of this transfer.  The question is whether NCHKCap has properly set up a case that Wu had concealedthe transfer from the company deliberately.</p>    <p><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a> I hold the same view that the failure of NCHKCap to properly set up the case of concealment makes it difficult, if not impossible,to assess whether there is at least an arguable case that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26</a> might be engaged, or whether it is defeated by the fact that NCHKCap itself should be treated as already having knowledge of theessential fact(s).</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>The Payment-Outs Claim</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a> This is a claim for $44,049,295, being the balance of money transferred out of Wuâs account on Wuâs instructions, such transfershaving occurred between 30 April 1994 and 31 December 1995.  <i>Prima facie</i>, a limitation period of 6 years applies to a claim for recovery of the amount running from the end of 1995 at the latest.</p>    <p><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a> By the proposed amendment in paragraph 98 of the Re-A-PoC, this claim is put on the basis that because of Wuâs position on theExecutive Committee, he was able to âcarry out the actionsâ, or alternatively, be in a position not to disclose the payment-outs. Insofar as NCHKCap intends paragraph 98 to be an averment of concealment under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26</a>, I am unable to understand exactly the way the concealment is alleged to have arisen by virtue of Wuâs position, without more. The plea as drafted is clearly deficient in particulars.  The draft Reply is hardly more illuminating.</p>    <p><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a> That said, however, Mr. Scott submitted that the Sandy Black Report shows that there is compelling evidence that Wu had concealedhis involvement in the transactions from his account, referring in particular to the backdating of documents and fictitious entries. Indeed, for instance, the discussion in relation to the loan to Enkson of $11 million transferred from Wuâs account to NCHKFinâs<a>[70]</a>; and the loan of $11 million to T.T. Tsui and eventually transferred to Great Merit<a>[71]</a>, with allegations of backdating of documents, are clearly matters relevant to making up the claim of wrongful transfers<a>[72]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a> Indeed, having considered the Sandy Black Report, I am unable to say that the allegations of deliberate concealment relating to thePayment-Outs Claim are bound to fail.  Although the case of concealment has not been properly formulated, I do not think this partof the claim should be struck out.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>The Unauthorised Interest Claim</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a> This claim concerns 2 sums paid by NCHKCap to Wu, one for $1,085,724 on 31 March 1995 and another for $150,093 between 22 May 1995and 5 December 1995.  It is alleged that these payments, purported to be interest, had not been authorised by NCHKCap.</p>    <p><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a> Insofar as these are claims for restitution, <i>prima facie</i> the 6-year limitation period applies and the causes of action for their recovery would have accrued by 5 December 1995 at the latest.</p>    <p><a name="p181" class="para" id="p181">181.</a> NCHKCap relies on deliberate concealment.  It is said that these payments were not disclosed by Wu to the board of directors of NCHKCapdespite his duty to do so.  However, as Mr. Strachan pointed out, it is the liquidatorsâ evidence that they have learned of thepayments âfrom a review of the accounting ledgersâ<a>[73]</a> and the liquidators did not suggest that these payments were not apparent from the NCHKCapâs own accounting records.  The factthat the payments did not appear in the board minutes of NCHKCap or the Executive Committee is far from being sufficient as a basisfor setting up a case of deliberate concealment.</p>    <p><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a> The Plaintiffs point to the friendship between William Kwong and Wu and to the allegation of improper purpose of these payments. However, the Sandy Black Report makes no reference to these interest payments despite the fact that the liquidators had been undertakinginvestigation since 1999.  As matters stand, NCHKCap is effectively asking the court to draw inferences of impropriety against Wuand William Kwong with regard to these payments based on other dealings between them (unrelated to the Accounts Claim here) whichthe Report says are questionable.  I do not believe a case of deliberate concealment has been properly set up.</p>    <p class="heading">Result</p>    <p><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a> Apart from the Audit Fees Claim against E&amp;Y and the Payment-Outs Claim against Wu, the other claims against the Defendants aretime-barred.</p>    <p><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a> As NCHKGp and NCHKCap have been identified separately as the claimant for the respective parts of the Audit Fees Claim<a>[74]</a>, and only NCHKCap is making a claim for the Payment-Outs, the question of who should be the proper Plaintiff and âreflective lossâdoes not arise.
