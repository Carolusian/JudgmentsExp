Whether or not the respondent was the person who committed the offence under Regulation 29 on the basisof which the Commissioner purported to cancel the registration of AP3300, is not apparent. On the 30th October, the Commissionercaused to be posted by ordinary mail a letter to the respondent, as the registered owner of AP3300, notifying the respondent thatin the exercise of his powers under Regulation 17D the Commissioner had cancelled the registration of this vehicle. The letter sosent was apparently a standard letter of a type habitually used by the Commissioner in all cases - and I emphasize the words "inall cases" - where there had been a conviction under Regulation 29. It was the invariable practice of the Commissioner in all suchcases, irrespective as to whether the registered owner was in fact the driver of the vehicle at the time of the commission of theoffence, to issue a letter cancelling the registration of the vehicle in relation to which the offence was committed. There was noevidence that the letter ever, in fact, reached the respondent. Remarkable though it may be, however, the fact that the registeredowner may never have been informed of the fact of cancellation of the registration of his car is of no avail to him since Regulation17F. (1), although requiring the Commissioner within seven days from the date of such cancellation by him, to notify the owner ofthe vehicle of the act of cancellation expressly goes on to provide:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(2) Failure to comply with paragraph (1) shall not affect the validity of -</p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="15%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="74%" class="quote">any refusal by the Commissioner to register; or</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="15%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="74%" class="quote">the cancellation by the Commissioner of the registration of,</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">any motor vehicle."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Nor does the matter end there: the luckless owner, if he should drive the car - or lend it to someone else to drive - after the registrationhas been cancelled under Regulation 17D, despite the fact that has never been notified of any such cancellation, renders both himselfand the unwitting driver of the car, liable to prosecution under Regulation 17F for driving, or permitting someone else to drive,an unregistered motor vehicle. Finally, one may postulate the question as to what would be the position in law, in relation to hispolicy of insurance, whether it be merely a compulsory third party policy of insurance or a comprehensive policy, of the owner ofa private car in the following circumstances: the owner lends the car to a relative or friend who, unbeknown to him, commits an offenceunder Regulation 29 - an offence such as using the car as a private taxi or picking up, or even soliciting, a passenger for hireor reward; the person to whom the car has been lent is prosecuted and convicted but conceals this fact from the owner of the car;the Commissioner, acting under Regulation 17D, cancels the registration of the car; the owner, either within seven days of the dateof such cancellation - the notice of such cancellation not yet having reached him - or, alternatively, long after such cancellation- the Commissioner having omitted to send him a notice of such cancellation (but such omission under Regulation 17F(2) not invalidatingthe fact of de-registration) drives his car and has a serious accident; that he is liable to prosecution under Regulation 17E fordriving an unregistered car - even though he never knew it had been deregistered - is apparent. But is his insurance invalidatedby reason of the fact that he has been driving an unregistered car? (Regulation 3 provides that "A vehicle licence shall not be issuedin respect of a motor vehicle until such motor vehicle has been registered:). And if his insurance policy is so invalidated, quiteapart from the serious financial loss that he may consequently suffer, is he also liable to further prosecution for having drivena car without having the requisite third party policy of insurance in force at the time? These are but some of the problems theseunhappy regulations raise.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> For my part, I accept the argument of the Solicitor General that subsidiary legislation cannot be held to be ultra vires simply becausea court may regard it as unreasonable. Different considerations arise where such subsidiary legislation is, in itself not only unreasonablebut contrary to natural justice and no express power is contained in the parent legislation enabling this to be done. This distinctionwas made by this court in the recent case of <u>Lau Ping</u> v. <u>The Queen</u><sup>(1)</sup>. In that case, this court held that the then existing Regulation 41B of the Road Traffic (Taxis, Public Omnibuses, Public Light Busesand Public Cars) Regulations which compelled the court, upon certain types of traffic offences being proved, mandatorily to orderthe detention of the vehicle in respect of which the offence had been committed, without giving the owner of the vehicle an opportunityto be heard, abrogated fundamental common law principles that no man shall be deprived of his property without first being givenan opportunity of being heard, and in the absence of conferment of such an express power from the parent legislation, was ultra viresthe enabling section of the Ordinance under which the regulation itself purported to be made.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The crucial question before us is whether Regulation 17D, which enables the Commissioner to cancel the registration of a vehicleor refuse to register it, is ultra vires the section of the Ordinance - <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374" class="autolink_findacts">Road Traffic Ordinance</a> - under which it purports to be made. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4(1)(b)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374" class="autolink_findacts">Road Traffic Ordinance</a> provides for, inter alia:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%" class="quote">"(b)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="79%" class="quote">the registration and licensing of motor vehicles within the classes referred to in subsection (2) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a> or any division of any such class;"</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 2(2)</a> of the Ordinance, as amended by subsequent legislation, sets out eleven different classes into which vehicles may be divided forthe purpose of registration.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4(1)(b)</a> furthers the purpose of classification provided under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 2(2)</a> by enabling the registration and licensing of those classified vehicles. In so far as registration is concerned, if one looks atthe original regulations in their inception they deal with such matters as the manner and method of registration, display of registrationmarks, change of ownership, cancellation of registration where a vehicle has been broken up or destroyed, and cancellation of a registrationwhere a vehicle has not been licensed for a period of over two years. Under Regulation 17 power is given to the Commissioner to refuseto register a motor vehicle in certain circumstances. Power is also given - and having regard to the enabling provision of Section4(1)(j) perfectly validly given - to the Commissioner to limit the number of vehicles which may be registered or licensed in certainclasses. But, for my part, in the absence of clear words contained in the enabling section itself, I am unable to agree that thepower conferred under Section 4(1)(b), as it now stands, to make regulations for the registration of motor vehicles within specifiedclasses, empowers the Governor-in-Council to make regulations enabling the Commissioner to refuse to register or cancel the registrationof vehicles which have been used for the commission of an offence - an offence itself created by Regulation 29 - involving the useof the vehicle for a purpose outside the class or category for which it has been licensed. Nor am I satisfied, as contended by theSolicitor General, that it can be said that it was clearly within the contemplation of the Legistlature that regulations for de-registrationor cancellation of a registration - what, in effect, is clearly a penal provision - should be an integral part of the general schemeof registration provided for under Section 4 of the Ordinance. Section 4(3) of the Ordinance provides that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(3) Any regulation made under this section may provide that a contravention thereof shall be an offence and may provide punishmentand penalties for such offence not exceeding a fine of one thousand dollars and imprisonment for six months."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> It was contended by the Solicitor General that the registration of a vehicle and the issue of a licence was a privilege and not aright and that, as a consequence, the withdrawal, cancellation or refusal to renew or issue a licence was an administrative act thetaking of which was a matter solely for the Commissioner to determine. I am unable to accept that contention. Regulation 6(1) itselfprovides that upon application for registration of a motor vehicle the Commissioner, subject to the provisions of Regulation 17 shall:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%">(a)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="85%">register the motor vehicle; and</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%">(b)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="85%">assign to the motor vehicle a registration mark; and</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%">(c)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="85%">register the person by whom or on whose behalf the application for registration was made as owner of the motor vehicle; and</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%">(d)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="85%">issue to that person a registration book in respect of the motor vehicle, marked with the registration mark assigned to the motorvehicle.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Regulation 7 gives to the Commissioner a discretion to refuse to register any motor vehicle in the circumstances therein provided.It is sufficient to say that those circumstances are irrelevant to the consideration of the matter now before us. Subject, therefore,to the restricted limitations contained in Regulation 17, an applicant for the registration of a private vehicle who has compliedwith the necessary requirements has a <u>right</u> to have his vehicle registered. Once the vehicle has been validly and properly registered and licensed, to deprive the registeredand licensed owner of the right to use that vehicle is a penalty which is not provided for either in Section 4(1)(b) or Section 4(3)of the Ordinance itself. It is directly relevant here to observe that there is in Section 4 of the Ordinance no provision similarto Section 3(1) giving the Governor in-Council power to make regulations for the "seizure, impounding and detention" of vehicleswhich have been driven or used in contravention of this Ordinance. For these reasons I am of the opinion that the learned magistratewas right in holding that Regulation 17D was ultra vires.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> I would also hold that the regulation itself is contrary to natural justice in that in the absence of enabling provisions under theOrdinance itself empowering it to do so, it deprives the owner of the motor vehicle of the right to use his vehicle in circumstancesin which he may not only be not guilty of the commission of any offence but even unaware that any offence has been committed in relationto his vehicle. That deprivation of property in the past has been habitually made by the Commissioner as a matter of course, consequentupon a conviction for an offence committed under Section 29 in respect of that vehicle, without giving any opportunity to the ownerof the vehicle to be heard before he is deprived of the use of his property. There is, furthermore, the fact that coupled with thecancellation of the registration and the deprivation of the right to use his property the owner is penalized monetarily to the furtherextent that he is deprived of the value of the unexpired portion of his vehicle licence fee.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> That disposes of the first two questions put before us by the magistrate in the Case Stated.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> As to the third question postulated by the magistrate it must follow that the learned magistrate was, in my view, correct in holdingthat the Commissioner's de-registration of the respondent's motor vehicle was invalid.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> As to question 4(a), it is not disputed - nor, indeed, can it be disputed - that the courts are intended and, where the point istaken, indeed bound, to review subsidiary legislation for the purpose of determining whether or not such legislation falls withinthe powers conferred upon it by the parent body. As to the question postulated under 4(b) it is, I think, clear that unreasonablenessis not in itself a ground for holding that subsidiary legislation is ultra vires; it is only a factor to be taken into considerationwhen determining whether that subsidiary legislation falls strictly within the powers conferred by the enabling act or ordinancefrom which such subsidiary legislation derives its existence.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The Solicitor General has invited us to express our views upon whether, assuming that the principles of natural justice have notbeen complied with, what was the effect of the Commissioner's decision to de-register? Was it void ab initio or was it voidable onlyat the instance of the owner of the vehicle but good as against the rest of the world? In asking us to determine that issue in favourof his own argument that if the principles of natural justice were not complied with then the Commissioner's decision was only voidableand not void, the Solicitor General relies very heavily upon the speech of Lord Up john in the Privy Council decision of <u>Durayappah</u> v. <u>Fernando</u><sup>(2)</sup>. He submitted that the effect of Lord Upjohn's speech taken together with the speeches of Lord Devlin and Lord Evershed in that casewas to decide that a decision of the kind taken by the Commissioner in this case, if it was found to be contrary to natural justice,was voidable only and not void. The Solicitor General then delivered the coup de grace by saying that whatever views this court mighthave we were bound by the majority decision of their Lordships of the Privy Council in that case. The majority decision of theirLordships in the case of <u>Durayappah</u> v. <u>Fernando</u><sup>(2)</sup> has been the subject of considerable adverse criticism, notably of Speight, J. in the New Zealand case of <u>Denton</u> v. <u>Auckland City</u><sup>(3)</sup>. In the course of his judgment in that case, Speight,J. said that he found it "a little confusing that the same act should or shouldnot be valid according to the locus standi of the person challenging it." He expressed the view that Lord Morris's views in <u>Ridge</u> v. <u>Baldwin</u><sup>(4)</sup> had been misinterpreted in the Privy Council case of <u>Durayappah</u> v. <u>Fernando</u><sup>(2)</sup> and, in the result, he held in regard to the case then before him that the decision made by the Town Planning Committee was in breachof natural justice and was a nullity. The comment to be found in the Annual Survey of Commonwealth Law 1969 at p.137, in referenceto the decision of Speight, J. is:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"This ruling is to be welcomed, and it is to be hoped that a breach of natural justice will in future consistently be looked uponas an ultra vires action, and, as such, void ab initio."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> For my part, having arrived at the conclusion - sufficient for the purposes of this case - that Regulation 17D is, in itself, ultravires, I decline to be ensnared into the trap laid for us by the learned Solicitor General in venturing to consider whether it mightconceivably be possible that what would appear to be the majority decision of their Lordships in <u>Durayappah</u> v. <u>Fernando</u><sup>(2)</sup> might be wrong.

Has the delegate exceeded the authority so granted to him, and thus purportedto make a regulation which he was not authorised to make? If so, the regulation is ultra vires and of no legal effect. The regulationis of course, an example of subordinate legislation, or, as it is usually called, subsidiary legislation. If validly made, subsidiarylegislation has the full force and effect of an Ordinance, whether or not the Ordinance under which it is made provides that it isto have effect as if enacted in the Ordinance itself (see <u>Institute of Patent Agents</u> v. <u>Lockwood</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281894%29%20AC%20347" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1894) A.C. 347</a> per Lord Her schell at p.360-1). It is a fundamental distinction, between an Ordinance passed by the Legislative Council and subsidiarylegislative, that the validity of an Ordinance cannot (ordinarily) be challenged in the courts whereas the validity of subsidiarylegislation may be so challenged (ibid.). Among the grounds upon which subsidiary legislation may be challenged is the ground thatit is defective in substance by reason of it being ultra vires - that is to say, outside the scope of the enabling power under whichit purports to be made. It must readily be appreciated that the complexity of modern life often entails legislative bodies legislatingin general terms, leaving the details of the legislation to be filled in, as it were, by regulations and other such subsidiary legislation.But the principle must always be maintained, that what the delegate does must come within the four corners of the powers vested inhim, if it is to have effect as law. Otherwise he is assuming a power to legislate. All this is, of course, well-known, but equallyit is of great importance. No one, of course, questions the authority or competence of the legislative body to delegate; generallyspeaking, the power to do so is unrestricted by law, and it is a matter of policy, not strictly the concern of the Courts, how farit chooses to delegate its authority to enact rules of law by which all persons and things which fall within them will be bound.It is in the matter of ascertaining or establishing the extent of the delegate's authority that difficulties arise, that is to sayin construing the scope or extent of the enabling legislation - the legislation under which the delegate derives his power to makethe subsidiary legislation in question. It is apparent at a glance that the regulations with which we are concerned were extensivelyamended and added to in 1969 (by L.N. 99/69) so as to confer drastic powers on the Commissioner for Transport. Instead of, as formerly,being obliged to register <u>any</u> motor vehicle on application, the Commissioner may now refuse registration, for example, if it appears to him to be necessary orexpedient so to do in the interests of public safety or the regulation of vehicular traffic in the Colony' - whatever this may mean,or, perhaps more importantly, however this may come to he interpreted (see regulations 6 and 17(1)). Under regulation 18B the Commissionermay, by notice in the Gazette, limit the number of vehicles which may be registered or licensed as public omnibuses, public lightbuses, taxis or public cars. Under regulation 17C he may designate persons as eligible to be the owners of public light buses.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The particular regulation impugned in this case, regulation 17D, is as follows -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"17D.

It is ancillary thereto. Secondly, it will be observed that subsection (1)(b) of the section refers to subsection(2) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2.</a> That subsection classifies motor vehicles as goods vehicles, taxis, public cars, private cars etc. etc. for the purpose of registration,and it provides that the class in which any vehicle is registered is to determine 'the purpose for which the vehicle may be lawfullyused'. It is the Ordinance itself, therefore, that provides what is to be lawful user of a motor vehicle, by reference to its registeredclass. But it is the regulations which are to prescribe the contragentions thereof which are to be offences, and, subject to thelimits of fine and imprisonment laid down, to prescribe the punishment and penalties to be attached to each such offence (see <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(3)).</a> It is to be noted that nothing is said in either <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a> or <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4</a> as to any offence of unlawful user, in the sense of subsection (2) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a>, that is to say user for a purpose outside the class in which the vehicle is registered. Subsection (2) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a> does not make such user an offence, although it says, in effect, that it is unlawful; nor does it provide any penalty for such unlawfuluser. It could well be argued that no regulation made under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(3)</a> could ponalise such unlawful user, because <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(3)</a> is confined to contraventions of the regulations themselves declared to be offences by the regulations themselves, whereas user outsidethe registered class is made unlawful by the Ordinance.

But this has not been argued and I do not, therefore, propose tomake it the basis of my decision in this case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Most of the regulations in which regulation 17D appears were made under previous legislation but were preserved and have effect underthe present Ordinance. They provide, as one would expect, the necessary machinery for registration and licensing of motor vehicles.I cannot agree with the contention put forward by the Solicitor General that registration, or licensing, of private cars is in thenature of a 'privilege' which may be withheld. This is not to read the regulations as defining the scope of the enabling legislation,that is to say it is not assuming that because the regulations say that - subject to exceptions as I have indicated earlier - vehicles'shall' be registered and licensed on application, therefore the enabling legislation must have so intended. It is a case of therebeing nothing in the Ordinance, as opposed to the regulations, to suggest that registration or licensing is a matter of discretion.On the contrary, it is obviously in the interests of the identification of motor vehicles, and the control of the disposition thereof,that registration was introduced; likewise licensing in the interests of the public revenues; both according to the pattern of theEnglish legislation. The contention that registration or licensing is a more privilege quite simply means that it would be entirelya matter of discretion whether anyone could make use of his vehicle on the roads, so that anyone could inour the considerable expenseof the purchase of a new vehicle, of any class, without any assurance that he could so make use of it. If this were to have beenthe position which the enabling legislation intended, then one would have expected to see, in the enabling legislation, express powerto make regulations for curtailing the number of vehicles which may be registered and for restricting also the importation of newvehicles. Further, under regulation 3 of the regulations a vehicle cannot be licensed until it is registered. By section 4(4) ofthe Ordinance the driving or permitting the driving of an unlicensed vehicle is an offence. Unless licensed, therefore, a vehicleis virtually useless, in Hong Kong, and it can only be licensed if it is registered. The contention put forward by the SolicitorGeneral puts the owner of a car in an impossible position, in my opinion; if the contention is correct, then by withholding registrationof a motor vehicle the Commissioner may render it impossible for the vehicle to be licensed and thus entirely prevent the vehiclefrom being lawfully used on the roads. Such a power would require the most explicit enabling terms to that effect in the Ordinance,In my view, and clearly the Ordinance does not so provide.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The power under regulation 17D, to cancel registration and to refuse to re-register, is dependent, according to its terms, on a personbeing found guilty of an offence under regulation 29. To recapitulate that regulation provides -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"29(1) No person shall drive or use, or permit or suffer to be driven or used, any motor vehicle for a purpose other than that forwhich it is registered."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">It is clear, and it is accepted by the Solicitor General, that in view of the terms of regulations 17D and 29 cancellation of registrationand refusal to re-register may follow upon mis-user by <u>any</u> person, not necessarily by the registered owner - whether it is mis-user by an employee, a friend or relative who has borrowed thecar, or even a thief. This is a startling situation, to say the least. Then, under regulation 17F the Commissioner should, within7 days after the cancellation, notify the owner that the registration of his car has been cancelled. But, in the terms of this regulation,the cancellation has effect even if the notification is never given. So that it can very well happen that the owner, or anyone else,will be driving a de-registered car, for a substantial length of time, completely unaware that it is not registered and that he iscommitting an offence every time he does so. But this perhaps is more a matter of the exercise of the powers purported to be grantedby regulation 17D rather than the validity of those powers. I return to this aspect below.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> It is further argued that section 4(1)(b) of the Ordinance, set out above, in giving power to make regulations for 'registrationand licensing' of motor vehicle must be assumed to give power also to make regulations for cancelling registration and refusing re-registration.The Solicitor General supports this argument by reference to section 40(2)(b) of the Interpretation Ordinance (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap.1</a>) which reads-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), Where any Ordinance confers power -</p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="15%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="74%" class="quote">..........................................</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="15%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="74%" class="quote">to grant a licence, Crown lease, permit, authority, approval or exemption, such power shall include power to impose reasonable conditionssubject to which such licence, Crown lease, permit, authority, approval or exemption may be granted;"</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">The suggestion is that registration is a form of 'authority' or 'approval', so that a condition may be imposed enabling registrationto be withdrawn or cancelled, and that such a condition would be a reasonable one if attached to unlawful user of the vehicle. Ithink that the argument fails for the reasons I have already given on the contention that registration is a privilege, and for thefurther reason that such a matter as registration and licensing of motor vehicles is not within the contemplation of the provisionsof section 40(2)(b); those provisions, in my view, are confined to licences etc. which an empowered person has a discretion to grantor withhold - as the following section, section 41, appears to indicate. Section 41(1) reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"41(1) Where any Ordinance confers power upon any person to issue, grant, give or renew any licence, Crown lease, authority, approvalor permit, the person so empowered shall have a discretion either to issue, grant, give or renew or to refuse to issue, grant, giveor renew such licence, Crown lease, authority, approval or permit."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Regulation 17D is ultra vires also, in my view, by reason of the provisions of section 4(3) of the Ordinance - the penalty provisionreproduced earlier in this judgment. Section 4(3), in my view, must be taken to comprehend the totality of the punishment or penaltywhich may fall upon a person offending against any of the regulations, namely what it lays down - a maximum fine of $1,000 and 6months imprisonment. In other words, section 4(3) provides for no more than such fine and imprisonment, whereas the regulations asmade purport to go further in providing for de-registration as well. This reasoning is to treat the cancelling of the registrationof a vehicle, or refusal to re-register, as an additional punishment or penalty not authorised by section 4(3). So, in my view, itclearly is. A de-registered vehicle is, apart from any export value, so much scrap; as a motor vehicle in the Colony it virtuallyceases to exist in that, not being registered, it cannot be licensed, and so cannot lawfully be used on the roads. The effect ofregulation 17D, therefore, is to introduce an additional punishment or penalty above and beyond the penalties of fine and imprisonmentauthorised by section 4(3).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Then there is the important matter of the impact of cancellation of registration and refusal to re-register. Having regard to theprovisions of regulation 29, regulation 17D falls upon the registered owner regardless of any fault, or even neglect, on his part.This must be distinctly realised, as a fundamental proposition. In the case of Lau Ping ([1970] H.K.L.R. 356) I referred to certainauthorities on the matter of punishing a person for the act of another. I would repeat the relevant passages, which commence witha reference to the case of Sweet v. Parsley ([1969]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20WLR%20470" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 W.L.R. 470</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%201%20All%20ER%20347" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 1 All E.R. 347)</a> where Lord Pearce said:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">'It is one thing to make a man absolutely responsible for all his own acts and even vicariously liable for his servants if he engagesin a certain type of activity.

So here, it might be argued that what was intended by the Legislaturewas the regulation of the user of public light buses by the strictest means, regardless of any likelihood that innocent and guiltywould suffer alike; to paraphrase words used by Lord Pearce: only thus can owners be made alert to prevent offences being committedby their drivers. The learned Lord of Appeal found the argument wholly unacceptable; I am respectfully of the same opinion in thepresent context.</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">          No doubt there is a certain category of cases where the Legislature may be concerned, as a matter of policy, to impose strictvicarious liability, such as where contaminated foodstuffs are sold by a shopkeeper's employees or where a duty is imposed on a factoryoccupier to ensure the safety of his employees. In such cases, however, vicarious liability is imposed upon the basis that the defendanthas chosen to undertake a particular form of activity with its inherent risks. The case of the operation, as an owner, of a particularform of public transport cannot fall within any such category, as it appears to me. Here I would refer to the following passage fromthe Privy Council case of <u>Lim Chin Aik v. R.</u>:-</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"'But it is not enough in their Lordships' opinion merely to label the statute as one dealing with a grave social evil and from thatto infer that strict liability was intended. It is pertinent also to inquire whether putting the defendant under strict liabilitywill assist in the enforcement of the regulations. That means that there must be something he can do, directly or indirectly, bysupervision or inspection, by improvement of his business methods or control, which will promote the observance of the regulations.Unless this is so, there is no reason in penalising him, and it cannot be inferred that the legislature imposed strict liabilitymerely in order to find a luckless victim. This principle has been expressed and applied in <u>Reynolds v. G.H. Austin &amp; Sons Ltd.</u> ([1951]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20KB%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 K.B. 135)</a> and <u>James &amp; Son Ltd. v.

It must,surely, require the most explicit enabling legislation to empower a delegate to bring about such a wholly unjust situation. No suchintention appears in the enabling power, nor in my view can it be construed as implying any such intention.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> For the foregoing reasons, I hold regulation 17D to be ultra vires.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> I have not, so far, dealt with the argument that a regulation may be ultra vires because it fails to provide that the rules of naturaljustice are to be observed in its application or implementation; in particular, in the present case, the argument that regulation17D is invalid because it fails to require that, before a vehicle is de-registered by the Commissioner, the owner must be given anopportunity to make representations to the Commissioner. I cannot accept, as a general proposition, that where a regulation givespower to interfere with the rights of individuals, it is ultra vires if it does not expressly require the rules of natural justiceto be observed. The case of Lau Ping was different in that it was apparent there, from the term of the relevant regulation itself,that the owner was not intended to be heard unless he happened to be in Court when the driver was convicted. Thus there was a viceinherent in the subsidiary legislation itself. The case where the subsidiary legislation makes no such provision, i.e. no provisionwhich in itself shows that the rules of natural justice, or fairness (see <u>Re H.K.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%202%20QB%20619" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 2 Q.B. 619</a>, and <u>R. v. Gaming Board</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%202%20All%20ER%20528" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 2 All E.R. 528)</a> are to be complied with, is quite a different case. I know of no authority which goes so far as to say that subsidiary legislationaffecting persons in their proprietary rights is invalid merely because it fails expressly to say that the rules of natural justiceof fairness are to be observed. It is a different matter, however, when one comes to consider regulation 17D in the light of regulation29. Although it has no bearing on the question of ultra vires, in practice, we are told, cancellation of registration is effectedautomatically by the Commissioner whenever <u>any</u> person has been convicted of unlawful user of a vehicle, without any hearing or any enquiry as to whether the person convicted isthe registered owner or as to whether there is any complicity on his part. Thus the registered owner may lose the use of his vehicleby de-registration although not himself prosecuted or convicted and even though completely innocent of any offence. Surely it shouldbe a condition precedent to de-registration where the person driving is not the registered owner, that he should be convicted forpermitting or suffering the vehicle to be so used - which is in fact an offence provided for by regulation 29 - before his vehicleis de-registered. It follows that if it is permissible to read regulation 17D together with regulation 29 then the foregoing affordsan additional reason for holding regulation 17D to be ultra vires. In my opinion it is permissible to read these two regulationstogether inasmuch as regulation 29 indicates the circumstances in which regulation 17D may operate - circumstances of complete injusticeto the registered owner, so that it is as if regulation 17D itself contained what I have termed the inherent vice of departure fromnatural justice or fairness. In <u>Wiseman v. Borneman</u> ([1969]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=3%20All%20ER%20275" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">3 All E.R. 275</a> at 278) Lord Morris referred to the rules of natural justice in these terms -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"My Lords, that the conception of natural justice should at all stages guide those who discharge judicial functions is not merelyan acceptable but is an essential part of the philosophy of the law. We often speak of the rules of natural justice. But there isnothing rigid or mechanical about them. What they comprehend has been analysed and described in many authorities. But any analysismust bring into relief rather their spirit and their inspiration than any precision of definition or precision as to application.We do not search for prescriptions which will lay down exactly what must, in various divergent situations, be done. The principlesand procedures are to be applied which, in any particular situation or set of circumstances, are right and just and fair. Naturaljustice, it has been said, is only 'fair play in action'."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In the present case we have the situation, as the regulations are framed, and as they have been exercised hitherto, that registeredowners who may be guilty of no fault, or even neglect, have no opportunity to make representations against the cancellation of theregistration of their vehicles; cancellation has followed automatically. However, we are now told that an opportunity to make suchrepresentations will, in future, be afforded, the Solicitor General giving an undertaking to that effect. But this does not, of course,dispose of the matter of ultra vires.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Accordingly I would hold that the answer to the first question put by the case stated is "(1) Yes, the learned magistrate was correctin holding regulation 17D to be ultra vires section 4 of the Ordinance (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/220">Cap.220</a>)."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Question 2 is in the form -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(2) Was I correct in law in holding that the rules of natural justice are applicable to regulation 17D."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">This I would answer "Yes, in the context"; having I think sufficiently indicated my reasons for so answering this question. It hasnot been directly contended that cancellation of registration or refusal to re-register is not an invasion of proprietary rights.In this respect Mr. Jackson-Lipkin relied on the case of <u>Cooper v. Wands worth Board of Works</u> ([1863]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=14%20CBNS%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">14 C.B.N.S: 180)</a>, the leading authority to the effect that no man is to be deprived of his property without having an opportunity to be heard, andat this point I would add a reference to the case, in the House of Lords, of <u>Belfast Corporation v. O.D. Cars, Ltd.</u> ([1960]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20All%20ER%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 All E.R. 65)</a> where, in effect, it was claimed that planning restrictions which were imposed without a right to compensation were void as beingcontrary to a provision of the constitution of Northern Ireland which laid it down that the Parliament thereof should have no powerto enact legislation to 'take any property without compensation'. Viscount Simonds referred to passages from the judgments of BrandeisJ. and Holmes J. in the <u>United States case of Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon</u> ([1922],  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=260%20US%20393" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">260 U.S. 393</a> at p.417 and 415 respectively). Brandeis J. said -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Every restriction upon the use of property imposed in the exercise of the police power deprives the owner of some right there beforeenjoyed and is, in that sense, an abridgment by the state of rights in property without making compensation. But restriction imposedto protect the public health, safety or morals from dangers threatened is not a taking. The restriction here in question is merelythe prohibition of a nocious use."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Holmes J. said -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The general rule at least is, that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognisedas a taking."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In the House of Lords, Viscount Simonds agreed, at p.70, that a measure which is ex facie regulatory may in substance be confiscatory.Viscount Radcliffe refers to the case where a restriction is so extreme as to amount to confiscation. That, I would think, is theposition here. 'Ownership' of a chattel, such as a motor-car, is that bundle of rights with respect to it which go to make up ownership,and included therein is the right to make use of the chattel for the purpose for which it is intended. To deprive a person of theuse of his motor-car is, surely, to deprive him of a proprietary right. In addition, he is deprived of the value of the unexpiredportion of his vehicle licence fee.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The third question put by the learned magistrate is whether the de-registration was invalid. Having answered questions 1 and 2 inthe affirmative, it must follow that the answer to this question also is "Yes".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Question 4(a) asks whether the Courts can review subsidiary legislation; the answer, as the Solicitor General agrees, is obviously"Yes". In this respect, I would add, there is no conflict between the Courts and the Legislature; the Legislature is as much concernedto see that the powers granted by it are not exceeded as the Courts are.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Question 4(b) is, in effect, a general question as to whether the magistrate was correct in his decision that the de-registrationin this case was invalid. It follows from what I have said in answer to the preceding questions that the answer to this questionis "Yes". This question, however, refers to 'unreasonableness' as a test of the validity of subsidiary legislation. So far as I amaware there is no authority directly in point. Reasonableness is a test usually applied to by-laws of local authorities and publiccorporations and the locus classicus is, of course, the case of Kruse v. Johnson ([1898]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20QB%2091" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 Q.B. 91)</a> where Lord Russell of Killowen said, at pp.99-100 -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"But unreasonable in what sense? If, for instance, they were found to be partial and unequal in their operation as between differentclasses; if they were manifestly unjust; if they disclosed bad faith; if they involved such oppressive or gratuitous interferencewith the rights of those subject to them as could find no justification in the minds of reasonable men, the Court might well say,(Parliament never intended to give authority to make such rules; they are unreasonable and ultra vires.' But it is in this sense,and in this sense only, as I conceive, that the question of unreasonableness can properly be regarded."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Unreasonableness, therefore, I conceive to be but an aspect of the doctrine of ultra vires; I accept the argument of Mr. Jackson-Lipkinto that effect, and, if I may do so, I would add that it was the fact of the regulations in the case of <u>Lau Ping</u> (supra) being (partial or unequal' that led me to say that those regulations were void as being discriminatory.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> There remains the question, not raised by the case stated, which the learned Solicitor General invited us to consider and expressour opinion upon. In his judgment, which I have had the advantage of reading, my brother Pickering J. expresses the view that weshould not embark on this question. For the cogent and compelling reasons contained in that judgment, I agree that we should notdo so.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> In commencing this judgment I referred to the necessity for maintaining the principle that subsidiary legislation must be confinedwithin the scope of the enabling legislation. The principle is obviously of paramount importance. Subsidiary legislation, incidentally,is not authorised in advance nor, generally, submitted to the Secretary of State for scrutiny, as must be done in the case of Ordinancesaccording to Royal Instructions. Whilst today we are concerned with road traffic regulations, tomorrow we may be concerned with regulationsaffecting trade, commerce, industry or any other aspect of human affairs. I feel bound to observe that the Law Officers of the Crown,in the present case, have demonstrated a capacity to stretch the enabling power beyond all proper limits. This is not just a matterof a lawyer's exercise. It is an essential part of the rule of law, and it would be a sorry day indeed if the Courts were preparedto dilute their approach in any such case simply because the persons likely to be affected are generally unpopular.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Mills-Owens J.)</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">Sneath, Q.C., &amp; Caird for appellant.</p>        <p align="left">Jackson-Lipkin (Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master) assigned for respondent.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:center">IN THE SUPREME COURT OF HONG KONG</p>    <p style="text-align:center">(APPELLATE JURISDICTION)</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:center">CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 189 OF 1971</p>    <p style="text-align:center">-----------------</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section party --><parties>        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td valign='top' align="left" width="25%">BETWEEN</td>                <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%"> </td>                <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="25%"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="25%"> </td>                <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">THE QUEEN</td>                <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="25%">Appellant</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="25%"> </td>                <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">and</td>                <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="25%"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="25%"> </td>                <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">TSANG Kwok-kuen</td>                <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="25%">Respondent</td>            </tr>        </table>        <p style="text-align:center">-----------------</p>    </parties><!--sino section text -->    <!--sino section coram --><coram>        <p align="left">Coram: Full Court (Rigby, C.J., Mills-Owens and Pickering JJ.)</p>    </coram><!--sino section text -->    <date>        <p align="left">Date of Judgment:</p>    </date>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:center">-----------------</p>    <p style="text-align:center">JUDGMENT</p>    <p style="text-align:center">-----------------</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">Pickering, J.:</p>    <p align="left">The facts of this case have been related with great clarity in the judgment delivered by the learned Presider and to them I do notpropose to allude further. I find it pertinent however to recall the highly embarrassing and anomalous position in which the ownerand any driver of a de-registered vehicle is unwittingly placed under the system of de-registration which has obtained, between thetime of actual de-registration and the receipt by the owner of notification thereof and the very serious consequences, includingpenal consequences, which may result to those persons. The unhappy position forced upon them by the fact of de-registration coupledwith the provision in Reg. 17(F)(1) of the Registration and Licensing of Vehicles Regulations for only ex post facto notificationto the owner is compounded by sub-section (2) of that Regulation which provides that failure by the Commissioner to effect the notificationcontemplated by sub-section (1) shall not affect the validity of the de-registration. It is thus possible under the Regulations foran owner and his driver or drivers to be unknowingly in breach of Regulations 17E, 29 and 44(2) and so to remain until the true positionis discovered either upon actual receipt of the Commissioner's notice or, if such notice is not issued or although issued not received,upon the next application for renewal of the vehicle licence which could mean for a period of up to a year.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> It is only necessary to state that position to render it almost superfluous to pose the question whether such a result could havebeen in the contemplation of the Legislature when it passed the enabling <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374" class="autolink_findacts">Road Traffic Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/220">Cap.220</a>). Clearly no responsible Legislature could ever have intended to place members of the public who may well be entirely blameless,in such jeopardy. On this ground alone I would hold Reg. 17D, read in its context, to be ultra vires.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Quite apart from the Regulation not being within the contemplation of the Legislature it is also ultra vires as I see it as lyingoutside the rule-making power. Nowhere within the confines of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374" class="autolink_findacts">Road Traffic Ordinance</a> is there to be found an express power to de-register vehicles and if it be argued that a power to de-register is implicit and properin a registration scheme that proposition cannot be extended, in the absence of express provision in the Ordinance, to the impositionof penalties additional to those authorised in the Ordinance. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374" class="autolink_findacts">Road Traffic Ordinance</a> provides that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"          Any regulation made under this section may provide that a contravention thereof shall be an offence and may provide punishmentand penalties for such offence not exceeding a fine of one thousand dollars and imprisonment for six months."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> There is nothing there about the additional penalty of de-registration still less about de-registration of the vehicle of an innocentowner. Section 17D is, in terms, unrelated to the offender since its impact is upon the registered owner who may well not be theperson who, in the words of Reg. 29, has driven, used or permitted or suffered the vehicle to be driven or used for a purpose otherthan that for which it is registered. Where it is in fact the registered owner who is guilty of a contravention of Reg. 29, the effectof Reg. 17D is to render him liable to double punishment in that he may suffer the fine and/or imprisonment authorised by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4(3)</a> of the Ordinance and also have heaped upon him the de-registration of his vehicle. There is no warrant for such double penalty inthe Ordinence. I have used the word "penalty" partly because the learned Solicitor-General, in the final stage of the three-day submissionsin this case, said that if the Court considered that Reg. 17D imposed a penalty or sanction he would concede that the regulationwas ultra vires. In the course of the discussion there had been a certain amount of emphasis upon the word "penalty" and it was arguedfor the Crown that de-registration was not a penalty. I venture to think however that there is no particular magic in the word forit does not occur in ss.(4) of the enabling <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374" class="autolink_findacts">Road Traffic Ordinance</a> and where it occurs in ss. (3) thereof the reference is to "punishment and penalties" and both sub-sections prescribe as a maximumthe imposition of a fine of $1,000 and imprisonment for 6 months. Nothing further is contemplated anywhere under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4.</a> But the effect of de-registration upon an owner is to burden him with a disability, a disadvantage, a detriment, a sanction; thelabel is unimportant. The effect is to deprive him of the enjoyment of his property in the form of his vehicle and the unexpiredportion of his road licence and that, irrespective of whether the deprivation can properly be termed a "punishment" or a "penalty",goes further than the sanctions authorised by the enabling section. It is a stretching of statutory authorisation in favour of executiveexpediency and is, for this second reason also, ultra vires.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> It was further Mr. Jackson-Lipkin's contention that Reg. 17D, as framed, is contrary to the rules of natural justice and with thatargument I would also agree. In very recent years there has been considerable development in the field of Administrative Law withemphasis upon the concept of natural justice and frequent reference to the principle of audi partem alteram. The old distinctionformerly frequently drawn between the position where an administrative body was acting purely administratively and that in whichits function was quasi-judicial (it being said that in the former case the rules of natural justice had no application, though beingattracted in the latter case) has crumbled and the modern tendency is to hold that in both circumstances there is an obligation toact in accordance with natural justice which term the recent cases tend to define in starkly simple terms. Thus Lord Morris in <u>Wiseman</u> v. <u>Borneman</u><sup>(1)</sup> said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The principles and procedures are to be applied which, in any particular situation or set of circumstances, are right and just andfair. Natural justice, it has been said, is only 'fair play in action'".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In <u>R.</u> v. <u>Senate of University of Aston</u><sup>(2)</sup> Donaldson J. spoke of "Common fairness ............ which is all that natural justice is" and in the same case Blain J.<sup>(3)</sup> said that "Common fairness" demanded an opportunity for representations to be made by or on behalf of the applicants in that case.In <u>Schmidt</u> v. <u>Secretary of State</u><sup>(4)</sup> Lord Denning M.R. having said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I quite agree, of course, that where a public officer has power to deprive a person of his liberty or his property, the general principleis that it is not to be done without his being given an opportunity of being heard and of making representations on his own behalf.",</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">went on to observe that the distinction formerly existing between circumstances in which the Home Secretary was exercising on administrativepower and those in which he was performing a judicial act no longer existed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Applying the principles highlighted by these brief extracts from recent decisions, can it be said that Reg.17D as framed conformsto natural justice? I think not. It places no obligation whatever upon the Commissioner of Transport to act fairly in de-registeringa vehicle. It imposes no necessity even to warn the owner of the vehicle concerned still less to give him an opportunity of beingheard before the de-registration is effected. The guilt or innocence of the owner is rendered irrelevant as is the fact that accordingto the terms of the vehicle's insurance policy, it may have become uninsured though still liable to be driven by persons nescientof the de-registration. By failing to circumscribe its application to the guilty and by omitting any provision for notice and a hearing,the Regulation offends against natural justice for no mere question of the termination of a privilege is involved an owner beingentitled to have his vehicle registered if the Commissioner is satisfied with the particulars contained in his application and ifthe provisions of Reg.17 do not apply; subject to those two conditions the duty of the Commissioner to register the vehicle is mandatoryunder Reg.6(1).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The situation in regard to natural justice, or the lack of it, is on all fours with that which obtained in the case of <u>Regina</u> v. <u>Lau Ping</u><sup>(5)</sup> where the efficacy of the former Reg.41B of the Road Traffic (Taxis, Public Omnibuses, Public Light Buses and Public Cars) Regulations,relating to the mandatory detention of vehicles in certain cases, was challenged. In that case the learned Chief Justice said<sup>(6)</sup>:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">These Regulations go even further in that they enable a man to be deprived of his property without being given an opportunity of beingheard simply by reason of the fact that some other person has committed an offence.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">.....................................................................................................</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">.....................................................................................................</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">In my view, in the absence of any express provision in the statute itself, that is to say, in section 3(1)(1), enabling the Governorin Council to abrogate the common law principle that no man shall be deprived of his property without first being given an opportunityof being heard, regulation 41B, as it now stands, is ultra vires and had on the grounds that it is contrary to natural justice."</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Those words are equally apt in the present situation and I need say no more on this issue of natural justice.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The answers to the first two questions posed by the learned magistrate are therefore in the affirmative; that is to say, Reg. 17Dis ultra vires and the rules of natural justice are applicable to it - which indeed is one, though only one, of the reasons for holdingit ultra vires.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> In the light of the answers to these first two questions, it seems to me that the replies to the questions remaining fall naturallyinto place. The learned magistrate's third query is whether he was correct in holding that the Commissioner's de-registration ofthe defendant's car was invalid. This issue having been fairly and squarely raised before the magistrate it matters not whether thede-registration was a nullity or merely voidable. It was being challenged and the Regulation having been found to be ultra viresand contrary to natural justice, it was clearly right to hold the de-registration invalid.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The fourth question posed was sub-divided. The learned magistrate asks first if the Courts of the Colony can review subsidiary legislation.The Crown concedes that if the Courts are to perform their functions as Courts they can so review. It is then asked if the Courtscan hold subsidiary legislation to be unreasonable and that must follow if only because reasonableness is one of the tests of vires.Finally the learned magistrate asks if he was correct in law in holding Reg.17D to be unreasonable and invalid. I have already affirmedthe correctness of his decision in regard to invalidity and it is patent for the reasons which I have stated in regard to vires andnatural justice that the magistrate was equally correct in holding the Regulation unreasonable.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Accordingly I would answer all the questions put to the Court in the case stated in the affirmative and uphold the learned magistrate'sdecision.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> A further matter of considerable importance remains. The learned Solicitor-General described the issue of whether the de-registrationin this case was a nullity or merely voidable at the instance of the registered owner, as the most interesting point raised but addedthat is was less important than that of the validity or otherwise of the Regulation upon which point he sought a ruling. He concededthat if the action of the Commissioner was either a nullity or merely voidable the de-registration must now be of no effect as againstthe registered owner but, arguing that the de-registration was voidable only, claimed that until the registered owner had taken stepsto have it set aside it was good as against the whole world. As I understood him, the learned Solicitor-General invited this Courtto rule upon the issue of nullity or mere voidability oven if that issue should become strictly superfluous as a result of our findingthe Regulation ultra vires. There was, he said, considerable general interest inasmuch as so many powers of this type existed undersubsidiary legislation in the Colony.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> For my part I must decline to undertake an academic exercise the results of which would in any event be merely obiter though apparentlyintended to be heavily relied upon by the Crown. My learned predecessor Macfee J. put the matter bluntly but aptly when in <u>Attorney General</u> v. <u>Man Chi Kin and another</u><sup>(7)</sup> he said "after all, this is a Court of Justice, not an academy of law". It may be that having at one time been a member of a Courtof final instance (not in Hong Kong) invested with the power to issue declaratory judgments, I am more sensitive about deciding mattersnot strictly germane to the issue before the Court than others. A declaratory judgment meant simply a judgment based upon a set ofhypothetical facts put before the Court by the High Commissioner of the territory concerned. It was a power which members of a multi-nationalCourt with different legal backgrounds universally disliked and one which they endeavoured to circumscribe both as to the requencywith which it was invoked (twice during my four years with the Court) and as to the particular hypothesis posed when it was invoked.I do not conceive however that this particular experience renders me unique in a reluctance to embark upon exercises of the natureproposed. The dangers of superogatory pronouncements are well know and the embarrassment which they, though obiter, can occasionwhen second and wiser thoughts prevail, notorious.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Another consideration is that so far as the Crown is concerned the exercise would be academic in a very real sense in that so faras this Regulation is concerned it makes little practical difference whether the Commissioner's action was a nullity or merely voidable.If the de-registration was a nullity and if owners of vehicles which have in the past been de-registered in similar circumstancesconsider that there was something tortious in such de-registration they could test that issue immediately before the Courts. If howeverthe de-registration was held to be merely voidable it would still be open to such owners to obtain a declaration (possibly in onerepresentative action or as a result of a test action) that the de-registration was void ab initio when they would thereafter beenabled to test the tortiousness or otherwise of the de-registration in the same way.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> If it be argued that such owners need to know whether the de-registration be a nullity or merely voidable before they can decidewhether it is open to them to sue directly in tort or whether they must first obtain the declaration to which I have referred, Ithink that the answer is for them either individually or in a representative or test action to sue for both remedies. Indeed it maybe unnecessary to sue for a formal declaration and open to the Court in an action for tort to rule upon the question of nullity ormerely voidable when, if either such conclusion was reached, the action of the Commissioner would become void ab initio. At the stageof such an action, should it ever be reached, the Courts would be properly seized of this issue with the relevant facts of the relevantcases before them but for my part I would be reluctant to cross this bridge before I come to it, slow to decide this issue in vacuo.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> It was the learned Solicitor-General who invited the Court to pursue this topic and in deference to his wish, Mr. Jackson-Lipkinadvanced his own views upon the subject. I am not ungrateful for the proffered assistance upon the problem nor unmindful of the researchupon both sides which went into it. Indeed throughout the whole of this case the Court has had the advantage from both sides of lucidand skilful exposition of all the issues involved. Nonetheless I must decline to tread this particular path which cannot lead toany conclusion really useful, let alone essential, to either of the parties in this particular case. If and when the time comes thatthis issue of nullity or merely voidable is before me either at first instance or as a member of this Court, I shall be happy toexplore it. Until then, I prefer not to be led into provisional expressions of opinion from which I may later, in the context ofa case where the issue is a live one, wish to resile.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> In its last analysis the invitation of the learned Solicitor-General is an attempt to persuade this Court to follow a decision ofthe Privy Council (<u>Durayappah</u> v. <u>Fernando</u><sup>(8)</sup>) in which a decision as to whether the administrative action the subject of appeal in that case was a nullity or merely voidable,rested partly upon what appears to be a faulty analysis by Lord Upjohn of the judgment of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in <u>Ridge</u> v. <u>Baldwin</u><sup>(9)</sup>. Certainly that analysis has been the subject of severe subsequent criticism (see the judgment of Speight J. in <u>Denton</u> v. <u>Auckland City</u><sup>(10)</sup> and that of Megarry J. in <u>Hounslow</u> v. <u>Twickenham Garden</u><sup>(11)</sup> and even the learned Solicitor-General was constrained to refer to "the privilege of the Privy Council to be wrong but binding".In my view the time has not yet come for this Court to saddl itself with a decision so described.</p>    <p align="left">  </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p align="left">  </p>    <p align="left">  </p>    <p align="left">(1) (1969) 3 W.L.R. @ 711</p>    <p align="left">(2) (1969) 2 A.E. @ 975</p>    <p align="left">(3) (1969) 2 A.E. @ 978</p>    <p align="left">(4) (1969) H.A.E. @ 908/909</p>    <p align="left">(5) (1970) H.K.L.R. @ 343</p>    <p align="left">(6) (1970) H.K.L.R. @ 350</p>    <p align="left">(7) (1964) H.K.L.R. @ 490</p>    <p align="left">(8) (1967) 2 A.E. 152</p>    <p align="left">(9) (1963) 2 A.E.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=66%20AC%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">66 (1964) A.C. 40</a></p>    <p align="left">(10) (1969) H.Z.L.R. 256 @ 268</p>    <p align="left">(11) (1970) 3 A.E. 326 @ 347</p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/1971/9.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
