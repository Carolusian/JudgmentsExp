Approximately 11% of Wai-Nga's body suffered second degree burns.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The medical evidence:</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Wai-Nga was treated with dressing and analgesics. Pressure garment therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy were also instituted.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Wai-Nga was examined by Dr. Ian H. Nicolson, a plastic surgeon. In his report dated 19/4/2005, Dr. Nicolson opined that althoughthe scars were all well healed, soft and pliable, the plaintiff has permanent cosmetic disability due to colour discrepancy whichis accentuated by mild hyperpigmentation of the junctional area between normal skin and pale scald scars. Although the scars willimprove over the years, this will be limited. Laser treatment may expedite the improvement but Dr. Nicholson did not recommend itfor Wai-Nga because she was diagnosed with Childhood Emotional Disorder, because laser treatments cannot eliminate the scars, butmay focus Wai-Nga's attention to the scars. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The plaintiff also received treatment at Yaumatei Child Psychiatric Centre for generalized anxiety, increased arousal and irritabilityafter the accident. Although there was an initial diagnosis of Childhood Emotional Disorder by Dr. S.L. Kwong, Dr. Anita Leung, aregistered psychologist, later reported that the accident does not appear to have a lasting psychological impact on Wai-Nga, however,as she grows up, she may become conscious of the scars and bother by them and therefore laser treatment should be provided to herwhen she wants the treatment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Dr. Leung also recommended counselling sessions for Wai-Nga's mother to alleviate the mother's parental stress as well as providingguidance on effective parenting so as to facilitate positive development in Wai-Nga.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The claim:</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Wai-Nga claims the following damages:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="70%">            <tr>                <td width="50%">Pain, suffering and loss of amenities</td>                <td width="50%">HK$500,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Future laser treatment</td>                <td width="50%">HK$49,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Expenses and special damages</td>                <td width="50%">HK$17,082</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Interest and costs</td>                <td width="50%"> </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> There are 2 separate issues in this matter: liability and quantum.

Under the circumstances, it wasnot reasonable to expect Bon Bon would turn the turntable and topple the jug.

As in all negligence claims, the plaintiff has aburden of proving; (1) the defendants owed the plaintiff a duty of care; (2) the defendants breached that duty of care; and (3) itis foreseeable that the plaintiff would suffer damages as a result of the defendants' breach; and (4) the plaintiff did suffer damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> There is no dispute that Wai-Nga suffered damages, but there is no settled law on what duty is owed by a parent to a third party.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The law in respect to a parent's responsibility to third parties for damages done by their children is stated in Clerk &amp; LindsellOn Torts, 19<sup>th</sup> ed. at para 8-173, as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThere is no general duty arising simply from parenthood to prevent a child from causing damage to third parties and a parent isnot vicariously liable for his child.

Prystay (Children's Lawyer for)</i> [2004] O.J. No. 1382; 2004 ON.C. Lexis 1323, the Ontario Court of Appeal quoting Professor Linden's seminal work <i>Canadian Tort Law</i>, 7<sup>th</sup> ed. (Markham: Butterworths, 2001) described the nature of a parent's duty of care as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe [parent's] duty [of care] is to supervise and control the activities of the child and, in doing so, to use reasonable careto prevent foreseeable damage to others.

Fridman's <i>The Law of Torts in Canada</i>, 2n. ed (Toronto: Carswell, 2002) at 388, the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>Eichmanis</i> further stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â âForeseeability is a key component in assessing whether the care was reasonable in the circumstance.'... The standard of caremust take into account any evidence of whether the parents were aware of any dangerous activities or propensity on the part of thechild and whether, knowing of this possibility, failed to take reasonable steps to avoid its manifestation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Miss Tsang, counsel for the plaintiff, also pointed to <i>Carmarthenshire County Council v. Lewis</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%201%20All%20ER%20565" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] 1 All E.R. 565</a> as authority that lack of constant supervision of a child was negligence. Mr. Chong, counsel for the defendants, pointed to the samecase as authority that it was not. In view of the diverse view, I think this case warrants a closer examination.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> In <i>Carmarthenshire</i>, a four-year-old boy attending a nursery school under the management of the county council strayed from the premises onto a publichighway and the plaintiff's husband, who was driving a lorry, struck a telegraph post in avoiding the child, was killed. In boththe trial court and the Court of Appeal, the defendant was held liable because the schoolmistress, Ms. Morgan, was negligent in leavingthe four-year-old boy alone and attended to the injuries of another child.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> On appeal, the House of Lord dismissed the appeal on the ground that the council was negligent for not having measures in place toprevent the child from leaving the school premises and getting on to the public highway, but by a majority of three (Lords Oaksey,Goddard and Tucker) held that Ms. Morgan leaving the 4-year-old boy alone for 10 minutes, to attend to another child was not negligent.Lord Tucker wrote:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âMy Lords, on this issue I agree with my noble and learned friends, Lords Oaksey and Goddard, that the evidence disclosed no negligenceon the part of Ms. Morgan. It is easy after the event to think of several things she might have done which would have avoided theaccident which resulted from her absence, but the question is whether her failure to take such action <b><i>in the circumstances which existed</i></b> amounted to negligence. For myself, I have no hesitation in holding that Miss Morgan was not shown to have been guilty of any negligenceand that no responsibility for the death of the decease man attached to her.â (Emphasis added.)</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> To summarize the cases, there is no general duty on a parent to keep a child under constant supervision. The duty of a parent isto exercise a reasonable degree of supervision and control over the child, in view of any foreseeable danger in the activities thechild was involved in at the relevant time, taking into account that particular child's propensity to meddle.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Application:</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> There was much argument on: Whether Bon Bon was standing or seating at the time he turned the turntable? Whether he turned with forceor not? Whether tableware was set up or not? All are in my opinion irrelevant, since parties agreed the act that caused the jug totopple was Bon Bon's turning of the turntable. The main issue on liability is: Whether the defendants exercised a reasonable degreeof supervision and control over Bon Bon, in view of any foreseeable danger in the circumstances at the relevant time?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Parties agreed that turning the turntable on its own was not dangerous. It was the jug of scalding tea placed on the turntable thatmade it dangerous.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> The defendants did not place the jug there, and there was no evidence they knew or should have known a jug containing scalding hottea had been placed on the table.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> There is also no evidence that the defendants knew or should have known the jug was placed on the turntable instead of on the table,where the danger of toppling was substantially lower.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> So far as the plaintiff's allegation that the defendants should be aware of rural restaurants' practice to place a jug of hot teafor patrons to wash their tableware, there is no evidence that the defendants often went to rural restaurants and was aware of thispractice.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Furthermore, it is common sense that hot tea is served in a metal or ceramic teapot not a plastic jug. Ms. Sevillejo's evidence thathot tea is always served in non-transparent, covered jugs and cold water is always served in clear and open jugs is mere speculation,without any evidence or support.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> There is no evidence that the defendants were aware that the plastic jug, placed on the turntable on that day, contained tea hotenough to cause serious burn and should be on the look out for this danger. The defendants had no knowledge of the danger.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> The evidence simply did not show the defendants were aware that Bon Bon and the turntable presented a dangerous situation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Bon Bon was eight years old at the time of the accident. He was independent and had been in restaurant before. The evidence alsoshowed that he was well behaved and had no aggressive temperament. There was no particular reason for the defendants to be on thealert that he may act in any manner that may endanger someone else.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Miss Tsang argued that the <i>Jauffur</i> case stands for the proposition that in addition to proper control, a parent has a duty to warn or instruct his children.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> In <i>Jaffur,</i> the father knew there was a dangerous object, the candles, within reach of his son and failed to give warning or instructions tohim. Here, there is no evidence that the defendant knew there was anything dangerous around. How could the defendants be requiredto instruct or warn Bon Bon, when they were not aware of any dangerous object around him?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> The first defendant left Bon Bon to the care of his mother, the second defendant, when he helped in ordering food for the group.His action cannot be viewed as negligence, even by the strictest of standard.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Whilst there is no evidence where was the second defendant when the accident occurred, but the agreed fact was she was the firstto arrive giving first aid to Wai-Nga after the accident. We can safely assume that she was in the same vicinity as Bon Bon, eitherseating at the adult table or standing nearby when the accident occurred.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Bon Bon was an independent 8-year-old boy, well behaved and had no aggressive temperament; there was no evidence that the defendantscould have foreseen any danger or special circumstances. I find it was reasonable for the second defendant not to keep Bon Bon underclose and constant supervision. Requiring the same under these circumstances would be imposing an impossible task on parents.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> As I have ruled the defendants not liable, there is no need for me to consider quantum.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> I have great sympathy for Wai-Nga and her parents, the injury she suffered was horrible and must have been very painful to both childand parents, but under the circumstances of this case, I cannot find the defendants liable for her injuries.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Orders:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)   Claim is dismissed.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)   Costs to the defendants, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for counsel.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)   The plaintiff's own costs be taxed in accordance with legal aid regulations.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>        <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> (Anthony Chow)<br />            Deputy District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    </blockquote>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Miss Alice Tsang, instructed by M/s Peter K.H.
