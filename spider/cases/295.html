It shareholders and directors were the2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant Mr Lau Fat Tsang (âthe Fatherâ) and Madam Ng Yuk (âthe Motherâ). </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In 1993, the Plaintiff Company acquired land use rights over 2 plots of land in Shanwei, Guangdong (âthe Landâ).  The Land wasregistered under the name of âHong Kong Tsang Tatâ.  According to the Plaintiff Company, the Mainland contracting party (SWLRB)added the words âHong Kongâ to signify that the Plaintiff Company was a Hong Kong company. Two land use licenses pertaining tothe Land were issued in 1998 and 2000. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  On 25.7.2002, the Father transferred all his interest in the Plaintiff Company to Lau Loi Tat (âthe Sonâ), whereupon the latterbecame the majority shareholder and director.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In 2005, the Father incorporated the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant (âthe Defendant Companyâ).</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Plaintiff Company alleged that the Father perpetrated a scheme to cause loss to it.  He had allegedly held out the DefendantCompany to be the Plaintiff Company and procured a further license over the Land in 2006 for the Defendant Company. The DefendantCompany then effectively caused the land use rights under the 2000 and 2006 licenses to be transferred to the Father and one HaifengHo Sheng Properties Development Co. Ltd. (âHFHSâ).  By a Tripartite Agreement made by the Defendant Company, the Father and HFHS,and 2 Subscription Agreements (all dated 10.9.2010), HFHS acquired through a corporate vehicle 80% of the rights in the Land at aconsideration of RMB 40,000,000 to the Defendant Company; the Father acquired the remaining 20%.    </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Two months later, on 20.11.2010, the Son was said to have signed a Supplemental Agreement on behalf of the Plaintiff Company withHFHS, which provided for transfer of the remaining 20% of the land use rights to HFHS at a consideration of RMB 10,000,000.  As willbe seen below, the Son disputed the authenticity of the Supplemental Agreement.    </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Plaintiff Company allegedly discovered the Tripartite Agreement in October 2010 when âa person claiming to be in charge ofHFHSâ showed it to the Son and asked for performance of the terms.  The Son refused.  After the meeting, the Son was informed bya friend who was familiar with the Chinese officials in the SWLRB and Shanwei Shi Planning Bureau that someone had attempted to dealwith the Land.  However, the Plaintiff Company âdid not follow up on the matterâ.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The Son allegedly was told by the Mother in about Chinese New Year of 2011 that she saw construction activities on the Land.  Heconfirmed the same by 2 visits, the last one being in March 2011.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The writ and a summons for an injunction against the Defendant Company and the Father were issued on 26.5.2011.  The Plaintiff Companyobtained interlocutory injunctions (âthe Injunctionâ) on 3 and 17 June 2011 to restrain the Defendant Company and the Fatherrespectively (1) from holding out to be users of the Land under the 2000 and 2006 licenses; (2) from taking any steps to carry outany terms in the Tripartite Agreement; and (3) from permitting construction works to be done on the Land under the 2000 and 2006licenses.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  On 17 August 2011, HFHS commenced proceedings (âthe Sanwei Proceedingsâ) against the Plaintiff Company, the Father, the Mother,the Son and another before the Intermediate Peopleâs Court in Shanwei City (âthe Shanwei Courtâ). It sought an order for transferof the Land to it and loss of profits arising from delay in the transfer.  On 19 August, it obtained an interim injunction to freezelanded assets belonging to the Fatherâs factory.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The objection by the Plaintiff Company and the Son to jurisdiction was dismissed by the Shanwei Court on 14 October 2011.  It ruled,amongst others, that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthe subject matter, â¦namely, the land usage right is in Shanwei City, Guangdong Province. The contract of land usage right isto be performed in Shanwei. Therefore, according to Article 24 (should be 34) of Civil Procedure Law of the People's Republic ofChina, the Court has proper jurisdiction over this case.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The appeal against the ruling of the Shanwei Court remained pending as of the date of this hearing.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The Defendant Company now seeks stay of proceedings in favour of the Shanwei Court and to have the Injunction dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>STAY FOR FORUM NON CONVENIENS</i></p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The principles for granting a stay are well known.

The burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that there is another jurisdictionthat is clearly or distinctly more appropriate.  The burden is not on the party suing in Hong Kong to demonstrate the appropriatenessof continuing the procedure here: <i>The Peng Yan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2009%5d%201%20HKLRD%20144" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2009] 1 HKLRD 144at</a> para 21-23.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Issues Disclosed</i></p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  One has to first identify the issues.  Mr McCoy SC  leading Mr Ng submits that 2 causes of action in tort have been disclosed inthe statement of claim â unlawful interference and conspiracy to injure.  The issues are (i) whether the Father incorporated theDefendant Company and disguised it as the Plaintiff Company to usurp the land use rights obtained by the Plaintiff Company; and (ii)whether the Father and the Defendant Company conspired to injure the Plaintiff Company by perpetuating deceit against the CompaniesRegistry and/or third parties in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The Plaintiff Company, to my mind, faces the immediate difficulty that these 2 causes of action have not been pleaded.  However,for present purposes, I shall assume that there will be a successful application to amend to plead those 2 causes on the existingfacts.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Mr McCoy SC submits that the questions of tort are claims in personam capable of being determined by the Hong Kong Court withouthaving to decide on the question of title over the Land.  He relies on the holding of Scott LJ in <i>St. Pierre v. South American Stores</i> <i>(Gath and Chaves) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1936%5d%201%20KB%20382" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1936] 1 KB 382</a>, at page 397:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ it is the action <i>founded on</i> a disputed claim of title to foreign lands over which an English court has no jurisdiction, and that where no question of title arises,or only arises as a collateral incident of trial of other issues, there is nothing to exclude the jurisdiction.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  This line of submission is contradictory to the Plaintiff Companyâs own case: </p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)    That there was an âeconomic dispute regarding right of use of landâ when it challenged the jurisdiction of the ShanweiCourt; and</p>        <p>(ii)  That it was a âslander to titleâ and damages would not be an adequate remedy when it applied for the Injunction from theHong Kong Court.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  I agree with Mr Li, counsel for the Defendant Company, that the real dispute centres around the Tripartite and Supplemental Agreements. The Plaintiff Company disputes their validity and authenticity respectively and seeks damages and the Injunction.  On the otherhand, HFHS (in the Shanwei Proceedings) and the Defendant Company (in this High Court action) want to uphold those Agreements.  Ina nutshell the court has to decide who has what rights over the Land.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Questions of title and injunction against infringement of land use rights are best determined where the land is situated. </p>    <p class="heading"><i>The Connecting Factors</i></p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The Plaintiff Company points to the following factors connecting the present action to Hong Kong.  All the parties are residentshere or are Hong Kong corporations.  The most significant acts pertaining to the fraudulent scheme set up by the Father and the DefendantCompany took place in Hong Kong.  These included incorporation and deployment of the Defendant Company in Hong Kong as a vehicleof impersonation against the Plaintiff Company, and the act of execution of the Subscription Agreements which pertained to the misappropriationof the land use rights.  The terms of the Subscription Agreements provided that they were to be governed by Hong Kong law and thatthe parties submitted to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Hong Kong courts.  The witnesses (not specified) to the fraudulentscheme were likely to be located in Hong Kong.  The trial of the causes of action shall involve construction of Hong Kong legal documents.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  On the other hand, factors connecting the matter to the Mainland are: the signing of the Supplemental Agreement and payment of theconsideration in the Mainland.  A potential witness who was a lawyer is from the Mainland. There is an ongoing set of proceedingsin the Shanwei Court.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The connecting factors identified by the Plaintiff Company such as the place of incorporation of the companies and execution ofdocuments do not have much significance from the point of view of the trial.  Except for Mainland lawyer, no witness has yet beenidentified.  Given the proximity of Hong Kong and Mainland China, logistical issues count for little: <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2012,</i> para 11/1/10AC.  That an issue is governed by the law of Hong Kong is a factor tending to make the Hong Kong court a more appropriateforum but there is no hard and fast rule.  There is nothing to show that the Shanwei Court is not in a position to apply Hong Konglaw with the assistance of Hong Kong legal experts.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The approach in deciding on the appropriateness of a forum is not just an exercise in loading up with factors which point to anyparticular jurisdiction in abstract.  The Court is required to focus on the appropriateness of a forum from the point of view ofthe trial of the action.  The court is to identify a forum with which the action has the most real and substantial connection.  See<i>New Link Consultants Ltd v. Air China &amp; others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%202%20HKC%20260" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 2 HKC 260</a>, at para. 67, per Deputy Judge Poon as he then was.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Proceedings in Shanwei</i></p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Of great significance is that the Shanwei Proceedings relate to issues similar to those in this High Court action and involve landin Shanwei.  The Plaintiff Company itself accepted this. That was why in its grounds of objection to jurisdiction submitted to theShanwei Court, both at first instance and on appeal, it relied on the principle that âone action could not be tried twiceâ; thatthe High Court Action and the Shanwei Proceedings were identical; and that the evidence submitted by HFHS and others to both Courtswas identical.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The Shanwei Court has been seized of this matter.  All the parties relevant to the various Agreements have been joined.  The PlaintiffCompanyâs objection to jurisdiction had failed and so the Shanwei Proceedings will continue (subject of course to the outcome ofthe appeal) regardless of any stay in Hong Kong.  It will be undesirable to continue the Hong Kong Action as there will be duplicationof costs and litigation efforts, and risk of inconsistent outcome.  See <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2012,</i> para11/1/11; c.f. <i>Pacific Aerosupplies v. Dakota Air Parts,</i> HCA No. 1233/2010, Deputy Judge Coleman SC, at para 104.  The tort claims in personam which the Plaintiff has made in the presentcase can be raised as a counterclaim in the Shanwei Proceedings.  Though different in nature, there is close nexus between the twoto justify the joinder.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Mr McCoy SC submits that the Hong Kong Court was seized of the matter earlier than the Shanwei Court.  This is unimportant in myview, for otherwise no question of stay will ever arise whenever an action is commenced in Hong Kong earlier in time.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Mr McCoy SC also submits that the Shanwei Proceedings were brought with an oppressive purpose of subverting the Hong Kong proceedings.This is untenable, for the claimant in the Shanwei Proceedings was HFHS who is not a party to this High Court Action.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Having shown that there are questions of title over land in Shanwei and ongoing proceedings which will continue there, the DefendantCompany passes the test in Stage I in showing that the Shanwei Court has the most real and substantial connection with the dispute.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>STAGE II</i> <i>â JURIDICAL DISADVANTAGE SUFFERED BY THE PLAINTIFF IF THE ACTION WERE STAYED</i></p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The burden of proof under this Stage is on the Plaintiff Company.  It names the following disadvantages:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)   Potential jurisdictional challenge by the Defendants before the Shanwei Court;</p>        <p>(ii)  Difficulty of direct enforcement of judgment in the Mainland;</p>        <p>(iii)  Forensic evidence would not be accepted by the Mainland Court.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  With regard to the 1<sup>st</sup> disadvantage, Mr McCoy SC submits that the Shanwei Proceedings concerned different parties and different issues.  The Plaintiff doesnot have any proceedings on foot in the Mainland to claim against the Defendant Company and the Father.  The Plaintiff should notbe forced to give up the right to sue in Hong Kong for tort.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  I am unable to see any disadvantage.  All the parties in the Shanwei Proceedings are relevant to the Plaintiff Companyâs claim. The Defendant can hardly challenge jurisdiction there since it considered Shanwei as the more appropriate forum and the ShanweiCourt was aware of the High Court Action. </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  With regard to the 2<sup>nd</sup> disadvantage, what the Plaintiff Company is claiming is both damages and an injunction for its claim in tort.  Insofar as damagesare concerned, the Shanwei Court has already frozen some assets that apparently belonged to the Fatherâs weaving factory.  Thatmight assist the Plaintiff Company in enforcement. </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Mr McCoy SC submits that even though the Father was said to have a factory in the Mainland, there was no evidence on its profitabilityor whether it was subject to a mortgage.  With respect, the burden was on the Plaintiff Company to adduce evidence to the contrary. It has failed to discharge this burden.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Insofar as an injunction is concerned, the Plaintiff Company has not shown why it is more difficult to enforce it in the Mainland(than in Hong Kong).  Mr McCoy SC recognizes that his client will not be able to get any relief in Hong Kong as regards title tothe Land, therefore it will ask the Court <i>for the next best thing,</i> which is an injunction against the individual.  If he is correct, joining in the Shanwei Proceedings will not be a disadvantage becauseit might help it also to get <i>the best thing</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  With regard to the 3<sup>rd</sup> difficulty, the Son had asked for the original Supplemental Agreement for forensic examination.  He claimed that the approach ofthe Mainland Court is different from that of Hong Kong.  The former does not place reliance on forensic evidence and will not allowit to be adduced.  This is refuted by the Defendant Company by relying on Article 72 of the Civil Procedure Law of the PeopleâsRepublic of China which provides that âWhen the Peopleâs Court deems it necessary to make an expert evaluation of a problem ofa technical nature, it shall refer the problem to a department authorized by the law for the evaluation.  In the absence of sucha department, the Peopleâs Court shall appoint one to make the expert evaluation.â  The Plaintiff Companyâs submission in thisrespect is unsustainable.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The Plaintiff fails in the test in Stage II.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>STAGE</i> <i>III â BALANCING</i> <i>EXERCISE</i></p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Since the Defendant Company has succeeded in Stage I and the Plaintiff Company has failed in Stage II, the balance is clearly infavour of having the action tried in the Shanwei Court. I therefore grant a stay on the ground of foreign non conveniens.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>DISCHARGE OF THE INJUNCTION</i></p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The Defendant Companyâs case is (i) that the Plaintiff Company has failed to make full and frank disclosure when it applied forthe Injunction.  It had not disclosed the Supplemental Agreement which would have cast doubt on its title to the Land and hence thebasis for applying for the Injunction.  (ii) The Son had lied to the Court in his affirmation in support of the Injunction.  (iii)The circumstances of service of the High Court proceedings on the Father were suspicious.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Lack of Full and</i> <i>Frank Disclosure</i></p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The case of the Defendant Company is that the Father had initially sold the 80% interest in the Land to HFHS in exchange for financialassistance.  In around October 2010, HFHS approached the Son for his cooperation in relation to the Land.  The Son asserted thatthe Plaintiff Company, instead of the Defendant Company, was the true owner.  He claimed that, absent a further deal, his Fatherwould disclaim the Tripartite Agreement.  However, he proposed (for himself, his family and the Plaintiff Company) to recognize theAgreement if HFHS would acquire the remaining 20% interest in the Land for an additional RMB 10,000,000.  The Sonâs proposal wasmade to one Mr Zeng (âZengâ), the lawyer of HFHS, in a telephone conversation on 17 October 2010.  It was taped by Zeng and thecontents were not in dispute.  Eventually, the Supplemental Agreement was signed.  The Son never referred to the Supplemental Agreementin the Statement of Claim and his affirmation in support of the application for the Injunction.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>The Plaintiff Companyâs Explanations for the Lack of Full and Frank Disclosure</i></p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Mr McCoy SC first took objection to the use of the transcript of the taped telephone conversation (âthe Transcriptâ) on theground that it was without prejudice.  With respect to Mr McCoy SC, this objection has not been raised in the evidence and the Sonhad made references to the telephone conversation with Zeng in his affirmation in reply.  In any case, as a matter of law:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)  If âwithout prejudiceâ meant that communication should not be disclosed before a contract was formed, this cannot stand becausethe Supplemental Agreement had been formed after the telephone conversation (although the Plaintiff Company disputed its authenticity).</p>        <p>(ii)  If âwithout prejudiceâ meant that the communication was for the purpose of settlement or litigation, the short answer isthat litigation was not contemplated at that time.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Next, the Son toned down the effect of the telephone conversation. He said that he made clear that neither the Defendant Companynor the Father had any interest in the Land.  There was a discussion on resolving the matter by selling the ownership of the Land/licensesbecause he wanted to protect the safety of the Father.   A very brief proposal was made by the Son (which he had not elaborated onin his affirmation).  No agreement was reached.  At the end of the telephone conversation, the Son made it clear that when anotheragreement was to be signed, he would attend with his lawyers to review the terms and conditions.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  He claimed that at a meeting with Mr Tse of HFHS and Zeng in October 2010, he was asked to put down his name and telephone numberfor future contacts.  He did so on a blank A4 sheet of paper which he claimed had been misused to âcreateâ the Supplemental Agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The Son said he was âshockedâ on discovering the Tripartite Agreement and alleged his signature on the Supplemental Agreementto be a forgery.  He became aware of these allegations only when he received the court documents in the Shanwei Proceedings on about27 August 2011.  He had never seen the Subscription Agreements. </p>    <p class="heading"><i>Analyses</i></p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The assertion of the Son that he was shocked was simply incredible.  Why would he negotiate another sale of the Land with strangerswho claimed to be owners of part of the Land? </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Moreover, the contents of the telephone conversation showed that the Son knew about the Tripartite Agreement and the sale of the80% interest in the Land by the Father.  He tried to close another deal on the remaining 20% and purported to act also on behalfof his Father when he made the proposal to Zeng.  The terms of the Supplemental Agreement (entered into 3 days after the telephoneconversation) tallied with the contents of the telephone conversation:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)  The Plaintiff Company affirmed the Tripartite Agreement in the recital and clause 3.</p>        <p>(ii)  It sold the remaining 20% interest in the Land to HFHS for RMB 10,000,000.</p>        <p>(iii)  The total consideration for the purchase of the Land would be RMB 50,000,000. </p>        <p>(iv)  Upon payment of a deposit totalling RMB 16,500,000 (which included a loan already lent to the Father), the Plaintiff Companyand the Defendant Company should proceed to transfer the Land to HFHS or a new subsidiary.</p>        <p>(v)  Upon completion of the transfer, the remaining consideration of RMB 33,500,000 shall be payable in full.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  There were signed receipts and bank statements to prove that HFHS had paid the deposit to the Father.  The Son remained completelysilent in the face of such proof of payment.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The Son never mentioned in his affirmations any attempt to communicate with the Father. Had he confronted the Father on the variousAgreements? Or sought the Fatherâs views before or after the telephone conversation? Or confronted him on the construction activitieson the Land?  Why did he decide to sue the Father?  There was a deafening silence on these matters despite express challenge by theDefendant Company in its affirmation</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  One cannot avoid coming to the conclusion that the Son deliberately refrained from making full and frank disclosure of his involvementin events leading up to of the Supplemental Agreement. </p>    <p class="heading"><i>The Sonâs Lie</i></p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In his affirmation in support of the application for the Injunction, the Son mentioned that he âdid not follow upâ after speakingto people who claimed to be in charge of HFHS.  The transcript and his signing of the Supplemental Agreement on behalf of the PlaintiffCompany showed that he did the exact opposite.  The Son did follow up with SWLRB (page C90) and HFHS.  He had lied to the Court.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Suspicious Circumstances Surrounding Service of Proceedings on</i> <i>the Father</i></p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  When the writ was served, the Father was still a director in control of the Defendant Company and the Son ought to be aware of this. The writ was served at the registered office of the Defendant Company, which was at the office of Messrs T.C. Lau &amp; Co.  Thatfirm claimed to have lost contact with the client in the past year and it later sent the court documents to the Father.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  In obtaining the Injunction and later applying for default judgment, the Plaintiff Companyâs solicitors said that their serviceon the Father had led to no response.  The Father had never surfaced in the Hong Kong proceedings.  The Defendant Company learntabout the present proceedings through other sources just in time to stop a default judgment from being entered against it.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  It is the case of the Defendant Company that the Son and the Father had engineered a situation whereby the Defendant Company andthe Father would not respond to the claim so that the Plaintiff Company could obtain the Injunction and (but for the Defendant Companyâsserendipitous change of registered office) even default judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Whilst I find the circumstances surrounding the service on the Father to be suspicious, I refrain from basing my decision on thisfactor alone.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  To sum up, the Son had clearly failed to make full and frank disclosure and lied to the Court when applying for the Injunction. Had the truth been before the Court, the Injunction would hardly have been granted because the Plaintiff Company had no interestin the Land to protect.  In the premises, the Injunction should be discharged immediately.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Since the injunction against the Father was obtained on the same bases as with the Defendant Company, the Injunction against theFather should also be discharged notwithstanding that he is absent from the present proceedings.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Injunction</i> <i>under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s21m.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 21M</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a></i></p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Mr McCoy SC requests that the Injunction do continue despite a stay of proceedings in favour of the Shanwei Court.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s21m.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 21M</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a> does empower the High Court to grant an injunction in aid of proceedings which have been or are to be commenced in a place outsideHong Kong.  It provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1) Without prejudice to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s21l.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21L(1)</a>, the Court of First Instance may be order appoint a receiver or grant other interim relief in relation to the proceedings which â</p>        <blockquote>          <p class="quote">(a) Have been or are to be commenced in a place outside Hong Kong; and</p>          <p class="quote">(b) Are capable of giving rise to a judgment which may be enforced in Hong Kong under an Ordinance or the common law.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2) â¦</p>        <p class="quote">(3) Subsection (1) applies notwithstanding that â</p>        <blockquote>          <p class="quote">(a) the subject matter of those proceedings would not, apart from this section, give rise to a cause of action over which the Courtof First Instance would have jurisdiction.</p>          <p class="quote">(b)     the appointment of the receiver or the interim relief sough is not ancillary or incidental to any proceedings in Hong Kong.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote><p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In my view, since the Injunction should be discharged on the ground of lack of full and frank disclosure and the Sonâs lie, thePlaintiff Company is barred from invoking the assistance of this Court under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s21m.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21M.</a>  There cannot be a different standard for seeking or maintaining an interim injunction simply because the proceedings to be assistedare outside Hong Kong. </p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  However, in deference to counsel, I will just deal with this application under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s21m.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21M</a> briefly. The reliefs sought by the Plaintiff Company are damages and injunctions.  A judgment on damages will be enforceable in HongKong under common law.  One questions what benefits can be derived from the Injunction which does not restrain the Father and theDefendant Company from disposing of assets.  And what is the use of restraining the individual Defendants in Hong Kong when the landuse rights are in the Mainland?  I am of the view that even if the Injunction were to continue, it should last only for a short period,say, not more than 3 months, to enable the Plaintiff Company to apply, if so advised, to the Shanwei Court for the appropriate injunctionin replacement.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>CONCLUSION</i></p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  For Application A, a stay of the proceedings in favour of the Shanwei Court is appropriate in view of the existing proceedings thereon a similar or related subject matter.  For Application B, given the lack of full and frank disclosure by the Plaintiff Companyand the Sonâs lie in his affirmation, the Injunction against both Defendants shall be discharged.  Applications C and D for amendmentto the statement of claim and filing of defence are unnecessary given the ruling on the first 2 Applications.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  I order, <i>nisi,</i> that costs on all 4 Applications (including all costs reserved) should follow the event and be to the Defendant Company to be summarilyassessed.
