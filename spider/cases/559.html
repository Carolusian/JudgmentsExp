(âSkyandyâ) in January 2001.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Background</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  New Optics has been selling optical products to a Nigerian Company Skyandy since 1997.  In or about 1998, Skyandy nominated LapShing to be its freight forwarder of all goods purchased from New Optics, the freight charges were paid by Skyandy.  In early 2001,New Optics agreed to sell 141 cartons of optical lenses to Skyandy for US$35,957.38 (âthe goodsâ).  Again, the Skyandy nominatedLap Shing to be the freight forwarder of the goods.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  On 9 January 2001, Lap Shing collected the goods from New Optics and duly forwarded the goods by sea to Skyandy in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  It is not disputed that the goods were packed into a container together with goods from other Hong Kong suppliers bound for Lagos,Nigeria; such an arrangement is known as âgroupage container shipmentâ.  The carrier âDelmasâ left Hong Kong for Lagos on18 January 2001 and arrived in Lagos in or around the end of February 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The goods were released to Skyandy in or about March 2001 after freight charges for the goods were received by its agent in Lagosfrom Skyandy.  New Optics, however, did not receive any payment for the goods except for a part payment in advance.  Subsequently,New Optics negotiated for the payment with Skyandy.  There were allegations from Skyandy that part of the goods were defective andcould not be sold in Nigeria.  New Optics denied its goods were defective. </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Plaintiffâs claim, according to the Statement of Claim, is based on an agreement made between the Plaintiff and the Defendantto forward the goods to its customer Skyandy in Lagos.  The Plaintiff further claimed that Lap Shing had agreed not to release thegoods to Skyandy until after the full payment of the goods and/or until the receipt of advice from New Optics.  New Optics furtherclaimed that Lap Shing as a freight forwarder owed a duty of care to New Optics in the carriage or delivery of the goods to takereasonable care and to act in accordance with instructions and directions of New Optics not to release the goods to Skyandy untilfull payment had been received by New Optics or until advice from New Optics.  That Lap Shing was in breach of contract and failedin its duty by releasing the goods to Skyandy without prior consent of New Optics and to ensure New Optics would be paid in fullby Skyandy before the goods were released.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  New Optics acknowledged that Skyandy had paid a deposit previously in the sum of US$9,113.32 and further that it had received apayment made through Lap Shing in the sum of US$5,000.  However, the sum of US$21,844.06 remained outstanding.  This is the sum NewOptics is claiming against Lap Shing.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Lap Shingâs defence is:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1) There was no forwarding agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(2) Lap Shing had never agreed not to release the goods to Skyandy until advised by New Optics;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(3) Lap Shing did not owe any duty of care in the carriage of the goods from Hong Kong to Nigeria because the title and possessionof the goods together with the risks of carriage had passed to Skyandy upon collection of the goods by Lap Shing in Hong Kong;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(4) New Optics had settled the dispute on payment of the goods with Skyandy before the commencement of this action by accepting fromSkyandy the sum of US$4,500.00.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The Issues</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  (1)   Was there a freight forwarding agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant?</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(2) Was there an agreement by Lap Shing not to release the goods until advised by New Optics to Skyandy; and, if there was, was theagreement binding on Lap Shing?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(3) Does Lap Shing owe a duty to New Optics as the bailee of the goods?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(4) Is Lap Shing liable if New Optics had settled the payment dispute for the goods with Skyandy?</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(1) <u>Was there a freight forwarding agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant</u></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  It is not disputed that the freight forwarding agreement was entered between Skyandy and the Defendant.  New Optics agreed thatLap Shing had been the nominated freight forwarder of its customer Skyandy since 1998.  It is further not disputed that freight chargesthroughout the period were paid by Skyandy, the purchaser of the goods.  According to the evidence of Mr. Ken Cheng (âKenâ),Lap Shingâs manager, Lap Shing had since 1998 arranged for the forwarding of goods purchased in Hong Kong by its Nigerian customersincluding companies such as: Lasitkon, Joelife, Netzjon and Skyandy.  After Skyandy purchased goods in Hong Kong it would instructLap Shing to pick up the goods from the supplier.  Lap Shing would then pack the goods and arrange for its carriage by groupage containershipment from Hong Kong to Nigeria.  Upon the arrival of the shipment in Lagos, Lap Shingâs agent in Lagos (which it referred toas the notify party) would collect the freight and handling charges from various customers with goods in the same container.  Inturn, Lap Shing would receive its share of the freight charges for the particular cargo in the groupage container shipment. </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  According to Kenâs evidence, for each freight delivery, the relevant bill of lading would be passed on to the agent in Lagos whoupon receiving the freight charges for all the customers in the same shipment would hand over the bill of lading to the consigneenamed within 2 or 3 days.  As delivery was by way of groupage container shipment with goods belonging to different Nigerian customers,the consignee named in the bill of lading would be the customer with the largest volume of goods in the particular shipment.  Theconsignee named would then collect the cargo in the container and the other customers who had goods in the same container shipmentwould collect their respective goods from the consignee named in the bill of lading.  According to Ken, this practise was and issatisfactory to the Nigerian customers because they all knew each other well and accepted the arrangement.  Lap Shing claimed thatthe release of goods to various customers in Lagos was not within its control because once freight charges were collected by itsagent, the bill of lading would be passed on to the consignee.  The agent in Lagos would compile a payment list of freight chargesand send it to Lap Shing.  Lap Shing, on the other hand, would not receive the payment of freight charges until the agent remit themoney collected or sent it by courier in US dollars to Lap Shing in Hong Kong. </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Mr. Cheung, Counsel for New Optics, expressed at the hearing that New Optics is no longer claiming the forwarding agreement wasentered between New Optics and Lap Shing.  The decision is a correct one because based on the delivery note dated 9 January 2001and the evidence of Mr. Ha, Lap Shing took delivery of the goods from New Optics not because there was a freight forwarding contractbetween them but because Lap Shing had received instructions from Skyandy to forward the goods to Lagos.  Clearly, the forwardingcontract was between Lap Shing and Skyandy.  There was no contractual relationship between New Optics and Lap Shing. </p>    <p class="heading">(2)   <u>Was there an agreement by Lap Shing not to release the goods to Skyandy until advised by New Optics; and, if there was, was the agreementbinding on Lap Shing</u></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mr. Ha Chuen Pong (âHaâ), a director of New Optics, alleged that since 1998 when its goods began to be forwarded to Skyandyin Lagos through Lap Shing, his practice was to contact Lap Shing for pick-up arrangements and New Optics would always request LapShing to collect payment for the goods before release of goods to Skyandy in Lagos or to wait for New Opticsâ advice before releaseof goods in Nigeria.  In early 2001, after Skyandy placed the order for 141 cartons of optical lenses from New Optics, Ha calledup Ken to arrange for collection of the goods.  During that conversation, he asked Lap Shing to collect the balance of the paymentof goods before releasing the goods to Skyandy.  He claimed that Ken had agreed to collect the balance of payment on New Opticsâbehalf and/or not to release the goods until he was instructed to do so by New Optics.  He relied on the delivery note dated 9 January2001 (page 1 of the documents bundle) for goods ordered under invoice No. E-1223 by Skyandy with the remarks:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âPlease donât release the Goods to âSKYANDYâ until our advice.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">The receipt was acknowledged by the endorsement in Chinese ãè»å ´éæ«ã (car park transferred to container).  It was dated 10January 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Ha claimed that the only reason he agreed to send the goods to Lap Shing to ship to Lagos was because he understood Lap Shing hada warehouse in Lagos and it would store the goods on New Opticsâ behalf upon arrival of the shipment to Lagos.  He claimed thatif Lap Shing had not agreed to collect payment for the goods or wait for New Opticsâ instructions before releasing the goods, NewOptics would have entrusted the goods to another freight forwarder who would accept the said conditions.  It was based on this practiceand on such an understanding that New Optics did not actively pursue the collection of the balance of payment for the goods untilJune 2001 when it discovered it had not received the balance of payment from Skyandy.  Ha then contacted Ken to enquire the whereaboutsof the goods and the collection of the balance of payment.  However, he was told by Ken that the goods had already been releasedto Skyandy. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Ken, on the other hand, denied he was under any obligation to collect payment for the goods on New Opticsâ behalf.  He emphasizedthat his customer was Skyandy not New Optics.  Furthermore, as the type of freight forwarding engaged was by groupage container shipmentwhere a number of purchasers of goods shared the same container and the one with the largest volume of goods was named the consigneein the bill of lading, upon arrival of the shipment in Lagos, the other purchasers sharing the same container would obtain theirown goods from the consignee named.  It is therefore not for Lap Shing to dictate when the consignee named should take delivery ofthe shipment nor would Lap Shing know when the goods would be released to Skyandy until it was informed by its agent in Lagos.  Hefurther claimed that on 9 January 2001, he did not promise Ha he would obtain payment for the goods for him nor did he agree to withholdthe goods until payment.  He claimed further that Lap Shing did not and does not have a warehouse in Lagos.  His agent in Lagos wouldonly store the shipment in a warehouse if the consignee failed to pay the freight charges on time and the consignee would be requiredto pay the storage charges in such a case.  He explained that it is impossible for him to store any goods of New Optics if New Opticsâcustomer in Lagos failed to pay for the goods indefinitely because there was no agreement between New Optics as a seller of the goodsand Lap Shing as a forwarder to make New Optics liable for the warehouse charges.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  According to Haâs evidence, Lap Shing had in the past, collected payments from Skyandy for New Optics.  On the other hand, LapShingâs manager, Ken claimed that the collections were specifically requested by New Optics after the cargo had been released. Lap Shing had asked its agent in Lagos on those occasions to collect payment for goods sold by New Optics and charged a 2% commissionfor the service.  With reference to the particular payment made by Skyandy through Lap Shing, Lap Shing was informed by its agentin Nigeria that Skyandy had made a payment of US$5,000 and Lap Shing was asked to forward it to New Optics.  That was why on 1 August2001, Lap Shing issued a cheque for the sum of HK$38,000, equivalent to US$5,000, to New Optics.  Lap Shing had no idea which shipmentof goods the particular payment was for. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  After hearing the evidence of Mr. Ha and Ken and considering the documents exhibited, I cannot find any contractual relationshipbetween New Optics and Lap Shing in respect of the 9 January 2001 shipment.  The freight forwarding contract was made between Skyandyand Lap Shing.  Freight charges were paid by Skyandy to Lap Shing through Lap Shingâs Nigerian agent under the groupage containershipment arrangement.  Lap Shing had no control when the goods in the container would be released to the consignee named in the billof lading.  Though Lap Shingâs agent in Lagos may have some control over the release of the goods, Lap Shing, as the freight forwarder,had no knowledge of when freight charges would be paid by the consignee and all the other buyers of goods shipped in the same container. Under such circumstances, Lap Shing or its manager Ken was in no position to promise New Optics that its Lagos agent would not releasethe goods until advised by New Optics.  Lap Shing was not under a contractual obligation to collect payment for the goods on NewOpticsâ behalf.  Lap Shing was not an agent of New Optics, neither was Lap Shing in the position to know what was the outstandingbalance for the goods ordered by Skyandy.  There was no evidence from Mr. Ha that he had informed Ken what was the outstanding balanceduring their conversation on 9 January 2001.  There was no evidence that they had any further conversation over this particular cargosubsequent to 9 January 2001 until June 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  There was no agency agreement between New Optics and Lap Shing nor was there a contractual relationship between the two supportedby consideration.  Therefore, even if New Optics might have requested Lap Shing in some of its previous transactions and Lap Shingmight have agreed to pass the request on to its agent in Lagos on such previous occasions and had obtained payments through its Lagosagent for Skyandy, these were done only under specific requests.  Lap Shing did on these special occasions charged a commission of2%.</p>    <p class="heading">(3)  <u>Did Lap Shing owe a duty to New Optics as a bailee of the goods</u></p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  New Opticsâs claim is on the basis that Lap Shing was the bailee of the goods.  It was not specifically pleaded in the Statementof Claim, but it was part of the submissions of Mr. Cheung, Counsel for the Plaintiff.  Such a claim is made under negligence inrespect of the loss of the goods.  In this respect, New Optics must show it possessed the legal ownership of the goods or the possessorytitle at the time of the loss of the goods in order to succeed.  At paragraph 682 of Halsburyâs Laws of England Volume 5(1) 4<sup>th</sup> edition page 583 it states:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âTo recover damages in tort for negligence in respect of loss of or damage to goods, a claimant must show that he had either thelegal ownership of the goods or a possessory title to them at the time of the loss or damage.  Mere equitable property is insufficientunless accompanied by a possessory title.  For this purpose, a possessory title may include a right of possession as well as possessionitself.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  It is not disputed that the sale contract between New Optics and Skyandy was a f.o.b. (free on board) contract where Skyandy wasresponsible for arranging payment for the freight charges of the goods from Hong Kong to Lagos (see Skyandyâs email on the salecontract on p.162 of the bundle).  Under a f.o.b. contract, ownership and risks in the goods would have passed to Skyandy upon collectionof the goods from New Optics in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Paragraph 355.311 at page 411 of Halsburyâs Laws of Hong Kong, Volume 23 (2004 edition) states:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â<b>[355.311] Commercial nature of f.o.b. contracts</b> Where goods are sold f.o.b.

The contract of carriage may be made by the buyer himself or by the seller onthe buyerâs behalf, and the buyer is liable for the freight and prima facie all charges subsequent to delivery on board.

There is nothing in this document that provided for the seller reserving the right of disposal of the goods.  Furthermore,according to Mr. Haâs evidence, in his communication with Skyandy there was no reservation of right of disposal nor were thereany evidence that Skyandy had agreed with New Optics that the goods should not be released until New Optics had paid in full.  Inany event, the practice between New Optics and Skyandy was that Skyandyâs various orders were settled by a continuous flow of payments.i.e. Skyandyâs surplus payments would be put on account after settling the balance of outstanding payments for previous ordersplaced. </p>    <p class="heading"><u>The Form of shipping documents</u></p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  According to the evidence of Ken, the consignee named on the bill of lading would be the customer who had the largest volume ofgoods in the container shipment on 9 January 2001.  The consignee named was a company called Judeak Ventures Ltd. (page 266 of bundleC).  Clearly, the bill of lading was not issued to New Optics or to the order of New Optics. </p>    <p class="heading"><u>How the bill of lading was dealt with</u></p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Upon payment of all freight charges, Lap Shingâs agent in Lagos would release the cargo to Judeak the consignee named who wasgiven the bill of lading for collection of the cargo.  New Optics had no part to play so far as the bill of lading was concerned.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  If New Optics was responsible for the freight charges, it may be possible to regard New Optics to have reserved the right of disposalof goods.  However, in the present case, New Optics was not the consignee named on the bill of lading nor was New Optics responsiblefor the freight charges.  There was nothing in the invoice from New Optics to Skyandy to indicate the seller had reserved the rightof disposal of the goods.  Consequently, New Optics could not have retained the legal ownership of the goods or the possessory titleto the goods when the goods were released to Lap Shing, by which act, title to the goods had passed to Skyandy.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  As a result, Lap Shing did not owe a duty of care to New Optics who had no legal ownership or possessory title to the goods.  Itwas the bailee for Skyandy not for New Optics.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Mr. Cheung argued that the onus is always on the bailee whether he be a bailee for reward or a gratuitous bailee to prove that theloss of any goods bailed to him was caused by any fault of his or any officer, servant or agent to whom he entrusted the goods forsafe keeping, relying on the judgment of the Privy Council in the case of Port Swettenham Authority v. T.W. Wu and Co. (M) SDN. BHD. <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20AC%20580" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] AC 580</a> at page 590A to C.  I do not doubt the binding effect of this case.  However, in that case, the Privy Council was referring to anaction where the owner of the goods claimed against the bailee whom the owner entrusted the goods and had paid the bailee a rewardfor looking after the goods.  In the present case, ownership of the goods had passed when Lap Shing collected the goods from NewOptics on 9 January 2001.  Both legal ownership and possession of the goods had therefore passed to Skyandy as the purchaser of thegoods.  Lap Shing was the bailee for Skyandy.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Mr. Cheung submitted that title of the property and risks did not pass upon delivery of the goods to Lap Shing because there wasno evidence produced on the agreement reached between New Optics and Skyandy.  I cannot agree.  The burden is on New Optics to producethe terms of the agreement if New Optics is relying on a right of ownership by reservation of the right to release the goods to thepurchaser.  On the contrary, the evidence produced, such as the invoices and the official receipts, contained no such terms.  Therefore,it must be concluded that no such terms existed between Skyandy and New Optics so far as this order was concerned. </p>    <p class="heading">(4)   <u>Is Lap Shing liable if New Optics had already settled the payment dispute with Skyandy</u></p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Lap Shing claimed that New Optics had in fact settled the payment dispute with Skyandy in the sum of US$4,500.00.  Lap Shing producedvarious emails exchanged between Ken and Skyandy in support of the allegation.  New Optics denied there was any settlement with Skyandy. Mr. Cheung referred to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Liability (Contribution) Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377">Cap. 377</a> and submitted that a person who is jointly liable in respect of the debt or damage is not discharged for the liability ofthe debt or damage even if there was a release or accord with the person liable in respect of it unless the release or accord providedfor it.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Lap Shing claimed Skyandy had refused to pay for the goods because the goods were defective and New Optics had negotiated with Skyandyfor a settlement of the payment outstanding in its running account with Skyandy.  It is not disputed that New Optics and Skyandyhad an ongoing business relationship since 1997 and Skyandy had paid various sums of money on account with New Optics as depositsfor the orders placed with it.  Payments made by Skyandy were managed regularly on a replenishment basis.  It is not intended foreach payment to be identified in respect of each order placed.  It is the evidence of Mr. Chan Ka Man, the accountant of New Optics,that New Optics had adopted a first-in-first-out principle, meaning that the practice was to apply the payments from Skyandy to settlethe longest outstanding invoices and if there was a surplus, New Optics would apply it to more recent invoices.  From the documentsproduced by the Plaintiff including the invoices and accounts relating to Skyandy, it seemed that this practice of first-in-first-outhad not been closely adhered to.  Mr. Ha admitted he had only calculated the accumulative figure on Skyandyâs account with NewOptics in the present claim of US$21,844.06.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  On the basis of the aforesaid evidence, clearly, New Opticsâs claim in these proceedings should be sorted out between New Opticsand Skyandy.  Lap Shing is not privy to any of the information on Skyandyâs account with New Optics.  Lap Shing is further, notprivy to the terms of settlement between New Optics and Skyandy.  As observed by Skyandy in the emails exchanged with Ken, the saleand purchase contract between New Optics and Skyandy was a matter entirely between the two parties to the contract.  I fail to seehow Lap Shing could be made jointly liable for the debt.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Conclusion</u></p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  I cannot find a contractual relationship between New Optics and Lap Shing.  Lap Shing was the nominated freight forwarding agentfor Skyandy with freight charges paid by Skyandy entirely.  It was not an option opened to New Optics to chose which freight forwarderto use because the choice and nomination belonged to Skyandy.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  There was no evidence that New Optics had retained possession or the legal title to the goods.  On the basis that the contract wasa f.o.b. contract, the possession of the goods together with the risks involved had passed to Skyandy upon delivery to Lap Shing. Lap Shing was the bailee for Skyandy not New Optics.  Consequently, Lap Shing did not owe New Optics a duty of care when the goodswere released to Skyandy by Lap Shingâs agent in Nigeria.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Lap Shing might have in the past under specific requests by New Optics collected payments from Skyandy subsequent to the releaseof goods, on those occasions, Lap Shing had charged a commission of 2%.  This indicated that on those special occasions there wasan agreement to collect payment with consideration for the specific service rendered by Lap Shing.  Other than those specific occasions,there was no evidence produced to show that it was a standing practice for Lap Shing to act as a collecting agent for New Opticsin each and every transaction between New Optics and Skyandy.  Furthermore, the evidence showed it would not have been possible forLap Shing to have collected payment for the goods because Lap Shing was not privy to the state of Skyandyâs account with New Opticsunless there was a specific request after New Opticsâs accounts department calculated the exact amount and Lap Shing was told ofit for collection.  I find there was no obligation or duty under contract or tort on Lap Shingâs part to collect payment for NewOptics or to withhold the release of the goods pending instruction from New Optics.  For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the Plaintiffâsclaim.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Costs</u></p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Costs nisi â Costs should follow the event and the Plaintiff shall pay the Defendantâs costs to be taxed if not agreed withcertificate for Counsel.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(H.C.
