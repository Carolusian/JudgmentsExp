Between 12 November 2006 and 4 March 2007 a number of police officers, on 5 occasions, stopped andsearched him or his younger brother and him in the streets.  The police officers searched their persons, demanded them to producetheir identity cards and recorded in the police notebooks their personal particulars as set out in their identity cards.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Mr. Wong complained that the police officers should not have any reasonable suspicion against him or his younger brother, but theydemanded them to produce their identity cards and searched their persons, and by doing so they violated <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a>.  Mr. Wong also asserted that whether or not any reasonable suspicion existed, a police officer was not allowed to record or collectthe personal particulars of a person stopped and searched. Mr. Wong alleged that what the police officers had done contravened Article39 of the Basic Law and Article 14 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (âBill of Rightsâ), both of which provided for theprotection of the privacy of citizens, as well as paragraph 2(a) of the Data Protection Principle 1 (purpose and manner of collectionof personal data) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (âPersonal Privacy Ordinanceâ).</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In 2007, Mr. Wong filed another claim with the Court of First Instance of the High Court (HCA539/2007) for damages against the Commissionerand his representative the Secretary for Justice (âthe Secretaryâ).  The amount of damages which Mr. Wong claimed against theCommissioner and the Secretary was HK$1,888,888.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On 11 August 2009, Mr. Justice Jeremy Poon of the Court of First Instance dismissed Mr. Wongâs claim and ordered him to pay costsfixed in the sum of $500,000.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Mr. Wong now appeals to this Court against Poon Jâs decision.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The undisputed facts were that Mr. Wong or Mr. Wong and his younger brother were stopped and searched by police officers at thefollowing times and locations:</p>    <blockquote>      <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="auto-style1" style="width: 90%">        <tr>          <td colspan="2" align="center" valign="top" class="quote"><u>Time and date</u></td>          <td width="345" align="center" valign="top" class="quote"><u>Location</u></td>          <td width="306" align="center" valign="top" class="quote"><u>Person stopped and searched</u></td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td valign="top" class="quote" style="width: 56px"> I.</td>          <td width="202" valign="top" class="quote"> 11p.m. â 12 a.m.,            12 November 2006</td>          <td width="345" valign="top" class="quote"> Outside 35 Gage Street, Central</td>               <td width="306" valign="top" class="quote"> Mr. Wong</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td valign="top" class="quote" style="width: 56px"> II.</td>          <td width="202" valign="top" class="quote"> 1:30 a.m.,            26 January 2007</td>          <td width="345" valign="top" class="quote"> Outside OK Convenience Store at 254 Des Voeux Road, Central</td>               <td width="306" valign="top" class="quote"> Mr. Wong and his younger brother</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td valign="top" class="quote" style="width: 56px"> III.</td>          <td width="202" valign="top" class="quote"> 5:30 p.m.,            8 February 2007</td>          <td width="345" valign="top" class="quote"> Java Road, North Point</td>            <td width="306" valign="top" class="quote"> Mr. Wong and his younger brother</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td valign="top" class="quote" style="width: 56px"> IV.</td>          <td width="202" valign="top" class="quote"> 12:35 a.m.,            27 February 2007</td>          <td width="345" valign="top" class="quote"> Safety Island outside Harcourt Garden, Admiralty</td>            <td width="306" valign="top" class="quote"> Mr. Wong and his younger brother</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td valign="top" class="quote" style="width: 56px"> V.</td>          <td width="202" valign="top" class="quote"> 6 p.m.,            4 March 2007</td>          <td width="345" valign="top" class="quote"> Outside former Western Magistracy, Pok Fu Lam Road</td>            <td width="306" valign="top" class="quote"> Mr. Wong and his younger brother</td>        </tr>      </table></blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The position of the Commissioner and the Secretary was that the stopping and searching of Mr. Wong or Mr. Wong and his younger brotherwere done solely in lawful execution of the police officersâ duties and did not constitute any illegal acts of tort, and that therecording of the personal particulars of a citizen by a police officer in his notebook following a lawful stop and search of thecitizen was lawful, constitutional and did not contravene the Personal Privacy Ordinance.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>Evidence given by the parties</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Both Mr. Wong and his younger brother gave evidence about what happened when they were stopped and searched by the police officers.

At about 12 oâclock on or about 21 October 2006, I left the fitness products company which I owned as sole proprietor andwhich was located in Sheung Wan. I then went to the vicinity, i.e. Lan Kwai Fong, on foot to attend a party. When I walked past 35Gage Street, I was stopped by a police officer of the Police Tactical Unit (PTU). The officer indicated that I had to produce myHong Kong identity card and undergo a search of my person. I produced my Hong Kong identity card and handed it to the officer, whothen said that he had to write down my personal particulars, including my name and Hong Kong identity card number, in his policenotebook. I refused to let him do so. He also said that he suspected I had dangerous drugs on me and that he had to conduct a searchon my person pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232">Cap. 232</a>, but I also refused to let him do so. I then argued with the PTU officer. Having been detained for 10 minutes, I was letgo, and [I] believe he had neither collected my personal particulars nor conducted a search on my person. I was detained and guardedfor approximately 10 minutes before I was let go.â</p>      <p>PC 54107âs evidence:</p>      <p class="quote">â3. At 0007 hours on 12 November 2006, when PC 478 and I were partrolling along Gage Street, I saw a male outside 36 Gage Streetwalking towards us. Upon seeing us, the man suddenly went behind a vehicle and then walked out of the rear of the vehicle and hurriedaway. He was acting suspiciously. We went up to intercept him and then told him that he was suspected to be possessing dangerousdrugs. We demanded him to show his identity card and undergo a search of his person. He then showed me his identity card for inspection.I checked the information on the identity card against the information in the Nominal Index Computer System and also conducted asearch on his person, but nothing was found. So I recorded his particulars in my notebook. The whole incident lasted two minutes,from 0007 to 0009 hours, in the course of which no dispute arose. â¦â¦</p>      <p class="quote">4. In November 2006, we were often assigned to patrol in Central/Sheung Wan and Lan Kwai Fong.

The officer asked me to produce my Hong Kong identity card for his inspection. Afterwe produced our Hong Kong identity cards for his inspection, he stretched out his arms to block our way and detained us outside thestore. He said he suspected that we were âboth possessing instruments for stealingâ and we had to be detained and subjected toa body search. Then one after the other, two uniformed police officers approached us. The five of us had a heated argument. Eventually,a uniformed officer insisted on recording my persona particulars in his police notebook despite my refusal to let him do so. Butno body search was carried out on us. We were not allowed to go until we were detained and guarded for 15 minutes or so.â</p>      <p>PC 58904âs evidence:</p>      <p class="quote">â3.

At that time, Sergeant 45246 and SPC 17230 stayed on boardto perform other duties, whereas SPC 49580 (in uniform) led me (in plain clothes) and PC 3433 (in uniform) to patrol along ConnaughtRoad West, Wing Lok Street and Bonham Strand East. At about 0150 hours, I found two men outside the OK Convenience Store at the junctionof Des Voeux Road Central and Hillier Street looking around. Upon seeing us, the two men immediately turned around to leave. I thenapproached them, revealed my police identity and showed them my police warrant card. I also demanded them to undergo a body searchas I suspected that they had committed the offence of âgoing equipped for stealingâ. They challenged my power and refused tobe searched. I explained to them again the reason for the search and the authority for conducting the search. Eventually they letme search them. The search was completed at about 0154 hours.

He demanded to conduct searches on our persons. We asked to be let go, but the officer refused and, despiteWong Tze Yukâs and my refusal and in the absence of our permission, forcibly collected our personal particulars [by recording them]in his police notebook. We said that the officer had no lawful authority to stop and search us or collect our personal particularsin a public place, but the officer paid no heed to us.

At about 1745 hours on 8 February 2007, when I was patrolling along Java Road near North Point Road, I saw two men coming upin my direction. Something seemed to be protruding underneath their clothes at the waist area and they were both acting furtively.Then I went up to intercept them and said that they were suspected to be possessing contrabands. I demanded them to produce theiridentity cards and undergo a body search. They refused to cooperate and challenged my authority. PC 53565, who was by my side, assistedme by explaining to the two men the powers of the police. Following our repeated explanations, the two men finally produced theiridentity cards, but they refused to be searched on the spot or at North Point Police Station. They insisted that the searches hadto be carried out inside Police Headquarters. In the meantime, the two men raised a hue and cry at the scene and shouted that theywere being violently treated by the police. A number of passers-by gathered around and watched. I warned them that if their behavioursbreached the peace and caused obstruction to others, they were liable to be arrested for disorderly conduct. At about 1755 hours,the two men (or one of them) called the console by dialing 999, alleging that they were being violently treated by the police. PC53565 and I informed CAR10 and asked for assistance. At about 1806 hours, Station Sergeant 23770, Station Sergeant 855 and PC 52662arrived at the scene to enquire about the incident. Station Sergeant 23770 made enquiries with the two men, whereas Station Sergeant855 made enquiries with PC 53565 and me. PC 52662 gathered information from those in the vicinity who might have witnessed the courseof the event. At about 1825 hours, Station Sergeant 23770 explained to the two men the relevant powers of the police and the proceduresof lodging a complaint against the police. The two men indicated that they were very familiar with the procedures of lodging a complaintagainst the police but had no complaint or dissatisfaction over the incident.

Accordingly, I explained our authority and procedures again to the two men, and they seemed to be satisfiedwith my explanation. Then I explained to them that if they had any dissatisfaction, they could lodge a complaint in accordance withspecified procedures. They said they were very familiar with the procedures for lodging complaints against police officers but theyhad no dissatisfaction or complaint in respect of this particular incident.

They answered that they had just been to the Central Police Station to make a report. Then I demandedthem to produce their Hong Kong identity cards so that I could make a record thereof, but they refused to cooperate. Although I hadexplained to them the powers of the police, they still refused to cooperate. I then sought reinforcement.

Mr. Wong emphasized that Poon J did not explain why he concluded thathe and his younger brother were not honest and reliable witnesses, but ruled that all the police officers were honest and reliable.

Mr. Wong just maintained that the recordingof his personal particulars and those of his younger brother by the police officers during or after stopping and searching them wasagainst the Basic Law, the Bill of the Rights and the ICCPR, and was at variance with the Personal Privacy Ordinance.  Mr. Wong stressedthat one of the purposes of the police officersâ stopping and searching them, including detaining him and his younger brother,was to obtain the information contained in their identity cards and to record the information in their notebooks.

Mr Wong asserted that the protection afforded to a citizen for his basic human rights should be all encompassing,and that these rights should be interpreted generously so as to give effect to the rights of an individual to the full; that on theother hand, restrictions imposed on the rights should be narrowly interpreted; and that it was incumbent on the Government to providesufficient reasons to justify any measure which restricted human rights.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mr. Wong pointed out that neither the Commissioner nor the Secretary provided any reason and/or evidence to show that the recordingof the personal particulars of a person stopped and searched was in any way reasonably connected with any lawful purpose.

Even if suchinformation was information concerning âprivacyâ, in order to strike a proper balance between the interests of the society andthe privacy of the individual, it was reasonable to allow a police officer to record in his notebook the particulars contained inthe identity card of a citizen after he stopped and searched that citizen.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>Discussion</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Article 39 of the Basic Law provides that the ICCPR is applicable in Hong Kong. Article 17 of the ICCPR and Article 14 of the Billof Rights stipulate that [Translatorâs note: the English versions of these two provisions are identical]:</p>    <blockquote>      <p class="quote">â(1) No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy â¦</p>      <p class="quote">(2)    Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference â¦â</p>    </blockquote><p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The learned judge found that the personal particulars set out on the identity card of a citizen formed part of the âprivacyâof the citizen and should be protected by Article 17 of the ICCPR and Article 14 of the Bill of Rights.  Mr. Shum disagreed and hestressed that the European Commission of Human Rights had never made any decision that âprivacyâ included the name of a person,and that in <i>Reyntjens v Belgium</i> (Application No. 16810/90) 73 D.R. 136, it was clearly held that the complainantâs identity document bore only his name, date ofbirth and other personal particulars but did not bear any information about the âprivate lifeâ<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> of any individual.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  If the respondent in an appeal is aggrieved by a decision made at the trial and desires the Court of Appeal to vary the decision,he must give a respondentâs notice and lodge a cross-appeal in accordance with Order 59 rule 6(1) of the Rules of the High Court.Otherwise, it is not necessary for the Court of Appeal to grant any remedy or relief.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Neither the Commissioner nor the Secretary has given any respondentâs notice in respect of Poon Jâs decision.  In the circumstancesof this case, we do not think that we should exercise our discretion to deal with the respondentâs allegation that Poon J had madea wrong decision.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The right to protection of âprivacyâ-related information which a citizen enjoys is not a right which is absolutely free fromany interference.  When it is reasonable and lawful to do so, law enforcement agencies, including the police force, are empoweredto take certain actions, notwithstanding such actions violate the principle of protection of âprivacyâ.  It is for this reasonthat Article 17 of the ICCPR and Article 14 of the Bill of Rights stipulate only that no one shall be subjected to âarbitrary orunlawful interference with his privacyâ, and that Article 39 of the Basic Law provides that âThe rights and freedoms enjoyedby Hong Kong residents shall not be restricted unless as prescribed by law.â</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Poon J in his judgment correctly pointed out that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 54(1)</a> and (2) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a> expressly provide that under certain specifically defined circumstances a police officer has the power to stop any person who hasaroused his suspicion and demand that he produce proof of his identity for inspection.  The wording of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 54(1)</a> and (2) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a> is clear.  Even if they are interpreted in the narrowest sense, they still confer power on a police officer, in circumstances specifiedin the provisions, to stop a person who has aroused his suspicion and to demand that the person produce proof of his identity forinspection.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  As a matter of fact, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a> was amended and became as it is now after the Bill of Rights came into force in 1991.

Mr. Wong argued that inspectionof proof of identity after stopping and searching someone and the recording of information were two different procedures.  Mr. Wongeven insisted that one of the purposes of a police officerâs stopping and searching a suspicions character was to collect the personaldata of that person.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  We do not agree with Mr Wongâs argument.  A police officer is a member of a disciplinary force and is required to strictly observedisciplinary rules and regulations. In order to ensure that the police officers will carry out their duties properly and that howthey behave when carrying out their duties can be examined where it is necessary to do so, all police officers must make detailedrecord of events which happened when they were carrying out their duties.  There are multiple purposes for doing this.  It can protectthe police officers and can help them, when necessary to do so, to refresh their memory of what happened in the execution of theirduties.  It is also for the protection of the interests of the citizens, for it can ensure that the police officers will not abusetheir powers when they were performing their duties.  The notebooks which the police officers use to record the details of how theydischarge their duties are one of the specified articles of equipment that, under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a>, should be provided to police officers.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  As pointed out by Mr Shum, the Law Reform Commission had scrutinized the amended <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a>.  The Commission not only considered that the provision did not contravene the Bill of Rights, they even made the following recommendation:</p>    <blockquote>      <p class="quote">âWe have concluded that there should be a power to carry out random identity card checks. However, as a safeguard against abuseof the power, we believe that a requirement should be imposed on the police to keep a written record of any ID checks. This wouldmake it possible to monitor the exercise of the power to carry out random identity card checks and, where necessary, it would enabledisciplinary action to be taken in the event of abuse of those powers.â</p>    </blockquote><p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  We agree that to record in the notebook the information contained in the proof of identity of the person stopped and searched isjust the exercise of part of the powers conferred on a police officer by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a>.  It is a reasonable extension of such powers and is a necessary and reasonable step.  This step, just like stopping and searchinga suspicious character and demanding that he produce proof of his identity for inspection, is constitutional and lawful.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Had there been any information which shows that the police officersâ recording the information contained in the identity cardsof the persons stopped and searched by them was a result of any ulterior motive or purpose in addition to the purpose of making arecord of what had happened, then the outcome may have been different.  However, there is no information which shows that this didhappen. Mr. Wong did not make such allegation, nor did he produce any evidence to substantiate such allegation.  We do not need toconsider what the outcome would have been if such thing did happen.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  We must emphasize that the workload of a police officer is heavy and the duties he needs to carry out are many.  A police officer,when required to act as such, shall be deemed to be on duty, regardless of where he is and what time it is. A police officer is amember of a disciplinary force and his conduct is governed by disciplinary rules and regulations.  If a police officer cannot makewritten record of details about how he carries out his duties, he will be seriously hampered in his work and his efficiency willsurely decrease.  This is certainly not a desirable phenomenon in a civilized society.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Poon J found that the information, namely the names, dates of birth and identity card numbers of the persons which the police officersrecorded after they stopped and searched those persons in accordance with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a> was the most basic information needed for ascertaining or verifying the identity of a person, and that recording such informationwas proportional to the purpose of preventing and detecting crimes.  Poon J stressed that the evidence showed that the police officersârecording such basic information of the persons stopped and searched, like stopping and searching the persons who aroused their suspicions,was solely for preventing and detecting crimes.  The information was not put to any other use.  The interference that was causedto the âprivacyâ of the persons stopped and searched was minimal.  These findings made by Poon J are reasonable and correct. We agree with them.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Poon J correctly stated in paragraph 34 of his judgment that âParagraph 2(a) of Data Protection Principle 1 under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/486" class="autolink_findacts">Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance</a> provides that personal data must be collected in a lawful manner. â¦ the lawful interception of a person by the police pursuantto <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a> and the subsequent recording in the police notebook of the particulars of that person as shown on the identity card pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10(b)</a> are aimed at investigating and preventing crimes.  It is of course lawful to collect personal data in this way.â</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The stopping and searching of the two Mr. Wong and the recording of the information on their identity cards by the police officershad a sound legal basis and were done as âprescribed by lawâ.  Judging the legal provisions in the perspective of reasonablenessand proportionality, they do not infringe upon the âprivacyâ protected by the Basic Law, the ICCPR and the Bill of Rights.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  We have carefully considered the judgment given by Poon J and we approve his judgment.  When a police officer stops and searchesa citizen and records in his notebook the name, date of birth and other information contained in the citizenâs identity card, thereis no contravention of Article 39 of the Basic Law, Article 17 of the ICCPR or Article 14 of the Bill of Rights, and such acts satisfythe requirements in the Personal Privacy Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Poon J found that each of the 5 occasions of stopping and searching Mr. Wong or Mr. Wong and his younger brother was lawful actiontaken by the police officers in accordance with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54(1)</a> or <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">54</a>(2) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a> when the officers felt suspicious of them.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Mr. Wong complained that Poon J accepted the police officersâ evidence but rejected the evidence given by him and his youngerbrother.  He accused Poon J of being biased.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  General speaking, the Court of Appeal will not disturb findings of fact made in the lower court, because the trial judge had theopportunity to hear and observe the demeanor of the witnesses when they were giving evidence.  The Court of Appeal will not reversethe findings of fact made by the trial judge and replace them by its own, unless it considers that the findings of fact in questionare not supported by the evidence or are inconsistent with the documentary evidence produced at the trial.  (See <i>Ting Kwok Keung v. Tam Dick Yuen and Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282002%29%205%20HKCFAR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2002) 5 HKCFAR 336).</a></p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Poon J had the opportunity to observe how the witnesses of the two sides gave evidence.  The police officers concerned had no motivefor framing Mr. Wong. Mr. Wongâs allegations against the police officers have no objective basis. Poon J was entitled to acceptthe police officersâ evidence and reject the evidence given by Mr. Wong and his younger brother.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  We uphold Poon Jâs decision to dismiss Mr Wongâs claim against the Commissioner and the Secretary.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  As a general rule, the losing party in a civil case has to pay the opposite partyâs costs.  There are no exceptional circumstancesin this case.  Poon J is entitled to order Mr. Wong to pay the costs of the Commissioner and the Secretary.  However, we have reservationsabout the decision made by Poon J summarily that the costs should be $500,000.  This case is not too complicated and the hearingfinished within 4 days.  We have considered and analyzed the Statement of Costs submitted by the Commissioner and the Secretary. We can determine the reasonable amount of the Commissioner and the Secretaryâs costs on the same footing as Poon J.  We thinkthat the reasonable amount should be $300,000, instead of $500,000.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  We dismiss Mr. Wongâs appeal, but reduce the costs payable by him to the Commissioner and the Secretary from $500,000 to $300,000.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  We also order that Mr. Wong shall pay the costs of this appeal.  Having considered the Statement of Costs of the Commissioner andthe Secretary and relevant factors, including our decision that the costs of the first instance hearing shall be reduced, we fixthe costs of the appeal at $50,000.</p>	<p> </p>	<p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="33%">(Peter Cheung)<br />            Justice of Appeal</td>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="33%">(Wally Yeung)<br />            Justice of Appeal</td>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="33%">(Susan Kwan)<br />            Justice of Appeal</td>        </tr>    </table><!--sino section representation --><representation><p> </p>	<p>The Appellant/Plaintiff, acting in person, present.</p>    <p>Mr. Edward Shum, instructed by the Department of Justice, for the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondents/Defendants</p>	<p> </p>    <p>Translated by the Judgment Translation Unit of the Judiciary and approved by Mr. P.
