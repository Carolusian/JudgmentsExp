defendants for damages for personal injury suffered by him as a result of an accident which befellhim on 23 October 1997 when, while working at the outside wall of the first floor of a building, he fell to the ground and suffereda broken leg.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The plaintiff is a plumber and electrician and at the relevant time he was the subcontractor for plumbing and electrical works forthe 1st defendant, who was the main contractor for decoration works ordered by the proprietor of Flat C, 1st Floor, Lee Wai Building,No.654 Nathan Road, Kowloon ("Flat C1"). The 2nd defendant was and remains the owner of Shop C on the ground floor and Flat C onthe mezzanine floor ("Flat CM") of the same building, of which the 3rd defendant is the owners' corporation.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> There is no dispute that the plaintiff was installing pipes on the outside wall of Flat C1 when he fell about 16 feet to the floorbelow. The main dispute of fact relates to what if anything was supporting him and this on this in turn depends the question of whoshould be liable. He was not on a purpose-built scaffold. Following the accident, the 1st defendant was charged with breach of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s38b.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation 38B</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations</a> made under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59" class="autolink_findacts">Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59">Cap.59</a> in that being the contractor responsible for the construction site, where work could not safely be done on or from the groundor from part of the building or other permanent structure, he failed to provide, place and keep in position for use scaffolds whichwere sufficient, strong and suitable for the purpose. He was on 18 August 1998 convicted after trial, fined $20,000 and ordered topay costs of $3,000.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Neither the 1st nor the 3rd defendant took any steps to defend the action, save that the 1st defendant appeared in person at thetrial. The plaintiff had not obtained judgment on liability in default of defence and since counsel did not take any point on thisthe trial proceeded as if the 1st defendant had filed a defence. Although the 3rd defendant has not defended, the plaintiff, nothaving obtained a default judgment, must still prove its case against that defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> I will first describe the scene of the accident, as it appears from the evidence, the factory inspector's report and the court'sown view on a visit. The Lee Wai Building was built in the 1960's, and has on the ground floor three shops, A, B and C, with theirshopfronts opening on to the pavement of Nathan Road. There is a scavenger lane at the rear of the building. In the rear of the buildingthere is a light well about twenty feet wide and six feet deep which was originally walled off from the lane to about the ceilingheight of the ground floor. This walled area was divided internally by solid walls into three back yards measuring 9 feet 6 inchesby 10 feet, one for each shop; I will call them Yards A, B and C. Shop C and Flat CM run right through to the rear of the building.Flat C1 has windows looking out on to the lane and sideways into the light well as well as a small bathroom window looking out towardsthe lane from the inner corner of the light well.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> At the date of the accident there was a sloping canopy made of corrugated asbestos covered with cement screeding, covering the wholeof the light well with its upper and inner edge about 18 inches below the level of the windows of Flat C1 and about 20 feet aboveground level. The walls of Yard C had been built up to about the height of the ceiling of the mezzanine floor, some 16 feet aboveground level. The vertically extended yard space was covered over about 3-4 feet below the upper canopy at the building wall, eitherwith burglar-bars, or with another canopy of similar construction to the upper one, or with a flat cement platform; this is a matterof dispute. It is not known when or by whom these structures were built but whatever they were, there is no dispute that they wereunauthorised. Since the accident the 2nd defendant has had the walls of the Yard C rebuilt, up to about the height of the mezzanineceiling and the whole roofed over with a grille and metal sheeting so as to form, in effect, a high-ceilinged room.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> On 31 May 2001 the court visited the scene for a view, and I observed the structure just described over Yard C. The upper canopyremains in place over Yards A and B but over Yard C it has been cut away. Over Yard B there is another sloping canopy, about 3-4feet below the upper one and apparently made of corrugated material with screeding on top. However the rear wall of the Yard B hasnot been extended upwards; it remains at what was presumably the original height of 8 feet or so. It was not possible to see what,if anything, covers it. The plaintiff said that the platform through which he fell was flat and was not an extension of, nor at thesame height as this lower canopy over Yard B.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> For the purpose of his works in Flat C1 the 1st defendant had had scaffolding erected in the lane, along the back of the buildingand across the light well, and he used this scaffolding to put a new window frame in the window of Flat C1 over the lane. He alsoput new frames in the window facing into the light well as well as the bathroom window. However, there was no scaffolding in thelight well and he says that he and his workers stood on planks on the upper canopy when doing this work.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiff was contracted <em>inter alia</em> to plumb in a new lavatory, wash basin and floor drain in the bathroom of Flat C1. He had knocked holes through the outside wallfor the soil and water drain pipes and had installed pipes on the outside wall below the upper canopy which he was connecting tothe common pipes, when the structure supporting him gave way and he fell to the floor of the yard of Shop C.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> It is necessary first to resolve the dispute of fact as to what the structure was which gave way under the plaintiff, allowing himto fall. He says that it was a flat concrete platform to which he gained access by going out of the rear window of Flat C1, alongthe scaffolding and through the gap between it and the upper canopy. It was not an extension of the lower canopy remaining over theyard of Shop B. However, in his declaration to the factory inspector, Mr Ip, he said that he had got down on to the lower platformthrough the large hole in the upper canopy, which may be seen in the photographs included in Mr Ip's report.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The 1st defendant says that there was indeed a lower canopy or platform. He did not know what it was made of but it was covered withcement screeding. He had taken the plaintiff to the site on about 1 October 1997, and they had climbed out of the side window ofFlat C1 on to the upper canopy. At that time the big hole in the corner of the upper canopy was there and the lower structure couldbe seen through it. However, access to the space between the upper canopy and the lower structure was not possible from the scaffolding,because the space was blocked with vertical bars. In fact, according to him, the plaintiff should not have gone into this space;he should have fed the new lavatory soil pipe and floor drain pipe in through the vertical bars as far as the holes made for themin the rear wall, and should then have connected them vertically to sewage pipes on the wall in the back lane.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Mr Lam Yik Him, the manager of the 2nd defendant, says that he saw the premises earlier in 1997 when a related company, of whichhe is a director, negotiated to buy Shop C and Flat CM. Completion took place on 11 June 1997 with the 2nd defendant as purchaser.There was a sitting tenant, namely City Chain Co. Ltd whose tenancy expired on 10 October 1997. He also saw the premises on thatdate when his company took over possession from the tenant. He said that on looking up in the yard space, he could see metal barsand a canopy above him, but it was very dark; the only light came from a small amber bulb at the door to the yard. The burglar barswere in the form of a horizontal grille running up the wall and enclosing the entire area of the yard space. They were very rustyand indeed the enclosed yard space was in a complete mess. He had tried to get the management office to remove the canopy but tono avail so he told his contractor, Mr Ho Yau to take the whole thing down; this was done, and the new structure built.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Mr Ho's evidence is that there was no lower platform or canopy at all. There was a metal burglar-bar cage extending up the wallsand over the top of the yard space but well below the upper canopy level. There were vertical burglar-bars between the top of thewall and the bottom of the upper canopy. His description in the declaration to Mr Ip Chi Kong, who inspected the scene, seems ratherequivocal; it could be read as meaning that there was a metal rack with a canopy on or immediately above it, or as being consistentwith the description he gave in evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Mr Ip, the Occupational Safety Officer of the Labour Department who made a report in respect of the plaintiff's accident, concludedfrom what the plaintiff and Mr Ho told him, as well as from his inspection of the debris left at the scene after the accident, thatthere had been such a lower platform, though it is rather difficult to see from his photographs that there was enough debris on theyard floor to have come from a 10 feet by 6 feet corrugated platform covered with screeding. The photographs show what are apparentlydisplaced horizontal burglar-bars. They do not show any vertical bars between the top of the rear wall and the underside of the uppercanopy; all that can be seen is a horizontal support beam of two parallel tubes with diagonal tubes between them, which does nottake up the whole vertical space. They do, however, show what appears to be the remains of some sort of horizontal corrugated structureattached both to the building wall and the yard wall.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Mr Ho is not entirely an independent witness, for he, it appears, gets a lot of work from the 1st defendant's related companies andhas known Mr Lam's father for many years. Suggestions made in his statement, which he adopted, that the plaintiff must have beenworking with his body coming down through the hole in the upper canopy are fanciful; that would need a plumber who was also a circusacrobat. Mr Lam does not help very much; he was looking up from within, in very poor light and could not tell in any detail whatwas above him, but it does appear that, if it was indeed very dark, there must have been a solid canopy covering the vertically extendedyard walls. If there had simply been horizontal burglar-bars at the top of the walls, with vertical bars between the back wall andthe upper canopy, light would have come in through those bars.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The plaintiff and the 1st defendant agree that there was a solid cement-covered platform, seen from above. They were consistent asbetween their evidence and what they told Mr Ip and indeed what they told the magistrate in the 1st defendant's trial. Where thereis a dispute between them and Mr Ho on this point I prefer their evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time of the accident there was a lower canopy or platform - I will simplyrefer to it as a platform - at the top of the vertically extended yard space, with horizontal burglar-bars beneath it. It was 3-4feet below the upper canopy. As to the vertical bars at the rear wall, I do not believe either Mr Ho or the 1st defendant about theexistence of these. However, whether they were there or not is of little importance because the plaintiff could have got down throughthe hole in the upper canopy, as indeed he said he originally told both the inspector and the magistrate he had done. In fact heprobably did this at least some of the time, because to do so would have been easier than climbing in from the scaffolding past thehorizontal support beam. In any event he got on to this lower platform; it supported his weight for some hours while he worked onthe pipes on the outside wall, but then it gave way so that he fell to the ground.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The plaintiff alleges against the all defendants negligence and breach of the common duty of care under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupier's Liability Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap.314</a>. He also alleges against the 1st defendant breaches of statutory duty under Construction Site (Safety) Regulations, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59">Cap.59</a><em>sub.leg.</em> I propose first to deal with the liability of the 1st defendant for negligence and breach of statutory duty.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> There is no dispute that the plaintiff and the 1st defendant together inspected the work site from the scaffolding in the rear lane.From there, the rear wall and the pipes on it would have been visible; light would get in through the hole in the upper canopy, andfrom the rear lane. The 1st defendant would have been able to see the place at which the plaintiff would have to work. Now, he saysthat the plaintiff did not need to work there; he was originally expected to put in long pipes to the wall from the scaffolding;he did not put that to the plaintiff in cross-examination, though that is perhaps not of great significance given that he was actingin person; more important is the fact that there is nothing to that effect in his original witness statement, or in what he declaredto Mr Ip. I take it, therefore, that it is a recent fabrication. So he knew that the plaintiff would have to get into the space betweenthe upper canopy and the lower platform, and work while squatting, sitting or kneeling on the latter. There was no other way to dothe job. He could see that the lower platform had a cement surface but he could not know what was beneath it and supporting it; andhe took no steps to find out.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The 1st defendant as main contractor, i.e. the person responsible for the construction site at Flat C1, had various statutory dutiesunder the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations</a>. The plaintiff alleges various breaches. In particular, he alleges a breach of the duties under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s38a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulations 38A(1)</a> which provides that the person responsible for a construction site shall ensure every place of work on the site shall, so far asreasonably practicable, be made and kept safe for any person working there. He also alleges a breach of the duty under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s38b.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation 38B</a> to take adequate steps to prevent any person on the site from falling from a height of two meters or more. There are allegationsof breach of duty relating to access but I do not think those are appropriate in the light of my findings of fact. The 1st defendanttook no step to ascertain whether the lower platform or canopy was a safe place for the plaintiff to work. The duties under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s38a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulations 38A(1)</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s38b.html" class="autolink_findacts">38B</a> would necessarily require the main contractor to ascertain whether an existing structure more than two metres high was strong enoughto support a person who had to work there, and if it was not, to make it so or provide some other kind of platform. Obviously, inthe circumstances of this case, a scaffold could not have been provided so long as the lower platform or canopy was in place, butif its condition had been ascertained, and if it had been known that Mr Ho was to demolish it, once it had been demolished a properscaffold could have been provided. So I have no doubt that the 1st defendant was in breach of his statutory duties under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s38a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulations 38A(1)</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s38b.html" class="autolink_findacts">38B</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The 1st defendant argues that the plaintiff was an independent contractor. This is no defence to a claim in tort for breach of thestatutory duties imposed by the Constructions Sites (Safety) Regulations. See <strong>Rainfield Design &amp; Associates Ltd v. Siu Chi Moon</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%20HKLRD%20226" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] HKLRD 226 (CFA).</a> There may be cases where a main contractor can escape liability by contracting out or reliance on a sub-contractor's particular expertisebut that does not apply here. <strong>Rainfield</strong> only deals with breach of statutory duty and leaves open the question of whether at common law the 1st defendant could rely on thefact that the plaintiff was an independent contractor. In any event I do not think it is necessary to consider this here since breachof the statutory liability is established.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> I turn to the question of liability for negligence and breach of the common duty of care which is alleged against all the defendants.Section 3(1) of the Ordinance provides that an occupier owes a "common duty of care" to visitors. Section 3(2) defines that dutyas "a duty to take such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safein using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there". So the first question iswhether the defendants or any of them were occupiers of the lower platform and the second question is whether the plaintiff was alawful visitor to it.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> "Occupier" is not defined in the Ordinance. A useful explanation of its meaning was given by Lord Denning in <strong>Wheat v. Lacon</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1966%20AC%20552" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1966 AC 552</a> at 577 and 558:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In the Occupier's Liability Act, 1957, the word 'occupier' is used in the same sense as it was used in the common law cases on occupiers;liability for dangerous premises. It was simply a convenient word to denote a person who had a sufficient degree of control overpremises to put him under a duty of care towards those who came lawfully on to the premises ...</p>        <p class="quote">Translating this general principle into its particular application to dangerous premises, it becomes simply this: wherever a personhas a sufficient degree of control over premises that he ought to realise that any failure on his part to use care may result ininjury to a person coming lawfully there, then he is an 'occupier' and the person coming lawfully there is his 'visitor'; and the'occupier' is under a duty to his 'visitor' to use reasonable care. In order to be an 'occupier' it is not necessary for a personto have entire control over the premises. He need not have exclusive occupation. Suffice it that he has some degree of control. Hemay share the control with others. Two or more may be 'occupiers'. And whenever this happens, each is under a duty to use care towardspersons coming lawfully on to the premises, dependent on his degree of control. If each fails in his duty, each is liable to a visitorwho is injured in consequence of his failure, but each may have a claim to contribution from the other.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In SALMOND on TORTS (14th Edn., 1965) p.372, it is said that an 'occupier' is 'he who has the immediate supervision and control andthe power of permitting or prohibiting the entry of other persons'. This definition was adopted by Roxburgh, J., in <em>Hartwell v. Grayson Rollo and Clover Docks, Ltd,</em> and by Diplock, L.J., in the present case. There is no doubt that a person who fulfils that test is an 'occupier'. He is the personwho says 'come in'; but I think that that test is too narrow by far. There are other people who are 'occupiers', even though theydo not say 'come in'. If a person has any degree of control over the state of the premises it is enough."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Lord Denning went on to examine the cases relating to the landlord who lets premises but retains no control, the landlord who letsflats in a building but retains control of the common parts, the owner who licenses premises to another but retains a right of repair,and the owner who employs an independent contractor and to work on his premises.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Turning first to the 2nd defendant, it was the owner-occupier. It bought Shop C and Flat CM on 11 June 1997. Along with Shop C, itgot Yard C. Some predecessor in title had extended the rear and side walls of Yard C upwards and covered it with burglar-bars andthe lower platform. This extension was an unauthorised structure; the area above the original yard walls should have been open. Ineffect the situation was the same as that where in a low rise building a ground floor flat owner builds a roofed extension, e.g.a kitchen, up to the first floor level. The upper canopy may be disregarded; it had nothing to do with the 2nd defendant, being attachedabove its property. The 2nd defendant was in the same position as if it had put up the unauthorised structure itself. Through MrLam the 2nd defendant knew of the existence of the structure, for he had seen it before he went ahead with the purchase. He alsosaw it when he regained possession from the tenant on 10 October 1997. The 2nd defendant had <em>de facto</em> possession of the whole of the inside of the structure, for the only way in was through the shop or through the door from the lane.It obviously regarded itself as having ownership and possession of the unauthorised structure for it instructed Mr Ho to demolishthe same; and on the 2nd defendant's instructions the structure was rebuilt and re-roofed.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Counsel for the 2nd defendant argues that the lower platform was forced upon D2; that may be so but nevertheless I have no doubtthat once it took possession of the shop and mezzanine floor it had possession of the whole structure. It would certainly have oweda duty to keep it reasonably safe for any visitor entering into the structure from the ground floor; if the lower platform or theburglar bars had fallen on such a visitor it would surely have been liable for that. I do not see why it would not be liable forsomeone who entered lawfully on to the roof of the structure, i.e. the lower platform.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The 1st defendant was an independent contractor who had been given possession of Flat C1. He was obviously an occupier of Flat C1.He would owe the common duty of care to a visitor, including the plaintiff when working as a subcontractor inside the flat. Oncethe plaintiff goes outside, though, the position is different. Returning to the low-rise building situation I suggested above, insuch a case the first floor owner would not have any automatic right to invite his plumber or other workman to stand on the roofof the ground-floor extension. Nor would the ground floor owner be under any duty to allow the first floor owner's contractor accessto his roof. Here the argument is that the plaintiff would derive his right to work on the external wall by reason of an invitationof the owner of Flat C1, through the 1st defendant, because the owner would have the right to drainage and the drains were on theexternal wall. That may be so but I do not see that the owner of Flat C1 would have any right to invite anyone on to the lower platformwhich had nothing to do with him. If the 1st defendant had actually taken possession of the lower platform, as he did of the uppercanopy when he put in the windows, no doubt he could be liable as occupier of it; but there is no evidence that he ever actuallytook possession. I do not think that simply telling the plaintiff to get on to the lower platform would make him liable as occupier.Liability could arise in other ways, as I have found it did by reason of his statutory duties but the 1st defendant simply did nothave a sufficient degree of control over the platform to make him liable as occupier.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The 3rd defendant is and was the owners' incorporation of the building. It is argued for the plaintiff that as such it is the owner,and therefore the primary occupier, of the external walls and responsible for their maintenance. That would include anything attachedthereto including both the upper canopy and the lower platform.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 18</a> (1) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344">Cap.344</a> provides that the owners' corporation shall "maintain the common parts and the property of the corporation in a state ofgood and serviceable repair and clean condition". In <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a>, "common parts" are defined as :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... the whole of a building, except such parts as have been specified or designated in an instrument registered in the Land Registryas being for the exclusive use, occupation or enjoyment of an owner; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">unless so specified or designated, those parts specified in the First Schedule"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Paragraph 1 of the First Schedule includes external walls.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> By Clause 2 of the Deed of Mutual Covenant dated 10 August 1962, the First Owner granted to the Vendor the "full right and privilegeto hold use occupy and enjoy to the exclusion of First Owner the premises set out in the Second Part of the Second Schedule heretoto the intent that the Vendors shall have in all respect the rights of an absolute owner thereof". Part two of the Second Schedulereads :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"All those self-contained shops and offices and apartments comprised in the said Building other than [what was conveyed to the FirstOwner] together with the exterior walls and the roof of such building."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> However all units in the building, consisting of 46 shops or flats and the roof were subsequently sold by the original developer,as appears from the land searches produced. These together make up the 47 undivided shares conveyed. Therefore, says the plaintiff,the original vendor must now have conveyed away, along with the other 46 shops or flats and the roof, its right to exclusive use,occupation or enjoyment of the external walls.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Counsel for the 2nd defendant argues that the land search records do not establish that the exterior walls are common parts. Thefact that no undivided shares have been allocated to the exterior walls is neither here nor there; see <strong>Jumbo King Ltd v. Faithful Properties Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%204%20HKC%20707" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 4 HKC 707.</a> However in that case, at page 720C Litton PJ explained the position as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"As mentioned earlier, the proprietary right of a co-owner in a multi-storied building is the right to an undivided share in the landand building; prima facie the owner is entitled to exert rights of possession to every part of the building, in common with his co-owners.This is what is meant by the expression 'unity of possession'. But by the deed of assignment and by the DMC the rights of exclusivepossession to individual parts are marked out as between the co-owners."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> It seems to me that it must follow that once the developer divests itself, as here, of its proprietary rights to all of the undividedshares, there is nothing from which it can derive a right of exclusive possession to any part. Therefore, the external walls canno longer be taken as specified or designated for the exclusive use, occupation or enjoyment of an owner, and the owners' incorporationmust be responsible for them as common parts. In any event Clause 5(b) places a duty on all the owners to maintain the common parts.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> In effect then the 3rd defendant is the owner-occupier of the common parts of the building including the external walls. Anythingwhich is attached to the external walls, such as a canopy or the roof of an outbuilding would become annexed to them and fall intothe ownership of the 3rd defendant. Therefore, says the plaintiff, the 3rd defendant would owe the common duty of care to a lawfulvisitor to the lower platform. See also <strong>Chu Wo Heung and Anor v. Hui Lai Wa &amp; Ors</strong> CACV1715/2001, 15 March 2002. That was a case where a canopy attached to a building collapsed; the building manager was held to havehad responsibility for the maintenance of the canopy, as coming within the common parts.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> This is of course all very well but the lower platform did not collapse on passers-by underneath, or on an lawful visitor insidethe Yard C structure. It was in a dilapidated condition; the 2nd defendant knew that and had complained to the 3rd defendant of it,to try to get the 3rd defendant to deal with it. But there is no evidence to suggest that it fell because of anything other thanthe plaintiff's weight placed upon it. The question remains whether, in going on it, he went there as a lawful visitor, <em>vis-Ã -vis</em> the 3rd defendant. "Visitor" encompasses the old common law categories of "invitee" and "licensee". There was no contact betweenthe plaintiff or the 1st and 3rd defendants so he was not the 3rd defendant's invitee. If he was invited at all it could only havebeen as an implied invitation by the owner of Flat C1, through the 1st defendant. To make him the 3rd defendant's visitor, it wouldbe necessary to find that the latter expressly or impliedly licensed the plaintiff to go on to the lower platform. Now I would haveno difficulty if this if the platform were some common part of the building to which persons would normally have access, such asthe usual kind of Hong Kong roof to which all the owners in the building may have access. Their workmen must be taken as licensedto go there by the owners' corporation. That is not the position here. The lower canopy was an outbuilding roof, with no means ofaccess. It was not the sort of roof on which persons could be expected to walk. I do not how the 3rd defendant could be taken ashaving licensed the plaintiff to go there. This would necessarily mean that any flat owner in a multi-storey building can tell aworkman to go on to any common part of the building, whether made for access or not, and the workman then becomes a lawful visitor<em>vis-Ã -vis</em> the owners' corporation which is expected to take reasonable care for his safety; i.e. keep every outbuilding roof, canopy or whatever,not just safe so that it does not fall on those below, but safe so that people can walk on it, even if it was never built for thatpurpose. That cannot be right.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> The plaintiff says that he was a visitor, having been expressly invited to use the platform by the 1st defendant. For the reasonsI have set out above, I do not think that can be right. The 2nd defendant says that the plaintiff was a trespasser, i.e. "one whogoes on the land without invitation of any sort and whose presence is either unknown to the proprietor or, if known is practicallyobjected to" - <em>per</em> Lord Dunedin in <strong>Robert Addie &amp; Sons (Collieries) Ltd v.

It seems to me that this is the position so far as the 2nd defendant and indeed the 3rd defendant are concerned. The plaintiffwas there without any invitation from either of them, and completely unknown to them, on a structure not made for access and on whichneither of them should have been expected to foresee that someone would go.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> In <strong>British Railways Board v.

Dumbreck</strong>. The effect of the decision was that it became possible for a plaintiff, even though he was a trespasser, to recover in negligence.The precise nature of the duty owed to a trespasser gave rise to controversy and in 1984 statutory provision was made for the liabilityof an occupier to a trespasser in the United Kingdom. There was no corresponding Hong Kong statute. The law applicable in Hong Kongis that set out in <strong>BRB v. Herrington</strong>. For the purposes of this judgment it is sufficient to refer to some of the passages in the opinions of the Law Lords in that case.</p>    <p class="heading">Per Lord Reid at 899 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"So the question whether an occupier is liable in respect of an accident to a trespasser on his land would depend on whether a conscientioushumane man with his knowledge, skill and resources could reasonably have been expected to have done or refrained from doing beforethe accident something which would have avoided it. If he knew before the accident that there was a substantial probability thattrespassers would come I think that most people would regard as culpable failure to give a thought to their safety."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Per Lord Morris of <em>Borth-y-Gest</em> at 909 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... An occupier owes no duty to make his land fit for trespassers to trespass in. ... [but there is] a duty which, while not amountingto the duty of care which an occupier owes to a visitor, would be a duty to take such steps as common sense or common humanity woulddictate."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Per Lord Pearson at 929 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It seems to me that the rule in Addie's case has been rendered obsolete by changes in physical and social conditions and has becomean incumbrance impeding the proper development of the law."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Earlier Lord Pearson said at 922 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... [the occupier of premises] ... does not owe to the trespasser a duty to take such care as in all the circumstances of the caseis reasonable to see that the trespasser will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is trespassing... It does not follow that the occupier never owes any duty to the trespasser. If the presence of the trespasser is known to orreasonably to be anticipated by the occupier, then the occupier has a duty to the trespasser, but it is a lower and less onerousduty than the one which the occupier owes to a lawful visitor. Very broadly stated, it is a duty to treat the trespasser with ordinaryhumanity."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Per Lord Diplock at 941 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The duty [to the trespasser] does not arise until the occupier has actual knowledge either of the presence of the trespasser uponhis land or facts which make it likely that the trespasser will come on to his land; and has also actual knowledge of facts as tothe condition of his land or of activities carried out upon it which are likely to cause personal injury to a trespasser who is unawareof the danger. ... Once the occupier has actual knowledge of such facts, his own failure to appreciate the likelihood of the trespasser'spresence or the risk to him involved, does not absolve the occupier from his duty to the trespasser if a reasonable man possessedof the actual knowledge of the occupier would recognise that likelihood and that risk."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> The result is that for the 2nd or 3rd plaintiff to become liable it would have to know that the condition of platform was such thatit would be dangerous to a trespasser who went on to it and it would have to know or expect that someone would go on to it.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> The plaintiff then says that the platform was analogous to a trap. It was like the disused scaffold in the case of <strong>Ta Xuong v. Incorporated Owners of Sun Hing Building</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%204%20HKC%20171" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 4 HKC 171</a>; in the words of Seagroatt J both an invitation to burglars and "an open invitation to anyone required to do any work on the exteriorof the building to use it and rely upon it as a means of access and support". In other words, the 2nd and 3rd defendants could expectfrom the nature of the lower platform that anyone required to work on the exterior of the building would use it for access and support.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> This is an attractive argument, but I do not see that that can be right either. A scaffold is built for the purpose of climbing.If one leaves a scaffold up it is reasonable to expect that someone will use it for the purpose for which it was originally erected.An outbuilding roof is different. It is not made for climbing on, even though it might look safe enough. If this argument is rightit means that anyone who puts up a roofed extension at the back of his ground floor flat must expect trespassers on the roof andbuild it to be load-bearing. I think this is putting the duty too high.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> It is also argued that the 2nd defendant's contractor Mr Ho must have known that work was being done in the upstairs flat, becauseof the noise; the plaintiff knocked a hole through the back wall. That is no doubt right but I do not see that it would have producedany knowledge that whoever was making the noise upstairs would necessarily go out on to the platform.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> I conclude that the neither the 2nd nor the 3rd defendant can be liable to the plaintiff for this accident. Only the 1st defendantis liable, for breach of statutory duty. In effect where he was at fault was in not ascertaining that the lower platform was safeto work on. In fact the position is really little different from what it would have been if I had found that the situation was asdescribed by Mr Ho, and there had only been burglar bars, not covered with any platform, to support the plaintiff. The 1st defendantwould still have been liable for breach of statutory duty but the other defendants' arguments on liability would still have succeeded,though probably more easily.</p>    <p class="heading">Contributory Negligence</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The question of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff arises. It is argued that the decision to that he should workon the platform was thrust on him by the 1st defendant, but in fact he was an independent contractor and he could himself have gonedown to the ground floor flat to make inquiries about the safety of the platform before he went on it, just as easily as could the1st defendant. No doubt the platform looked safe enough from above, as it had a cement surface; but no one could know what was holdingthe surface up. Further it would no doubt have been easy enough for the plaintiff to rig a safety harness using an anchor point abovethe hole in the upper canopy, with the line coming down through the hole. It seems to me that in the circumstances the plaintiffwas negligent of his own safety and his contributory negligence should be put at 50%.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The plaintiff, who was aged 46, suffered a compound fracture of the left tibia. Treatment included five operations, but recoverywas delayed due to non-union and complications arising out of infection. Because of the delayed fracture union he was offered, butrefused a further operation to insert an intramedullary nail in the tibia and apply a bone graft and opted for further applicationof a plaster cast. He was on sick leave until 14 September 1999 though his expert recommended that he should have sick leave forthree years from the date of the accident. He now suffers from shortening of the left leg by 1.7 cm. and varus deformity; musclewasting of the left thigh, indicating weakness of or disuse of the left leg and/or favouring of it. He has scarring at the site ofthe accident on the inner aspect of the left lower leg and scarring on the thigh at a skin graft donor site. He complains of abnormalsensation and numbness at the fracture site; a feeling of pulling at the lower left leg; and inability to climb ladders properlyor squat symmetrically.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Evidence was heard from the treating surgeon, Dr Choi Siu Tong and from two orthopaedic experts, Dr Richard Lau Man Tsang for theplaintiff and Dr Lau Hoi Kuen for the 2nd defendant. The plaintiff's expert says that he has a 20% impairment of the lower limb or8% impairment of the whole person. He estimates a 10% loss of earning capacity on the basis that the plaintiff could not work forone day in ten because of the disability. The 2nd defendant's expert (in a later report) puts the loss of earning capacity at 5%.Both agree that as at July 2001 he was able to resume his pre-accident employment.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> The experts are not far apart in their evidence of the plaintiff's present condition. They and the court have seen a private investigator'svideotape of the defendant walking and working. When he squats, he does not squat symmetrically; he keeps his left heel up or hekneels on the left knee. When he walks, he has a very slight limp, visible to the doctors. But he does not appear to have any difficultyin walking or in working for long periods.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> The main dispute relates to whether the plaintiff was unreasonable in refusing the further operation to insert an intramedullarynail in the tibia with bone graft. It is not in dispute that such an operation would have had a 90% chance of success, and that ifsuccessful it would have removed the mal-alignment and varus deformity though it would not have helped the shortening. Dr RichardLau takes the view that the acceptance of such an operation is a matter for the patient and that he should not be penalised for refusingit. Dr Lau Hoi Kuen however says that he should be responsible for at least half of the present degree of permanent impairment andloss of earning capacity.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> If an injured plaintiff refuses to undergo recommended treatment, the burden of proof lies on him to prove that in all the circumstanceshe acted reasonably and whether or not he did so is a question of fact; <strong>Selvanayagam v. University of the West Indies</strong>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20WLR%20585" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 WLR 585.</a> As I said at the trial I have a lot of sympathy for the plaintiff's refusal to undergo further surgery. He knew that his leg wouldnot be bent, if he had the operation. However he obviously felt that he did not want to have his leg "sawn open". He was alive tothe risk of infection. Dr Choi, who treated him, says that he explained the "pros and cons". He recommended surgery, but he doesnot seem, from his evidence, to have recommended it particularly strongly; nor did he give an indication of a high percentage probabilityof success. Now he says that as a layman he would agree with the plaintiff's decision to have conservative treatment.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> I do not think the situation here can be equated to that in <strong>Marcroft v. Scruttons Ltd</strong> [1954] 1 Ll.L.R.395 where the plaintiff purely for subjective reasons refused electric shock treatment, or that in <strong>McAuley v. London Transport Executive</strong>, [1957] 2 Ll.L.R.500 where the plaintiff refused surgery for no very explicable reason. It seems that this defendant was given twochoices, but although one was recommended it was not the obvious choice especially given the possibility of infection; the plaintiffhad already suffered from infection and it was not unreasonable for him to take the choice that he did, knowing that he would runa further risk of infection. I do not think that there should be any reduction for the plaintiff's refusal to undergo this surgery.</p>    <p class="heading">PSLA</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The plaintiff says that the injury is in the "serious injury" category and that an appropriate award is $450,000.00. The 2nd defendantsays that is too high and refers to <strong>Yu Kok Wing v. Lee Tim Loi</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%202%20HKLRD%20306" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 2 HKLRD 306</a> where an award of $350,000.00 was made for what appear to me to be rather more serious leg injuries. I think an award of $350,000.00is appropriate here. I will apply the 50% discount for contributory negligence to this and other figures at the end.</p>    <p class="heading">Pre-trial loss of earnings</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> It is agreed at any rate between the plaintiff and the 2nd defendant that the plaintiff was earning an average of $16,100.00 permonth before the accident which was 55 months and six days before the trial. This is based on employment for 17 days per month at$800 per day, i.e. $13,600.00 p.m. plus contract work of $30,000 p.a. The plaintiff says that he started work again in June or July2000. He now only earns $1,800.00 per month, at $300.00 per day for odd job work six days a month. He could get $800 per day as aplumber but he cannot get this work because of residual disability; in particular he is no longer able to climb ladders. I have somedifficulty with this. Both experts say that he is fit to resume work as a plumber and electrician and could climb ladders or scaffoldsthough there would be some extra risk. However such workmen do not always work at height. Further he admitted that his employer,Wong Keung, could not secure any work this year, and that he himself could not get independent work because of the economic downturn.It is argued that he probably could not now make as much as he made before the accident; the work is not available. That seems tobe probably right.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> This is all rather indefinite but I think it must be accepted on the basis of what both experts say that the plaintiff could haveworked at his former job if work had been available from at least July 2001, even if he lost, say, 10% of previous income becauseof inability to do certain work. That he cannot get plumbing work now seems from his own evidence to be largely the fault of theeconomic downturn and unemployment caused thereby. It is difficult to see why a defendant should pay for that. In this connection<strong>Cutler v. Vauxhall Motors Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%202%20WLR%20961" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 2 WLR 961</a> and <strong>Rouse v. Port of London Authority</strong> [1953] 2 Lloyd's Rep.179 are relevant.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> I take into account Dr Richard Lau's recommendation that the plaintiff should have sick leave for three years, i.e. up to October2000, and both specialists' view that he could resume plumbing work in their later reports, around mid-2001. In fact the plaintiffstarted work again in June or July 2000. I will allow the full loss of earnings for the period up to 23 June 2000, i.e. for 32 months.From that date until 23 June 2001 i.e. for 12 months I will assume that he was able to earn $1,800.00 per month. From then and fromthen until the date of trial, 29 May 2001, I will assume that had the work been available, though it was not, he could have earned90% of his pre-accident actual monthly earnings in employment, with no contract work, or $12,240.00 per month and make the awardon the basis that the unavailability of work was not the fault of the 1st defendant. His pre-trial loss of earnings will thereforebe :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="50%">Loss over 55 months and 6 days at $16,100.00</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%">$886,103.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="50%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="50%">Less :</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="50%">12 months' earnings at $1,800.00</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%">$21,600.00</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="50%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="20%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="50%">11 months and 6 days' earnings at $12,240.00</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%">$137,009.00</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="50%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="50%">Subtotal</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%">$158,609.00</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="50%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="50%">Total pre-trial loss of earnings</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%">$727,494.00</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Medical and travelling expenses are agreed at $4,896.00 and $610.00 respectively.
