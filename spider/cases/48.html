id="p1">1.</a>  The events which gave rise to these proceedings occurred between October 1997 and May 1998.  The proceedings were commenced 4 yearslater, in May 2003.  I am told that discovery was completed in June 2005.  Now, nearly 9 years after the events, and nearly 4 yearsafter the commencement of the proceedings, the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants seek to strike out the pleadings, pursuant to O 18 R 19(1), on the grounds that the pleadings do not disclose any reasonablecause of action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The plaintiffs counter that application by an application to amend the pleadings, amendments which they say save the pleadings. A draft amended statement of claim has been filed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The 1st defendant, although having been served, and having filed a statement of defence, takes no part in the proceedings now beforeme.  The 6th, 8th and 9th defendants are no longer involved in the proceedings, the claims against them having been struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The statement of claim, as amended, is said to comprise no less than eight different causes of action against some or all of thesix remaining defendants.  References to paragraph numbers in this judgment references to the paragraph numbers in the draft amendedstatement of claim.  Where appropriate I shall indicate whether or not the pleadings contained in the draft amended statement ofclaim were included in the original statement of claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In relation to a number of the different causes of action, some paragraphs have been added to the draft amended statement of claim,and in some existing paragraphs, references to defendants, not previously referred to in that paragraph, have also been added.  Invarious places paragraphs have been amended by the addition of further words or sentences.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  I am satisfied that the proper way to approach the matter is to consider each cause of action, separately, against each defendant. That is an exercise that will require examining first whether the pleading, as amended, is sufficient to disclose a reasonable causeof action, and, if it is sufficient, to then consider whether the survival of the cause of action is dependent upon an amendment. If the survival of the cause of action is dependent upon an amendment it will then be necessary to consider any limitation issuethat arises.  That latter exercise will require a consideration of O 20 R 5, and s 35 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap 347</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In the course of argument Mr Bedford, for the plaintiffs, read to me a number of passages from the notes to O 18 R 19 in <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2007</i>, setting out the principles to be applied.  I have applied those principles in dealing with this matter. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In considering the matter I bear in mind that the fact that the statement of claim may be in-elegantly pleaded, and not pleadedin the way in which I might have drawn the document myself, is not a basis to strike it out.  If I can make some sense of the pleading,I will do so, notwithstanding the fact that the pleading may not be entirely logically set out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  It is appropriate that I should record that Mr Bedford was not responsible for the original pleading.</p>    <p class="heading"><i style="text-transform: uppercase">The limitation issue:</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  A significant issue raised by these proceedings is the limitation issue.  The issue arises because steps are being taken to amendthe pleadings well after the expiry of the six year limitation period since the events, the subject of the proceedings, occurred.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In considering this issue it is appropriate to set out the following passage from <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure</i> 2007, Vol 1, para 20/8/7:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe principle underlying the powers of the court under O 20 R 5, it is that if the proceedings had been, from the beginning, properlyformulated or constituted in the circumstances specified in paras (3), (4), and (5), the defence of limitation would not have beenavailable to the defendant; and accordingly, if in its discretion, the court thinks it just to grant leave to amend defects in thepleading within the scope of the circumstances specified in those paragraphs so that such defects in the proceedings are treatedas having been cured <i>ab initio</i>, the defendant is not being deprived of the benefit of a defence which he would not have had if the proceedings had been so properlyformulated all constituted in the first place.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The submission made by Mr Bedford was that so long as a defendant had been named in respect of one cause of action, within the limitationperiod, another cause of action could be pleaded against him, outside the limitation period, even if that additional cause of actionrequired the pleading of new facts.  I am satisfied that is an incorrect interpretation of the effect of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 35</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> and O 20 R 5. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The effect of those provisions is that where it is necessary to plead facts to support a whole new cause of action, or to pleadnew or additional facts to substantiate a cause of action against a defendant, already a party to the proceedings, and it is soughtto plead those new or additional facts outside the limitation period, the amendment may not be permitted.  If however the essentialfacts required to substantiate an un-pleaded cause of action, are pleaded against a defendant in relation to another cause of action,in the discretion of court, amendment may be made to introduce the un-pleaded cause of action.</p>    <p class="heading"><i style="text-transform: uppercase">Pleading tantamount to fraud:</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In the course of argument Mr Bedford accepted that a number of paragraphs containing expressions such as: âfraudulent or recklessor negligent misrepresentationâ, or âfalse, misleading or deceptiveâ, or similar expressions, constituted rolled up pleas offraud and negligence, which were bad: see <i>Belmont Finance Corporation v Williams Furniture</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20Ch%20250" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] Ch 250.</a>  Mr Bedford conceded that the claim could not be couched in terms of fraud or recklessness.  He accepted also that it was a necessaryconsequence of that concession that all such expressions should be amended to be restricted to allegations of negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Mr Smith contended that if bad, the whole plea must go, with the inevitable consequence that the plea of negligence must go.  Thesubmission relied upon the decision in <i>Paragon Finance Plc v D B Thakerer &amp; Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20All%20ER%20400" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 All ER 400.</a>  That case makes it clear that an amendment which sought to make a new allegation of intentional wrongdoing, where previously nointentional wrongdoing had been alleged, constituted the introduction of a new cause of action, since intentional and unintentionalwrongdoing gave rise to distinct causes of action.  Leave to amend was refused in that case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  I have considered the decision and submissions carefully and have concluded that the converse does not apply.  And unintentionalact is comprised in an allegation of an intentional act, for the actor may say in response to the plea: âYes I did the act, butI did not intend to do it, nor did I intend the consequences of the actâ.  A plea of an unintentional act however may only be metby a denial, and not an assertion that the act was done intentionally.  In simple terms I am satisfied that the greater includesthe lesser.  <i>Paragon Finance</i> was a case of the lesser not including the greater.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Mr Bedford accepts that he must make appropriate amendments, pleading only unintentional acts.</p>    <p class="heading"><i style="text-transform: uppercase">Background Facts:</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The facts that I now set out are the facts alleged against the defendants in the draft amended statement of claim.  Although theyare mere allegations at this stage the court is required to look at the pleading without extrinsic evidence, and to decide, whether,on the assumption that the facts as pleaded are true, the pleading discloses a cause of action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Barber Asia was, at all relevant times, a company registered as a corporate investment adviser under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333" class="autolink_findacts">Securities Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333">Cap 333</a>, and a âregistered personâ, registered as an âInvestment Adviserâ under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/24" class="autolink_findacts">Securities and Futures Commission Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/24">Cap 24</a>.  Mr Christopher Barber and Mr Andrew Barber were also âregistered personsâ, and were personally registered under the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333" class="autolink_findacts">Securities Ordinance</a> as âInvestment Adviserâs Representativesâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  At all material times Mr Andrew Barber and Mr Dunford were directors of Barber Asia.  From 18 June 1998, Mr Dunford was also thecompany secretary to Barber Asia.  At all material times Mr Christopher Barber was an employee of Barber Asia.  He became a directorof Barber Asia on 30 October 1998.  Mr Clark was not a director of Barber Asia.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  International Strategies Group, (ISG), is a BVI company, of which Mr Christopher Barber and Mr Clark were, at all relevant timesdirectors.  ISG is fully owned and operated by Barber Asia.  Essentially ISG was a special-purpose vehicle used for the purpose ofpooling money from different parties, including the plaintiffs, who intended placing money in a particular investment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr Clarkâs principal occupation was that of a solicitor, employed in 1997 and 1998, as a consultant to the Hong Kong solicitorsfirm of Horvath &amp; Giles.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  As a result of advice given by Mr Christopher Barber, in his capacity as a director of Barber Asia, at a meeting, in about October1997, when Mr Clark was said to be present, the Plaintiffs became interested in investing in an investment scheme known as a âFullySecured Leverage Programâ, (FSLP).  The FSLP involved the leveraged trading of assets such as US Treasury bills or bank debentureinstruments from less than face value and reselling those instruments at high profit.  The plaintiffs say they were told that theirfunds would never be put at risk, that profits of at least 100% would be made within a period of six months, and that the FSLP wascontrolled by the US Federal Reserve.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The plaintiffs were informed that for tax reasons FSLP investments must be made by an overseas registered company, in this caseISG.  After the initial meeting in about October 1997, when the FSLP was first introduced to the plaintiffs, discussions concerningthe investment continued.  In particular by a letter dated 31 October 1997, on the letterhead of ISG, signed by Mr Christopher Barber,the plaintiffs were informed that there would be a Barclays Bank guarantee to 108% of the principal sum invested.  This assertionwas later varied to constitute a âbank guarantee from one of the top 25 banksâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  On 31 October 1997, Mr Mortensen transferred the sum of US$500,000 to an account of ISG held at the London Branch of the Bank ofEast Asia.  The transfer was for the purpose of investment in the FSLP.  On 16 January 1998, Mr Terkildsen transferred the sum ofUS$750,000, which had been advanced to him by Royal Skandia Life Assurance Ltd, to the same bank account.  Again, the transfer wasfor the purpose of investment in the FSLP.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The funds were not immediately invested in the FSLP, but remained in the account of ISG.  Apparently steps were still required toestablish the FSLP, before the plaintiffsâ funds could be invested.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  In the meantime, on 10 March 1998, on the letterhead of Barber Asia, Mr Andrew Barber wrote a memorandum to a Mr Ben Beaumont, abarrister formerly practising in Hong Kong.  The memorandum recorded a concern that the FSLP was a âscamâ, together with otherconcerns.  The plaintiffs were not informed of the concerns that were raised in this memorandum.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  About 6 May 1998, Mr Christopher Barber, acting on behalf of ISG, became a signatory to a bank account at the Brussels branch ofABN-Amro Bank in the name of âCorporation of the BankHouse Syndicate No 165â, (BankHouse).  It was this entity which was intendedto hold the funds invested in the FSLP. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  On about 12 May 1998, Mr Christopher Barber, notwithstanding the concerns that had been expressed in the 10 March 1998 memorandum,authorised the transfer, from ISGâs account at the London branch of the Bank of East Asia, to the BankHouse account in Brussels,the sum of US$4,000,100, which sum included the funds contributed by the plaintiffs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  On 29 May 1998, without any guarantee from any bank being in place, or any undertaking having been received from any merchant bank,Mr Christopher Barber, acting on behalf of ISG, authorised the transfer of US$4 million, including the plaintiffs funds, from theBrussels BankHouse account, to another bank account held by BankHouse at the Brussels branch of ABN-Amro bank.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The funds were never invested in an FSLP.  Of the sum of US$4 million transferred on 29 May 1998, some US$2.8 million were transferredto the accounts of various individuals, amongst which has been identified as sum of US$237,000 to Mr Clark.  It is said that Â£200,000was received by Barber Asia from ISG on about 3 September 1998.  Some repayments have been made to the plaintiffs but a substantialamount remains missing.</p>    <p class="heading"><i style="text-transform: uppercase">The causes of action pleaded:</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  In these circumstances the plaintiffs sued the various defendants seeking to recover their losses, which, with accrued interest,I am told now exceed US$5 million.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Mr Bedford contended for eight different causes of action, relating each one to the nine prayers for relief in the statement ofclaim.

Together with the usual requirements to establish the tort of negligence, that is, that the defendant owed theplaintiff a duty of care, that the defendant was in breach of that duty, that the plaintiff suffered a loss in consequence of thatbreach, and that such losses are of a kind for which the law recognizes the right to be compensated by the defendant, the plaintiffmust establish a special relationship between the parties to justify a duty. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In <i>Henderson</i>, (supra), the governing principle of <i>Hedley Byrne</i> was identified as being an assumption of responsibility by the defendant along with reliance by the plaintiff.  That assumption ofresponsibility may be by overt acts or words, but may be implied from the nature of the relationship.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The statement of claim, either in its original form, or its amended form, does not contain, as it ought to, a clear and specificplea, setting out the facts upon which the plaintiffs intend to rely, that a special relationship existed. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The statement of claim, in both forms, does however plead that legal duties were owed by Barber Asia, Mr Christopher Barber, MrAndrew Barber, and Mr Dunford, as fiduciaries, (para 4).  The duties are alleged to be owed to all persons to whom they held themselvesout as financial advisers and to whom they purported to give financial advice.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  By amendment, the draft amended statement of claim, (para 3), pleads particular duties on the part of Mr Andrew Barber and Mr Dunfordin their capacity as directors of Barber Asia.  This plea was originally made against Mr Dunford, but the addition of Mr Andrew Barberto this clause comes with the amendment.  In paragraph 5, plainly referring to both paragraphs 3 and 4, both versions of the statementof claim set out particular duties alleged to be comprised in the fiduciary duties pleaded on the part of the various defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  As Lord Browne-Wilkinson notes in his judgement in <i>Henderson</i> at p 206 A-B, the use of the expression âfiduciary dutiesâ in the context of <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability is dangerous.  If <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability is to be pleaded, it ought to be pleaded clearly and precisely and not indirectly through the medium of expressions suchas âfiduciaries dutiesâ.  But that said, it is sufficient to describe <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability as being of the nature of a fiduciary duty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  That <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability may arise in respect of the giving of financial advice is, I am satisfied, now so clear at law, that I have concluded thatthe pleading is sufficient to constitute a plea of a special relationship.  It is abundantly clear that financial advisers hold themselvesout as possessing a special expertise to advise persons on the suitability of financial investments.  A financial adviser must knowthat a person seeking their advice places implicit reliance on that expertise when they accept the advice and give to the adviserfunds to be invested.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  I find a direct parallel between the circumstances of a financial adviser and the managing agents of Lloydâs syndicates advisingNames, as described in the leading judgement in <i>Henderson</i>, per Lord Goff at 182 D-G.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Mr Bedford seeks to mount this claim against all defendants.  While a general assertion as to the special relationship is made,it is necessary to examine the facts alleged against each defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(a)     Barber Asia:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Barber Asia did not take part in the proceedings before me.  The facts alleged against Barber Asia are sufficient to substantiateMr Bedfordâs assertion that the statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action against the company in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(b)     ISG:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  There is no appropriate pleading that any fiduciary duty was owned by ISG to the Plaintiffs.  The pleas in relation to fiduciaryduties have been carefully confined to the individuals and to Barber Asia.  The only duty pleaded against ISG is that of a statutoryduty under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335">Cap 335</a>, contained in paragraphs 6 of the statement of claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  In so far as the draft amended statement of claim purports to be a claim against ISG in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability, it discloses no reasonable cause of action against that company, and to that extent is struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(c)     Mr Christopher Barber:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  In both versions of the statement of claim there are sufficient pleas that Mr Christopher Barber owed appropriate fiduciary dutiesto the Plaintiffs, and sufficient pleas of the manner in which those duties have allegedly been breached, that I am satisfied thatthe statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action against him in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  In reaching this conclusion I do not disregard the decision in <i>Williams v Natural Life Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%20831" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 831.</a>  That was a case involving assertions by a company director in a brochure which allegedly persuaded the plaintiffs to enter intoa franchise agreement with the company.

There are direct allegations of the advice being given to the plaintiffs by Mr Christopher Barber.</p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph' class="heading">Mr Andrew Barber:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  The giving of advice is an essential element of the tort comprised in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability.  The specific advice the plaintiffs say that was given that was negligent, is that the plaintiffs should invest in theFSLP.  That is dealt with in paragraph 12 of the draft amended statement of claim under the heading âAdvice given to the Plaintiffsby the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendantsâ.  There is no suggestion that Mr Andrew Barber attended the meeting at which the advice was given or that he gave anyother advice in relation to the FSLP. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  In the absence of any plea of advice given by Mr Andrew Barber to the plaintiffs, a claim against him based on <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability cannot succeed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  It is clear that a director of the company is not liable for the wrongs done by the company to others simply because he is a director:<i>Kuwait Asia Bank v National Mutual Life</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20BCLC%20868" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] BCLC 868</a> and <i>Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v Green Cartridge Co (HK) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20HKLR%2069" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] HKLR 69.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The only basis upon which Mr Bedford was able to argue for <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability on the part of Mr Andrew Barber is contained in paragraph 26 to 34 of the draft amended statement of claim, essentiallya plea that the individual directors, including Mr Andrew Barber, knew information to the detriment of the proposed investment inthe FSLP and that they failed to disclose that information to the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The general rule is that a positive act or misrepresentation is required, and that âmere silence, however morally wrong, willnot support an action of deceitâ: see <i>Bradford Third Equitable Benefit Building Society v Borders</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1941%5d%202%20ALL%20ER%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1941] 2 ALL ER 205.</a>  I accept Mr Smithâs submission that, <i>a fortiori</i>, the failure to disclose information alleged could not support a claim of negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  I do not disregard paragraph 48 of the draft amended statement of claim which contains a reference to Mr Andrew Barber.  The paragraphis however not a pleading of advice given by Mr Andrew Barber upon which the plaintiffs might have relied, but an irrelevant pleadingof evidence of facts that occurred after the events that might have given rise to the cause of action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In so far as the draft amended statement of claim purports to be a claim against Mr Andrew Barber in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability it does not disclose a reasonable cause of action, and to that extent is struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(d)     Mr Clark:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  There is no plea whatsoever against Mr Clark that he owed any fiduciary duty to the Plaintiffs.  As far as <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability is concerned, Mr Bedford seeks to include him in this liability by an amendment in paragraph 12, (old paragraph 14), ofthe draft amended statement of claim, which now includes an allegation that Mr Clark was present at a meeting at which the FSLP hewas recommended, and that Mr Clark too recommended the FSLP.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  There are two reasons why the statement of claim, in both forms, discloses no cause of action against Mr Clark in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability.  First, in both forms, it fails completely to plead any fiduciary duty on the part of Mr Clark towards the plaintiffs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Second, the plea in the draft amended statement of claim of an act on the part of Mr Clark, is a plea that he attended a meetingin October 1997, at which he gave advice to Mr Mortensen.  That is a plea of an act which took place in October 1997, more than sixyears prior to the date of the amendment.  If there were any right to a claim in this respect against Mr Clark, it is clearly statutebarred.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  In the absence of any pleading that Mr Clark owed a duty to the plaintiffs it would be quite wrong to exercise discretion to allowthe amendment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Insofar as the original or amended statement of claim purports to be a claim in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability against Mr Clark, it discloses no reasonable cause of action, and to that extent is struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(e)     Mr Dunford:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  An appropriate plea of a fiduciary duty owed by Mr Dunford is contained in both versions of the statement of claim.  However, thereis no allegation whatsoever that Mr Dunford gave any financial advice to either Plaintiff.  There is no allegation whatsoever ofany direct dealing between Mr Dunford and the Plaintiffs.  There is no plea the Mr Dunford was registered as an Investment AdviserâsRepresentative.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Paragraphs 51 to 53 above, in relation to Mr Andrew Barber, an equally relevant to Mr Dunford.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  In so far as the draft amended statement of claim purports to be a claim against Mr Dunford in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability it does not disclose a reasonable cause of action and to that extent is struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  In paragraph 49 of the draft amended statement of claim Mr Clark and Mr Dunford have been added to the list of defendants allegedto have failed to ensure that a bank guarantee was in place.  For there to be any liability at all in this respect it would havebeen necessary to the allegation to have been made in the original statement of claim.

While in the statement of claim Mr Dunford was alleged to be a director of BarberAsia, the particular paragraph referring to the liability of both Barber Asia and its directors under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a> omitted to specifically referred to Mr Dunford as a director.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  It is precisely these circumstances that the discretion of the court to permit amendment exists under O 20 R 5.  All essential elementsof the statutory tort were pleaded at the time Mr Dunford was made a party to the proceedings.  The only omission was a referenceto him in the particular paragraph referring to the statutory tort.  The new cause of action against Mr Dunford arises out of thesame facts as a cause of action in respect of which relief had already been claimed in the proceedings, namely <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability.  I am satisfied that this is an appropriate case to exercise discretion and to allow the amendment, thereby bringing MrDunford within scope of the pleadings in relation to the statutory tort.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  The imposition of liability on a director of a company is by way of rebuttable presumption.  If Mr Dunford can establish that heneither caused nor authorised the representation to be made he will escape liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  I am satisfied that the draft amended statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action against Mr Dunford in relation to<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a> liability, and that the amendment required does not offend against limitation provisions. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  Mr Ling said that it would be wrong to permit the claim to proceed against Mr Dunford in circumstances where there is no allegationthat he was actively involved in the giving of advice.  While superficially attractive, in relation to Protection of Investors liability,the submission cannot be sustained.  The legislation imposes liability on anyone who chooses to accept the position of director ofa company giving financial advice.  If bad advice is given, and loss suffered, the obligation falls on the director to rebut thepresumption that he is liable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  That said, I would have thought that the plaintiffs, in order to avoid any unnecessary costs, may wish to give careful considerationto any evidence Mr Andrew Barber or Mr Dunford may wish to present to them that might indicate that they, although directors of BarberAsia, were unaware of, or neither caused nor authorised the representations concerning the bank guarantee to be made.</p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph' class="heading">Negligent act, (extended Hedley Byrne liability):</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  The decision of the House of Lords in <i>Henderson</i> makes it clear that <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability is not confined to negligent advice.  The facts relevant to this head of claim are those relating to the transfer of theplaintiffs funds out of the control of ISG, and are set out in paragraphs 25-31 above. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  Mr Bedfordâs argument in this respect is that the act of transferring funds from ISGâs account in London, and ultimately outof the control of ISG, was a negligent act, caught by extended <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability, because there was demonstrably no bank guarantee in existence.  I am satisfied that such a claim would constitute a goodcause of action. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  The question that will determine whether or not a good cause of action exists depends upon the precise allegations as to who mighthave committed such an act.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(a)     ISG and Mr Christopher Barber:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  It is plain that both ISG and Mr Christopher Barber have committed acts which might fall within the scope of the claim.  ISG wasthe holder of the funds and permitted the funds to be transferred from its account at a time when there was no bank guarantee inplace.  The allegation is that it was Mr Christopher Barber who authorised the transfer, knowing that there was no bank guaranteein place.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  The acts on behalf of both ISG and Mr Christopher Barber on which the plaintiff relies in relation to this claim are principallycontained in paragraphs 37, 38 and 40 of the amended statement of claim, these paragraphs being added.  I am satisfied that theseare not new allegations, but mere particulars of the transfer of investment funds, already pleaded, (albeit barely), and that accordinglythe addition of those paragraphs does not fall foul of limitation provisions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  Mr Smith contends, relying upon <i>Williams</i>, that unless Mr Christopher Barber had personally assumed responsibility, he could not be found liable in this respect.  While theprinciple in <i>Williams</i> is plainly correct, it is inapplicable in the circumstances of a financial adviser, who either actually gives advice, as Mr ChristopherBarber has, or who performs specific acts with an investorâs funds, again as Mr Christopher Barber has.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  I am satisfied that the statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action against ISG and Mr Christopher Barber under extendedHedley Byrne liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(b)     Barber Asia, Mr Andrew Barber, Mr Clark and Mr Dunford</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  There are no allegations whatsoever of negligent acts on the part of Barber Asia, Mr Andrew Barber, Mr Clark or Mr Dunford.  Thereis no suggestion that it was improper for Barber Asia to place the funds with ISG is a trustee. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  There is not even an allegation that Mr Andrew Barber, Mr Clark or Mr Dunford were aware that Mr Christopher Barber had undertakenthe relevant transfer of funds.  The best that can be said, on the pleadings, against Mr Andrew Barber, Mr Clark or Mr Dunford isthat they sat aside and took no action while Mr Christopher Barber transferred the funds in the absence of a bank guarantee.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  Just as silence does not constitute a negligent misrepresentation, neither could sitting by and taking no action constitute a negligentact for extended <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  In so far as it purports to constitute a claim against Barber Asia, Mr Andrew Barber, Mr Clark or Mr Dunford in extended <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action, and to that extent is struck out.</p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph' class="heading">A claim in contract:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  The allegation of a claim in contract may be dealt with shortly.  In the course of argument Mr Bedford conceded that no contractwas pleaded, and that there was none that could be relied upon.  In so far as the statement of claim purports to constitute a claimagainst Barber Asia, Mr Christopher Barber and Mr Andrew Barber, in contract, it discloses no reasonable cause of action, and tothat extent is struck out.</p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph' class="heading">Professional negligence or breach of the Code of Conduct:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  The claim for professional negligence is based upon an allegation, contained in paragraph 4 of the draft amended statement of claim,(also originally pleaded), that Barber Asia, Mr Christopher Barber and Mr Andrew Barber, all being âregistered personsâ underthe <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333" class="autolink_findacts">Securities Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333">Cap 333</a>, were subject to duties arising from the Code of Conduct Persons Registered with the Securities and Futures Commission,(the Code).  This claim is confined to a claim against those three defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  Although no proper references to the particular provisions of the Code are specified in the statement of claim, I am satisfied thatthe contention that a registered person, subject to the Code, may be liable in negligence, should he act in breach of the Code, constitutesa good cause of action.  Whether the acts alleged constitute breaches of the Code, and consequently negligence, is plainly a matterfor trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  In so far as a statement of claim purports to be a claim in professional negligence against Barber Asia, Mr Christopher Barber andMr Andrew Barber, I am satisfied that, subject to any particulars that may have to be supplied relating the acts alleged to particularprovisions of the Code, a reasonable cause of action is disclosed.</p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph' class="heading">Breach of trust:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  This claim is confined to a claim against ISG, and Mr Christopher Barber.  In order to support the claim of breach of trust, MrBedford relies upon paragraphs 16, 25, 37, 38, and 40 of the draft amended statement of claim.  It seems to me that he needs alsoto rely upon the general allegation in paragraph 49.  Mr Smith, although not challenging the proposition that the statement of claimdiscloses a reasonable cause of action against ISG and Mr Christopher Barber for breach of trust, complains that paragraphs 37, 38and 40, contain new pleas which are too late.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  Paragraph 49 of the draft amended statement of claim, (and the original statement of claim), contained a plea that a bank guaranteehad not been in place.  I am satisfied that paragraphs 37, 38, and 40 of the draft amended statement of claim simply supply relevantparticulars to support the allegation in paragraph 49, and that no limitation issue arises.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  Mr Smith also relies upon <i>Williams</i> to contend that Mr Christopher Barber cannot be personally liable for the actions of ISG.  Again, <i>Williams</i> is plainly distinguishable.  On the pleadings Mr Christopher Barber was the person who attended to the transfer of funds, and oneof the persons who had made the assertions concerning the existence of a bank guarantee.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  I am satisfied that the draft amended statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action against ISG and Mr Christopher Barberfor breach of trust.</p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph' class="heading">Money had and received:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  The claim for money had and received is a claim restricted to ISG.  Mr Smith does not contend that there is no reasonable causeof action.  The statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action against ISG.</p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph' class="heading">Theâ Tracingâ claim:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  Paragraph 9 of the prayers for relief seeks what Mr Bedford describes as a âtracing claimâ.  Mr Bedford seeks this relief againstMr Christopher Barber, Mr Andrew Barber, Mr Clark, and Mr Dunford.  Mr Bedford described the tracing claim is arising through eithera constructive trust, or an unjust enrichment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  The leading authority on tracing is that of <i>Foskett v McKeown</i> &amp; Ors  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%201%20AC%20102" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 1 AC 102.</a>  There Lord Millett notes, at p 128D, that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âTracing is thus neither a claim nor a remedy.  It is merely the process by which a claimant demonstrates what has happened to hisproperty, identifies its proceeds and the persons who have handled or received them, and justifies his claim that the proceeds canproperly be regarded as representing his property.  Tracing is also distinct from claiming.  It identifies the traceable proceedsof the claimantâs property.  It enables the claimant to substitute the traceable proceeds for the original asset as the subjectmatter of his claim.  But it does not affect or establish his claim.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">In that case the plaintiff brought an action against a trustee who wrongfully misappropriated trust money, mixed with his own, andused to pay for an asset for the benefit of his children.  Once that cause of action, breach of trust, was properly established,the equitable tracing rules were available to the plaintiff as part of his relief.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  Thus, orders for tracing may be made, following the establishment of a proper cause of action.  Consequently in any of the circumstanceswhere, following this judgement and trial, there has been found to be a reasonable cause of action, the Plaintiffs will, upon theestablishment of that cause of action, be entitled to seek tracing or any other orders to which they are entitled, to recover theirfunds.  Tracing, by itself, is not a cause of action.  The relief is properly sought and relates to all of the causes of action whichsurvive this judgement.</p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph' class="heading">Summary:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  In summary therefore I am satisfied:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)     the draft amended statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action against Barber Asia and Mr Christopher Barberfor <i>Hedley Byrne</i> negligent misrepresentation;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)    the draft amended statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action against Barber Asia, ISG, Mr Christopher Barber,Mr Andrew Barber, and Mr Dunford in relation to the statutory tort under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a>;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)     the draft amended statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action against ISG and Mr Christopher Barber for extended<i>Hedley Byrne</i> negligent acts;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d)    the draft amended statement of claim discloses no cause of action against any defendant for breach of contract;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(e)     the draft amended statement of claim discloses a cause of action against Barber Asia, Mr Christopher Barber, and Mr AndrewBarber professional negligence, consequent upon breaches of the Code of Conduct for Persons Registered with the Securities and FuturesCommission, (March 1996);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(f)     the draft amended statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action against ISG and Mr Christopher Barber for breachof trust;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(g)     the draft amended statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action against ISG for money had and received.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph' class="heading">Costs:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  ISG, Mr Christopher Barber and Mr Andrew Barber and Mr Dunford have succeeded in having some of the causes of action against themstruck out, but they remain parties to the proceedings and face liability under other causes of action which have survived this judgement.
