In order to be registered as a team in that Divisionthe football team requires the endorsement of its District Council.  Provided it has that endorsement and all other application procedureshave been properly complied with the HKFA will register the team in that Division.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  In the seasons commencing 2003 and 2004, the team representing the Islands District was the Islands District Sports Association(âIDSAâ).  Unfortunately they finished bottom of the league in 2003/4 which led to there being no team representing the IslandsDistrict in the season commencing 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  For the season commencing 2006, a new team emerged, the Island District Football Club (âIDFCâ) which became registered for thatseason.  The matches for the 2006/7 season ended in March 2007.  </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In June 2007, events occurred which resulted in these proceedings in which the President and Chairman of IDFC (Mr Fan and Mr Yam)are suing on their own behalf and on behalf of IDFC the Chairman of the Island District Council (âIDCâ), Mr Lam Wai Keung for,<i>inter alia</i>, a declaration that three letters written by Mr Lam on 14, 18 and 19 June were maliciously published and false.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The onus is on the plaintiffs to prove that the statements were false, that they were published with malice and that the plaintiffssuffered financial loss as a result.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Before focusing on the allegedly false and maliciously published statements I shall outline the background, as I find it to be havingheard the evidence.  The plaintiffs both gave evidence, as did Mr Lam, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  For HKFA, who had been joined by the plaintiffs as a ânecessaryâ party, Mr Pui Kwan Kay, a Vice-Chairman, gave evidence. </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The annual general meeting (âAGMâ) of HKFA was due to take place on 25 June 2007.  HKFA has a board of eight directors.  Therewas to be an election at the AGM, by secret ballot, for five vacancies as directors.  One of those five vacancies was for the directorshiprepresenting the 3<sup>rd</sup> Division Districts League.  There were two candidates contesting that particular directorship.  One of them, the eventual winner,was Mr Kenneth Ng.  Mr Ng has played no part in these proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On or about 10 June 2007, Mr Ng approached Mr Fan, who had recently become President of IDFC, and asked him who IDFC would be castingtheir votes for at the forthcoming AGM.  Mr Ng was clearly lobbying for votes.  Mr Fan, at that stage, did not know who IDFC wouldbe voting for and in any event felt he was not obliged to provide the answer.  Being new to the post of President, he suggested ameeting be held with himself, Mr Ng and Mr Yam.  Such a meeting took place on 12 June at the Mandarin Hotel.  At the meeting Mr Yamgave the same response, namely that IDFC had not yet decided who to vote for and in any event was not obliged to tell Mr Ng.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Mr Lam comes into the picture in this way.  On 9 June 2007, he had telephoned Mr Yam to enquire how IDFC would vote at the AGM. The call was made on his mobile phone whilst in the street.  Mr Lamâs evidence was that when asked who IDFC would be voting for,Mr Yam answered to the effect that âWhoever comes up with more money would get his vote.â  Mr Yamâs version of the phone callwas that he said that the voting was a matter to be decided by IDFC in due course.  He did not say the words alleged by Mr Lam.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  I am satisfied that Mr Lam has not invented that there was a reference to money by Mr Yam.  Mr Yam may have forgotten saying itas, in any event, it was an inconsequential remark.  Voting for a candidate who might provide better sponsorship for the team wouldhave been a natural and sensible thing to do.  Mr Yamâs main message to Mr Lam, which he clearly remembers, was that IDFCâs choiceof candidate was a matter for IDFC and not a matter for IDC or its Chairman.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In my judgment, Mr Lam has placed undue weight on the remark about money.  I reject totally any suggestion, veiled or otherwise,that money might have changed hands for purposes âother than footballâ as Mr Lam put it.  I have no doubt that Mr Yam is an honourableand honest man and Mr Lamâs so called âconcernsâ about money being involved, insofar as it amounts to an attack on Mr Yamâscharacter, does him little credit.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  I accept that Mr Lam felt that Mr Yamâs response had been somewhat abrupt.  As a result of the short mobile phone conversation,Mr Lam felt that his authority over the councilâs football team was being taken away.  He felt that the District Council had theright to choose who to vote for and IDFC had no right to keep him in the dark about their choice.  The irony is that Mr Yam himselfwas not bothered who the football club decided to vote for.  His prime motivation was playing football not politics.  His true interestwas the development of youth football in Hong Kong not board room power struggles.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Mr Lam also gave evidence that, on 12 June, he met Kenneth Ng and Martin Hong (the latter being the leading light in one of thetwo opposing âcampsâ who were fighting the elections for the five vacancies on 25 June).  Arising out of that meeting Mr Lamlearnt two more things.  The truth or otherwise of those two things does not matter.  The relevance of them is that they enteredhis mind and thereby caused him to write the letters which are at the heart of this case.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Firstly, he learnt of the existence of a company owned by Mr Yam called âProgoal Ltdâ.  Mr Yam and Mr Fan were two of the threedirectors of Progoal.  Evidence revealed that Progoal was Mr Yamâs company under which all his footballing interests were managedand which supplied secretarial support.  IDFC was just one of many sporting organisations with which Mr Yam was directly involvedwhich came under the management of Progoal.  IDFC letters, written by Mr Yam, were on Progoal stationery.  This led Mr Lam to suspectthat the management of IDFC was being taken away from IDC and towards Progoal, a company about which he knew nothing.  Moreover,he was concerned that Mr Yam had never recorded or reported Progoalâs interest with IDC.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Secondly, Mr Lam said that he learnt for the first time, on 12 June, that he was no longer the President of IDFC.  He had been Presidentfor the previous season.  Mr Fan had now taken his place.  Mr Yamâs evidence was that early in the year Mr Lam had asked to stepdown as President due to an excess of commitments.  Mr Lam denied having said this.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  This particular conflict of evidence is difficult to resolve.  I do not think very much turns on it.  I do not think however thatthe election of Mr Fan as the new President was done for any ulterior or sinister motive.  Some earlier conversation about Mr Lamâsbusy work schedule may have been misunderstood.  In any event, Mr Lam has added this factor to the reasons for writing the lettersof 14, 18 and 19 June, to which I now turn.</p>    <p class="heading">THE CORRESPONDENCE</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  It should first be noted that the deadline for submitting the necessary forms for a team to register for the 2007/8 season was 1June 2007.  IDFC had duly submitted its application within time and HKFA confirmed in evidence that, but for this litigation, IDFCwould have been enrolled as the team representing the Islands District in the 2007/8 season.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The day after he met Mr Ng and Mr Hong, Mr Lam wrote, on 13 June, to HKFA in his capacity as Chairman of IDF in these terms :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âRegarding the participation of the Islands District Council in the District Third Division Football League last year, the councilonly assigned Islands District Football Club to send players to take part in the matches.  As regards all other administrative mattersand the qualification for representation, they should remain vested in the Islands District Council.  We respectfully send you thisletter for your information.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Thus, Mr Lam had unilaterally decided to inform HKFA that he regarded IDFCâs role to be no more than playing football matches. Impliedly, everything else (which necessarily includes the right to choose who to vote for at the AGM) were matters for IDC.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The next day, 14 June, HKFA replied as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âDear Sir,</p>        <p class="quote">Regarding your letter dated 13 June, we are now writing to inform you that according to the record of our association, the IslandDistrict Football Club is a registered affiliated member of our association and, therefore, our association will communicate directlywith the affiliated club concerning all the affairs of the association, document exchanges as well as matters relating to the participationin matches.  As for the administrative matters between Islands District Football Club and your esteemed council, we do not have anythingto do with them.</p>        <p class="quote">Thank you for your kind attention!â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The meaning of this letter is clear.  HKFA regards the football team as its member not IDC.  How a team and its own council arrangeadministrative matters between themselves is not of any concern to HKFA.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Ms Yanky Lam, counsel for HKFA at the hearing, informed the court that unless informed otherwise it considered the voting rightsat the AGM to be with the football club not the District Council.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Mr Lam replied the same day to HKFA.  This letter of 14 June is the first statement which the plaintiffs allege to be false andmaliciously published.  It reads :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âDear Sir,</p>        <p class="quote">The Islands District Council appointed the Islands District Football Club as a representative only to participate in the Districtthird Division Football League last year, and now the matches are done.  We are now writing to inform you that the Islands DistrictFootball Club has been disqualified from representing the Islands District Council.  We respectfully send you this letter for yourattention.</p>        <p class="quote">Regards,</p>        <p class="quote">Lam Wai-Keung SBS, BBS, JP</p>        <p class="quote">Chairman of the Islands District Councilâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The falsity alleged is that the letter gives the impression that the disqualification was a decision of IDC properly made at a meetingat which all necessary rules had been followed.  It is common ground, however that no IDC meeting took place prior to this letter.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  On 15 June, HKFA replied informing Mr Lam that the registration procedure for IDFC had already been completed and requesting âtherelevant resolution of meeting to our association for record purposeâ.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  On 16 June, IDFC wrote to HKFA informing them that they had not been notified by IDC that they had been disqualified and that neitherhad there ever been any objection to IDFC representing IDC for the forthcoming season.  They expressed their surprise at recent eventsand reiterated their wish to participate in the 2007/8 season.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  On 18 June, the 2<sup>nd</sup> statement, said to be false and malicious, was sent by Mr Lam to HKFA as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTo The Hong Kong Football Association Limited</p>        <p class="quote">The Islands District Council officially passed the following 2 resolutions in its Council Meeting held on 18<sup>th</sup> June 2007:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">Â·  The Islands District Council will appoint the Islands District Sports Association to represent the Islands District to attendthe Annual General Meeting of the Hong Kong Football Association Limited to be held on 25<sup>th</sup> June 2007.  Mr. Li Kwok-wah and Mr. Wong King-chuen will vote on behalf of the Islands District Council.</p>            <p class="quote">Â·  With effect from today, the Islands District Sports Association shall be the district football organization appointed by the IslandsDistrict Council, and to represent this Council as the Member of the HKFA.  The Chairman of the Association is Mr. Lam Wai-keung. The Vice Chairmen are Mr. Li Kwok-wah, Mr. Wong King-chuen and Mr. Ho Bing-chiu with Ms Cheung Yuet-mei as the Secretary.  And itsregistered address is c/o Tung Chung District Office, 1/F., Tung Chung Post Office Building, 6 Mei Tung Street, Tung Chung, LantauIsland.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">Further, it is to our knowledge that the Islands District Football Club, whose qualification as the representative [member club ofthe Islands District in the HKFA] has been hereby cancelled, might have assigned the authorization document for voting in the electionin the Annual General Meeting of the HKFA [to others], without the consent or approval of the Islands District Council, and haveappointed individuals not authorized by the Islands District Council to vote at the Annual General Meeting.  This is contrary tothe intention and plan of the HKFA in organizing district league.  This Council will conduct investigation to inquire into the truthof this matter.</p>        <p class="quote">Kindly please render the necessary cooperation by immediately taking the relevant procedural steps, so as to enable the lawful representativesof this Council to be eligible to attend the AGM and the election thereat.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  To complete the saga it is necessary to recite two more letters.  Firstly, HKFAâs reply to Mr Lam of 18 June which reads :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âDear Sirs,</p>        <p class="quote">Regarding your letter dated 18<sup>th</sup> June , it was said that the Islands District Sports Association would be appointed to attend the annual general meeting of 2007. However, according to the record of our association, the Islands District Sports Association is not an affiliated club in the years2006/2007 or 2007/2008 and therefore the Islands District Sports Association cannot attend the annual general meeting of 2007 asa representative.  We have to first complete the deregistration of the Islands District Football Club as an affiliated club beforewe can accept your application for appointing another football club.</p>        <p class="quote">Further, your letter does not provide (us) with the details relating to the cancellation of the appointment of the Islands DistrictFootball Club clearly.  We now urge you to submit the following documents:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1)  the relevant minutes concerning the cancellation of the appointment of the Islands District Football Club;</p>            <p class="quote">(2)  the relevant minutes concerning the appointment of the Islands District Sports Association.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">The above documents shall set forth the persons attending the meeting, time, date, and resolutions of the meeting and shall be signedand confirmed by the chairman as certified copies; and shall be sent to the secretariat of the Hong Kong Football Association Limitedbefore 12 oâclock on 20<sup>th</sup> June 2007, so as to expedite the procedure for the relevant deregistration/ registration of a new club.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Secondly, Mr Lamâs response dated 19 June which constitutes the final publication said to be false and malicious.  It was an extractfrom the IDC meeting on 18 June.  It included a list of names of persons present at the meeting (which contained some minor errorswhich are of no consequence) and a section headed âThe Relevant Resolutionsâ which were reported in the letter in the followingterms :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe relevant resolutions:</p>        <p class="quote">Lam Wai-keung, Chairman of this District Council, proposed to terminate the appointment of the Islands District Football Club to representthe Islands District as a Member of the HKFA with immediate effect, and proposed to appoint the Islands District Sport Associationas the Districtâs football organization to represent this District Council as a member of the HKFA with immediate effect, and askedthe proposal to be placed on record.  The Chairman of the Association is Mr. Lam Wai-keung.  The Vice Chairmen are Mr. Li Kwok-wah,Mr. Wong King-chuen and Mr. Ho Bing-chiu with Ms. Cheung Yuet-mei as the Secretary.</p>        <p class="quote">Lam Wai-keung, Chairman of this District Council, proposed that the Islands District Council should now appoint the Islands DistrictSports Association as its representative to attend the Annual General Meeting of the HKFA to be held on 25<sup>th</sup> June 2007 and to nominate Mr. Li Kwok-wah and Mr. Wong King-chuen to vote (at that meeting) for this District Council.</p>        <p class="quote">All Councillors present concurred to the above resolutions.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The complaint about the first statement (Lamâs letter of 18 June) is that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">i)  the expression âofficially passed the following 2 resolutionsâ does not truthfully reflect what happened at the meeting;</p>        <p class="quote">ii)  there was no specific resolution that IDSA would attend the AGM;</p>        <p class="quote">iii)  there was no specific resolution that Mr Li Kwok Wah and Mr Wong King Chuen would cast votes on behalf of IDC at the AGM; and</p>        <p class="quote">(iv)  the plaintiffs also complain that there was no factual basis for the penultimate paragraph of the letter and the matter hadnot been discussed at the meeting on the 18<sup>th</sup>.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The complaint about the letter of the 19<sup>th</sup> is that the ârelevant resolutionsâ in the letter were not the same as the words which appear in the official transcript of theminutes of the meeting under the heading of âOther Mattersâ.  That extract is as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âXIV.  Other Matters</p>        <p class="quote">150.  The Chairman said that last year Islands District Football Club was appointed to represent the Island District Council to participatein the local third division football league, however, it was later found out that the District Council did not quite understand theadministration of the said club.  Therefore, he suggested that the councilors should support canceling the arrangement of the IslandsDistrict Football Club representing the Islands District in participating in the league game and that it should be substituted bythe Islands Sports Association instead, with immediate effect.  The Chairman also suggested that the two vice-chairmen of the IslandsSports Association, namely Mr. Wong King-chuen and Mr. Lee Kwok-wah, should represent the Islands District Council to take part inthe work of administration and of socializing with the Football Association.</p>        <p class="quote">151.  Councilor, Ms. Lee Kwai-chan, enquired about how to reply if someone made enquiries?</p>        <p class="quote">152.  The Chairman said that the person could make enquiry to him directly.</p>        <p class="quote">153.  The Councilors did not raise objection to the Chairmanâs suggestion.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Again, the minute does not refer to Mr Wong or Mr Li being appointed to attend and vote at the AGM.  It merely suggests that theyshould ârepresent IDC and take part in the work of administration and of socializing with the Football Associationâ.  The finaldifference is that Mr Lamâs letter concludes âAll councillors present concurred to the above resolutionsâ whereas the minutesrecord that âthe councilors did not raise objection to the Chairmanâs suggestion.â</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  At the next meeting of IDC in August 2007 the minutes of the June meeting were formally adopted, although one councillor did questiontheir validity.  The basis of the questioning was the same as the plaintiffs complaints about that meeting, namely that the issuewas only raised under âany other businessâ, at the very end of the meeting, without any prior notice being given.  It was passedafter only a few minutesâ discussion when some of those at the meeting had already left.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  There is no doubt that all proper formalities were not complied with at the meeting.  Certain standing orders were ignored.  However,the standing orders for District Council meetings are flexible so as to deal with urgent matters.  Mr Lam said in evidence that thiswas such a matter.  Whether or not the standing orders were strictly complied with does not determine whether the letters were falseand malicious.  The issue does however reflect on Mr Lamâs autocratic approach to the entire issue.  I have no doubt that he believedthat IDC had the ultimate say in who IDFC should vote for.  He had lost trust in Mr Yam for a combination of reasons already referredto and he had decided to replace IDFC with IDSA so that the football team would be under his authority whereas it seemed that IDFCplainly did not want to be.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Such was his autocratic approach that he even had the letter of 18 June typed up before the meeting.  The meeting ended at 17:20hours and the letter was faxed at 17:24 hours.  He may have had time to sign it in those four minutes but little else.  It does notgo to his credit that in evidence he was not willing to admit that a draft of the letter must have been prepared in advance.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  In my judgment the single explanation for the entire episode is that Mr Lam felt IDFC had behaved curtly towards him.  The way inwhich he had ceased to be the President had not been done properly, he felt he should have been told about Progoal and he felt IDChad the right to be informed of IDFCâs voting intentions at the AGM.  He believed he had the authority to act in the way he did. He decided to use his position as Chairman to replace IDFC with IDSA.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Criticism may justly be made that he overreacted, behaved autocratically and used his position to IDFCâs disadvantage but as willbe seen hereafter I do not think that the plaintiffs have shown the letters to be false and maliciously published thereby causingloss so that this court should make a declaration to that effect.  In general terms the facts are in the plaintiffsâ favour butthe standard of proof of the tort alleged has not been met.  The facts favour the plaintiffs, the law favours the defence.</p>    <p class="heading">LAW</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The ingredients of the tort are simple to state.  The plaintiffs must prove that the words used were false, that they were publishedto third parties, that they were published maliciously and that special damage has resulted from the publication.  The falsity ofa statement is to be determined by what the words would convey of the ordinary reader.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  What constitutes malice is more difficult.  A false statement is not a malicious one if it was made in the careless belief thatit was true.  To determine malice there must be a finding of the makerâs motive in publishing the words.  Malice or improper motivecannot be inferred from the mere absence of <i>bona fides</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Finally the plaintiffs must allege and prove special damage :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âUnless the plaintiff had in fact suffered loss, which can be and is specified, he has no cause of action.  The fact that the defendanthas acted maliciously cannot supply the want of special damage, nor can a superfluity of malice eke out a case wanting in specialdamage.â (<i>Joyce v. Sengupter</i> [1993] 1 WLR at p. 347.)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The damage must be a pecuniary loss.  Merely seeking compensation as a result of a malicious falsehood which caused no actual losswill not suffice.</p>    <p class="heading">APPLICATION OF THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES TO THE FACT OF THIS CASE</p>    <p class="heading">(a)  Mr Lamâs letter of 14 June 2007</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The use of the word âweâ on two occasions indicates that the letter was written by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant on behalf of himself as Chairman and the Council, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  The high water mark of the falsehood therein is that the Council is informing HKFA that IDFC âhas been disqualifiedâ. The rest of the letter is factually accurate.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  The letter implies that the Council had disqualified IDFC.  In fact Mr Lam had disqualified them unilaterally which he had no authorityto do.  There had been no meeting, no discussion, no decision of the Council.  Mr Albert Yau, counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants, quickly points out that the letter does not say there had been any meeting or resolution.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  However, a court is entitled to look at more than the mere words in black and white.  The ordinary reader would assume that theâdisqualificationâ had resulted from some sort of formal procedure involving at least two people (because of the word âweâ). I am satisfied that the ingredient of âfalsityâ is made out in the letter of 14 June.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  However, I am not satisfied that malice has been established.  His motive was to replace IDFC with IDSA.  This motive was foundedon a number of factors including his belief that the Council should have a say in who the football club votes for at the AGM andhis belief that Progoal might be usurping the Councilâs authority.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  I accept that these beliefs were genuinely held by Mr Lam.  I accept also that he honestly believed that he had the right, as Chairman,to do what he did.  The fact that a more democratically minded or fairer Chairman might have believed differently is of no consequence. I do not accept that he was intending to deceive HKFA.  I accept that he believed he acted within his authority when writing theletter and believed that it was true.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Before considering the second and third letters it should be stated that the first letter resulted in no pecuniary loss to IDFC. Had that letter been the end of the matter IDFC would have lost its status in Division III.  No evidence has been adduced to showthat being in Division III brings with it financial gain.  There is no evidence of any loss of sponsorship.  The only loss is theloss of a modest government subsidy designed to pay for certain expenses arising from playing football in that Division.  Ironically,Mr Yam explained that some of the team expenses had been met from his own pocket.  Such generosity and enthusiasm for youth footballis entirely to his credit but it means that as far as he was concerned he was better off rather than worse off as a result of IDFCnot participating in Division III.</p>    <p class="heading">(b)  Mr Lamâs letters of 18 and 19 June</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  It is the plaintiffsâ case that these letters contain the following falsehoods :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">i)  that a resolution had been passed authorizing IDSA to <i>attend the AGM</i> as IDCâs representative;</p>        <p class="quote">ii)  that a resolution had been passed authorizing Mr Li and Mr Wong <i>to vote</i> on behalf of IDC;</p>        <p class="quote">iii)  that IDC â<i>might have assigned</i>â the authorization document for voting; and</p>        <p class="quote">iv)  that âall councilors present concurred to the above resolutionsâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  A perusal of the actual minutes of the meeting held on 18 June does reveal inconsistencies and inaccuracies.  However, I considersuch inaccuracies fall short of proof of falsehoods.  I do not think there was an intention to lie or deceive.  The fact of the matteris that the resolution as recorded in the minutes is consistent with Mr Li and Mr Wong being able to attend the AGM and being authorizedto vote as the IDSA representatives of IDC.  That the IDC âmight have assignedâ the proxy forms was a speculative belief genuinelyheld.  I acknowledge that the paragraph is strongly worded in that it commences âit is to our knowledge â¦â, however Mr Lamis saved by the later use of the words âmight have â¦â and that an investigation would be conducted.  The fact that Mr Lam hadattached sinister motives to the involvement of Progoal which were not merited does not convert the belief from a genuine one intoa reckless one. </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Finally, it is arguable that the difference between âall present concurringâ and âno councillors objectingâ is, in the overallcontext, although technically different, a difference without any real meaning.  The ordinary reader would not be deceived into thinkingthat any adverse opinions had been voiced at the meeting.  The former is âunanimousâ, the latter is â<i>nem con</i>â.  They are different but the difference, on the evidence, does not, in my judgment, amount to a falsehood for purpose of theseproceedings.</p>    <p class="heading">ANY MALICE ESTABLISHED BY THE 18/19 JUNE LETTERS?</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Had these letters contained actionable falsehoods it would have been necessary to go on to consider the ingredient of malice.  Again,had it been necessary to do so, I would have found the evidence fell short of proof of malice.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Mr Lamâs motive for conducting this business in the way he did is no different on 18/19 June than it was on 14 June.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The fact is that he held firm opinions about the authority of the IDC over IDFC and his own authority over IDFC and about the truthof how he may have been deposed as President and about the true role of Progoal.  These opinions, when examined, were plainly suspect. However, it cannot be said, in my judgment, that they were recklessly held.  Neither can it be said that because he felt affrontedand reacted autocratically that his method of dealing with the matter constituted the tort of <i>malicious</i> falsehood.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The key factual matters, which are in the plaintiffsâ favour, are that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i)  the business was clearly rushed though at the meeting under âAny Other Businessâ;</p>        <p class="quote">(ii)  a letter to HKFA had clearly been drafted in advance in preparation for speedy dispatch in the event of the motion being passed;</p>        <p class="quote">(iii)  the resolution did not specify that Mr Li and Mr Wong would attend the AGM and vote; and</p>        <p class="quote">(iv)  certain Standing Orders which regulate the business at meetings of the IDC had not been complied with.  (This is not fatal tothe validity of the motion in question.  Such Standing Orders can be waived for urgent situations and in any event can be rectifiedby the adoption of the minute at a subsequent meeting.)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In short, I consider the evidence to reveal in Mr Lamâs mind a determination to restore what he believed to be his authority andIDCâs authority over their football team at a time when he believed, albeit wrongly, that it was being threatened; however, itdoes not reveal malice for the purpose of this action.</p>    <p class="heading">PECUNIARY LOSS?</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The evidence does not support the contention that IDFC would have suffered pecuniary loss as a result of the issuance of the twoletters of 18 and 19 June.</p>    <p class="heading">THE POSITION OF THE HKFA</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  The stance taken by the HKFA in this dispute has been commendable throughout.  It correctly pointed out that IDC does not have anypower to vote at the HKFA AGM; that power is vested in its chosen football team.  The HKFA correctly refrained from becoming involvedin any disputes between a District Council and its football team.  Administrative matters between a council and a team are mattersfor them, not for the HKFA.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The HKFA, by their letter of 15 June, was right to question Mr Lamâs first letter which purported to disqualify IDFC from participatingin the forthcoming season.  Their response, on 18 June, to Mr Lamâs second letter (also of 18 June) was also measured and correct. The HKFA did not interfere with the votes cast at the AGM by IDSA in accordance with a court injunction which had been granted restrainingthem from so doing.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  HKFA has always stated that it will abide by the adjudication of the court.  Moreover it, helpfully, stated during the trial thatit would entertain late applications for participation in the 2009/10 season from either team.  It is willing to assist where possibleto ensure that the Island District is represented in Division III next season.  This can be seen from the âunderstandingâ reachedbetween the parties in the course of the trial to the following effect :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¢  IDSA will be given the indorsement by the IDC to participate in the League for the season 09/10 and it will submit the registrationforms before 01.06.09 to the HKFA.</p>        <p class="quote">â¢  If the Court finds in favour of IDFC in this action and rules that the IDC did not pass the resolutions having the effect ofterminating the endorsement of IDFC to participate in the League for the season 07/08 on behalf of the Islands District, then IDSAis prepared to withdraw its application for the registration for the season 09/10</p>        <p class="quote">â¢  Further, in such event, D1 will recommend to all the members of the IDC to give the necessary indorsement to the IDFC to participatein the League for the season 09/10</p>        <p class="quote">â¢  HKFA will in such circumstances consider such late application for registration by the IDFCâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  As a result of this decision it will remain IDCâs decision as to which team truly merits their endorsement and therefore whichteam should make the application for the HKFAâs consideration. </p>    <p class="heading">CONCLUSION AND COSTS</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  As will be seen the court has not been slow to critize the conduct of Mr Lam.  An element of falsity was established with regardto the first letter but that apart, no falsehoods or malicious publications have been established.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs approach to the entire saga was unattractive but not unlawful.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  I decline to make the declarations sought but am confident that the proper and just award as to costs between the plaintiffs andthe 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants is that there be no order as to costs.  Such an order, in my judgment and in my discretion, meets the justice of the case.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Equally, it seems entirely proper to me to award HKFA their costs so that they are fully compensated for their expenses.  I orderthat HKFAâs costs are paid on an indemnity basis 50% by the plaintiffs and 50% by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants.  All costs orders shall be on a <i>nisi</i> basis.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(M.P.
