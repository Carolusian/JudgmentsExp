The Defendants agree with certain amendments but object to thoseamounting to an addition of 2 new courses of action.</p>    <p class="heading">The Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> On 8 January 1997, the 2nd Defendant became the registered owner of the piece of land known as the Remaining Portion of Lot No. 208in D.D. 14 (âthe Landâ).</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> By 2 written agreements (âthe Agreementsâ) in Chinese dated 2 June 1997 and 25 September 1997, the 1st Defendant agreed to selland the Plaintiffs agreed to purchase the 2nd Floor (including the roof thereof) and the 1st Floor of the building (âthe Buildingâ)to be erected on the Land at the respective prices of $2,250,000 and $1,800,000.  The Plaintiffs paid 10% of the purchase price asdeposit.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> However, on 11 April 2002, the Plaintiffs, through their then solicitors, gave notices  to terminate the Agreements:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ It was agreed, inter alia, that you shall proceed to apply for building licence and to construct the building of which theProperty forms part as soon as possible after the signing of the Agreement and in any event to complete the transaction within areasonable time.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">However, in breach of the Agreement, you failed to apply for building licence of and to construct the said building and to completethe transaction with our client within a reasonable time.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">We are instructed that our clients now accept your repudiation of the Agreement and to demand your return to our client the sum ofâ¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The Defendants did not agree to the demand.  On 5 June 2002, the Plaintiffs commenced DCCJ 3440/2002 against the Defendants for thereturn of a total sum of $405,000, interest and costs.  The Defendants denied any breaches and counterclaimed for damages causedby the wrongful repudiation of the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The proceedings in the District Court went through the pleadings and discovery stage.  Trial was further fixed on 11 and 12 August2005.  However, on 18 July 2005, by consent, the proceedings were transferred to the High Court to become the present proceedingsHCA 1746/2005.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Thereafter, the parties appeared before the Listing Master of the High Court on a number of occasions.  On 26 October 2005, leavewas given to the parties to set down the case for trial with 3 days estimated before a bilingual judge on the fixture list.  Nonetheless,there were some outstanding interlocutory matters to be disputed.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> On 13 June 2007, I heard and dismissed an application by the Plaintiffs against the 2nd Defendant for specific discovery. It wasbecause, among other grounds, the âlawfulnessâ of the Agreements had never been raised as an issue by the pleadings before theCourt.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Probably, as a result of this ruling, on 18 September 2006, the Plaintiffs took out an application to re-amend their Amended Statementof Claim. They sought to put forward an alternative case that the Agreements were illegal and unenforceable because the 2nd Defendant,being an indigenous villager, had made a misrepresentation to the Government under the Small House Policy that he was the legal andbeneficial owner of the Land.  However, under the arrangement between the Defendants, the 1st Defendant was the beneficial ownerinstead.  As a result, due to the âillegalityâ, the Defendants should return the deposits paid or pay damages because of:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) money had and received by them, and/or</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b) a breach of contract for the Defendants would never be able to pass good title of the Building to the Plaintiffs.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The Defendants opposed to the amendments concerning the âillegalityâ.  I heard the substantive arguments on 15 May 2007.  Ms.Eva Sit of Counsel acted for the Plaintiffs.  Mr. Eric Yao of Counsel and Mr. R. Hout of Messrs. Rene Hout &amp; Co. representedthe 1st and 2nd Defendant respectively.  Having heard from the parties, I reserved my decision to be handed down.  I now do so.</p>    <p class="heading">Ruling</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Upon consideration of the evidence authorities and submissions from the parties, I have decided to allow the Plaintiffsâ application. My reasons appear in below.</p>    <p class="heading">Reasons</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The following extracts from paragraph 20/8/6 of the HKCP 2007 at page 364 and 365 provide a good starting point to determine theparties dispute.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b>General principles for grant of leave to amend</b> (rr.5, 7 and 8)âIt is a guiding principle of cardinal importance on the question of amendment that, generally speaking, all suchamendments ought to be made âfor the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties to any proceedingsor of correcting any defect or error in any proceedings â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It is a well established principle that the object of the Court is to decide the rights of the parties, and not to punish them formistakes they make in the conduct of their cases by deciding otherwise than in accordance with their rights â¦ I know of no kindof error or mistake which, if not fraudulent or intended to overreach, the Court ought not to correct, if it can be done withoutinjustice to the other party.  Courts do not exist for the sake of discipline, but for the sake of deciding matters in controversy,and I do not regard such amendment as a matter of favour or grace â¦ It seems to me that as soon as it appears that the way in whicha party has framed his case will not lead to a decision of the real matter in controversy, it is as much a matter of right on hispart to have it corrected if it can be done without injustice, anything else in the case is a matter of right.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Further, if the proposed amendments amount to adding new course of action, Order 20 rule 5(5) RHC stipulates that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(5)  An amendment may be allowed â¦â¦ notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment will be to add or substitute a new causeof action if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a cause of action in respectof which relief has already been claimed in the action by the party applying for leave to make the amendment.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> In considering whether the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts, both Counsel agreedthe following remarks made by Mr. Recorder Shieh SC in HCA 2741/1998, unreported, 5 January 2007.  In short, there is no hard andfast rule.  Each case depends on its own facts and the Court should adopt a âcommon senseâ approach.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â26.      It has been said that whether the new cause of action arose out of the same or substantially the same facts is âa matterof impressionâ (see <i>Welsh Development Agency</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20WLR%201409" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 WLR 1409</a> at 1418D <i>per</i> Glidewell LJ).  In <i>Paragon Finance</i>, however, Millett LJ observed at 418 that this might be so in borderline cases.  In other cases it must be a matter of analysis.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">27.       I do not read these judgments as laying down any mechanical rule whereby one has first of all to decide whether a case isâborderlineâ and then decide the question by (i) impression (if âborderlineâ) or (ii) analysis (if not âborderlineâ). In my view these judgments simply set out a common sense approach (and in <i>Paragon</i> at 418g-h Millett LJ expressly referred to and agreed with the first instance judgeâs application of common sense).  It is notpossible to judicially âlegislateâ for all types of new causes of action that the Courts will have to consider.  There will invariablybe a spectrum of possibilities.  Some will obviously involve (or not involve) substantially the same facts; some less so.  The questionwill have to be addressed on a case by case basis.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">28.        It has been observed that the words in Order 20 rule 5(5) are not to be narrowly construed and that they should be givena broad and liberal interpretation in order to attain the objective of the rules: <i>Leung Kin Fook v Eastern Worldwide Co. Ltd. (No.2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20HKC%20524" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 HKC 524</a> at 528C-D <i>per</i> Litton VP (as he then was).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">29.        â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">30.        â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">31.       In my view it must be right that in order for a new cause of action to fall within Order 20 rule 5(5), the material factssupporting that new cause of action need <u>not</u> be identical to, or the same as, or be a âcomplete overlap withâ, those supporting the originally pleaded cause of action.  Thisis clear from the wording of Order 20 rule 5(5) itself, in that the sub-rule expressly recognized the possibility that an amendmentto add a new cause of action could arise out of <i>substantially the same facts</i> (i.e. facts which are not âthe sameâ but only âsubstantially the sameâ) as the cause of action originally pleaded.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">32.      Thus the originally pleaded cause of action may rely on material facts A, B and C.  The new cause of action may rely on materialfacts A, B, C and D (or A, B and D).  The additional of new fact D (or the substitution of new fact D for old fact C) does not <i>necessarily</i> mean that the facts are not substantially the same.  It depends (among other things) on the nature of the causes of action concerned(see, e.g. Millett LJ in <i>Paragon</i> at 418g-h) and the nature and importance of the new facts averred.  There can be no hard and fast rule.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Applying the above principles to Ms. Sitâs application, I am satisfied that, by adopting a common sense approach, in the proposedRe-amended Statement of Claim, the Plaintiffs are relying on substantially the same facts as contained in the original pleadings. It is always the Plaintiffsâ case that they are entitled to the return of the 10% deposit paid due to the breaches on the partof the Defendants.  To employ the analysis of Mr. Recorder Shieh, SC, the material facts A, B and C of the original case are thePlaintiffs, the Defendants and breaches of the Agreements.  The additional new fact D will be the fact that the Agreements are illegal. The Plaintiffs, by the new courses of action, is still asking for the 10% deposit, but simply putting two further alternative basis((a) money had and received and (b) further breach of contract for failure to prove good title) in case that this Court will findthe arrangement between the Defendants amounting to a contract to commit a civil wrong, namely the tort of misrepresentation on theGovernment.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Mr. Yao further argued that discretion of the Court should be exercised against the Plaintiffs because of the lateness of the applicationand the prejudice suffered which could not be compensated by costs.  Ms. Sit did not attempt to argue that the Plaintiffs were notlate.  However, she said that it was not too late, and I agree.  Fortunately, no trial dates have been fixed and the applicationfor amendment for pleadings is not made at the first day before the Trial Judge.  There is still time for the parties to put forwardthe real question in controversy before the Court.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> As to prejudice, Mr. Yao said in his skeleton that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â34.      The late amendment causes prejudice to D1 which cannot be compensated for by costs:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i)         D1 will have to put in further effort to amend Defence, make further discovery and supplemental witness statements;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(ii)        there will be another significant period of delay until the matter gets finally adjudicated by the Court (the delay sofar is wholly caused by Ps); and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(iii)       there is a significant and real risk that D1âs witnesses will suffer from a fading of memory of events happened in asearly as 1997.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>With respect, these prejudice are not specific enough to persuade me to accept that they cannot be compensated by costs.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Finally, I certainly realize that both Counsel, in the context of arguing when the limitation period should start to run, have spentquite some efforts arguing on the âknowledgeâ of the Plaintiffs about the âillegalityâ of the Agreements, if any.  However,in any opinion, I need not make any ruling on the dispute as the amendments can be allowed under Order 20 rule 5(5) RHC as aforesaid. Further, probably, the determination of such dispute does have some bearings on the ultimate result of the proceedings, and as such,the Trial Judge, with the benefit of oral testimony of the witnesses and full documentation, must be in a far better position thanme to make a finding on the same.</p>    <p class="heading">Directions</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In the circumstances, I direct that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)       The Plaintiffs do have leave to re-amend the Amended Statement of Claim as per the copy marked exhibit  âTSF-1â andfile and serve the same within 7 days from the date hereof.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)       The Defendants do have leave to file and serve their Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim within 14 days thereafter.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)       The Plaintiffs do have leave to file and serve their Re-Amended Reply and Defence to Counterclaim within 14 days thereafter.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d)      Liberty to apply for further directions.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Costs usually follow the event.
