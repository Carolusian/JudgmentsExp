It is brought under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10(2)(e)(ii)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124" class="autolink_findacts">Lands Resumption Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/124">Cap. 124</a>.</p>                <p> </p>                <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The land resumption case had been settled between the parties without any application having been made to this tribunal.  It wasa case of compensation for extinguishment of leasehold interest in 4 lots of land.  The Applicant was the tenant of these lots, whichwere let to him by four different landlords.  He in turn sublet them to subtenants.  The claim for compensation was settled at $755,000.</p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The Applicantâs present claim is for remuneration at $174,480, of which $133,925 is profit costs of solicitors, $8,000 is forthe law costs draftsman for drafting the bill of costs, $31,375 is for the surveyors and the rest are for disbursements.  The surveyorsâfees are based on scale charge.  The Respondent does not argue against these fees or the disbursements.  The arguments are only onthe solicitorsâ profit costs and the law costs draftsmanâs costs.</p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>   I would firstly deal with the law costs draftsmanâs claim for 5 hoursâ work at the rate of $1,600 per hour of $8,000.  Thebundle of documents in support of the bill has 376 pages.  The bill covered 16 pages containing over 140 items.  The Respondent saysthat 2 hours would be enough for the preparation of this bill.  I do not agree.  Time has to be spent on reading the documents forpreparing the bill.  I find 5 hoursâ work reasonable and I so allow. </p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Turning to the claim of the solicitorsâ profit costs, the first argument is on whether I should allow the costs at the DistrictCourt Scale or the High Court Scale.</p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Respondent argues that the compensation claim was settled before any application had been lodged with the tribunal.  He furtherargues that the claim for remuneration at $174,480 is within the District Courtâs jurisdiction; hence, I should apply the DistrictCourt Scale.</p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  I note that the limit of the District Courtâs jurisdiction for claims under contract and tort was raised from $600,000 to $1 millionon 1<sup>st</sup> December 2003.  This compensation claim was settled by the Applicantâs acceptance of the Respondentâs offer of $755,000 on 28<sup>th</sup> October 2003.  At that time, this sum was outside the District Courtâs jurisdiction. </p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  If I should ignore the amount of the compensation claim but to use the amount of the remuneration claim to find jurisdiction forthe District Court, that would discourage the settlement of compensation claims before applications for the same have been lodgedwith the tribunal.  If I should do so, the claimants would only want to settle their compensation claims after the same have beenlodged with the tribunal so as to make sure that their remuneration claims, which form part of the compensation claims, would beassessed at the High Court Scale.  I therefore do not think I should ignore the amount of the compensation claim as settled. </p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Furthermore, if such an approach were correct, then the District Court Scale would apply to remuneration claims so long as the remunerationis less than $1 million and regardless whether the compensation claim has been settled at $10 million or $20 million or more.  Suchan approach does not appear to be logical.</p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  I take the view that so long as the settlement sum is outside the District Courtâs jurisdiction, the remuneration claim shouldbe assessed on the High Court Scale. </p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Respondentâs next point is that the claim for compensation for resumption of land is more analogous to claims brought under<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 35</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a> than under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32.</a>  Before its amendment which took effect on 1<sup>st</sup> December 2003, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a> provided: -</p>                <p> </p>        	<blockquote>	        <p class="quote">â32.  (1) The Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine any action founded on contract, quasi-contract or tort where the amountof the plaintiff's claim does not exceed $600000.â </p>		</blockquote>                <p> </p>                <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 35</a>, before 1<sup>st</sup> December 2003, read: -</p>                <p> </p>        	<blockquote>	        <p class="quote">â35.

I think <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/116/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32</a> provides a better analogy than <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/116/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 35.</a>  For this reason, I do not agree that I should apply the District Court Scale.</p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The third point on the applicable scale relates to the increase of the District Courtâs jurisdiction for claims in contract andtort to $1 million on 1<sup>st</sup> December 2003.  The Respondent refers me to the case of <i><u>Ali Shoukat v. Hang Seng Bank Limited</u></i> HCPI3/2003.  This action was instituted in 2003.  It went to trial on 4<sup>th</sup> March 2004 and the plaintiff succeeded.  The Honourable Mr. Justice Suffiad said at the end of the judgment that: -</p>        	<blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn view of the amount recovered by the plaintiff at $675,514.05, which is below the jurisdiction of the District Court after itsincrease in jurisdiction to $1 million, effective 1 December 2003, this matter could and should have been transferred to the DistrictCourt after that date.  Accordingly, there will be a costs order nisi that the defendant do pay the plaintiff his costs of this action,to be taxed on the High Court scale, if not agreed, in respect of all costs incurred up to 1 December 2003; but, for those costsincurred after 1 December 2003, to be taxed on the District Court scale, if not agreed.â </p>    	</blockquote>            <p> </p>                <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In the present case, the compensation claim was settled on 28<sup>th</sup> October 2003, leaving the formal agreement to be made at a later stage.  If the case of Mr. Shoukat did not go to trial in March2004 but were settled on 28<sup>th</sup> October 2004, leaving a consent summons to be drawn up and approved at a later stage, I wonder whether the same costs order wouldhave been made there.  I therefore do not think I should follow the learned judge as the facts of this case are very much differentfrom those in the case of Mr Shoukat. </p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  All in all, I decide that the High Court scale should apply.</p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The next point raised by the Respondent is the applicable rate for the handling solicitor.  I am referred to the Hong Kong SolicitorsâGuide to Professional Conduct, Vol. 1, paragraph 4.01, which reads: -</p>        		<blockquote>            <p class="quote">âOn taking instructions, a solicitor should normally give his client the best information he can about the likely cost of the matter.â</p>    	</blockquote>    	            <p> </p>                <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  I am therefore told that the solicitor should have told the Applicant that he should go to a more junior solicitor for the prosecutionof his claim as it is a simple one.  I am also referred to the case of <i><u>Chan To-pui v. The Secretary for the Environment, Transport &amp; Works</u></i> LDMR 10/2003 where His Honour Judge Chow said at paragraph 5: -</p>                <p> </p>    		<blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe next issue I have to consider is the hourly rate to be allowed for such professional costs.  Having pursued the bundle of documents,I am satisfied that a solicitor having eight yearsâ practice would be sufficiently competent to handle the Applicantâs claimsubmitted to the Director of Lands on 26 September 2001.  I, therefore, order that the rate for the professional fees claimed isto be allowed at $2,300 per hour.â</p>    		</blockquote>             <p class="quote"> </p>                <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The Respondent submits that I should also allow the hourly rate of a solicitor of 8 yearsâ standing only and, if I should applythe High Court scale, that would be between $2,900 to $3,500 per hour, and I should not allow the hourly rate of $4,000 as claimedby the handling solicitor who was admitted in the year 1989.</p>                <p class="quote"> </p>                <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The case of <i><u>Chan To-pui</u></i> was a simple resumption case and I am told that the matter to be dealt with was a simple case of proving title.  Furthermore, thelearned judge in that case had already held that the District Court Scale should apply there.  The present case is more complicatedand involved four different lots from four different landlords and also subletting to different tenants.  It was a sort of extinguishmentof a business of letting and subletting.</p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  As the nature of this case is more complicated, the compensation claim had gone through about 5 drafts before it was submitted tothe Respondent.  The amount of claim was also revised from $514,000 to $940,000.  It was eventually settled at $755,000.  The papersin the bundle show that the handling solicitor had made useful contributions to the preparation of this claim.  I am of the viewthat it was reasonable for the Applicant to have engaged this handling solicitor and I allow the hourly rate of $4,000.</p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  What remains are arguments of lengths of time spent on individual items.  There is one item that is worth express mentioning.  Thesolicitor has spent 4 hours and 40 minutes for taking instructions, conferring with the expert and then drafting a reply letter tosome requisitions raised by the Respondent.  I have considered the requisitions and the reply and I think all the work should reasonablyhave been done within 3 hours and 40 minutes.  Hence, I take 1 hour off the conference time for that task.</p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  For the rest, mutual concessions have reduced the items that are in dispute.  For the remaining few that have to be adjudicated,I have made my decisions on a table presented by the Applicant.  I do not think it necessary for me to go through each and everyone of them.  The total profit costs as agreed and allowed is $86,851 and the disbursement is $40,555.  The total sum is $127,406.</p>        <p> </p>            <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Finally, I also order that costs of this application including the costs previously reserved be to the Applicant.  I have decidedthat the scale for the costs and remuneration should be that of the High Court and not that of the District Court because, when thecosts and remuneration were incurred, they were incurred for the prosecution of a High Court claim.  However, when the costs wereincurred for prosecuting the remuneration claim, they were incurred for the prosecution of a District Court claim as the quantumof the remuneration claim is within the District Courtâs jurisdiction.  Hence, I order that the costs of this application be taxedin accordance with the District Court Scale. </p>		<p> </p>        <table border="0" width="100%">		<tr>			<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>		<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(H.
