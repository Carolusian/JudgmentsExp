After hearing the parties on 25 February 2009, Registrar Au-Yeung made the costs order <i>nisi</i> absolute and ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant costs of the hearing assessed at HK$4,000 (âthe 2<sup>nd</sup> Orderâ).</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The plaintiff now appeals against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Order : see the notice of appeal dated 3 March 2009.  At the outset of the hearing on 8 June 2009, I tried to clarify with the plaintiffif she also wanted to appeal against the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>Order.  She was unable to give me a direct answer.  She went on to make submissions, which confirmed the impression that I had whenI read her materials, namely, she was dissatisfied with the 1<sup>st</sup> Order.  That being the case, I will proceed on the basis that she wishes to appeal against the 1<sup>st</sup> Order as well.  But since the notice of appeal was not taken out within 14 days after it was made, leave to appeal out of time isrequired : see Order 58, rule 1(3) of the Rules of the High Court.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The present action stemmed from <i>HCA1499/2006</i>.  In that action, the plaintiff sued âThe Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Bailiff [Operation Section]âfor damages.  She alleged that the bailiff had seized all items of possession from her except some clothes and bedding mattress pursuantto a writ of <i>fieri facias</i> and had sold them wrongfully at a gross undervalue.  That action was struck out, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal : see <i>CACV62/2007</i>, 17 December 2007, unreported.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The defendant herein, Ms Michelle Soong, is a government counsel.  She represented the defendant in <i>HCA1499/2006</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In November 2008, the plaintiff commenced the present action against Ms Soong personally.  In her home-made statement of claim,she pleaded that in <i>HCA1499/2006</i>, the then Registrar Chan had given directions to the parties for filing of evidence for the striking out application.  After thehearing, she inquired with Ms Soong if she (the plaintiff) might submit all the documents to the court.  Ms Soong then said ânotto fileâ.  The plaintiff took it to mean that there was no need for her to file any evidence.  She therefore did not file any forthe striking out application.  Because of the lack of evidence in support of her claim, it was struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  As noted, Registrar Au-Yeung struck out her statement of claim and dismissed the present action. </p>    <p class="heading">Appeal against the 1<sup>st</sup> Order out of time</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  I first deal with the plaintiffâs appeal against the 1<sup>st</sup> Order out of time.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The plaintiffâs submissions are basically a repetition of her complaints against the bailiff for wrongfully seizing her propertiesand selling them at a gross undervalue.  She also complained that because of Ms Soongâs misleading statement, she had not placedbefore Registrar Chan the requisite evidence in support of her claim against the bailiff.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  She advanced the same submissions before Registrar Au-Yeung who roundly rejected them thus :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â<i>The Law</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">5.    In law, there is no duty of care owed by one litigant to another as to the manner in which the litigation is conducted, whetherin regard to service of process, or in regard to any other step in the proceedings.  Neither does a litigant have a duty to âcorrectâhis opponentâs mistakes.  The safeguards against impropriety are to be found in the rules and procedure that control the litigationand not in tort.  See <i>Business Computers International Ltd v. Registrar of Companies</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20Ch%20229" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] Ch 229</a>, followed in Hong Kong in <i>Wong Yu Cho Rolly trading as Marco Polo and China Oversea Technical Development v. Louie Wong &amp; another, DCCJ 2805, 2806 and 2930of 2007.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>Application of the Law</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">6.    As in HCA 1499 of 2006, the Plaintiff still directed her arguments to the manner in which the writ of fi fa was executed, thenumber of items seized, the value of the items seized and their sale at a gross value.  [See paragraph 27 of CACV 62 of 2007.]  Theseare quite irrelevant to the Defendantâs application to strike out, which turns on legal arguments only.  Even if the Plaintiffcan come up to proof on her version of facts, it is plain and obvious that there is no reasonable cause of action against Ms. Soong. The statement of claim ought to be struck and I limit myself to doing so only under the first limb of Order 18, rule 19.  The pleadingsare not capable of amendment.  The claim should be dismissed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I agree.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In my view, there is a further hurdle which the plaintiff cannot possibly surmount.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The gist of the plaintiffâs complaint is that Ms Soong had misled her into believing that she needed not file any evidence forthe striking out application in <i>HCA1499/2006</i>, which eventually led to her claim against the bailiff being struck out.  But any evidence that she wanted to file in support ofher claim would not advance her case a bit.  For legally her claim was incurably bad.  As pointed out by the Court of Appeal in <i>CACV62/2007</i>, her claim was absolutely barred by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(5)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Proceedings Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300">Cap.300</a> (paras.18-21 of the judgment).  Thus whatever evidence she might otherwise have filed in order to support her case but forwhat Ms Soong had allegedly said, her claim against the bailiff was unarguable and doomed to fail.  In other words, the result ofthe striking out application would be just the same even if she had filed the evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  It follows that the plaintiff will never be able to properly plead and establish the causal link between what Ms Soong had allegedlysaid and the resultant loss that she might have suffered.  Her claim against Ms Soong is therefore untenable and must fail.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  I have also considered the cause of action based on misfeasance in public office, although the plaintiff has not expressly pleadedit.  Assuming but without deciding that Ms Soong was acting in her office as government counsel when she allegedly told the plaintiffnot to file any evidence, the plaintiff, as I have said, would still be unable to properly plead and establish the casual link betweenwhat Ms Soong had said and the resultant loss.  So I do not think the plaintiff can possibly have a cause of action based on misfeasancein public office against Ms Soong either.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In my view, the Registrar was entirely correct in striking out the plaintiffâs claim and dismissing her action.  There is no meritwhatsoever in her appeal against the 1<sup>st</sup> Order.  I will refuse to give her leave to appeal out of time.</p>    <p class="heading">Appeal against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Order</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  I now turn to deal with the plaintiffâs appeal against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Order.  It is a costs order which will not be lightly disturbed on appeal unless it is unreasonable or the Registrar had erred inlaw : <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2009</i>, Vol. 1, para. 58/1/6.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The normal rule is costs should follow the event.  I can see nothing why this rule should not be followed when the Registrar struckout the plaintiffâs claim.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  As to quantum of costs for the substantive application, Mr Leung, senior government counsel, who acted for Ms Soong below has morethan 12 years of professional experience.  He claimed an hourly rate of HK$3,500, which was, as rightly recognized by the Registrar,rather generous.  The Registrar accepted his hourly rate.  She then took into the time spent for preparation and the two hearingsinvolved and came to the figure of HK$15,000.  I find her assessment reasonable and see no reason why I should disturb it. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  For the hearing on 25 February 2009 concerning the 2<sup>nd</sup> Order costs should also follow the event.  The Registrarâs assessment of HK$4,000 is again reasonable.  I will not disturb it.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The plaintiffâs appeal against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Order is therefore dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  At the end of the hearing, I invited the parties to make submissions on costs.  The plaintiff did not say much.  Mr Leung askedfor costs should I dismiss the appeal.  He asked me to make a gross sum assessment.  He claimed an hourly rate of HK$3,000 and hadspent a total of 2Â½ hours (including the actual time spent in court).  He asked for a sum of HK$7,500.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In my view, costs should follow the event.  I agree with Mr Leung that it is an appropriate case to make a gross sum assessment. As to quantum, I find the figure proposed by Mr Leung reasonable and accept it.  I will therefore order the plaintiff to pay thedefendant costs of this appeal assessed at HK$7,500 forthwith.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(J.
