The 1st Defendant's Counsel submitted that the Plaintiff had given no less than four versions of how theaccident happened. The Plaintiff also gave various versions as to how his fingers were injured.

Later he said he had "No idea" as to whetherhe asked Ah San to re-open the door before or after his hand was injured and in the cross-examination by the counsel for the 3rdDefendant, he said that it was "before" he got injured, he asked Ah San to re-open the door; and</p>        <p>(e) as he was facing the stack of trays, he could not see Ah San pushing the button.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Upon Cross-Examination by the 3rd Defendant's Counsel</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Further contradictions appeared when the Plaintiff was cross-examined by the counsel for the 3rd Defendant, he said that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) inside the lift, the stack of trays that he was facing was about 4.5 inches from his body;</p>        <p>(b) the hook was hanging on the top tray at his left hand side;</p>        <p>(c) between the lift door and the trays, he could stand sideways. The initial measurement of the shoulder to shoulder width was abit less than 18 inches. Later he said he was crushed when standing sideways so the measurement was reduced to 12.5 inches;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d) he "touched" the end of the hook by his left hand;</p>        <p>(e) when the lift door was closing, he looked at his right back;</p>        <p>(f) "may be", during this juncture, his left elbow unintentionally hit the hook making the handle of the hook lift up and protrude;and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(g) the handle of the hook was hit by the closing lift door. The hook fell down.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Even according to the Plaintiff's own evidence, when the lift door started to close, nothing had protruded to block the path of thelift door. Only when the lift door passed the position of the Plaintiff, that is, near the closing position of the lift accordingto the diagram at p. 102, that the handle side of the hook lifted when hit by the Plaintiff's elbow.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Accordingly, before closing the lift door, the path of the closing door was clear.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The 1st Defendant's Counsel submitted that the last version of the accident namely that the hook had been hit by the Plaintiff'selbow and thus lifted up to hit the lift door had never been mentioned either in the Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff's WitnessStatement or in his evidence-in-chief.</p>    <p class="heading">How the Injury Was Caused</p>    <p class="heading">Statement of Claim</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Before amendment it was stated that the lift door crushed his fingers together with the said hook.</p>    <p class="heading">In his Witness Statement</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> His fingers were hooked and injured by the iron hook when the lift door hit the hook.</p>    <p class="heading">Evidence-in-Chief</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> He stated, "At first I wanted to pick up the hook but the door closed so quickly it trapped my hand. Then he stated that he benthis body to the left sideways to pick up the hook. The hook had fallen down to the floor with the handle outside the lift door andthe hook end inside. The lift door closed trapping his hand in the door. He had not yet picked up the hook yet his hand was trappedin the door. When the door was closed it trapped the hook, the hook scraped him. Again later he said, when he went to pick it up,the hook was caught. The hook end hurt him. The hook was thrown. His hand that held the hook was hurt. As the hook was thrown outof the door, the pointed part of the hook scraped him when it was thrown out.</p>    <p class="heading">Under Cross-examination by the 3rd Defendant's Counsel</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The Plaintiff stated that after the hook fell on the floor, and when he picked or was about to pick it up, the lift door caught themiddle part of the hook and the hook was flung out. At this point, the hook end hit his fingers.</p>    <p class="heading">Finding of Facts - the Accident</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> The Plaintiff's version of facts was that he hung the hook on the topmost tray in front of him on his left. Having regard to thefact that he was facing the tray, that there was a distance of between 18 inches to 12.5 inches between the tray and the door, itis inherently improbable that the hook could have been hit by the closing lift door. The hook was heavy and the lift was not moving.Given the distance between the lift door and the hook, there could be no possibility for the lift door to hit the hook or the handleof the hook.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The Plaintiff gave this explanation under cross-examination by the 3rd Defendant's Counsel,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">Q.</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">You have to explain how the lift door could have hit the handle?</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">A.</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">As I was inside, I pressed towards the hook.

When he said that he could stand sideways, hehad to tighten his body to do so. He demonstrated this and the measurement taken of the space of his squashed shoulders was 12.5inches.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Again he stated,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">A.</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">The hook was hanging there 4 inches to my left and 4.5 inches in front. The lift door was very close to my body. The door had twolayers. I had to accommodate to let it close. As it was closing, because the tip of the hook was just hung onto the tray but nottouching securely, maybe I had to move my elbow to accommodate the door. Maybe I looked to see if the door closed. My elbow hit thehook and its handle protruded upwards and the lift door hit it.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> In the course of demonstration of how this could have happened, it became clear that it is not easy for his elbow to hit the hookin a way in which the hook could have lifted up to hit the lift door. As could be seen from the answers given by the Plaintiff above,his explanation of this was tentative. He stated that "maybe" this was how it happened. In actual fact for his elbow to hit the hookin such a way that it lifts it rather than push it sideways is an extremely difficult feat. For his elbow to hit the hanging hookin such a way as to lift it upwards the elbow has to hit the hook in the space between the hanging hook and the bread tray. It isnot possible for the Plaintiff's elbow to hit the hook in that way.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The Plaintiff tried to demonstrate how his elbow could have lifted the handle of the hook. He could only do so if the hand whichheld on to the hook at the top of the tray moved the hook upwards. Otherwise, his elbow could not have hit the hook so as to liftit up sufficiently for it to hit the lift door.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> I therefore find his version of the manner in which the lift door hit the hook to be highly improbable. None of the other versionscould explain how the lift door could have hit the hook.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> In relation to how the Plaintiff's fingers were injured there were also discrepancies in his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> In view of the aforesaid, I find that the Plaintiff's evidence in relation to how the accident happened is inherently improbable.I cannot accept his evidence of this.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> The manner in which the accident occurred is important to find out whether there is any negligence attributable to any party. Whenthe Plaintiff's evidence of how the accident happened could not be accepted, there is in fact no evidence related to how the accidenthappened to make a finding on the Plaintiff's claim of negligence in relation to the occurring of the accident.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiff's Case against the 1st Defendant</p>    <p class="heading">Was Yeung Wing San Negligent?</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> When the Plaintiff was cross-examined by the counsel for the 1st Defendant, he agreed that before closing the lift door, Ah San hadensured that the Plaintiff was ready for it. The Plaintiff admitted that in fact, he was well prepared for the closing of the liftdoor at that time.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> As mentioned above, even according to the Plaintiff's own evidence, before he looked at his right back, the hook did not protrudeinto the path of the lift door. Clearly, when Ah San closed the lift door, it was safe for him to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> In the premises, Ah San was not negligent when he pressed the lift button to close the door.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> In his witness statement, the Plaintiff stated that after the lift door hit the hook and upon his request, he saw Ah San immediatelypressing the open button of the lift .</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> However, in his evidence-in-chief, the Plaintiff stated that he could not see Ah San push the button to re-open the door. He justfelt or heard that.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Whether he saw it or not, it was the Plaintiff's clear evidence that once he informed Ah San to re-open the lift door, Ah San didso immediately. The allegation in paragraph 9 of the Amended Statement of Claim that Ah San failed to stop the lift is not the relevantissue. I agree with the 1st Defendant's counsel that the core issue is whether Ah San had taken reasonable steps to stop the closingof the lift door. According to the Plaintiff's own evidence, Ah San had done so. The allegation that the lift door could not be stoppedwas beyond Ah San's control.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> I therefore find that Ah San was not negligent. I also find that the allegation of vicarious liability on the part of the 1st Defendantarising from Ah San's negligence has no substance.</p>    <p class="heading">Did the 1st Defendant Prohibit the Plaintiff to Seek Medical Treatment?</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> In his witness statement, the Plaintiff stated that after the accident, as he and Ah San were the only persons responsible for deliveringbread outside, the 1st Defendant did not allow him to get off duty earlier to seek medical treatment.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> When he was cross-examined by the counsel for the 1st Defendant, the Plaintiff agreed that after the accident, he did not realizethat he got a fractured index finger. After his supervisor had fixed his bleeding by some Chinese medicine, he believed he couldcontinue working. He did continue to work for a further 6 hours before he went to seek treatment from the hospital. He agreed thatit was his decision to see a doctor after work.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> I agree with the 1st Defendant's counsel that the aforesaid allegation in the Plaintiff's witness statement is not substantiated.</p>    <p class="heading">Safe System of Work</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> The Plaintiff's work involved pulling the cake/bread trays into the lift to take them into the 1st Defendant's workshop. The useof the hook was necessary to help pull those cake/bread trays that were not put on trolleys. The system of work was not inherentlyunsafe. The hook could not be viewed as an unsafe implement. The Plaintiff was familiar with his work and his working environment.The task was simple. It was reasonable for the 1st Defendant to leave the execution of such a simple task to the employees. Thereis no evidence that the accident was caused by an unsafe system of work. In the ordinary course of events, an accident should nothave happened in relation to the use of the hook.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Mr. Lee Ki Wing the Production Manager of the 1st Defendant gave evidence that he often reminded the drivers and delivery workersto be careful when loading and unloading the goods in order to prevent the goods from toppling during delivery and to prevent accidentsfrom happening. He also stated that the 1st Defendant had internal guidelines to be followed by drivers and vehicle attendants. Suchguidelines are posted next to the clock-in machine of the Company and all staff should have notice of it. He also daily remindedthe staff that safety is the utmost importance and care should be used when using any ancillary tools.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> In relation to the problems with the lift, he stated that when any staff member discovered any malfunction of the lift, he wouldcontact the management office of the Building to repair it. He stated that on the date of the accident he did not see that the liftwas under repair.</p>    <p class="heading">Ownership of the Lift</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> It is not in dispute that the ownership and occupier of the lift vested with the 2nd Defendant. As the owner and occupier of thevested on the 2nd Defendant, the responsibility therefore should not vest on the 1st Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> Having considered the aforesaid, I find that the Plaintiff's claim against the 1st Defendant cannot be proved on a balance of probability.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiff's Case against the 2nd Defendant</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> The Plaintiff's case against the 2nd Defendant has real difficulties because the way in which the accident happened is not clear,as the Plaintiff's evidence of how the accident happened have not been accepted by me.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> The Plaintiff's evidence was that by the time the hook fell the door had already almost closed when the hook hit it. He drew on aplan marked Exh P-2 to show the position of the hook when it fell. It fell with the handle side of the hook outside the lift door.The position of the hook lying on the floor of the door was close to the edge of the door.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> The Plaintiff's evidence related to the "open" button of the lift was that, in evidence-in-chief, the Plaintiff stated that he couldnot see whether Ah San had pressed the "open" button of the lift after the hook fell. That was because he was facing the stack oftrays. In para 16 at page 90 of his witness statement he stated that he saw Ah San immediately press the open button of the lift.Under cross-examination by the 3rd Defendant's Counsel the Plaintiff stated that he told Ah San to hold the lift door for him beforehe bent down to pick up the hook. At the time he was bending down, it was not possible for him to see Ah San. He could hear the flickingof the open button for the flicking of the open button made a noise. He did not see what Ah San was doing. Under cross-examinationby the 3rd Defendant's Counsel when asked how he could be sure that Ah San flicked the open lift switch, he stated that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...this is the sort of old factory lift . . .a passenger/goods lift. It has more than an open door button. It has an open door switchto help delivery workers to deliver goods. . . That is a design that makes a sound when the switch is flicked."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> In relation to the condition of the lift door, the Plaintiff stated that in the two months when he had been working for the 1st Defendant,he noticed that the lift was out of order. He was not sure what caused the problem. Even if he pressed the "close" button of thedoor, the door could not close but only half close. He noticed that about two weeks before the accident. He stated that the liftcontinued to be used. There was no caretaker outside or somewhere near the lift door. The lift where the accident happened was theonly lift. He stated that when the lift could not be used, with the doors suspended open for a long time, only happened once. Hestated that what Ah San stated in his witness statement that even if the lift door trapped something or when people pressed on the"open" button, the lift door would still continue to close was right. As regards whether the lift button was out of order, he statedagain under cross-examination by the Counsel for the 3rd Defendant that even when Ah San flicked the open button the door did notre-open. He said that normally, even if the open button were not pressed, the lift door would not close because in between the doorthere was a safety edge device that had to be pulled to close the door.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> The Plaintiff had admitted that after the accident, he did not inform the 1st Defendant that the lift door was out of order. If indeedthe lift door was out of order, and as a result of that he had been injured, it is very unusual for someone injured or hurt by thisnot to report this to the building management or to his employer. It seems that the lift was not thereafter unused as there was nomention of that by the Plaintiff who had to do two further rounds of deliveries of cake/bread trays back to the 1st Defendant's premisesafter the accident. There was no mention that he did not take the lift on those two further rounds or that he took the stairs.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> According to the evidence of the 2nd Defendant's witness Mr. Koo Hung Hing, there has been no record of any complaint related tothe malfunction of the lift door on the date of the accident being 4th April 2001. The 3rd Defendant with whom the Plaintiff hada maintenance contract for the lift had a 24-hour service for repair and maintenance of lifts. Were there any malfunction of thelift, the caretaker would immediately telephone this service of the 3rd Defendant. There has been no service of the lift between23 March and 6 April 2001 when routine maintenance checks were made.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Mr. Huen Wah Sang an Area Manager of the 3rd Defendant gave evidence to say that there was no report of any accident caused by thelift in the Building on the 4 April 2001. There is a logbook recording incidents related to the lift of the Building. The logbookshowed that Engineers performed routine checks of the lift at the Building on 23 March 2001. Save that it was recorded that therewas a crack in the landing door panel and repairs were carried out, there was no other unusual finding. The logbook recorded that"lubrication was applied" to the lift. On the 6 April 2001 their Engineer attended the Building to perform a routine check of thelift. There was no unusual finding and the logbook merely recorded "lubrication was applied". It would therefore seem that therewas no record of the lift door having failed to operate normally. There was no repair done to it.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> From the aforesaid evidence, it is highly unlikely that the open switch of the lift was not operating normally on the 4 April 2001.As it is the only lift in the Building and is a goods/passenger lift, the operation of the open switch is extremely important todelivery workers. It is highly unlikely for there to be no complaint of this were the open switch not working during this time. Inmy view, it is highly unlikely that the accident was caused by the malfunction of the open switch of the lift.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> With reference to para 12 (d) of the Amended Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff's Counsel submits that the 2nd Defendant owed a dutyto ensure that the building they own is reasonably fit and safe for use. This meant that they owed a duty to ensure that the equipmentused thereat, is as good as reasonable care and skill can make it. He submitted that according to the 3rd Defendant's supplementalwitness statement, the reopening device of the lift when the open switch was pressed would be neutralized within 50 mm of the lastopen section of the closing door. It is not disputed that despite this, the reopening device of the lift met the Government safetystandards.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Mr. Huen, the 3rd Defendant's witness stated that the safety edge and corresponding open switch would not operate if he put his littlefinger in the door at the last 50 mm part of the door at the end of the closing door. He further stated that when he put his wholehand there, the switch would not be able to stop the lift door from closing.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> The Plaintiff's Counsel submitted that the 2nd Defendant had the duty to have the lift updated so that the lift doors are fittedwith an infrared safety device, as the reliance upon a "safety edge" was not sufficient. Mr. Huen stated in para 7 of his SupplementalWitness Statement that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The safety edge is not as sensitive as the infra red safety devices commonly used in newer passenger lifts these days".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> The common duty of care is defined in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupier's Liability Ordinance</a> as a duty to take such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safein using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there. In The Law of Tort in HongKong by DK Srivastava &amp; AD Tennekone, at page 313 in the 2nd paragraph under the heading "General principles" it is stated,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"At common law, as we have already mentioned, the degree of care varied depending on the class to which the visitor in question belonged... Accordingly, the degree or standard of care must vary with the changes in the circumstances. What may be reasonable in one situationmay not be so in another.. . Whether or not the occupier has breached his common duty of care is a question of fact. It is determinedby applying the same tests as may be applied in the case of a breach of the general duty of care. For example, the courts will inquireinto such matters as foreseeability of the occurrence of the injury, (see <em>Chordas v Bryant (Wellington)</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2091%20ALR%20149" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 91 ALR 149)</a>, the risk of greater injury if caused, the cost of avoiding such injury, the utility of the defendant's act, and the frequency ofaccidents causing such injury... By the same token, the occupier is not required to guard against improbable risks."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> The aforesaid principles will be applied to the facts. The principles would be applied to the scenario that the accident most probablywas caused because the hook was hit by the door at the last 50 mm of the end of the closing door when the open door safety devicewas neutralized. It seems that there is no other record of such an accident having taken place in the Building. The accident thathappened is in the nature of a freak accident or an unusual accident where a hook had inexplicably got in between the last 50 mmof the end of the closing door. The possibility of such an accident is most unusual. It seems to me that an accident of this typeis not easily foreseeable. Although there is no evidence of the costs of installing an infrared safety device to the lift door, noris there evidence as regards whether this is possible without the need to install a new lift, it is highly likely that this wouldbe costly. I have regard to the fact that the present device of a safety edge device is still within the Government approved safetystandard. Having considered the aforesaid I find that the 2nd Defendant has not breached the common duty of care by failing to havethe lift updated as particularized in paragraph 12 (d) of the Amended Statement of Claim. I am of the view that the 2nd Defendanthas taken reasonable care to see that the Plaintiff was safe whilst using the lift.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> I therefore find that the case against the 2nd Defendant has not been established.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiff's Case against the 3rd Defendant</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> I have found that the Plaintiff has not established that the open switch of the lift door was out of order. There is no evidenceof failure of the 3rd Defendant to properly maintain the open switch of the lift door. In relation to particular (f) of para 13 ofthe Amended Statement of Claim which states, "Failing to inform the 2nd Defendant that the lift needed updating", I accept the evidenceof Mr. Huen that within the terms of the maintenance contract the 3rd Defendant had no duty to advice the 2nd Defendant of the needto update the lift. Further as I have found that the 2nd Defendant has not breached the common duty of care by failing to have thelift updated, consequential to that the 3rd Defendant has not been negligent in failing to give the advice to the 2nd Defendant toupdate the lift.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> I therefore find that the Plaintiff's case against the 3rd Defendant has not been established.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> I dismiss the Plaintiff's claim against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants. I grant an order nisi for costs of the action to the 1st,2nd and 3rd Defendants to be taxed if not agreed with Certificate for Counsel. I grant an order nisi that the Plaintiff's own costsbe taxed in accordance with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">C.
