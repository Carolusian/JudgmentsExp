The facts asfound at the trial were that on the afternoon of 20th April 1971 the Plaintiff crossed Chung On Street, Tsuen Wan, near a cross-roads.He walked across a studded crossing with the junction on his left and intended, after he had crossed, to walk down the far side ofChung On Street to his right. When he reached the far side he stepped side-ways to his left on to a part of the pavement which wasoutside some railings installed with the apparent purpose of preventing pedestrians from straying on to the carriage-way. The Defendantdrove a 1 ?ton lorry round the corner at about 6 m.p.h. and crushed the Plaintiff between his vehicle and the railings. The basisof the Plaintiff's claim was that the Defendant failed to keep a proper lookout and that, even if he did not so fail, he wrongfullymanoeuvred his lorry so that part of it overhung the footway where the Plaintiff was standing and failed to take proper steps toavoid injuring the Plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> We are told that the learned judge had a view of the scene, but that does not appear from the record and we have no note of whathe saw. This is perhaps unfortunate because much of the argument has turned upon the position of the railings, as to which therewas little oral evidence. However, counsel have agreed that the railings were set back from the carriage-way, so that there was astrip of pavement of a width of not less than one foot, and probably more, outside the railings, and that the Plaintiff's crush injuriescould not have been caused unless the Defendant's lorry had over-hung the pavement. The railings extended from a point round thecorner up to the place where pedestrians would mount or leave the pavement when using the crossing. We have photographs which showthem to be tubular steel railings of a type generally used in Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The conclusion reached by the learned judge was that the Defendant owed no duty of care to anyone on the strip of pavement outsidethe railings and he made no finding as to the precise point at which the Plaintiff was standing or as to the reason why he came tobe there.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Although both the carriage-way and the foot-way are included in the highway and neither the driver nor the pedestrian has an exclusiveright to the use of the one or the other, there can be no doubt that where a pavement is provided it is intended primarily for theuse of pedestrians and that the carriage-way is intended primarily for the use of other traffic. Indeed, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4(8)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228" class="autolink_findacts">Summary Offences Ordinance</a> provides, inter alia, that "any person who without lawful authority or excuse rides or drives on any foot-path without obvious necessity"shall be guilty of an offence. In the ordinary way the driver of a vehicle of which the over all width is greater than its wheelbase (which probably must include most motor vehicles by reason of the Road Traffic (Construction and Use) Regulations) is boundto ensure that the entire vehicle is confined within the limits of the carriage-way. If by reason of the over-hang he strikes a pedestrianon the foot-path he is guilty of negligence: <u>Laurie</u> v. <u>Raglen Building Co., Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1942%201%20KB%20152" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1942 1 K.B. 152.</a> The same principle was applied in <u>Watson</u> v. <u>Thomas S. Whitney &amp; Co., Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1966%201%20WLR%2057" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1966 1 W.L.R. 57</a> where Sellers, L.J. said at p.60:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The pavement should give security to those who use it from vehicles using the road".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">It follows that if there had been no railings on this corner the Plaintiff would clearly have been entitled to stand where he didand, if he had been struck by the Defendant's vehicle, the Defendant would, in the other circumstances of this case, have been whollyto blame.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> What difference, if any, does the presence of the railings make. The purpose of railings of this type is to prevent pedestrians fromencroaching upon the carriage-way either deliberately or accidentally, just as the purpose of crash barriers is to prevent vehiclesfrom escaping from the carriage-way. The learned judge adverted to the fact that railings are sometimes erected away from the edgeof the carriage-way and asserted that the object in doing that was "to allow for vehicles to come very close to the pavement andnot to come in contact with the railings". With respect, it would not be necessary to set back the railings at all "to allow forvehicles to come very close to the pavement": that would only become necessary to allow vehicles to encroach upon the pavement. Thewords used by the learned judge might suggest that the purpose of setting back the railings was merely to ovoid costly damage tothem by vehicles which wrongfully manoeuvred themselves so that part of them projected over the pavement. If that was the intentionit would mean that the highway authority sought to alter the character of the character of the strip of pavement outside the railings,so that, as counsel for the Respondent was eventually forced to concede, it would be deemed to be part of the carriage-way. Counseldid at first suggest that this strip was a sort of no-man's-land on which no pedestrian ought to be, but even if it were correctthat this strip was denied to pedestrians it would not follow that it was dedicated to the motorist. Even if the purpose was to protectnot the railings but pedestrians standing close behind the railings, who might be injured as a result of such wrongful manoeuvringof vehicles, that would not be justification for seeking to deprive pedestrians of the use of part of the foot-way. As we have seen,these railings are erected to contain pedestrians within the limits of the foot-way and not to contain vehicles within the limitsof the carriage-way. Where railings are erected as close as is reasonably practicable to the edge of the pavement it is physicallyimpossible for a pedestrian to go outside the railings without encroaching upon the carriage-way. A motorist approaching railingsso placed is entitled to assume that no pedestrian will be likely to appear outside the railings - although, of course, he will notbe entitled to disregard an errant pedestrian who to his knowledge has gone outside: but where railings are ereeted so far back thatthere is ample room for a pedestrian to walk outside the railings without encroaching upon the carriage-way a motorist ought to expectthat some pedestrians will accept what can only be regarded as an open invitation to them by the highway authority to go outside.It seems to me not to matter whether the railings are set back something over one foot or something over one yard: pedestrians willinevitably ignore them. Indeed I go so far as to say that railings set back in this way are, though no doubt unintentionally, inthe nature of a trap set by the highway authority both for persons lawfully seeking to make use of part of the foot-way providedfor their security and for any motorist who is led to believe that pedestrians will remain behind the railings. It is unreasonableto expect that pedestrians will, in effect, surrender a usable strip of the foot-way unless compelled to do so either by law or byphysical obstruction. Particularly is that so in Hong Kong where foot-ways are often narrow and very overcrowded.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In the present case the trial judge appears to have taken the view that a pedestrian who placed himself between the railings andthe carriage-way was for the purposes of a claim for damages for negligence an outlaw. It therefore became irrelevant to his judgmentto decide what were the circumstances in which the Plaintiff found himself where he did. I take a different view, it being concededthat the Plaintiff would not have been injured unless the Defendant's vehicle had encroached upon the foot-way. I would held thatthat encroachment was at least a substantial cause of the Plaintiff's damage and that the Defendant was guilty of negligence: theDefendant owed a duty of care to avoid pedestrians lawfully upon the foot-way whether he saw them or not. If it were necessary Iwould further hold that his failure to see the Plaintiff on the edge of the foot-way - particularly as the Plaintiff had only justleft the carriage-way itself - was also evidence of negligence in that he failed to keep a pooper lookout.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Was the Plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence? I do he was. So long as he did not encroach upon the carriage-way he was, vis-a-visthe Defendant, entitled to use any part of the foot-way and, on the evidence, he would have come to no harm but for the negligenceof the Defendant. If it can be said in any sense that the Plaintiff did not take every reasonable care for his own safety, that lackof care was not a cause of the damage which he sustained. Of course, had he suffered damage of the kind suffered by the Plaintiffin <u>Watson</u> v. <u>Thomas S. Whitney &amp; Co., Ltd.</u> he might have been in some difficulty, because the evidence might not then have shown conclusively that the Defendant's vehicle encroachedupon the foot-way rather than that the Plaintiff encroached upon the carriage-way. A pedestrian who ventures outside railings isinevitably at risk of being found guilty of negligence and if he is injured the onus is on him to prove that his damage was causedby the negligence of the defendant and not by his own negligence: the res ipsa loquitur rule applies only where it is apparent thata vehicle must have encroached upon the foot-way. Such a pedestrian not merely deprives himself of the protection which the railingswould offer against his stumbling on to the carriage-way, but he may meet other like-minded pedestrians whose presence could in factforce him on to the carriage-way. There is another possibility, which I would leave open for consideration should the necessity everarise, although, as at present advised. I do not think it raises any special difficulty: if a pedestrian, wherever he is, sees orought to see that he is endangered by the wrongful act of a motorist he, like any possible victim of a tort, is under an obligationto take such steps to avoid or to mitigate the damage to himself as may be reasonable in all the circumstances and it may have tobe decided whether, if he has gone outside the railings and is thereby hindered in taking avoiding action, that could in any wayprejudice his right to be compensated for the full extent of his damage. In the present case it was not suggested that the Plaintiffought to have taken avoiding action.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> In my judgment, therefore, the Defendant was solely to blame for the Plaintiff's injuries. The Plaintiff's case was that, havingstarted to cross the carriage-way by the studded crossing at a time when it appeared safe to do so, he had found the foot-way socrowded that he could not mount it otherwise than at a point outside the railings: the alternative would have been to stand on thecarriage-way until the crowd dispersed. The argument on behalf of the Defendant went so far as to suggest that if those had beenthe circumstances he ought to have remained on the carriage-way and that then the Defendant might have been under a duty of careto see him and to avoid him. Even if the railings had been, say, four inches from the carriage-way so that toe Plaintiff had no absoluteright to go outside the railings I would have found it difficult to hold that the law required him to stand Horatio-like in the pathof the motorised hordes until there was space for him to step on to the foot-way at a point where there were no railings. A studdedcrossing is not for pedestrians what a box junction is for the motorist, a space which he must not enter until he can see that hisexit is clear. Nevertheless, if the Plaintiff had had no absolute right to use the strip of pavement outside the railings it wouldhave been material to enquire whether he could have avoided being in the position where he was struck by the Defendant's vehicleand it might have been necessary to remit the case for further findings to be recorded. As it is I would allow the appeal and enterjudgment for the Plaintiff in the sum assessed by the learned judge, namely $40,515, which includes $11,955 special damages.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">12th July 1974.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:center">IN THE SUPREME COURT OF HONG KONG</p>    <p style="text-align:center">(APPELLATE JURISDICTION)</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:center">CIVIL APPEAL NO. 11 OF 1974</p>    <p style="text-align:center">(On appeal from O.J. 2048/73)</p>    <p style="text-align:center">-----------------</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section party --><parties>        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" align="left" width="25%">BETWEEN</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%"></td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">LAM SHUI (or SUI)</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%">Appellant</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">TSIN (or CHING or CHING)</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%">(Plaintiff)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">and</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">JAMES TONG</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%">Respondent</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%"></td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%"></td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="25%">(Defendant)</td>            </tr>        </table>        <p style="text-align:center">-----------------</p>    </parties><!--sino section text -->    <!--sino section coram --><coram>        <p align="left">Coram: Huggins, McMullin &amp; Pickering, JJ.</p>    </coram><!--sino section text -->    <date>        <p align="left">Date of Judgment: 12 July 1974.</p>    </date>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:center">-----------------</p>    <p style="text-align:center">JUDGMENT</p>    <p style="text-align:center">-----------------</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">Pickering, J. :</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> I am of the same opinion as the learned President.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In considering the views of Diplock, L.J. expressed in <u>Watson</u> v. <u>Thomas Whitney &amp; Co., Ltd</u>.<sup>(1)</sup>, it has to be remembered that his was a minority judgment. Sellers, L.J. said, on the contrary,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I should have held that there was clear liability in this case where a vehicle overlapped the footpath".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> It may be true that there is no absolute prohibition upon a motorist's encroaching upon the pavement but, by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4(8)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228" class="autolink_findacts">Summary Offences Ordinance</a> there is such a prohibition except when the encroachment is made with obvious necessity and I am unable to agree that the existenceof a guardrail in any way diminishes either that prohibition or the view expressed by Sellers, L.J. in the case to which referencehas been made. The existence of such a guardrail is not, in my view, a licence to motorists to overhang the footpath. Nor, conversely,must a pedestrian overhang a carriageway without risk of being held contributorily negligent. Where a guardrail is set back so fewinches from the pavement that a pedestrian cannot occupy that portion of the pavement outside the rail without necessarily overhangingthe carriageway, other considerations may well apply but where, as in this case, the guardrail was so far set back that pedestrianscould walk on the pavement outside the rail without overhanging the roadway, it seems to me that the existence of the rail makesno difference to the principle enunciated by Sellers, L.J. in <u>Watson</u> v. <u>Thomas Whitney &amp; Co., Ltd</u>.<sup>(1)</sup>. And, with respect, it seems to me unrealistic in the conditions obtaining in Hong Kong, to say that both pedestrians and motorists"will tend to regard the unguarded portion of the pavement either as an area where pedestrians are not entitled to walk at all, or... as an area in which they are not normally to be found".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> I too would allow the appeal and enter judgment for the plaintiff in the sum assessed by the learned trial judge, namely $40,515.Costs to follow the event here and below.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">P.

The learnedChief Justice appears to have taken the view that in placing himself outside the metal guard-rail the plaintiff in this case hadplaced himself outside the protection of the law by placing himself where he had no right to be. With respect, I do not think thatcan be so. The public, and all members of the public, are entitled to use the highway, and all parts of the highway, to pass andre-pass thereon, subject to any special limitation imposed by statute or bye-law or by any rule of custom or common law upon themovements, or upon any kind of movement, of the public or of any section of the public. The highway includes the whole space betweenthe boundaries of dedication. In Hong Kong, there are no legislative provisions which simply forbid pedestrians to walk on the carriagewayor which forbid motorists to trespass upon the pavement in any way or under any circumstances. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">Subsection 8</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228" class="autolink_findacts">Summary Offences Ordinance</a> which forbids riding or driving upon a footpath "without obvious necessity" deals with a different area of prchibition: the consciouschoice and use of the footpath as though it were the carriageway. In the <u>Watson</u> case (referred to infra) the fact that there was a similar prohibition in Section 18(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1960 was not resortedto by counsel or by the Court of Appeal for any purpose let alone as sufficient proof of the entire responsibility of the driverof the motor vehicle.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The limits of the respective privileges and obligations of motorist and pedestrian in relation to the proper use of the highway arenevertheless fairly clearly established by the amalgam of custom, decided authority and common sense which represents the commonlaw upon the subject. There is no doubt that the pavement is, under normal conditions, primarily the preserve of the pedestrian;it is a special zone of security provided for him by the highway authority where he may expect to pass unmolested by vehicular traffic.The carriageway, under normal conditions, is intended primarily for the passage of vehicles and it is the zone specially designedto provide for their greater speed, size, and destructive propensity. It is these very general propositions which underlie the manydecisions of the courts in which damage done to a pedestrian by a vehicle which mounts the pavement where he is standing is regardedin the light of the principle, res ipsa loquitur. But neither the pedestrian nor the motorist enjoys an exclusive property in hiszone of predominant right. Thus, even where no guard-rail borders the pavement, a pedestrian may, with ...(illegible) so facto committingan offence, walk upon the carriageway; nor, is there any absolute prehibition upon a motorist encroaching upon the pavement. In practicesuch encroachment does occur frequently when cars are parked with a wing overhanging the pavement. In every case the act falls tobe judged by reference to the practical necessities of the situation at large which must, however, be read in the light of the generalprinciple that, for their mutual security (and other things being equal) the pedestrian should keep to the pavement and the motoristto the carriageway. The tort of negligence, as it applies to the use of the highway, and leaving aside specific statutory provisions,does not readily accommodate itself to the notion of absolute right or absolute prohibition in relation to special types of situationor special classes of person. The Highway Code itself is predicated upon a continuum of interlocking and mutual rights and obligationsembracing all road users and is therefore not accommodating to the notion of "outlawed" persons or "outlawed" situations. Thus, itis of interest to note that the first two rules in the Code (which are addressed specifically to the pedestrian) are in the followingterms:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">1.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="86%" class="quote">Where there is a pavement or footpath, use it.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="10%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">2.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="86%" class="quote">On a pavement or footpath, do not walk next to the kerb with your back to the traffic."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">The second of those admonitions certainly does not seem to support the suggestion that a pedestrian walking within the physical limitsof his own a special zone of safety is relieved from any further duty of care. To my mind, it recognises the possibility, amongstothers, that, even when conducting his own affairs within the physical limits of the pavement itself, he may yet be guilty of somedegree of negligence if he fails to watch out for his own safety by anticipating either that some part of his own person or belongingsmay intrude upon the carriageway or that some part of a passing vehicle may intrude upon his space above the pavement.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The Code itself may be regarded as of the general principles underlying this area of the law of negligence. The value of its suasionsis given recognition in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374" class="autolink_findacts">Road Traffic Ordinance</a> but <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Subsection 4</a>, pointing out that, its commandments do not themselves have the force of law, carries in it also something in the nature of a deprecationof absolutes in relation to the behaviour of road users. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Subsection 4</a> reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A failure on the part of any person to observe any provisions of the highway code shall not of itself render that person liable tocriminal proceedings of any kind but any such failure may in any proceedings whether civil or criminal and including proceedingsfor an offence under this Ordinance be relied upon by any party to the proceedings as tending to establish or to negative any liabilitywhich is in question in those proceedings."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Following the temperate language of that provision it may be said that for a pedestrian to walk with his back to the traffic may beevidence of negligence depending on the circumstances generally.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> If the territorial sovereignty of the pedestrian within the boundary of the pavement, and the immunity from fault conferred by itwere as nearly absolute as is suggested it is to me surprising that there is sub a more extensive corpus of opinion to attest it.Indeed, it is significant that, in the latter of the two cases cited in court upon the hearing of this appeal [<u>Watson</u> v. <u>Thomas Whitney &amp; Co. Ltd.</u><sup>(1)</sup>] the Registrar of the Court of Passage at first instance was satisfied that the plaintiff was wholly to blame for an injury to hisarm caused by the door handle of a van which, coming from his rear, drew alongside the pavement where he was walking, and did soupon the ground that it was dark at the time and that the driver would not expect the plaintiff to be in the position where he waswhen he was struck i.e. about six inches from the edge of the kerb. It is true that, on appeal, the majority of the three judgeswho heard the appeal took the opposite view and found that the lorry driver was wholly to blame. Harman L.J., however, was contentto agree with what had been said by Sellers L.J. without further elaboration thereon and the third member of the court, Diplock L.J.,having dealt at some length with a point of procedure affecting the appeal, went on to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"As to the merits of this appeal, I myself am not satisfied that the Registrar was not entitled to come to the conclusion that hedid upon the evidence before him."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In the light of this it is instructive to look at the facts in that case and the way in which the judgment representing the opinionof the majority deals with them. The plaintiff in that case was walking on the side of the pavement nearest to the road and aboutsix inches from the edge of the pavement when he was hit by the projecting door handle of a motor van driven by the second defendant.There was apparently no suggestion that the plaintiff had intruded upon the carriageway. The van had swung in from the middle ofthe road and come to rest along the kerb to let a passenger get out, and in doing so the handle of one door, encroaching above thepavement, struck the plaintiff and bruised his arm and damaged his coat. The defendant stated that he did not notice anybody uponthe foot-walk. It was dark at the time when the accident occurred. The Registrar found the plaintiff wholly to blame for the accidentby walking too close to the edge of the pavement when it was not necessary to do so and appears to have found that the plaintiffwas able to see the car approaching. Some doubt about this finding was, however, expressed in the Court of Appeal. Sellers L.J. havingreferred to the facts went on to say (page 60):</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%" class="quote">The Registrar took what to my mind is a surprising view and one which I find untenable, namely, that the blame here should be putwholly upon the plaintiff - that he was to blame because he was walking so close to the edge of the pavement. I think that that isan erroneous view. The pavement should give security to those who use it from vehicles using the road. I should have held that therewas clear liability in this case where a vehicle overlapped the footpath.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="10%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%" class="quote">          It is said that there was some negligence on the part of the plaintiff in walking so close in. I think that there was noevidence of contributory negligence. The plaintiff had no reason to think that this vehicle, coming round in the way it did, wasgoing to come so close that it would overlap the pavement and do this damage to him, even if he had occasion, which I doubt, to observewhat the vehicle was doing at all: it came suddenly from the middle of the road to the pavement."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">There is, to my mind, no attempt in this to state a general rule as to pedestrian's "sovereign immunity" upon a pavement and the possibilityis clearly left open that a pedestrian going close to the kerb might be guilty of contributory negligence if he had reason to anticipatethat the vehicle might behave in the way that it did.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> In none of the cases to which we were referred was the question of negligence related to the existence of a guard-rail upon the pavement.What is the significance of that feature in the present case? To my mind it introduces an additional clement which is of considerableimportance. It is in itself a physical feature of so striking a nature that one is tempted to say that it does alter the characterof that part of the pavement which lies beyond it and next to the border of the carriageway, constituting a neutral zone into whichneither pedestrian nor motorist is entitled to intrude as a matter of law and forming a buffer area which, when such intrusions dooccur, will protect them from the effects thereof in most cases as a matter of fact. But I do not think that I am warranted in goingso far. In the absence of an express prohibition published to pedestrians the outer strip of pavement must I think remain part ofthe primarily pedestrian sanctuary. But the character of the pavement as a pedestrian passageway is obviously altered in some clearlydiscernible respect by the presence of the guard-rail. At the very least it establishes a safe and a loss safe zone. Walking outsidethe railing with his back to the traffic even the most insouciant pedestrian must be acutely aware that he has forsaken a regionwhere injury from careless motorists, or from carelessly loaded vans or lorries, is a remote possibility for one where that possibilityis very real; the more so because it will be one natural consequence of the existence of the railing that motorists will tend todrive close to the kerb and keep less close a watch upon it. It does not want such imagination to realise that anyone, be he pedestrianor motorist, will tend to regard the unguarded portion of the pavement either as an area where pedestrians are not entitled to walkat all, or least as an area in which they not normally to be found.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> It may well be that the highway authority (the Diroctor of Public Works in this instance) who is empowered to construct and maintainworks in any road for the purpose of regulating traffic (see Section 7A of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/220">Cap. 220</a>) has chosen a means which is ambiguous and thereforeinadequate or even dangerous but it is an ambiguity which can be expected to effect the conduct of the motorist at least as stronglyas that of the pedestrian. Since both the motorist and the pedestrian will be judged in the light of all circumstances affectingtheir performance on any given occasion the court will necessarily find itself estimating what ought to be the attitude of the reasonablemotorist or of the reasonable pedestrian to each separate element which fell (or which ought reasonably to have fallen) within hisfield of perception on that occasion. Including, of course, such phenomena as this guard-rail. For, while it may be true that theprimary purpose of such a rail is to keep pedestrians from inadvertent excursions into the carriageway, a correlative effect mustbe to lessen the motorists' expection that such invasions will occur. To that extent it might be said that a subsidiary purpose ofthe railing is to relieve the motorist to some degree of the stricter need for vigilence which must exist where there is no railingguarding the edge of the pavement. The severed pertion of the pavement which may in fact prove to be something of a trap to the pedestrianwill equally be something of an enticement to the motorist. If it is possible - as Diplock L.J. clearly thought it was in <u>Watson</u> v. <u>Thomas Whitney &amp; Co. Ltd.</u><sup>(1)</sup> - that a pedestrian may be guilty of negligence by walking close to the edge of an unguarded pavement although still within its boundary,it must surely be that a pedestrian who deliberately chooses to quit an almost foolproof sanctuary provided for him in order to walkalong the narrow outer strip thus presenting his unprotected back to the overtaking traffic in a busy street is consciously assuminga risk of a considerably higher degree. The question whether he is negligent or contributorily negligent would still, of course,depend on all the prevailing circumstances - the state of the road and of the light; the quantity and type of traffic about; thedegree to which the unprotected area is customarily resorted to by the public and the state of the motorist's and of the pedestrian'sknowledge of these several factors. In particular, I would think that the possibility of at least contributory negligence is patentwhen, as in the present case, a pedestrian stands outside guard-rails near a corner when the motorist's opportunity of observinghim is lessoned by the existence of the corner.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> In the upshot I cannot bring myself to agree that a pedestrian can never be guilty of any degree of negligence who is injured whilewalking or standing within the limits of the pavement merely because the injury followed intrusion by a vehicle across the boundaryof the pavement and he had not observed its approach.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> In the present case it was the plaintiff' story that in crossing the pedestrian crossing he found himself impeded by a crowd of peopleahead of him and was impelled to stand aside upon the unprotected part of the pavement to wait for an opportunity to proceed on tothe pavement itself. He was in that position when the defendant's vehicle came round the corner and intruded into the space thenoccupied by him. If his position at that point was indeed the result of a necessity forced upon him by the prevailing circumstancesI would agree that he could not be liable to any extent for the injuries thus occasioned. Unfortunately however there is no findingas to this feature of the case and if the other members of the court had been of the same opinion as myself concerning the questionof negligence at large I would have said that the proper course in the present case would have been to remit the case for a furtherfinding as to whether or not the plaintiff's account of the matter was correct.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">(1) (1961)1 W.L.R. 57.</p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/1974/145.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
