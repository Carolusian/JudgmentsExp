plaintiff is an officer of the Correctional Services Department (âCSDâ).  The evidence showed that staff at the CSD are requiredto perform an additional shift of duty and will be compensated with one-day âDay-off-in-lieuâ (âDOILâ) for that shift duty. In monetary terms it means that the staff will be entitled to a dayâs leave with pay.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The plaintiffâs claim on DOIL was for the sum of $82,932.00.  The plaintiff used his DOIL for the purpose of medical appointments. The arrangement he made with CSD was that on the day he would attend a medical appointment, he was given half a shift and he himselftook the other half day off from his DOIL for medical examination.  The Judge recognized that CSD would give the staff proper timeoff to attend medical examination and the staff do not need to take time off themselves for such a purpose.  He, however, held that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â On the other hand, I cannot overlook the fact that the Plaintiff did take many half days off because of his medical appointmentsand this was probably because it was not always sensible to trouble his superiors constantly with arranging different shifts becauseof the large number of medical appointments the Plaintiff found himself having to attend.  This is an area where I believe I shouldnot be too harsh on the Plaintiff.  In all the circumstances, I would allow half of the amount claimed.

The defendant relied on Lord Reidâs speech in <i>Parry v. Cleaver</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] AC 1</a> at 13D that it is a universal rule that the plaintiff cannot recover more than he has lost.  It was argued that the distinction betweenpecuniary loss and non-pecuniary loss was overlooked.  The difference is set out in <i>Heil v. Another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20WLR%201173" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 WLR 1173</a> where Lord Woolf MR held that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn the case of pecuniary loss, and issues such as that which engaged the House of Lords in Wells v. Wells, the Court is only requiredto make the correct calculation.  Economic consequences are then irrelevant.  When the question is the level of damages for non-pecuniaryloss the Court is engaged in a different exercise.  As we have said, it is concerned with determining what is the fair, reasonableand just equivalent in monetary terms of an injury and the resultant PSLA.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> It was further argued that the award made by the Judge was in fact a compensation for the loss of amenities aspect of PSLA sufferedby the plaintiff as a result of the injury and as the Judge had already given a generous award of $140,000.00 (based on $350,000.00discounted by 60% due to pre-existing disability), it was wrong to make a further award under this head.  The defendant relied on<i>McGregor on Damages</i> 17<sup>th</sup> Ed, Para 35-215 which gives a summary on the well known PSLA :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThis head of damage concentrates on the curtailment of the claimantâs enjoyÂ­ment of life not by the positive unpleasantnessof pain and suffering but, in a more negative way, by his inability to pursue the activities he pursued beforehand.  Birkett L.J.put it thus in <i>Manley v Rugby Portland Cement</i> <i>C</i><i>o</i> :</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThere is a head of damage which is sometimes called loss of amenities; the man made blind by the accident will no longer be ableto see the familiar things he has seen all his life; the man who has had both legs removed and will never again go upon his walkingexcursionsâthings of that kindâloss of amenities.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">Loss or impairment of any one or more of the five senses is compensated under this head and also loss resulting from interferencewith the claimantâs sexual life or with particularly a female claimantâs prospects of marriage, from the break-up of the claimantâsmarriage or from inability to play with his children; even loss of enjoyment of the holiday upon which the claimant was embarkingor had embarked at the time of the injury has been taken into account in the non-pecuniary award.  Nor is this element of loss confinedto interference with leisure activities, so that damages may be awarded for deprivation of the ability to pursue an enjoyable occupation,or for having to contend with housekeeping in an injured state without domestic help.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> In <i>Ichard v.

He was able to continue with the holiday but suffered pain from the injuries he sustainedand the discomfort of having to wear a leather harness.  It was held by Peter Pain J that there should not be a separate head ofaward but the loss should be considered under general damage (i.e. PSLA) and as a factor which will lead to a more generous award.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>My view</u></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> I do not consider that the Judge has overlooked the distinction between pecuniary or non-pecuniary awards.  Nor do I regard the awardunder challenge should be considered as a âloss of amenitiesâ award.  Despite the expansion of the scope of PSLA since 1950 (seeMcGregor) the award is still in the nature of an award for the discomfort and inconvenience suffered by a tort victim.  Such discomfortand inconvenience are intangible in the sense that they are not easily quantifiable in monetary terms and as such the Court strivesto determine what is the fair, reasonable and just equivalent in monetary terms. </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> However, the claim by the plaintiff under this head is totally different from the discomfort and inconvenience situation.  DOIL wasa benefit to him.  He was entitled to take a day off with pay.  But because he had to use the DOIL to attend the medical examinationhe could not in fact obtain the real benefit of the DOIL.  He suffered a loss and he quantified the loss by reference to the amountof wage for that day.  I just do not see why he was not entitled to recover this from the defendant who caused him the loss.  Theloss of benefit is a well recognised head of damage.

After the injury the worker wasprovided with lodging by her father.  The English Court of Appeal held that the worker was entitled to a claim for the loss of herbenefit.

However, at the hearing, this was not pursued.  Insteadit was argued that the Judge should have, as he had done in relation to Item 3, apportioned Item 5 because under Item 3 the plaintiffonly used half days for medical examination.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The difference between the two claims is that the plaintiff was between 13 February 2002 and 19 February 2002 hospitalised.  He wasgranted sick leave by the government doctors between 13 February 2002 and 25 March 2002.  The relevant period of claim was between22 February 2002 to 25 March 2002.  This being the case there was no question that he was still able to work for half a day as inhis DOIL claim.  Plainly he was not able to do so.  Hence there should be no apportionment for Item 5.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Discount on other items</u></p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The defendant in the written submission had submitted that a 60% discount should be made on the other items but at the hearing, however,it only maintained that the 60% discount should be applied to the following items</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)    Past loss of earnings : $135,711.00 (Item 2)</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)    Loss of overtime work : $5,000.00 (Item 6A)</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3)    Future cost of maintenance : $10,000.00 (Item 13)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> In respect of Item 2, although initially the defendant in its âAmended Answer to Revised Statement of Damagesâ denied that theplaintiff was entitled to this claim because of his pre-existing condition, in the Scott Schedule the defendant agreed to this sumand in the written closing submission of the defendantâs counsel (not Mr. Wong and Mr. Ko who only appeared in this appeal) thepast loss of earning was agreed at $135,711.00.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> As this was an agreed sum, the defendant was not entitled to challenge it in the appeal.

He referred to the evidence in <i>Chan Kam Hoi</i> which showed that the precondition would have affected the plaintiffâs working life from his mid-50âs and the medical evidencein <i>Cheung Fat Tim v. Wong Siu Ming and Another</i> (H. C. Action No. A5079 of 1991) which showed that the plaintiff could have been able, without the accident, used his diseased elbowrelatively normally for another three to five years before the pain would become noticeable and drive him to seek treatment.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> It is true that there was no such evidence in the present case.  However, I do not regard such evidence to be the pre-requisite foran apportionment.  Ultimately the issue has to be decided by the overall evidence that is available in a case.  In this case thetwo orthopaedic specialists had stated that the degenerative back of the plaintiff was already symptomatic prior to the accidentand that in the course of time is likely to deteriorate on its own right to cause symptoms even if the accident did not take place. By apportioning 70% of the plaintiffâs impairment to the pre-existing condition and 30% to the accident, the doctors clearly recognizedthe seriousness of the pre-accident condition.  Dr. Singer likewise observed that âat least without the pre-existing back painthe likelihood of triggering of the Adjustment Disorder would have been much reduced say by 70%â and that âhis pre-existing psychiatriccondition also partly caused his Adjustment Disorderâ.  In my view the Judge was clearly entitled to make an apportionment in thiscase in the light of such evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Judges are not actuaries but their tasks frequently require them to make assessments of probabilities in quantitative terms basedon available evidence.  This is not done by way of a clinical, mathematical approach nor by intuition but in a way which more orless reflects the condition of the plaintiff based on the available evidence.  In this case while a different judge may have givena different figure, I am not convinced that the Judgeâs assessment that the plaintiffâs preconditions accounted for 60% of hisimpairment is so perverse that an appellate court should intervene.  This is in the realm of a finding of fact.  In any event itis to be noted that the discount was only applied by the Judge to the PSLA and not to loss of wage or other items.  Hence the questionof when in the future the preconditions would begin to affect the plaintiffâs work and his earning would not arise.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Prospect of promotion</u></p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> The plaintiff claimed that as a result of the accident, he lost his chance of promotion to one higher rank, namely, Principal Officer.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Principles in assessing chance</u></p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> In <i>Davies v Taylor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] A.C. 207</a> at 213, Lord Reid stated that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â ...

It is trite law that these questions are not decided on a balance of probability,but rather on the courtâs assessment, often expressed in percentage terms, of the risk eventuating or the prospect of promotion,which it should be noted depends in part at least on the hypothetical acts of a third party, namely the plaintiffâs employer.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> This was expanded later in the judgment under the third category of situations which may arise where the plaintiffâs loss dependsupon the action of an independent third party.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The three situations are best summarised by Otton LJ in <i>Doyle v Wallace</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20PIQR%20Q146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] PIQR Q146</a> at Q149 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â (1) In his first category fell cases in which the defendantâs negligence consisted of some positive act or misfeasance and thequestion of causation was one of historical fact, in which event proof on the balance of probability prevailed.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(2) In the second category fell cases in which the defendantâs negligence consisted of an omission where caution depended not upona question of historical fact but upon the answer to the hypothetical question âwhat would the plaintiff have done if there hadbeen no negligence?â; here the answer is provided by the application of proof on the balance of probabilities.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(3) In the third category fell cases in which the plaintiffâs loss depended upon the hypothetical action of a third party, whetherin addition to action by the plaintiff or independently of it; here the plaintiff need only show that he had a substantial chanceof the third party acting in such a way as to benefit him.

This is what he said</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â 79.   The Plaintiff himself admitted that he was only the middle of his class.  The many Appraisal Reports all indicate that hewas considered no high flyer and with due respect, someone with at best a chance to go only one grade up.</p>        <p class="quote">80.  The repeated reluctance of the Plaintiff to take the Promotion Examination is an indication of both the difficulty of passingthe Promotion Examination as well as the Plaintiffâs own assessment of his chances of passing the Promotion Examination.  I donot overlook the evidence of the Plaintiff as to why he was not quite ready to apply for Promotion or to take the Promotion Examinationbefore 1998.  I do not believe he was being forthcoming.  He knew very well the difficulty of passing the Promotion Examination andthat is the important reason for his holding back and also the real reason that he had never tried again after the disaster of 2000. He could try in any of the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006.  But he chose not to.  I do not see how any one who abortedthe 2000 Promotion Examination and never attempted any Promotion Examination thereafter could possibly say that he has a realisticchance of passing this difficult examination.  None of the doctors had ever said that his Accident injury would have any adverseimpact of his ability to pass the Promotion Examination.</p>        <p class="quote">81.  Counsel for the Plaintiff tried not to face up to the harshness and difficulty of passing the Promotion Examination.  The evidencehowever gives the true picture.  The pass rate at the Promotion Examinations is notoriously low.  In the 1999 Promotion Examination,2 out of 34 passed, a pass rate of 6%.  In the 2000 Promotion Examination, 4 out of 22 passed, a pass rate of 18%.  In the 2001 PromotionExamination, 5 out of 30 passed, a pass rate of 16%.  In the 2002 Promotion Examination, 6 out of 25 passed, a pass rate of 24%. In the 2003 Promotion Examination, 4 out of 50 passed, a pass rate of 8%.  In the 2004 Promotion Examination, 1 out of 23 passed,a pass rate of 4.5%.  In the 2005 Promotion Examination, 1 out of 13 passed, a pass rate of 7.7%.  [1341-70].  It can thus be seenthat with such a low pass rate, even the very best candidates, persons who are naturally highly able or high flyers might not beable to pass such Promotion Examination at least not until several attempts as indicated by Mr Mak in his evidence.</p>        <p class="quote">82.  But the hurdle of Promotion in the CSD is not limited to only passing the Promotion Examination.  There is further the selectionprocess which is equally demanding.  Passing the Promotion Examination is only the first step to being considered for Promotion. The data given by CSD under its letter dated 30 July 2004 [see 1651-56] suggest that appointments from eligible officers was notoriouslysmall in number.  The number of appointees had gone down from 26 in 1998, to 11 in 2001, to 7 in 2002.  There were apparently noappointments in 1999, in 2000 and in 2003.  In terms of filling vacancies in the rank of Principal Officer, the downward trend iseven more telling because in 1998 all 26 vacancies were filled, but in 2001, out of 24 vacancies only 11 were filled and in 2002out of 19 vacancies only 7 were filled.</p>        <p class="quote">83. Having regard to all the evidence, including the submission of Mr Sahkrani as to the statistical figures (favourable to his client)he relied upon, I have no doubt that there was and is no realistic possibility of the Plaintiff being appointed to a higher rank,even without the Accident.  The Accident did not cause the Plaintiff to lose any prospect of Promotion.  With all due respect tothe Plaintiff, I simply do not believe that he was ever the sort of material for higher promotion.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> In rejecting the plaintiffâs claim on promotion the Judge considered the following matters :</p>    <p style="text-align:left">(1)   The plaintiff had not taken the promotion examination before the accident.

The Judge further considered the low promotion rate of becoming a Principal Officer. </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> In my view the Judge had properly considered the reasons when he rejected the plaintiffâs claim for loss of chance of promotionand I disagree with Mr. Sakhraniâs submission that the Judge had not given reasons for his decision.  This is again a finding offact both in terms of primary facts and inference to be drawn from such facts.  I do not consider the Judge had erred in any way.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Costs of the trial</u></p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The defendant argued that the Judge was wrong to award 70% of the costs to the plaintiff because the defendant was the successfulparty.  It was argued that costs had to be decided by reference to the issues raised by the parties.  The plaintiff lost three majorissues, namely, his pre-accident physical and mental state and his promotion prospect.  The plaintiffâs claim of $5.8 million wasreduced to $648,444.93 after trial.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> The plaintiff argued that he was entitled to the whole costs of the trial.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>My view</u></p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> I disagree with the defendant.  In my view the plaintiff was the successful party.  He recovered damages in the assessment.  In respectof the 17 heads of damages claimed he recovered judgment on 14 of them.  The three he had lost were loss of future earnings, lossof earning capacity and promotion related awards (grouped under one head of damage).</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> In my view in personal injury litigation where a plaintiff has recovered an award of damages it would be most unusual to deprivehim of the costs on the ground that he has lost on the major issues that were raised at the hearing.  Ultimately payment into courtby a defendant in a personal injury case is the means by which the defendant would protect his position on costs.  If there was nopayment in or if the payment does not exceed the final award, it would be wrong to deprive the plaintiff of his costs even if thefinal award was a substantial reduction from the original claim.  Further to give the defendant costs of the whole action would besomething it could not achieve even if it succeeds in its payment in because it would then only be entitled to the costs of actionafter payment in and not before.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> In any event an award of costs is a matter of discretion.
