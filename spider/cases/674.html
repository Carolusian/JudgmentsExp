</p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a> This is an appeal by the plaintiff from the orders of Master Raymond Ho made on 28 February 2003.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> On the plaintiff's application for summary judgment the master ordered that judgment be entered for the plaintiff for the sums of:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) HK$1,898,777.75;</p>        <p>(b) HK$1,440; and</p>        <p>(c) HK$21,300.00.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He also ordered that interest be paid on the said sums as set out in the order until full payment. However, the master also orderedthat the said judgment be stayed until trial of the counterclaim in this action. The plaintiff appeals against the order for a stay.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> On the plaintiff's application by summons dated 30 December 2002 for an order that the amended defence and counterclaim be struckout, the master dismissed the plaintiff's summons. The plaintiff also appeals against this order.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> On the defendant's application by summons dated 7 January 2003 for leave to re-amend the amended defence and counterclaim in theterms of the draft annexed to the summons, the master made an order that the defendant do have leave to re-amend the amended defenceand counterclaim in the terms of the draft annexed to the summons. The plaintiff also appeals against this order.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> There has been no appeal by the defendant against the order giving judgment to the plaintiff. The defendant, therefore, accepts thatjudgment was correctly entered for the plaintiff by the master. The question to consider on the appeal is whether or not it was rightfor the master to order a stay of the judgment until trial of the counterclaim. It is also necessary to consider whether or not themaster's other orders were correct.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Pursuant to the master's order, the defendant filed and served the re-amended defence and counterclaim dated 3 March 2003 ("the RADC").The defendant's pleaded case is as set out in the RADC which is the defendant's latest pleading. I have to consider whether the RADCor any part thereof should be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The background facts are that the defendant is and was at all material times part of the Golden Harvest Group of Companies underthe control of Golden Harvest Entertainment (Holdings) Limited, a company incorporated in Bermuda. It is a listed company in HongKong. Golden Harvest Entertainment Co. Ltd. ("Golden Harvest") and Panasia Films Limited ("Panasia") all formed part of the GoldenHarvest Group. Golden Harvest's business includes the distribution and production of motion pictures in Hong Kong, and other partsof Asia. Its distribution business is carried out through a number of wholly-owned subsidiaries, one of which is Panasia. The defendantis a subsidiary of the Golden Harvest Group and owns and operates a movie cinema in Hong Kong and programmes motion pictures forscreening in its cinema.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> At all material times, Ms Winnie Tsang Lai Fun ("Ms Tsang") was employed by Golden Harvest under an employment agreement dated 30June 1995. As stated in the employment agreement, the title of her post was general manager of Panasia. She was employed from 1 July1995 until 30 September 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> It is pleaded in the RADC that Ms Tsang owed duties to Golden Harvest, Panasia and other companies of the Golden Harvest Group includingthe defendant. This included a fiduciary duty not to compete and not to make a secret profit from her position.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> It is also pleaded that following the conclusion of the employment agreement she entered into a consultancy agreement with GoldenHarvest dated 28 September 1998 ("consultancy agreement"), whereby she, through the plaintiff, acted as a consultant to Golden Harvestfrom 1 October 1998 to 30 September 1999 in connection with the distribution and marketing of its films.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The complaint of the defendant is that Ms Tsang, through the plaintiff, obtained a distribution agreement with Kadokawa Shoten PublishingCo., Ltd. ("Kadokawa"), a Japanese company carrying on the production, publication and distribution of motion picture worldwide.Kadokawa was, at all material times, the owner of three movies "Ring", "Rasen" (later called "Spiral") and "Sleepless Town" ("themovies"). Prior to the termination of her employment with Golden Harvest, Kadokawa was looking to find a distributor for the moviesin Hong Kong. By a letter dated 24 June 1998 Kadokawa offered Golden Harvest and/or Panasia a licence for the movies. Kadokawa alsoproposed that Golden Harvest and/or Panasia become its agent in the Asian region for all countries except Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea("the agency offer").</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> At para. 17 of the RADC it is pleaded that Ms Tsang represented Golden Harvest and/or Panasia in negotiations with Kadokawa. Priorto the termination of her employment on 30 September 1998, the material terms of a distributorship agreement with respect to themovies were agreed in principle between Kadokawa and Golden Harvest and/or Panasia. On or about 24 September 1998, Kadokawa senta draft distribution agreement to Golden Harvest for signing on behalf of Golden Harvest and/or Panasia. It is alleged that Ms Tsangneglected to execute the distribution agreement, to accept the agency offer or to respond to Kadokawa on behalf of Golden Harvestand/or Panasia.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> On 2 November 1998, under fax cover sheet of Panasia Ms Tsang faxed Kadokawa claiming that Golden Harvest and/or Panasia were notinterested in acquiring the distribution rights in the movies, but that a company that she controlled namely, the plaintiff was willingto acquire the distribution rights on the same terms as those offered by Kadokawa to Golden Harvest and/or Panasia. Kadokawa respondedto Ms Tsang stating that it would like to conclude the distribution agreement with the plaintiff but that it wanted to receive astatement by fax to the effect that Golden Harvest decided not to distribute the movies and would have no objection if Kadokawa soldthe movies to any other company in Hong Kong. It is also alleged that on the previous day, 1st November 1998, Ms Tsang faxed theagent for one of the actors appearing in "Sleepless Town" stating that the plaintiff was the distributor of the film in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> By a letter dated 5 November 1998 signed by Mr. Peter Tam, director of Golden Harvest, Golden Harvest confirmed to Kadokawa thatit had decided not to distribute the movies and that it had no objection if Kadokawa sold the movies to any other company in HongKong. On 12 November 1998 a distribution agreement was signed between Kadokawa and the plaintiff. It is also alleged that by December1998 the plaintiff had agreed to become Kadokawa's agent in Asia on similar terms to those offered by Kadokawa to Golden Harvestand/or Panasia in the agency offer ("the agency agreement").</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The defendant also alleges that at the time of the plaintiff entering into the distribution agreement with Kadokawa, Kadokawa waseither finishing or producing the sequel to "Ring" called "Ring 2". As pleaded, it was a custom in the motion picture distributionindustry that a distributor having the exclusive rights to the movie should be given the right of first refusal to a sequel uponthe same terms save as to the provision of the payment of the minimum guarantee. It is alleged that Ms Tsang wrongfully representedto Kadokawa that Golden Harvest, Panasia and the Golden Harvest Group had made a policy decision in September 1998, that Golden Harvestand Panasia should not acquire distribution rights in movies generally or in the movies in particular. It is further alleged thatMs Tsang was aware that neither Golden Harvest, Panasia nor Golden Harvest Group had made such a policy decision.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The defendant's case is that in breach of her employment agreement and the consultancy agreement Ms Tsang :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) deliberately neglected on behalf of Golden Harvest and/or Panasia to properly sign, progress or bring into binding effect thedistribution agreement sent by Kadokawa to Golden Harvest;</p>        <p>(b) deliberately neglected on behalf of Golden Harvest and/or Panasia to properly sign, progress or bring into binding effect theagency offer;</p>        <p>(c) informed Kadokawa that Golden Harvest and/or Panasia were no longer interested in acquiring the distribution rights in the moviesor any movies generally;</p>        <p>(d) introduced Kadokawa to the plaintiff as a distributor of the movies, in place of Golden Harvest and/or Panasia;</p>        <p>(e) introduced Kadokawa to the plaintiff as its agent in the Asian region in place of Golden Harvest and/or Panasia and diverted GoldenHarvest and/or Panasia's business opportunities to the plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The defendant further alleges that the plaintiff wrongfully and unlawfully induced and procured Ms Tsang to commit the breaches ofher duties under the employment agreement and the consultancy agreement. It is pleaded that the plaintiff's wrongful and unlawfulinducement of the breaches of contract was carried out for the purpose and intention of interfering with and injuring and did sointerfere with and injure the trade and business of the defendant. As a result, Golden Harvest and/or Panasia lost the benefit ofthe distribution agreement, including the right of first refusal of the distribution rights to "Ring 2" and the agency agreement.By reason of the plaintiff's unlawful interference with the trade and business of the defendant, it is alleged that the defendanthas lost the profits it would have made had it received the movies including "Ring 2" from Golden Harvest and/or Panasia for screeningin its cinema, has lost the benefit of its distributors (Golden Harvest and/or Panasia) having an agency agreement with Kadokawaand has been greatly injured in its trade and business.

That, in my view, was a fair and proper concessionto make. Ms Tsang was employed by Golden Harvest and her job title was general manager of Panasia. At most, it could be said thatshe owed duties to those two companies. It is inconceivable, in my view, that she owed any duties to other companies in the GoldenHarvest Group, including the defendant. There is no basis for alleging that she owed duties, including fiduciary duties, to the defendant.The assertion is obviously unsustainable.

It is clearthat an intention to injure a defendant has to be shown in an action for interference by unlawful means (para. 24-88 <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em> (18th Edn.).</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> It is alleged that the plaintiff was owned and controlled by Ms Tsang. It has been specifically pleaded at para. 35 of the RADC thatthe plaintiff's wrongful and unlawful inducement of the breaches of contract was carried out with the purpose and intention of interferingwith and injuring, and did so interfere with and injure, the trade and business of the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> It was submitted by Mr. Jat S.C., for the plaintiff, that even if Ms Tsang was the directing will or mind of the plaintiff, it couldhardly be said that she had been "induced and procured" by the plaintiff to breach her contractual obligations with Golden Harvestand Panasia. He submitted that there was nothing to suggest that she undertook any "persuasion or inducement" qua directing willof the plaintiff which caused herself, <em>qua</em> herself, to break her contract.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Mr. Hingorani, however, submitted that the plaintiff knew about the contracts that Ms Tsang had with Golden Harvest and/or Panasiaand that the plaintiff had dealings with Ms Tsang knowing that those dealings would be inconsistent with the contracts. As the designwas common to both the plaintiff and Ms Tsang, therefore, an actionable interference was committed. At para. 24-49 of <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em> it is stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â It is established that, where a third person with knowledge of a contract "has dealings with the contract breaker which the thirdparty knows to be inconsistent with the contract, he has committed an actionable interference. "</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> I see the force of Mr. Jat's submissions. However, I am unable to say that the defendant's allegations are incontestably bad or obviouslyunsustainable.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The plaintiff's case is that Ms Tsang ceased her employment with Golden Harvest on 30 September 1998 and became a consultant as from1 November 1998. She also ceased to be a director of Golden Harvest on 30 September 1998. It is the plaintiff's case that it wasGolden Harvest which decided not to take up the distributorship of the movies and the agency agreement with Kadokawa because of itsinternal financial problems. Ms Tsang was given permission to take up the distributorship of the movies after Golden Harvest haddecided against taking it up. The plaintiff's case is that at a meeting with Mr. Raymond Chow and Mr. Peter Tam in the latter partof September 1998 Ms Tsang was informed that Panasia was running at a loss. For that reason the post of the general manager wouldbe cut. Ms Tsang would be dismissed as an employee but would act as a consultant to provide services for the marketing of films alreadypurchased. It was also decided that Panasia would suspend the purchase of new films.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Mr. Tam confirmed in his evidence that the decision was made by Mr. Raymond Chow, the Chairman of Golden Harvest to suspend furtheracquisitions of foreign films, including those that were under negotiation, but in respect of which distribution agreement had notyet been signed. He confirmed that Ms Tsang was informed of this at a meeting in the latter part of September 1998 when Mr. Chowconfirmed to Ms Tsang the reorganisation in Panasia and her new role and that she was instructed not to sign any more agreementsfor the acquisition of foreign films for distribution, including the distribution agreement for the movies. The letter from Mr. PeterTam dated 5 November 1998 faxed to Kadokawa also tends to support the plaintiff's case.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Mr. Tam also produced a memorandum which he had sent to Mr. Jeff Courtney dated 18 March 1999. Mr. Courtney was the chief financialofficer of the group after Village Road Show joined the group in around December 1998. He had inquired about the arrangement of MsTsang. By the memorandum dated 18 March 1999, Mr. Tam informed Mr. Courtney of the decision made in September 1998 that no purchaseof new films would be made by Panasia and that in effect Ms Tsang was able to perform other work for non Golden Harvest entities.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> The documentary evidence tends to support the plaintiff's case that Golden Harvest had decided against taking up the distributorshipof the movies with Kadokawa. Mr. Raymond Chow, however, denies that there was a decision to suspend the acquisition of films andhe denies the allegations of the plaintiff as to what transpired at the meeting in the latter part of September 1998. These are disputedissues of fact. It cannot be resolved on affidavit evidence alone.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Although the plaintiff's documentary evidence tends to weaken the defendant's counterclaim, it seems to me that this is a matterwhich ought to be left to be determined at trial. It seems to me that the counterclaim ought not to be struck out although it appearsto me to be weak.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Mr. Jat also criticized the late attempt by the defendant to estimate the amount of damages that the defendant would suffer and complainedthat the same was an exaggeration of the damages that the defendant would suffer. It is pertinent to note that the complaints madein the counterclaim have already formed the basis of a separate action in HCA 3077 of 2002. This was an action commenced on 12 August2002 by Golden Harvest, Panasia and Golden Harvest Entertainment (Holdings) Ltd. against Ms Tsang and the plaintiff herein as defendants.An attempt was made by a summon dated 20 September 2002 in those proceedings for leave to amend the writ by adding the defendantherein, Conneway Films Co. Ltd., Real Merry Ltd. and Rich Will Ltd. as plaintiffs in HCA 3077 of 2002. That application was not pursuedwith. It was only in the further affirmation evidence of Ms Belinda Tang made on 3 April 2003 that estimates of the loss sufferedby the Golden Harvest Group and the defendant herein were given. It was Mr. Jat's submission that this was an exaggeration in anattempt to bring a counterclaim for an amount in excess of the plaintiff's claims. Ms Tsang states at para. 3 of her affirmationas follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The main loss suffered by the Defendant arises from the fact that, thanks to the Plaintiff's act, the Plaintiff, and not one ofthe Defendant's own sister companies, decided upon the Picture Release Pattern ("<em>PRP</em>") of the Movies in Hong Kong. The PRP is the strategy for releasing a film in cinemas. Essentially, the most profitable PRP for theGolden Harvest Group is to have screenings of the film in its initial launch period concentrated in Golden Harvest cinemas. If anotherGolden Harvest company had had control of the screening rights, the Group would have been in a position to choose a PRP of this sort,and thereby to generate more profit for the Defendant and for the Group as a whole. The difference in profitability for one of ourcinemas between a film released on a PRP chosen by us, compared with one chosen by an unconnected company, can be as much as a lossof market share of up to 50%. "</p>    </blockquote>    <p>She estimates the loss suffered by the defendant at HK$2,402,810.70. It is difficult to see what loss the defendant has suffered asthe movies were in fact exhibited in the defendant's cinema. It is the Plaintiff's case that the defendant has suffered no loss asthe movies were in fact screened at the defendant's cinema. The defendant has given some estimate of loss although the extent ofthe loss is dubious. However, this is a matter which ought to be resolved at trial.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> I turn to consider whether or not the master ought to have ordered a stay of the judgment pending trial of the counterclaim. Thecounterclaim is for unliquidated damages. It is important to bear in mind that the plaintiff's claim is for the liquidated sums aspleaded in the statement of claim. These are for amounts of film rentals and expenses for promotional material during the periodfrom October 2001 to April 2002. It is also important to bear in mind that the agreements for the exhibition of films, the subjectmatter of the plaintiff's claim, were in respect of other films, not the movies. Undoubtedly the films were exhibited and film rentalshave been due for some time now. The relevant invoices were dated from 28 December 2001 to 22 May 2002. There is no suggestion whatsoeverthat the plaintiff is not entitled to the film rentals.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> In <strong>Esso Petroleum v.

The counterclaim is in respect of a separate matter. It is in respectof damages for the tort of unlawfully interfering with the business of the defendant. It is a claim for unliquidated damages. Itwas in relation to the procuring of breaches of contract of Ms Tsang with Golden Harvest. The distribution agreement entered intoby the plaintiff with Kadokawa was in respect of the movies which were distributed in 1998 and 1999.

It would, in my view, be manifestly unjust to the plaintiff that there should be a stay of the judgment pending trialof the counterclaim which, as I have said, appears to me to be a weak counterclaim.

I shall make an order nisi as to costs. It seems to me that most of the time was spent on theplaintiff's appeal on the order for stay and the application to strike out the RADC. The plaintiff has succeeded on both of these.It, however, has failed on the appeal against the order refusing to strike out the amended defence and counterclaim. As most of thetime spent on the appeal was on the matters in respect of which the plaintiff has succeeded, it seems to me that it would be rightto make an order that the defendant do pay three-quarters of the plaintiff's costs of the hearing before me with certificate for2 counsel. The costs order made by the master on the plaintiff's summons dated 19 September 2002 was costs to be paid by the defendantto the plaintiff with certificate for counsel.
