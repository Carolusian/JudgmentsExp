Around 10 a.m., two of her colleagues left for a special workshopat the Chatham Road branch of the Defendant, leaving Miss Tse and another colleague Miss Lam to tend to the Shop.  Shortly after,Miss Lam went out to buy breakfast, leaving Miss Tse alone in the Shop.  Before Miss Lam returned to the Shop, trays and boxes ofcakes were delivered to the Shop, they were deposited outside the Shop entrance.  So as not to block the entrance, Miss Tse single-handedlymoved some of the cake trays into the storeroom and was shelving cakes at the Shop front when Miss Lam returned with her breakfast.Miss Lam went into the storeroom to finish her breakfast while Miss Tse continued shelving cakes by herself. As she was lifting 2to 3 trays of âold lady cakesâ ãèå©é¤ã from the floor, placing them onto the trolley of shopping baskets before loadingthem into the warming cabinets, she injured her back and right thigh.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Feeling the pain on her back and right thigh, she went into the storeroom and told Miss Lam of the accident.  After she and MissLam finished shelving the cakes at the Shop, she called the Shopâs assistant head Miss Wu and Mr. Lau, the supervisor, to informthem of the accident.  She was told to take a rest at the storeroom.  When the pain deteriorated, she was taken by a colleague toPrincess Margaret Hospitalâs Accident and Emergency Department for treatment later that morning.  She was given one weekâs sickleave by the doctor at the hospital.  She returned to work on 23 April 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  While at work on 1 May 2006, she suddenly felt numbness on her leg and pain around the back of the waist.  After reporting the conditionto her superior at the Shop, she was escorted by a colleague to the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospitalon the same day.  She was given sick leave up to 7 May 2006.  As the pain failed to subside, on 7 May 2006 she sought treatment atthe Accident and Emergency Department of Prince of Wales Hospital (âPWHâ) in Shatin.  She was referred to and received physiotherapytreatments at the PWH.  She returned to work on 15 May 2006 while she was still being treated at the physiotherapy department ofthe PWH.  Because of the requirement of her duties at the Shop, she was not given leave to attend the physiotherapy treatments thoughshe was able to continue with the follow-up treatments at the PWH.  She had also sought treatments at various clinics including PokOi Hospital in Yuen Long, Shatin Hospital, Shatin Lek Yuen Health Centre and Nethersole Hospital in Tai Po.  Furthermore, she attendedprivate clinics including the Union Hospital, general medical practitioners and Chinese herbalists for treatments.  She was given24 months of sick leave by the doctors after the accident between 16 April 2006 and 15 April 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  She admitted she received sick leave payments from the Defendant up to April 2008.  The Defendant settled the Plaintiffâs employeesâcompensation claim under DCEC No. 250 of 2008 by a sanctioned payment of $171,313 which was accepted by the Plaintiff on 17 August2009.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The Defendantâs case</u></p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Defendant adduced evidence from four witnesses who were co-workers and supervisors of Miss Tse.  It is not disputed that noneof Miss Tseâs co-workers witnessed the accident on 16 April 2006. Miss Lam, who was working at the Shop on the morning of 16 April2006 since 8 a.m. that day, had gone to buy breakfast sometime between 9.55 to 10.15 a.m. When she returned, she found a stack oftrays with cakes had been delivered to the shop.  She admitted because Miss Tse had told her to finish her breakfast before unloadingthe cakes, she went into the storeroom to eat her breakfast.  By the time she returned to the shop front to work, Miss Tse had finishedloading all the warming cabinets.  As there were âold lady cakesâ ãèå©é¤ã left in the trays, these were pushed into thestoreroom for storage after the trays were placed on the tray trolley.  While she was shelving tin biscuits onto the display shelves,Miss Tse came out of the storeroom, stood in front of the door, muttered a curse and told Miss Lam she had injured her leg. MissLam told her to take a rest, she saw as she looked inside the storeroom the tray trolley and trays inside the storeroom and thatthe storeroom floor was dry and flat.  Later, she overheard Miss Tse calling the shop head Miss Wu to report the accident.  A malecolleague, Mr. Fong, later came to escort Miss Tse to seek medical treatment.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  According to the evidence of Mr. Lau Yat Ming, the supervisor in charge of the five Tsim Sha Tsui branches of the Wing Wah CakeShop in 2006, he would take turn with the head of the shopãåºé·ã to man the Tsim Sha Tsui East Train Station shop. Togetherwith the head, the assistant head, and two shop assistants, there were altogether 5 staff working three daily shifts at the Shop. About 13 â 15 trays of fresh cakes and biscuits were delivered daily from Wing Wahâs Yuen Long factory to the Shop between 10a.m. and 12 noon.  Trays of cakes and cartons of biscuits would be left at the entrance of the Shop and the shop staff would placethe cakes on the shelves or into the warming cabinets, the remaining cakes would be stored in the storeroom.  On the day of the accident,16 April 2006, a total of 13 trays of cakes and one carton box of biscuits were delivered to the Shop after 10 a.m.  They consistedof individual wrapped cakes and around 8 trays of unwrapped cakes including puff pastries such asãèå©é¤ã.  Each tray with30 âold lady cakesâãèå©é¤ãhas a total weight of 5.63 kg.  The staff at the Shop was responsible for taking delivery ofthe cakes and biscuits delivered.  The cakes would be pushed into the shop next to the warming cabinets and the Shop staff wouldtake the trolley from the storeroom, put it next to the stack of cake trays, put the cakes from the trays onto the shelves beforestacking the empty trays onto the trolley.  After filling the shelves and the warming cabinets in the Shop, the staff would put theremaining trays of cakes on the trolley and push the stack of trays into the storeroom for storage.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  It was Mr. Lauâs evidence that puff pastries such as the âold lady cakesâãèå©é¤ãare placed in the bottom trays ofthe stack delivered and shelving should begin from the top.  Consequently, theãèå©é¤ãand other puff pastries would only beplaced in the warming cabinets after all the cakes were shelved.  During the course of the day, the Shop staff is required to replenishthe warming cabinets from the storeroom and bring out trays of puff pastries such asãèå©é¤ãinto the shop front.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  According to the evidence of Mr. Lau, Miss Leung, Miss Lau and Miss Lai, there was no need for any of the shop assistants to carry2 to 3 trays of cakes and training was given to each new staff in the first month of their employment at all Wing Wah shops.  Aseach Wing Wah shop has a different size and layout, each staff upon entry at a new shop is required to learn from the head of theshop the daily routine of taking delivery, shelving and storage of cakes.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  It is the Defence case that Miss Tse had failed to follow the proper procedure explained to her when she first joined the Shop,it resulted in her injuries.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Findings</b></p>    <p>(1)  <u>How did the accident happen on 16 April 2006? Was it at the front of the Shop or inside the storeroom?</u></p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  According to the evidence of Miss Tse, she was lifting 2 to 3 trays of puff pastriesãèå©é¤ãfrom the floor, placing themon top of the trolley of shopping baskets to facilitate the transfer of cakes into the warming cabinets at the Shop front when shefelt pain on her back and right thigh.  She went into the storeroom to inform Miss Lam who was having her breakfast.  She claimedshe was doing exactly what the other colleagues were doing when she lifted 2 to 3 trays of cakes and she was never told she shouldonly lift 1 tray of cakes at one time.  She also claimed there was no proper training at the Shop to speak of, she was merely shownhow the Shop operated on her first day at the Shop and she followed what other colleagues were doing.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Contrary to the evidence of Miss Tse, Miss Lam, Mr. Lau and Miss Leung claimed the way to load the warming cabinets was to takethe base plate from the warming cabinet, clean it and place the cakes onto the plate before returning the plate of cakes into thewarming cabinets.  Mr. Lau admitted he did not orally explain to Miss Tse what she should look out for when shelving cakes and replenishingthe warming cabinets.  He claimed he did demonstrate to Miss Tse the proper way to lift weight and told her to ask for assistancewhen required.  He further claimed that he had never witnessed Miss Tse lifting 2 to 3 trays of cakes at the Shop.  According toMr. Lau, the proper way to replenish the warming cabinets is to take the base plate from the warming cabinets into the storeroom,cleaned it before placing the cakes from the plastic trays in the storeroom and return the plate to the warming cabinets at the shopfront.  He further said that puff pastries such asãèå©é¤ãandãè®èé¥ãwould be removed from the plastic trays into paperboxes inside the storeroom for storage in the warming cabinets.  According to the evidence of Miss Leung and Miss Lam who were staffat the Shop, they would remove the base plate from the warming cabinet and placed it on top of the plastic tray, fill the base platewith cakes then return the plate to the warming cabinet.  The empty plastic trays together with the remaining cakes would then beplaced on the trolley and pushed into the storeroom for storage.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  On the day of accident, Miss Tse said she did not make use of the tray trolley inside the storeroom because it had trays with cakesleft over from the day before.  It was her practice to place 2 to 3 trays of old lady cakes on top of the shopping baskets when replenishingthe warming cabinets.  As she was lifting the trays from the floor, she turned to put them on top of the shopping baskets when sheinjured her back and thigh.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Miss Lam admitted she did not witness the accident. She was shelving tins of biscuits onto the shelves on the left side of the storeroomdoor when Miss Tse emerged from the storeroom after storing the stack of trays into the storeroom.  Miss Lam said she looked intothe storeroom as Miss Tse talked to her with the door half opened and she could see through the half opened door that the floor ofthe storeroom was level and dry and there was no obstruction in the passageway.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  I find Miss Lamâs evidence on what she could see and notice inside the storeroom when Miss Tse told her of the accident contrived. Judging from Exh. D5, the photograph of the area in front of the storeroom door and Exh. D3 (the sketch plan), it was impossiblefor Miss Lam to have seen the inside of the storeroom to ascertain if the storeroom floor was level or dry or whether there was anyobstruction at the passageway through the half opened door from the spot Miss Lam indicated where she was standing.  She also saidMiss Tse had told her she had âsprained her legâ (æ­å·é»è³).  It is possible Miss Lam had misheard what Miss Tse said orMiss Tse might have mentioned âlegâ when she meant the thigh, which is part of the leg.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The Defence relied on Miss Lamâs version of how the accident must have happened, while Miss Tse claimed she was injured whilelifting trays of cakes at the shop front, that she told Miss Lam about her injury when Miss Lam was still having her breakfast insidethe storeroom.  Page 404 of the trial bundle is the Form 2 filed by the employer on the accident, it is dated 29 April 2006 and completedby the manager named Mr. Tse Chi Hang (è¬å¿äº¨). At paragraph D, it stated: âå¡å·¥æ³æè²¨ç© (èå©é¤) æ¬éè³è²¨æ¶ä¸ï¼å¨æ¬ééä¸­ï¼æ­å·è°é¨åå¤§è¿ç­ãâ The statement clearly indicated  the employer had accepted Miss Tseâs version of the accident that she had injured her waist andthigh while she was transferring cakes onto the shelves.  There was no explanation at the trial from the Defendant as to why it reversedits stance after filing Form 2 when it accepted Miss Tseâs version on how she had sustained her injuries.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Miss Lam joined Wing Wah on 1 November 2005 while Miss Tse had worked at the Wing Wah Shatin shop for 6 months before she was re-employedon 1 September 2005.  Miss Tse being the more experienced staff had probably assumed a responsible role at the Shop at the time.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  It was the evidence of Miss Leung, the head of the shop, that Miss Tse was a responsible employee who was eager to do the work atthe Shop.  She was hard working and had a good understanding of what she was shown and was able to pick up the work quickly whileother staff may take longer to learn.  She said Miss Tse learned to do the work at the Shop within the first day of her transfer,while it might take three or more days for other staff to learn.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Miss Tse claimed it was the practice of her colleagues to carry two or more trays in one go and she was told by her colleagues todo the same.  This was denied by the Defendantâs witnesses.  Both Mr. Lau and Miss Lai claimed that if they saw Miss Tse carryingmore than one tray at a time, they would have told her not to do so, but both admitted they had never seen Miss Tse doing that. The Shop staff operated in 3 daily shifts, the delivery time for the shop was between 10 a.m. and 12 noon each day, a time when theShop was less busy and there were usually only two staff on duty.  It is therefore unlikely for Mr. Lau who was in charge of 5 to6 shops in Tsim Sha Tsui or for Miss Leung to be present at the Shop at the same time when trays of cakes were unloaded at the Shopby Miss Tse.  Furthermore, the Defendant admitted there was no staff training manual informing the staff the proper method of handlingcakes delivered to the shop.  Though there was training workshops given to the staff by the Defendant, according to the documentsdisclosed in the trial bundle, these related to customer relationships and knowledge on products rather than on safety procedureat work and the proper way to handle weighty merchandise at the shops.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I noticed from the photographs exhibited, the Shop was fitted with a large number of wall shelves.  In the centre of the Shop, therewere more cabinets and display shelves installed, thus leaving little room for staff and customer passage.  Miss Tse indicated shehad wanted to dispose of the stack of cake trays delivered without waiting for Miss Lam to finish her breakfast to assist her. Thisis understandable when the stack of cakes delivered was blocking the entrance to the Shop.  She also claimed because of the narrowaisles in the Shop, removal of the stack of trays to the storeroom was difficult to manoeuvre.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  After assessing the evidence of both the Plaintiffâs and the Defendantâs witnesses, the lay-out and the dimension of the Shop,the quality of evidence given, I find Miss Tse to be a truthful witness and her evidence on the incident that she injured her thighand her back while lifting trays of cakes at the shop front credible.  The Defendantâs objectivity was probably affected by MissTseâs second ECC claim on an accident in August 2006 and the dismissal of that claim by HH Judge Leung on 7 June 2010.  The twoaccidents are totally unrelated.</p>    <p>(2)  <u>Was the accident caused by Wing Wahâs negligence and/or breach of statutory duty or contractual duty for failing to provide a safesystem of work, proper instructions, training and risks assessment?</u></p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  An employerâs duty to the employee is set out in Clark &amp; Linsell on Torts, 20<sup>th</sup> Edition para. 13-03 at p.848-849:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAs Lord Hoffmann stated in <i>White v.

Taking into account the warming cabinets on either side (of the Shop) and the movable display cabinetsin the middle, the aisles on either side of the centre display cabinets measured less than 2Â½ feet (0.75 meters) wide.  As the stackof the 13-15 plastic trays delivered to the Shop daily by the factory (with a size of 55 mm x 48.4 mm with a height of 12.7 mm each)had to pass through one of the aisles into the storeroom, the staff pushing the stack of trays into the storeroom would find a spaceof 10 cm or less on either side of the stack as it was pushed into the store.  It is also noted that the left hand aisle beyond thewarming cabinets and the cashier counter would be too narrow for the cake trays to pass through for the width of the aisle betweenthe cashier counter and the central display cabinets in the Shop was even narrower.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  According to Miss Tse, she had cleared the Shop front, moved the stack of trays of fresh cakes into the storeroom by herself andbegan replenishing the warming cabinets before the accident.

It is trite law that the duty of an employer to his employees is to take reasonable care for their safety. The duty is owedby the defendants to each of its employees including the plaintiff. It is important to bear in mind that the duty is personal tothe employer and is non-delegable. The duty here was, inter alia, to provide a safe system of work. In planning a system of work,the defendants must take into account the fact that workers may become careless about the risks involved in their daily work (para.5.80 pg. 139 <i>Munkman on Employerâs Liability</i>, 13<sup>th</sup> Edn.).

Employers are not exempted from this duty by the fact that their men are experiencedand might, if they were in the position of an employer, be able to lay down a reasonably safe system of work themselves. Workmenare not in the position of employers.  Their duties are not performed in the calm atmosphere of a board-room with the advice of experts. They have to make their decisions on narrow sills and other places of danger and in circumstances where the dangers are obscuredby repetition.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  In the CFA case of Cathy Pacific Airways Ltd. v.

This was so even though it was convenient to think of the duty as involving the provision of safe co-workers, a safe placeof work, safe equipment, a safe system of work, proper instructions and supervision and, where called for, adequate training. A safesystem of work was the most frequently invoked branch of the employerâs duty and also the most difficult to define. Judges andacademics alike spoke in open-ended terms of the matters that the system included, and it was doubtful that any attempt to providean exhaustive list of what the system included would prove successful (<i>Cavanagh v Ulster Weaving Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1960%5d%20AC%20145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1960] AC 145</a>, <i>Speed v Thomas Swift &amp; Co.

But even if the plaintiffdid not do so, the court was by no means precluded from nevertheless finding the employer in breach of that obligation. Hence, hereidentifying an acceptable alternative system was not a pre-condition to finding that D failed to provide a safe system of work.</p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦â¦.</p>        <p class="quote">(5)      The crucial issue of fact at trial was whether D failed to take reasonable care for Pâs safety and there were concurrentfindings of fact by the Trial Judge and the Court of Appeal, albeit by a majority, that it had failed to do so.  The broad circumstancesproved or admitted permitted that view of the facts.  These were that P was a cabin attendant serving drinks to passengers underconsiderable time pressure; this involved getting a bottle from a drawer weighing up to 30 lbs by using one hand to support it; andthe danger involved in that exercise was apt to be obscured by its repetitive nature and P was not immune from momentary lapses ofattention. â¦â¦..â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The issue is whether the employer has taken reasonable care for the employeeâs safety or provided a safe system of work in theperformance of her duties at the Shop.  The Defendantâs witness Miss Lam demonstrated how a plate from the warming cabinets wouldbe taken out with a corner resting on the side of a stack of cake trays when replenishing the plates from the warming cabinets. The cake display warming cabinets were located in the two lower cabinets.  The employee, after loading the cakes from the plastictrays, was required to squat down to insert plates of cakes into the warming cabinets.  On the day of the accident, Miss Tse placed2 â 3 trays of cakes (weighing 11.26 kg â 16.89 kg) on top of the shopping basket trolley before the replenishing.  Whether shewas using the trolley from the storeroom or the one holding shopping baskets is not the issue, the real issue is whether Miss Tsewas working in a safe environment with sufficient room to manoeuvre when she carried one tray or 2 to 3 trays of cakes inside theShop, and whether a safe system of work was provided by her employer when she was required to replenish the warming cabinets.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The Defence witnesses gave two different versions of cake replenishing.  The first version came from Mr. Lau. He claimed the staffwas required to fill the plates from the warming cabinets at the storeroom and return the plates full for cakes into the warmingcabinets at the shop front.  The second version was to replenish the warming cabinets from cake trays delivered in the morning beforethey were stored in the storeroom; that was the version Miss Lam demonstrated in Court.  The first version is probably the saferof the two because the storeroom had more space for the staff to do her work.  The second version was presumably done upon the morningarrival of freshly baked cakes for the warming cabinet display before the remaining cakes were stored.  It is not disputed that the13 to 15 trays of cakes arriving at the Shop each morning were simply pushed or slid into the Shop because, the Defendant claimed,the shop floor was smooth.  They were not loaded onto the tray trolley from the storeroom.  After some of the cakes were shelved,the remaining cakes would be stored at the storeroom on the tray trolley.  The two practices described both required the staff tolift trays of cakes for shelving and replenishing from the 13 or 15 trays of cakes delivered.  I find the system described eitherby the Defendantâs witnesses or Miss Tse simply inadequate to protect the safety of the staff at the Shop.  I am not convincedby the evidence of the Defendantâs witnesses that instructions on safety and a safe method of lifting weights formed part of thetraining given to Miss Tse either at the Shatin shop or at the shop at Tsim Sha Tsui East Station. I believe the Shop staff wereleft to deal with the delivery and replenishing of cakes in whatever manner they find convenient, and they could be as diverse asthe two versions described by Mr. Lau and Miss Lam.  I find Miss Tse not guilty of contributory negligence.  The Defendant had failedin its duty to provide a safe system of work for its employees.

Chung and Ho, it was their opinion that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)   Miss Tse suffered from adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressive mood;</p>        <p>(b)  Miss Tseâs mental condition of adjustment disorder was precipitated by the accident;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)   Miss Tseâs adjustment disorder is caused by the stressors of the physical symptoms, the problematic relationship with herco-workers and the litigation;</p>        <p>(d)  Miss Tseâs psychiatric impairment at present is in a mild to very mild range; and</p>        <p>(e)   Miss Tseâs pre-existing panic disorder with agoraphobia was largely in remission before the accident.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It was Dr. Chungâs opinion that the accident had exacerbated Miss Tseâs mental problems.  (Page 356 &amp; 360 of Bundle 1).</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Pain, Suffering</u> <u>and</u> <u>Loss of Amenities</u></p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Mr. Kwok, Counsel for the plaintiff, relied on the case of Chan Chung Keung v. Greenroll Ltd. t/a Conrad Hong Kong HCPI 275 of 2005,where the plaintiff who fell on the wet floor on his buttocks was found to suffer from soft tissue contusion of the lower back. The Court held that he was suffering no more than a soft tissue injury which exacerbated a pre-existing weakness caused by naturalageing process.  The condition had caused the plaintiff certain degree of psychological problems leading to depression.  The Courtawarded $180,000 for PSLA.  The Court considered there was a real element of exaggeration of symptoms by the plaintiff in that case.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  In the case of Fung Lee Hung v. The Spastics Association of Hong Kong DCPI 1112 of 2005, the plaintiff was found to be sufferingfrom a mild form of depression caused and exacerbated mainly by the pre-existing physical symptoms sustained from injury at the accidentfollowed by social and financial problems since the accident.  The Court also found a slight element of exaggeration of her symptoms. She was awarded $200,000 under PSLA.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The third case relied on by the Plaintiff is Tam Kwok Man v. The Kowloon Motorbus Company (1993) Limited HCPI 775 of 2001.  Thejudge awarded the plaintiff $150,000 in PSLA after having found his injury was a minor contusion of the back leading to residualpain for some months, although there was no permanent or structural damage, bone or disc damage.  The Court accepted the plaintiffdid suffer from depression from his inactivity rather than as a result of the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Mr. Wong, Counsel for the Defendant, relied on the surveillance video of Miss Tse in early April 2008 and early August 2008. Thesevideos showed Miss Tse going out shopping and walking home, taking public transport carrying a number of bags of shopping, walkingup and down staircases in the process.  I agree the videos showed Miss Tse to have appeared entirely normal while engaged in herdaily activities.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The joint orthopaedic report of Drs. Lam and Cheng of 1 June 2009 at paragraph 34 assessed for the purposes of employeesâ compensation,stated that Miss Tse may be suffering from discomfort, fatigue or some pain during work and she suffered from 1% to 2% whole personimpairment. They also considered her loss of earning capacity to be 1% to 2%. (Page 336 of Bundle 1)</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Mr. Wong relied on the case of Cheng Liu Nei Su v. Clare Environmental Services Limited DCPI 842 of 2008 (date of judgment 30 July2009), one of my judgments where I awarded the plaintiff cleaner the sum of $175,000 under PSLA.  The plaintiff suffered from softtissue contusion injury of the back with residual pain.  6 months after the accident, she developed mental depression which affectedher sleep and well being.  The medical experts found she suffered from a mild form of adjustment disorder with depressed mood.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The second case referred to by Mr. Wong is the case of Tam Kwok Man v. The Kowloon Motorbus Company (1993) Limited, a case alsorelied on by the Plaintiff.  In that case, the Court found the sick leave of 9 to 12 months to be reasonable and accepted the plaintiffhad suffered from depression.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Mr. Wong submitted that the award under PSLA to Miss Tse should not be more than $100,000 because the injury suffered by her wasa minor back sprain with no trauma involved.  Furthermore, her psychiatric problems with residual impairment was said to be mildto very mild, it was expected to be resolved with a further 12 months course of therapy at the time of interview by the two psychiatricexperts.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  I have taken into consideration the pre-existing condition of Miss Tse which was in remission before the accident on 16 April 2006and the joint expertsâ opinion that the accident was an exacerbation of her mental condition caused by the stressors of physicalsymptoms and the later problematic relationship with her co-workers and the litigation.  (Paragraph 35 at Page 356 of Bundle 1). It is Dr. Chungâs opinion that Miss Tseâs mental complaints after the accident were compatible with an adjustment disorder withmixed anxiety and depressed mood.  It was characterized by the development of emotional or behavioural symptoms in response to identifiablestressors. At Paragraph  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=36%20Page%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">36, Page 356</a> of Bundle 1, the report stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe symptoms that she has complained of consist of depressed mood, anxiety, irritability, self-harm behavior, feelings of worthlessness,anxiety of going out, pessimistic ideas, lack of interest in activities, suicidal idea, bad memory, and sleep problems.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  At paragraph 37 of the report at page 357 Dr. Chung said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI believe the adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood is caused by the 1<sup>st</sup> accident.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>And at paragraph 38.3 he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe usual convalescent period for the 1<sup>st</sup> accident from a psychiatric point of view is a few weeks to a few months. Miss Tse would take a longer time for recovery due to thepre-existing mental problems.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  At paragraph 44,  Dr. Ho said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI concur with Dr. Chungâs opinion that Miss Tse has been suffering from an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressivemood.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At paragraph 45, Dr. Ho agreed with Dr. Chung that the exacerbation of her symptoms of adjustment disorder was caused by the stressorsof the physical symptoms after the accident, the problematic relationship with her co-workers and the litigation. Even though shehad a past psychiatric history and a positive family history that her mother had also received psychiatric treatment which made hervulnerable to develop psychiatric problems upon stressors, Dr. Ho agreed her panic disorder with agoraphobia was largely in remissionat the time of the accident on 16 April 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Therefore, the conclusion I draw from the expertsâ reports is that Miss Tse because of her pre-existing condition is more vulnerableto suffer from an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressive mood.  That the exacerbation of her symptoms of adjustmentdisorder is caused by the stressors of the physical symptoms after the accident.  Judging from the video surveillance tapes, if notfor the stresses she encountered at work, Ms Tse obviously can and has been living a normal life. It is unfortunate that the Plaintiffhad a pre-existing condition that could be triggered by stressors such as the accident on 16 April 2006 and the difficulties shefaced after returning to work albeit as a part time employee. On the aforesaid basis, I award her under PSLA the sum of $175,000.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Pre-trial loss of Earnings</u></p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Miss Tse claims a sick leave period of 609 days during the period 16 April 2006 to 15 April 2008.  She resigned on her own accordfrom the Defendantâs employment on 10 April 2009.  She claimed a monthly average earning of $7,300, consisting of a basic salaryof $6,800 and an annual bonus of $5,500.  The Defendant disagreed the bonus of $5,500 per annum should be taken into account.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  On the basis that Ms Tse was granted sick leave by the doctors for 609 days between 16 April 2006 to 15 April 2008, and on the basisthat she did try to return to work on a part time basis, it demonstrated she was conscientious and had wanted to resume working forthe Defendant.  On the day of examination by psychiatrists Drs. Chung and Ho in July 2009, it was obvious Miss Tse had been consultingpsychiatrists at the Hospital Authority. Both doctors agreed she would benefit from and should continue with her treatment.  Dr.Chung considered she would need long term psychiatric treatments for the pre-existing mental problem (Paragraph 43 at page 360 ofBundle 1); Dr. Ho, on the other hand, considered Miss Tseâs treatment for the mental problems caused by the accident required oneyear (Paragraph 54 at Page 364 of Bundle 1).  Dr. Chung considered the sick leave period granted by the HA psychiatric doctors tobe appropriate, while Dr. Ho considered from a psychiatric perspective, she would require a total leave period of about four to fivemonths during the more intense phase of her mental problem since the first incident (Paragraph 65 at page 366 of Bundle 1).  I acceptthe 609 days of sick leave given to Miss Tse by doctors at both the public and private sectors in the two years after the accidentbetween 16 April 2006 to 15 April 2008 was appropriate. </p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  On the dispute of the monthly wage she was earning before the accident, her basic monthly salary was $6,800, she claimed a bonusof $5,500 at the end of the year.  Mr. Wong, Counsel for the Defendant, referred to an agreement at the time of the ECC claim thather monthly wage was set at $6,800.  This is found at paragraph 63 of H.H. Judge Leungâs judgment of 7 June 2010 in DCEC 251 of2008 (Page 741 of Bundle 2).</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  In Miss Tseâs witness statement, paragraph 8 at page 145 of bundle 1, she claimed that her basic pay was $5,500 plus an allowanceof $1,300 making a total monthly payment of $6,800.  She did not mention an annual bonus of $5,500. I cannot find any supportingevidence for the $7,300 per month claimed in her Statement of Damages.  My assessment is therefore based on the monthly salary of$6,800 as follows:</p>    <p>        $6,800 x 609 days Ã· 30 days = $138,040</p>    <p>        MPF 5% = $6,902</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Future medical expenses</u></p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Miss Tse asks for compensation on future psychiatric and psychological treatments recommended by Dr. Chung, it was estimated at$14,000 as an appropriate sum for medication and treatment for one year.  The Defence objects to the claim for private psychiatriccare because Miss Tse had been receiving treatments at the Hospital Authority clinics.  The Defence further pointed out that therecommendation was for one year of treatments, it has been almost two years since Drs. Chung and Hoâs medical report in 2009, whethershe had already received the 12 months treatment and medication is unknown.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  From records exhibited, Miss Tse had been followed-up at the Hospital Authority Prince of Wales Hospital clinic in Shatin.  Sincethe accident on 16 April 2006, she had also received treatments at the Orthopaedic and Traumatic Surgery Department of Princess MargaretHospital, Prince of Wales Hospital, Union Hospital and the Lee Ka Shing Specialist Clinic as well as from private practitioners. Some of these clinics and hospitals such as the Union Hospital are privately run and she was required to pay for these treatments. I am well aware that it would be inconsistent and illogical if Miss Tse should give up the follow-up clinics at the Prince of WalesHospital for her psychiatric problems.  However, taking into account the special needs of a person with a history of depression,that from time to time Ms Tse may require extra care as she had done before particularly when she was feeling depressed or not ableto sleep and had to seek private medical care on an emergency and/or need-to basis, it is reasonable to make special allowances. For this reason I award her the sum of $10,000.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Special damages</u></p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Miss Tse claims special damages in the sum of $29,520.40.  The sum is supported by documentations including receipts from variousclinics and hospitals, the sum also included travelling expenses.  They are set out in the Statement of Damages at pages 70 to 73of bundle 1.  Expenses on the Hospital Authority treatments were not included because they had been waived by the Hospital Authoritywhen Miss Tse was unemployed.  The Defence disputes the sum of hospitalization at Union Hospital of $10,335, I find the hospitalexpenses and other miscellaneous expenses were reasonably incurred by Miss Tse. I allow the sum of $29,520.40 in total. </p>    <p class="heading"><u>Summary</u></p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>        </p><table width="100%" border="0">  <tr>    <td width="10%"> </td>    <td width="40%">PSLA</td>    <td width="20%" style="text-align:center">$175,000.00</td>    <td width="30%"> </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td> </td>    <td>Pre-trial loss of earnings</td>    <td style="text-align:center">$138,040.00</td>    <td> </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td> </td>    <td>MPF 5%</td>    <td style="text-align:center">$6,902.00</td>    <td> </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td> </td>    <td>Future medical expenses</td>    <td style="text-align:center">$10,000.00</td>    <td> </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td> </td>    <td>Special damages           </td>    <td style="text-align:center">$29,520.40</td>    <td> </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td> </td>    <td colspan="2" nowrap="nowrap" style="text-align:left"><hr /></td>    <td> </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td> </td>    <td>Total </td>    <td style="text-align:center"> $359,462.40</td>    <td> </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td> </td>    <td>Less</td>    <td> </td>    <td> </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td> </td>    <td>Employeesâ compensation</td>    <td style="text-align:center">$171,313.00</td>    <td> </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td> </td>    <td colspan="2" style="text-align:left"><hr /></td>    <td> </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td> </td>    <td>Total</td>    <td style="text-align:center">$188,149.40</td>    <td> </td>  </tr></table>   <p class="heading"><u>Interests</u></p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Interests on general damages at 2% per annum from the date of writ to date of judgment, interests on special damages at half judgmentrate from the date of accident to date of judgment, thereafter at full judgment rate until full payment.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Costs</u></p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Costs to follow the event.
