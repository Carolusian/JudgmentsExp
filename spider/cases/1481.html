This is denied by the defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiffâs case, which is denied, is that the 4 Deeds were illegal and unenforceable for being unlawful maintenance of lawsuitsand champerty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The plaintiff also alleges that D2 interfered with the process of the settlement of the plaintiffâs intended claim for the 50 sharesresulting in the delay of the settlement of that claim by 5 months causing the plaintiff to lose HK$1,250,000 being the differencebetween the original settlement offer of HK$9,000,000 and the final settlement sum of HK$7,750,000.  This is denied.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The plaintiffâs claim against D1 is for damages for misrepresentation and for interference with the settlement of the plaintiffâsintended claim for the 50 shares.  These are matters which Ms Chan, for the plaintiff, accepted will have to be resolved at trialas there are disputes of fact which can only be resolved at trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> However, the plaintiff by his amended summons seeks summary judgment under O.14 against D2 and D3 for the declarations sought.  Theplaintiff also seeks a determination of the issue under O.14A against D1, D2 and D3.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Ms Chan submitted that on the undisputed facts before the Court the plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment for the declarationssought and also to a determination of the issue in his favour.  She submitted that there is no triable issue on the question of whetheror not the 4 Deeds are champertous agreements which she submitted were illegal and unenforceable.</p>    <p class="heading" style="text-align:justify">Maintenance and champerty</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The leading authority in Hong Kong on the law of maintenance and champerty is the recent Court of Final Appeal decision in <i>Unruh v Seeberger</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%2010%20HKCFAR%2031" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 10 HKCFAR 31.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> It was held that the common law rules making maintenance and champerty criminal offences, torts and a ground of public policy forinvalidating tainted contracts were part of Hong Kong law prior to 1997 and remained applicable by virtue of art. 8 of the BasicLaw.  Maintenance was still directed at âofficious intermeddlingâ in someone elseâs litigation.  And champerty, a form of maintenance,still involved the notion of a division of the spoils, which might encourage perversion of justice and trafficking in litigation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> In a careful and detailed judgment Ribeiro PJ analysed the development of the law of maintenance and champerty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> In his analysis, he said at paragraph 86:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â The prohibition of maintenance and champerty is a matter of public policy and involves a value judgment that certain conduct shouldbe considered âofficious intermeddlingâ in someone elseâs litigation or âtrafficking in litigationâ which deserved to bemade unlawful.  Unsurprisingly, the content of that value judgment has fundamentally changed, reflecting the radical developmentof society in general and of the legal system in particular over the last seven hundred years.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> And at paragraph 89, Ribeiro PJ cited with approval what Lord Roskill said in <i>Trendtex Trading Corp v Credit Suisse</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] AC 679</a> at page 702:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â the courts have adopted an infinitely more liberal attitude towards the supporting of litigation by a third party than had previouslybeen the case.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Ribeiro PJ also dealt at paragraphs 91 to 98 with various instances where conduct which would otherwise constitute maintenance orchamperty has been excluded from the sphere of liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> One category of excluded cases, he said, involves what may be called the âcommon interestâ category i.e. persons with a legitimatecommon interest in the outcome of litigation sufficient to justify one of them in supporting the litigation conducted by anotherwithout engaging the prohibition against maintenance and champerty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> A second excluded category was cases involving âaccess to justiceâ considerations.  As Ribeiro PJ said at paragraph 95:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â A second excluded category involves what might today be referred to as cases involving âaccess to justiceâ considerations. In Hong Kong, art.35 of the Basic Law recognizes access to the courts as a fundamental right.  It has never been a defence to anaction nor a ground for a stay to show that the plaintiff is being supported by a third person in an arrangement which constitutesmaintenance or champerty.  Neither does liability for maintenance or champerty depend on the action or the defence being bad in law. It follows that an attack on an arrangement said to constitute maintenance or champerty could well result in a claim which is perfectlygood in law being stifled where the plaintiff, deprived of the support of such an arrangement, is unable to pursue it.  This is apowerful argument for such cases to be excluded from the ambit of maintenance and champerty.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Ribeiro PJ then went on to set out at paragraphs 99 to 104 the current approach to maintenance and champerty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> As he pointed out at paragraph 100 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â the mischief to be discouraged by the law of maintenance is still âofficious intermeddlingâ in litigation in particular wherethis results in oppression of the person against whom the action is brought and possibly it may result in the general encouragementof litigiousness.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> It is important to bear in mind what he said at paragraphs 102 and 103:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â 102.     Secondly, the fact that an arrangement may be caught by the broad definitions of maintenance or champerty is not in itselfsufficient to found liability.  The totality of the facts must be examined asking whether they pose a genuine risk to the integrityof the courtâs processes.  In <i>R (Factortame Ltd) v Transport Secretary (No 8)</i>, Lord Phillips MR stated: ââ¦ one must today look at the facts of the particular case and consider whether those facts suggestthat the agreement in question might tempt the allegedly champertous maintainer for his personal gain to inflame the damages, tosuppress evidence, to suborn witnesses or otherwise to undermine the ends of justice.â  It is not enough simply to say that itis the type of agreement which âsavours ofâ champerty.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">103.     Thirdly, countervailing public policies must be taken into account, especially policies in favour of ensuring access to justiceand of recognizing, where appropriate, legitimate common interests of a social or commercial character in a piece of litigation. The traditional public policies against intermeddling in litigation must be weighed against such competing values and if the balanceis in favour of the latter, the conduct complained of should not be regarded as contrary to public policy.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> It is abundantly clear that the totality of the facts must be examined asking whether they pose a genuine risk to the integrity ofthe courtâs process. Also, countervailing public policies must be taken into account.  The traditional public policies againstintermeddling in litigation must be weighed against competing values and if the balance is in favour of the latter, the conduct complainedof should not be regarded as contrary to public policy.  In my view one can only have a proper weighing exercise when the totalityof the facts have been examined. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The O.14 application</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> I am unable to accept that no triable issue has been raised on the O.14 application for the declarations sought.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The circumstances surrounding the execution of the 4 Deeds as well as the events which transpired after the execution of the sameare disputed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Contrary to the plaintiffâs allegations, D1 has affirmed that the plaintiff approached D1 telling him that he was in serious financialdifficulty and that he needed money to pursue the two claims.  The plaintiff told him that he was claiming what rightfully belongedto him but was unable to get any financing from banks or elsewhere and that without financial assistance, he would not be able topursue the two claims.  He told D1 that if he agreed to give him financial assistance to pursue the claims D1 could be repaid andcompensated by way of a share in the proceeds of any successful claim.  The plaintiff was insistent, according to D1, and went tosee D1 over 10 times to implore him to help.  The terms of the 4 Deeds were finally agreed in May 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> It is clear, in my view, that these factual disputes can only be resolved at trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> As Ribeiro PJ said in <i>Unruh</i> (at paragraph 95) an attack on an arrangement said to constitute maintenance or champerty could well result in a claim which is perfectlygood in law being stifled where the plaintiff, deprived of the support of such an arrangement, is unable to pursue it.  That is amatter to be considered when examining the totality of the facts.  That is something which, in my view, must be resolved at trialas there are factual disputes which can only be resolved at trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> I would observe that if, as D1 said, the plaintiff told him that without the financial assistance from D1 he would not be able topursue his two claims, that is a powerful argument for excluding the 4 Deeds from the ambit of maintenance and champerty.  I wasalso referred to a letter dated 14 October 2006 from the plaintiff to D3 for the attention of D1 where the plaintiff said, <i>inter alia</i>, that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â I am the victim of fraud and deceit in [HCA652] and [the 50 shares claim]â.  You are the white Knight in Shining Armourâ¦â¦â¦.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Subsequent events showed that the plaintiff did finally settle his intended claim for the 50 shares for HK$7,750,000 without institutingproceedings.  It is certainly at least arguable that it was a perfectly good claim which might have been stifled if the plaintiffwas deprived of the financial support to pursue it. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> It seems to me that there is at the very least a triable issue raised as to whether the 4 Deeds were illegal and unenforceable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> In my judgment it is not appropriate to give summary judgment on the claim for the declarations against D2 and D3.</p>    <p class="heading">The O.14A application</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> It is also not appropriate in my view to determine the issue under O.14A.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> In <i>Rockwin Enterprises Ltd v Shui Yee Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%203%20HKC%20174" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 3 HKC 174</a> at page 185 Ma CJHC (as he now is) said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â Where the court is not seized of all relevant facts, it would be an extremely rare case (if ever) in which the procedure underO.14A would be adopted.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> I respectfully agree.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> In my judgment this is not a suitable case for a summary determination of the issue without a close examination of all the circumstances. The Court does not have all the relevant facts giving rise to the execution of the 4 Deeds.  As I have said, the circumstances surroundingthe execution of the 4 Deeds as well as the events which transpired after the execution of the same are disputed.  These disputedfacts can only be resolved at trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> I would also observe that the court has a residual discretion whether or not to embark on a determination of the issue under O.14Aeven where the issue was one that was suitable for determination without a trial and its determination would finally determine anissue in the proceedings. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> In <i>Rockwin</i> Ma CJHC also said at page 185:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â The court can take an overall view of the matter to see the context in which the question arises.  If the court is of the viewthat there would not be a great saving of time or costs in determining the question (or indeed if it feels quite the opposite), thiswould be a factor against adopting the O 14A procedure.  For example, if the question involves an issue that is not determinativeof the action or is but one of many issues or which may at the end of the day be an academic one, a court may well not embark ona determination under O 14A.  In such situations, it may be that a determination by the court leading possibly to appeals at twofurther levels, will result in more delay and expense to the parties than if the whole matter was decided at one go at trial.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> As Ms Chan accepted, there will still have to be a trial of the action even if the issue is determined in the plaintiffâs favour. The plaintiff claims damages for misrepresentation and for interfering with the settlement of the claim for the 50 shares and MsChan accepted that this cannot be resolved without a trial.  In my judgment, since there will have to be a trial in any event evenif, contrary to my view, the issue were suitable for a summary determination under O.14A, the summary determination of the issuewill not result in a great saving of time and costs.  It would be far more desirable to have all the issues resolved at one go attrial especially when all the circumstances have been examined and findings on disputed facts have been made.  For that reason also,it is not appropriate in my view to embark on a determination of the issue under O.14A. </p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> I dismiss the amended summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> In view of the defences that had been served prior to the taking out of the application, in my view the plaintiff should not haveissued the application either for an order under O.14 or O.14A and the defendants are entitled to their costs of the amended summons. I also make an order <i>nisi</i> for costs of the application to be costs to the defendants. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Arjan H.
