defendants applied for leave to file a rejoinder, being a pleading following the plaintiffâs Reply.  The proposed rejoinder isannexed to the application.  This is the matter now before me.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  To put this in context, the pleadings closed on 4 August 2003. In further context however, there have since been a number of applicationsand hearings going to the pleadings, including one application to strike out which was granted and then confirmed in the Court ofAppeal.  The most recent application before this one was heard on 7 June 2007, giving the defendants leave to re-amend their defence,which reamendments were filed and served on 14 June 2007.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The application is opposed on three grounds as I shall come to.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  First however, the starting point.

Noneof these names for pleadings occurs in the former or present rules.  All except rejoinder are rare in Hong Kong to the point of extinction;and even rejoinder is seldom seen.  It may be necessary, for example, where the defendant raises a counterclaim for libel and theplaintiff in his reply and defence to counterclaim pleads qualified privilege to which the defendant wishes to plead express malice,which he can only do in a rejoinder, or where the plaintiff raises a counterclaim to the defendantâs counterclaim, to which thedefence can only be contained in a rejoinder. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">Application for leave to serve a rejoinder or subsequent pleading is made by summons to the master or may be made on the summons fordirections. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">Leave to serve a rejoinder or subsequent pleading will not be granted unless it is really required, so as to raise matters which mustbe specifically pleaded (see r.8).â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Rule 8, under the heading â<b>Matters which must be particularly pleaded</b>â states that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote">8(1)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="76%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">A party must in any pleading subsequent to a statement of claim plead specifically any matter, for example, performance, release,any relevant statute of limitation, fraud or any fact showing illegality, </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">(a)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="73%" valign="top" class="quote">which he alleges makes any claim or defence of the opposite party not maintainable; or </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">(b)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="73%" valign="top" class="quote">which if not specifically pleaded, might take the opposite party by surprise; or </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">(c)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="73%" valign="top" class="quote">which raises issues of fact not arising out of the preceding pleading.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  One gleans from the note at 18/4/1 that pleadings subsequent to a reply are, except for a rejoinder, practically extinct, and thata rejoinder arises only exceptionally.

The emphasis however is on the pleadings that answer the plaintiffâsassertion that it can rely on the rule in <i>Turquandâs</i> case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  One of the pleaded clauses in the proposed rejoinder is particularly controversial; it is clause 12.5.

These were both directors of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant at the material time, stated in the purported minutes of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to have been present at the board meeting said to have taken place on 17 September 1999.

The first is a matter of pleading.  The function of pleadingsis to give the party opposite sufficient notice of the case which is being made against him.  If the pleader means âdishonestlyâor âfraudulentlyâ, it may not be enough to say âwilfullyâ or recklesslyâ.  Such language is equivocal.  A similar requirementapplies, in my opinion, in a case like the present, but the requirement is satisfied by the present pleadings.

This is only partly a matter of pleading.  It isalso a matter of substance.  As I have said, the defendant is entitled to know the case he has to meet.  But since dishonesty isusually a matter of inference from primary facts, this involves knowing not only that he is alleged to have acted dishonestly, butalso the primary fact which will be relied upon at trial to justify the inference.  At trial the court will not normally allow proofof primary facts which have not been pleaded, and will not do so in a case of fraud.  It is not open to the court to infer dishonestyfrom facts which have not been pleaded, or from facts which have been pleaded but are consistent with honesty.  There must be somefact which tilts the balance and justifies an inference of dishonesty, and this fact must be both pleaded and proved.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Mr Whitehead went on to submit that there has not been pleaded in this case the necessary particularity as these judgments say isa vital ingredient of a plea of fraud.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  I shall deal with these objections now in turn.  First as to the suitability or otherwise of a rejoinder as being the means by whichthe matters raised therein should be pleaded.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  In answer to the proposition that all matters raised in the Reply are in issue in any event; that is as may be so.  But the primarythrust of the defendantsâ pleading in response is to plead exceptions to the rule in <i>Turquandâs</i> case. This means establishing knowledge or being put on enquiry.  And this has to be expressly pleaded.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Could this have been pursued by a further amendment to the defence?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Perhaps.  Mr Strachan conceded as such in his submission.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  But this would in my view have amounted to an unnatural situation, raising in a pleading preceding the Reply a matter not raisedsubstantively until the Reply.  This is like answering a question not yet asked.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The same goes for those matters raised in the proposed rejoinder which do not go to knowledge or enquiry.  They are direct responsesto matters raised for the first time in the Reply.  There is, realistically, no other proper place for such responses to come inthan in a subsequent pleading.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The pleaded facts make this an unusual case.  Some may say an exceptional one.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  A straightforward claim to recover moneys not repaid in breach of contract is met by the defence that the contract is irregularand unenforceable.  The reply to that is that the claimant is not bound to look into the debtor companyâs indoor management, sothat even if there is irregularity it is entitled to enforce its claim. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The defence wishes to respond to that reply by positive assertions; that the claimant cannot invoke the rule of indoor managementbecause it knew of or should have enquired about those irregularities.  So, how should this be pleaded, if not by rejoinder? </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Mr Whitehead submits that cannot be right, for such a course would give the defence the last word. But as the note below O.18 r.4reveals, there is a further pleading available to give the plaintiff the last word if it wants it; the surrejoinder.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  I have re-read the rule and the note below the rule.  I have noted of course the reference to the need for necessity, to the rarity,to the specific sort of case for which the procedure is appropriate.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  But I read of no express or implied prohibition to the granting of leave in a given case which calls in the order of things forfurther pleadings beyond the Reply, where positive assertions are necessary.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  I am sufficiently familiar with this case and its pleadings that are currently in and are proposed to know what is going on.  Butif a judge or other interested party were to read for the first time the pleadings with those going to the exceptions to the rulein <i>Turquandâs</i> case incorporated into the defence it would I suggest require several readings to understand how these pleadings had come into play.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  And there would remain the poser as to where, sensibly, to put pleas in response to those that have been raised in the Reply forthe first time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The inclusion instead of a rejoinder removes the fog of that.  Indeed I have to say I think it is an entirely sensible course. It is in effect to put everything in the right order.  It smacks of logic and common sense.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Along with this clarity there is as I see it no downside.  The plaintiff can have the last word, if it wants it.  There is no prejudiceto the plaintiff that I have been told about or can find.  On the contrary, it goes towards achieving what is required of pleadingsin any case; of ensuring that the real issues in dispute between the parties are defined in advance of the trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  <i>Norris v Beazley</i>, I am satisfied, was decided on its facts.  The proposed rejoinder was a repetition and amplification of pleadings already raised. That assuredly did amount to double pleading and it is not surprising that it was rejected, especially as the defendant was giventhe opportunity of enhancing his defence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Mr Whitehead pointed to examples in the proposed rejoinder where facts have been repeated; so that the authors he said have committedthe same wrong as those who represented the defendant in <i>Norris v Beazley</i>.  But on examination it is to be noted that those facts that are repeated are included so as to give a platform to the pleas thatthe plaintiff knew or was put on enquiry as to irregularities in the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs contracts.  This was not double pleading so as to confuse or embarrass or otherwise be prejudicial.  On the contraryit was to clarify just what it was the plaintiff knew about or about which it was put on enquiry.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  So as I find there is nothing to the point that there is or will be repetition if the rejoinder comes in.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  As to the objection that the rejoinder contains evidence and/or legal submissions:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="95%" valign="top">the rules do disallow the pleading of evidence; this for obvious reasons. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">I do not need to repeat them.  Mr Strachan alluded to a document that all lawyers and judges have come to know and dread; that is,the statement of claim or defence written by a litigant in person, by which means he feels bound to unburden his soul in a masterpiecethat seems to go on for ever.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  There is nothing in the proposed rejoinder which warrants criticism let alone exclusion under this head.  And I find no legal submissionstherein which warrant striking out because they are prejudicial and/or embarrassing.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  I come now to the third objection which is that the plea at clause 12.5 of the proposed rejoinder is deficient and should not beallowed in.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  The first point is that the plea as phrased is a plea of forgery.  There can be no ambiguity or doubt about that.  Mr Strachan whomI suspect played a part in how it was to be worded has submitted that it was modelled on a long-established definition of forgeryas propounded by Blackburn J in <i>R v Windsor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281865%29%2010%20Cox%20CC%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1865) 10 Cox CC 118</a> at 123:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">Forgery is the false making of an instrument purporting to be that which it is not; it is not the making of an instrument which purportsto be what it really is, but which contains false statements.  Telling a lie does not become a forgery, because it is reduced intowriting.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">I accept that to be so.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  It will of course be for the defence to prove that the minutes are a lie unto themselves and thus a forgery.  But the assertionthat they are, is foursquare and incontrovertible.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Second is that the Immigration Department letter lately produced (and I note there has been no explanation for that delay) is important,but not primary evidence in support of the contention that two people said to be present could not have been.  This was already putforward in the witness statement of Lee Kwok Keung who is a current director of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and who will be giving evidence for the defence, no doubt to affirm the truth of that and why. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The letter provides forensic support for that evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Third, the matter of the presence or absence of the directors in question is only one of five matters raised by the defence to supportthe proposition that the meeting of 17 September 1999 could not have taken place.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Fourth, the allegation of fraud is not made against the plaintiff.  It is incorporated as part of the factual matrix that the plaintiffknew or was put on enquiry that the 17 September 1999 meeting did not take place.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  In essence in deciding whether this lately made plea should be allowed in I do of course as I am bound pay heed to the pronouncementof the higher courts on the topic.  But the overriding feature in the exercise of my discretion is to consider the question âIsthere prejudice?â</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  I can find or think of none.  I do not believe that any has been proffered.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The plea remains.  It is of forgery.  Now it will be for the defence to prove that, if it can.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  I conclude by giving the defendants leave to file and serve forthwith the proposed rejoinder in the form annexed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  I shall now invite submissions on costs and consequential directions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(After Discussion)</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  The plaintiff has leave to file and serve a surrejoinder in response to the rejoinder on or by 2 October 2007.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Costs of and occasioned by the defendantsâ summons to the plaintiff in any event, with certificate for two counsel (Messrs WhiteheadSC &amp; Kwan).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Costs of the argument of 3 days to the defendants in any event, with certificate for two counsel (Messrs Strachan &amp; Chow).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center" height="18"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center" height="18">(D M B Gill)<br />            Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Robert Whitehead, SC leading Mr Steven Kwan &amp; Ms Joey Yuen, instructed by Messrs Wilkinson &amp; Grist, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Mark Strachan, leading Mr Kenneth Chow, Ms Anny Chak and Mr William Liu, instructed by Messrs David W T Chan &amp; Co., for the1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2007/1128.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
