The plaintiff seeks, <i>inter alia,</i> specific performance ofthis agreement. The plaintiff and the defendant had earlier entered into twoagreements containing arbitrationclauses. The question to be decided in thisapplication is whether the subject matter of the dispute in this action fallswithinthe ambit of those arbitration clauses.</p><p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The background is as follows. The plaintiff carried on business as amanufacturer and supplier of watch cases and watch bands. Thedefendant was awatch supplier; its business included the assembly of watches. The partiessigned a written agreement dated 24 January1998 (âthe First Agreementâ) underwhich the plaintiff appointed the defendant as its sole distributor inSwitzerland, Italy,Japan and the U.S.A for all products manufactured by theplaintiff in its factories in China. Clause 11 thereof provides:</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âThis agreement is governed by the law of HongKong.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">All disputes are to be settled in an amicable way.If this proves to be impossible any dispute is to be settled by an arbitraltribunal.The regulation for the arbitration will be laid down in a separateagreement.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> This was followed by another agreement dated 23 March 2001 (âthe SecondAgreementâ). It recites in a preamble that the supplier,i.e. the plaintiff,has asked the distributor, i.e. the defendant to amend the contract dated 24September 1998 and provides by clause11 that that contract is âsuspendedâ. Byclause 8 it provides that the agreement cannot be terminated until 31 December2005and further provides that the agreement is automatically prolonged forsubsequent periods of three years, unless 12 monthâs priornotice oftermination is given. Clause 10 repeats the words of clause 11 of the earlieragreement.</p><p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> In each case, a separate collateral written agreement provides for themechanism of arbitration.</p><p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> A letter dated 23 March 2001 from the defendant to the plaintiffconfirms that the First Contract is terminated with effect from1 April 2001and that âyou are free now to acquire customers in Switzerlandâ.</p><p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> On 28 June 2001 Messrs Robertsons, the plaintiffâs then solicitors,wrote to the defendant referring to âan Agreement betweenour client andyourselves dated 24 September 1998â and intimating the plaintiffâs claim forpayment for goods sold and deliveredin the sum of $4,041,100.90. The lettercontinued:</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âDespite repeated demands made by our client, youhave still failed to settle the same. As you are in fundamental breach of theAgreement, our client has considered that you have wrongfully repudiated theAgreement and it is therefore no longer bound by thesame without prejudice toits right to claim damages against you. In order to mitigate its loss arisingfrom your wrongful repudiation,our client will ship goods ordered to youdirect to the eventual customersâ.</p></blockquote><p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Then on 20 July 2001, the plaintiff initiated proceedings in High CourtAction No. 3278 of 2001 (âthe First Actionâ) againstthe defendant for$3,978,638.40, being the price of goods sold and delivered.</p><p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> In brief the plaintiffâs case in the present action is as follows. Theparties entered into negotiations to withhold proceedingsin the First Action.On about 24 July 2001 they entered into the Tripartite Agreement. The otherparty to it, Fossil, had orderedwatches from the defendant. The TripartiteAgreement required the plaintiff to take watch components from the defendantâswarehouse,itself supply its own watch cases and watch bands and obtain anyother necessary watch components at its own cost, and deliver allof these to acompany designated by the defendant. That company would assemble thecomponents, at the plaintiffâs cost, into thewatches ordered by Fossil. Thewatches were to be delivered to Fossil; the defendant would invoice Fossil forthem, using invoicesmarked with the words âPlease pay to New Sound IndustriesLtd.â; Fossil would pay the plaintiff direct. The payments so receivedwould beset off against the sum sued for in the First Action.</p><p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The plaintiff now claims that on five revised invoices, the defendant inrevising them deliberately and in breach of the TripartiteAgreement omittedthe words requesting payment to the plaintiff, and further that it requestedFossil to pay the sums invoiced toit. Fossil has refused to settle the invoices,in the total sum of US$100,901.00 with the plaintiff and is withholding the suminvoiced.Now the plaintiff claims against the defendant for a declaration thatit is entitled to payment for the revised invoices, or in thealternative foran order that the defendant mark the invoices as payable to the plaintiff, orin the further alternative for damagesin the sum of US$100,901.00.</p><p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The defendant has not yet filed any defence but its case appears from anaffidavit sworn by its director, Mrs Beate Hildegard G&ouml;belon November 2003.She does not deny that the Tripartite Agreement came into being but she saysthat it was not a three-cornered agreementbut rather an arrangement forpayment of some outstanding supply orders made by the defendant to theplaintiff under the two earlieragreements, and was in effect an assignment ofdebt in which the defendantsâ obligations to pay were passed on to Fossil. Thebusinessand contractual obligations between the plaintiff and the defendantwere not altered. As to the invoices referred to in the Statementof Claim, itwas found out that all the payments due to the plaintiff had been settled inaccordance with the new payment arrangement,so the defendant instructed Fossilnot to make any further payment to the plaintiff.</p><p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The defendantâs case on its application is that the First Agreement, andthe Second Agreement which was substituted for it, wereintended to regulatethe business relationship of the parties. That relationship is ongoing. Thepresent dispute is a dispute arisingfrom the business relationship and istherefore subject to the arbitration agreement. The Tripartite Agreement doesnot dischargethe earlier agreements. It is only a new arrangement forfulfilling the original payment obligations of the defendant under them.</p><p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The plaintiffâs case on the application is that the First and SecondAgreements were terminated on 28 June 2001 as a result ofnon-performance andrepudiation by the defendant, which the plaintiff accepted, and which led tothe commencement of the First Action.The Tripartite Agreement is a separateagreement entered into after termination. It is self-contained, different innature, and involvesan additional party. Even if it is intended to settle thedispute between the plaintiff and the defendant arising out of the FirstandSecond Agreements, it is still separate and distinct from them. It contains noprovision for arbitration; and such provisionsmust be in writing, by section2AC of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/341">Cap. 341</a>.</p><p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The defendantâs application was supported by an affirmation by itssolicitor. Later, and in reply to the affirmation by the plaintiffâsdirector,Mr Ng Lik Man, Mrs G&ouml;belâs affidavit was filed. It is convenient to deal withthe plaintiffâs evidence first.</p><p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> According to Mr Ng, the Tripartite Agreement was reached on about 24July 2001 and was in these terms:</p><blockquote><p>a) The defendantâs warehouse contained certain types and quantities ofwatch components. The defendant agreed that the plaintiffcould take thesecomponents to fulfil the purchase orders.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>b) The plaintiff would supply additional watch cases and watch bandsnecessary to fulfil the purchase orders.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>c) The plaintiff should purchase any outstanding watch components fromoutside sources at their own cost.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>d) The plaintiff would send all the watchbands, watch cases and other watchcomponents necessary to fulfil the purchase orders toa company designated bythe defendant, namely Fortunia Ltd to assemble watches to fulfil the purchaseorders.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>e) The plaintiff was to pay Fortunia directly for the assembly charges.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>f) Fossil and Fortunia should arrange among themselves the delivery ofcompleted watches.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>g) The defendant would invoice Fossil for the watches delivered and wasrequired to state on the invoices that payment was to be madeto the plaintiffdirectly.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>h) Fossil would arrange payment of the said invoices to the plaintiffdirectly, with the said payments to be used to set off all outstandingpaymentsowed by the defendant to the plaintiff.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>i) The Three Parties Agreement applies to all the purchase orders.</p></blockquote><p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> In support, Mr Ng exhibits a letter from the defendant dated 12 July2001 which contains the following:</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âYou are not willing to deliver goods ordered by usunless the payments of your invoices are made. The goods are needed to assemblewatches for our customer Fossil.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">1. We therefore propose thatyou take all the components from our warehouse which are necessay to completethe watches.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">2. After having completed thewatches they will be delivered to Fossil and invoiced by us. On the invoice wewill order Fossil topay to you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">3. After having received thepayments, you will pay the components to us and we will pay the supplier of thecomponents.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">4. The remaining money will beused for outstanding invoices, i.e. will be paid to you.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> He also exhibits a letter of 24 July 2001 from the defendant to Fossilcontaining the following:</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âNew Sound Industries will co-operate with us tofinish your outstanding POâs. New Sournd will produce and assemble the watchesand we will do after the production the final QC so that you can be sure toreceive the quality as before.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">We will right (sic) the invoices to you and mark oneach invoice to whom you should give the cheque for payment. This will be onlyNew Sound for the outstanding orders which we have today.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> There is also exhibited a letter from Fossil to the defendant dated 15November 2001 containing the following:</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âWe refer to your correspondence â¦â¦ requestingassistance in obtaining payment from us covering watches that were assembledonyour agreement by New Sound.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">As you are aware a verbal agreement was enteredinto by Fossil East, Meliga and New Sound that New Sound would assemble thewatchesthat were contracted by us with you and make delivery directly toFossil East. This arrangement required us to make payment directlyto New Sound.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">This verbal agreement re payment was confirmed inwriting by you as per your letter dated July 24<sup>th</sup> 2001 which clearlystated the following:-</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">âWe will right the invoices to you and mark on eachinvoice to whom you should give the cheque for payment. This will be only NewSound for the outstanding orders which we have today.â</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">In view of these clear instructions and to protectour interest we now need a letter from Meliga countersigned by New Sound or aletterfrom New Sound authorising us to make payment of all outstanding toMeliga (H.K) Ltd.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> According to Mrs G&ouml;bel the plaintiff wrongfully claimed for payment ofsome of the defendantâs supply orders by issuing thewrit for the purpose ofwithholding some of the watch bands and watch components which the defendantneeded for completing the purchaseorders from Fossil. In fact the plaintiffall along wanted to trade directly with many of the defendantâs customers,includingFossil.</p><p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The defendant instructed its solicitors to invite the plaintiff to referthe claim in the First Action to arbitration. It was agreedthat the actionshould be stayed. In the meantime the defendant sought to make alternativepayment arrangements. The defendant proposedthese in the letter dated 12 July2001. She says that it was quite clear from that letter that what the defendantproposed was anarrangement for payment of some of its supply orders to theplaintiff.</p><p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Mrs G&ouml;bel also exhibits the defendantâs letter to the plaintiff dated 11September 2001 which reads:</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âWe refer to the discussions and meetings duringthe last days and agree to settle the problems between our companied withoutanyprejudice but in trying to reach an amicable solution as follows:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">1. You are allowed to deliver all goods   ordered by Fossil according to the attached list directly to Fossil and   invoice alsodirectly to Fossil.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">2. After delivery of all these goods and receiving thepayment from Fossil there are no more financial claims of your side againstusas per today. The pending court case, where you claim (unjustified) about 4mill. HKD is withdrawn; we do not bear any cost.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">3. You delcare hereby to fulfil all outstanding SO-s[supply orders] and the duties resulting out of our contract without any delay.We have got the approval of Fossil and we are in negotiations with othercustomers as well.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">4. We see you in a clear breach of our contract; butwe try an amicable solution in order to avoid damages Our efforts do not meanthat we waive compensations for damages.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> This letter is said to record the agreement although its terms ratherappear to record an offer by the defendant to settle.</p><p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> In addition she exhibits a letter from the defendant to Fossil dated 10September 2001 in which the defendant asks for direct paymentof the disputedinvoices totalling US$100,910. It is to be noted that these invoices are alldated between 10 August and 27 August2001.</p><p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> According to both sides therefore it seems that the Tripartite Agreement(if such it was) came into being after its subject matterhad been dealt with.</p><p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a> provides:</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">â6. Court to refer matter to arbitration in certaincases</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) [notrelevant for present purposes], article 8 of the UNCITRAL Model Law(Arbitration agreementand substantive claim before court) applies to a matterthat is the subject of a domestic arbitration agreement in the same way asitapplies to a matter that is the subject of an international arbitrationagreement.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Article 8 of the UNCITRAL Model Law provides:</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âArticle 8.      Arbitrationagreement and substantive claim before court</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">(1)   A court before which an action is brought in amatter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party sorequests not later than when submitting his first statement on the substance ofthe dispute, refer the parties to arbitration unlessit finds that theagreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">(2)   Where an action referred to in paragraph (1) ofthis article has been brought, arbitral proceedings may nevertheless be commencedor continued, and an award may be made, while the issue is pending before thecourt.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The question here is whether the subject matter of the dispute in thisaction, i.e. the performance of the Tripartite Agreement,falls within theambit of the arbitration agreement in the two earlier contracts. It is not indispute that on an application fora stay in favour of arbitration the onus ison the applicant to demonstrate a âgood <i>prima facie</i> caseâ or a âplainlyarguable caseâ that an arbitration agreement existed and bound the parties; <i>PacificCrown Engineering Ltd v. Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co. Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%203%20HKC%20659" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003]3 HKC 659.</a> So the defendant must demonstrate a good prima facie case or plainlyarguable case that the performance of the Tripartite Agreement,falls withinthe ambit of the arbitration agreement. This is a matter of construction.</p><p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Looking at the Second Agreement as a whole (for it is not necessary tolook at the First Agreement, which was superseded by it)that is a contract bywhich the plaintiff is to manufacture âall products usually manufactured by[the plaintiff] in its factoriesin China, mainly watchbands and watchcasesâfor the defendant, and the defendant is to buy those products in âpriorityâ tothose of any other supplier except in certain restricted circumstances. Theseare provisions for payment on 40 daysâ credit. Thereis a provision alreadynoted for the term of the agreement. The rest is concerned with the minutiae ofmatters like quality controland labelling.</p><p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> The arbitration agreement in clause 10 is simply that âall disputesâ areto be referred to arbitration if they cannot be amicablysettled. This is verywide. In Re Hohenzollern A.G  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281886%29%2054%20LT%20596" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1886) 54 LT 596</a>, Lord Esher M.R. interpreted âalldisputesâ as meaning âall disputes which may arise between the parties inconsequence ofthis contract having been entered intoâ. I think it isequivalent to a clause containing such words as âall disputes in relationtoâor âin connection withâ the contract. Ma J, as he then was, in <i>Getwick EngineersLtd v. Pilecon Engineering Ltd,</i> HCA No. 558 of 2002, unreported, at para.23(2) said:</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âWhere the words âin connection withâ are used,while every contract must of course be construed in accordance with itsordinaryand natural meaning (and arbitration agreements are no exception), itseems to me that they are wide in nature. They would in generalcover alldisputes other than one entirely unrelated to the transaction covered by thecontract in question: see <i>Mustill &amp; Boyd : Commercial Arbitration, </i>2<sup>nd</sup>Edition, at 119.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Counsel referred me to various cases in which e.g. a new contractbetween the same parties had been held to be subject to arbitrationprovisionsin an earlier contract (<i>Faghirzadeh v. Rudolf Wolff (SA) (Pty) Ltd</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%201%20QB%20630" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 1 QB 630)</a> or a clause providing for arbitration of âany dispute arisingduring execution of this charterpartyâ was held to cover a claimfor damages intort arising out of the arrest of the vessel after the execution of thecharterparty where there was sufficientlyclose connection between that claimand the contractual dispute (<i>Astro Vencedor Compania Naviera S.A v. mabanaftG.m.b.H</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%202%20QB%20267" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 2 QB 267.</a> But as Evans J pointed out in <i>Overseas UnionInsurance Ltd v. AA Mutual International Insurance Co. Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20QB%2063" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 QB 63</a>at 66, the question is always one of construction, giving the words of thearbitration clause their natural and proper meaning inthe circumstances of thecase, and</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âThis means in turn that reported decisions inearlier cases, even of high authority, cannot necessarily be binding in latercases,unless exceptionally the relevant words and all the relevantcircumstance sare the same in both cases. Even then, the binding natureof theearlier decision would only become relevant if the Court in the later case, if unaidedby authority would reach a contraryconclusion as to the natural and propermeaning of the words in question.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> In the instant case the Tripartite Agreement arose after the plaintiffhad, through solicitors, purported to accept the defendantâswrongfulrepudiation of the Second Agreement. Reference is made to the First Agreementbut I accept that the solicitors must havemeant the Second Agreement whichsuperseded it. The Tripartite Agreement was oral though evidenced by somecorrespondence. Thereis no provision for arbitration, which would have to bein writing in any event, though the parties, in making the First and SecondAgreements without the benefit of legal advice, had manged to includearbitration clauses.</p><p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> An arbitration clause will still bind the parties even if one of themasserts that circumstances have arisen which discharges oneor both partiesfrom subsequent liability under the contract, such as repudiation by one partyaccepted by the other; <i>Heyman &amp; Another v. Darwins Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1942%5d%20AC%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1942] AC 356(H.L.)(E.).</a> But that must necessarily apply to a dispute which arises inrespect of or with regard to, or under the contract.</p><p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> It is true that Tripartite Agreement was made, not for the supply ofwatch cases and watch bands by the plaintiff to the defendantbut was for theplaintiff to make up watches, partly at its own expense and partly at that ofthe defenant, in that some of the latterâscomponents were to be used. Thewatches were to go to the third party in satisfaction of its orders to thedefendant and the plaintiffwas to get the price of them. The exercise wasintended to provide some reduction of the defendantâs indebtedness to theplaintiff(under both the First and the Second Agreements, or so it appearsfrom the schedule to the solicitorsâ letter) though it is notclear whether itwas intended to cover that indebtedness completely.</p><p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> I think the facts have to be viewed in this way. The defendant owned theplaintiff money. It did not have money, but it did havewatch components. So itgave the plaintiff the components so that the plaintiff could make up watches,sell them direct to the defendantâscustomer, and take the proceeds insettlement or part settlement of the defendantâs debt to it. But on thedefendantâs case thedebt has been settled by this means.</p><p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> It will be impossible for the court to decide whether or not thedefendant should arrange for Fossil to pay the five invoices tothe plaintiff,without deciding first what, if anything, the defendant still owes to theplaintiff for the supply orders issued underthe First and Second Agreements.This will require an examination not only of what invoices were outstanding butalso what was thevalue of the watch components which the defendant handed overto the plaintiff and how much the plaintiff put in, to make the watchesforwhich Fossil was invoiced. The whole dispute in this action seems to me to bevery closely connected with the two Agreementsand indeed to arise out of thosetwo Agreements. It seems to me to arise as a consequence of those twoagreements having been enteredinto.</p><p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> It follows that this action should be stayed in favour of arbitration.There will be an order in terms of the defendantâs summons.Since this rulingis to be handed down the costs order will be <i>nisi</i>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><table border=0 width="100%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tr>  <td width="50%" valign=top>    </td>  <td width="50%" valign=top>  <p style="text-align:center">(signed)<br>  (G.P.
