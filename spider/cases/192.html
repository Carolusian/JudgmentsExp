style="text-align:center">______________________________________</p>    <p style="text-align:center"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Introduction:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  On 8 March 2007, I handed down judgment in this matter.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  In paragraph 21, when dealing with the background facts, I recorded that Mr Clark was a director of ISG.  However, in paragraph82, when dealing with the liability of Mr Clark under the cause of action based upon the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a>, I recorded that Mr Clark was not a director of ISG.  I then proceeded to reach a conclusion that, as a consequence of that fact,no reasonable cause of action was disclosed against Mr Clark in that respect.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  My conclusion was plainly based upon a false premise.  Mr Smith, for Mr Clark, is obliged to accept that Mr Clark was a directorof ISG, as was pleaded in paragraphs 18 and 36 of the original statement of claim, those pleas continuing in the draft amended statementof claim, as paragraphs 16 and 33.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  My attention was drawn to that error by the solicitors for the plaintiffs.  I heard from Mr Bedford, and Mr Clarkâs solicitorson 15 March 2007, and indicated to them that I was minded to recall the judgment and to correct the error.  I invited submissionson that proposition.  At the request of Mr Clarkâs solicitors I adjourned the matter to 23 March 2007, in order that Mr Clark maybe represented by counsel.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Jurisdiction to correct the error:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The judgement has not yet been sealed.  Both Mr Bedford and Mr Smith accept that I have power to recall the judgment and to correctthe error.  If authority is required for the proposition it may be found in <i>Re Harrison</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%201%20Ch%20260" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] 1 Ch 260</a>, applied in Hong Kong in <i>Bank of India v Murjani &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%202%20HKLR%20585" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 2 HKLR 585.</a>  Both counsel agreed that in the particular circumstances of this case the proper course that I should follow is to correct the error,and then conduct the appropriate analysis of Mr Clarkâs position in the light of the correct factual situation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The consequences of the correction of the error:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Mr Smith argues that notwithstanding the correction of the error, the conclusion reached should be the same.  Mr Bedford says thatthe statement of claim, asserting as it does that Mr Clark was a director of ISG, means that there must be a cause of action disclosedagainst Mr Clark under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The essential paragraph upon which the plaintiffs must rely to establish an assertion of liability on the part of any of the defendantsunder the statutory tort created by the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a> was paragraph 7 of the original statement of claim, now paragraph 6 of the draft amended statement of claim.  The paragraph is essentialto the cause of action because it establishes the assertion of a duty that is allegedly owed to the plaintiffs, by the defendantsto be charged with the cause of action. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  It is useful to set out the two paragraphs in their original and amended forms, (the amendments in bold).</p>    <p style="text-align:left">Original form:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">Further to the above duties, at all material times the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants were under statutory duties vis-Ã -vis the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs by virtue of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333">Cap 333</a> directly or through their agents:</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Amended form:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">Further to the above duties, at all material times the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>  <b>and 7<sup>th</sup></b> Defendants were under statutory duties vis-Ã -vis the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs by virtue <b>of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 8</a></b> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335">Cap <b>335</a></b> directly or through their agents:</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">It will immediately be seen that, notwithstanding the amendment, there is no reference at all to Mr Clark, the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant, in the claim based upon Protection of Investors liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In the course of the original argument Mr Bedford set out in a document, given to me and to all other parties, the paragraphs ofthe draft amended statement of claim which he said identified the factual basis for the various claims.  At the same time he identifiedthe various causes of action relating to the various prayers for relief.  Prayer 2, he said was the cause of action under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a>.  Mr Bedford said that the statutory tort claim was brought against all defendants, and relied upon the following paragraphs of thedraft amended statement of claim upon which he relied to substantiate that prayer for relief: 1-7, 12-17, 24-25, 35-40, 47, 49 and50.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The involvement of Mr Clark in prayer 2 is by amendment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In the course of the argument I pressed Mr Bedford as to whether or not he sought to further amend the draft amended statement ofclaim by including Mr Clark in those persons against whom he alleged a statutory duty under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a>.  Mr Bedford specifically and clearly did not seek any such amendment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a>, by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 8(3)</a>, imposes liability on a director of a company, who has not personally made a negligent representation, by way of rebuttable presumption. For a plaintiff to succeed against such a director, he need only establish an appropriate negligent representation inducing himto enter into an agreement, and that that representation was made by some other director or employee of the company.  That established,liability is presumed against the other directors, a burden then falling on those other directors to establish that they have neithercaused nor authorised the representation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  It must always be open to plaintiff who seeks to bring a cause of action based upon the statutory tort to make a sensible assessment,prior to commencing his proceedings, as to whether or not he wishes to draw into those proceedings all of the directors of the company,other than the person who has actually made the representation upon which reliance was placed.  A sensible plaintiff will look atthe burden on those other directors to rebut the presumption, and may well say to himself that those other directors may easily meetthat burden.  He may then, sensibly, elect not to bring them into the action, in order to avoid the risk of costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In this respect I note particularly that the plaintiffs, while issuing the writ against the 6<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> defendants, have elected not to pursue any claims further against them.  I am told by Mr Bedford that Ms Barber and Mr Scott-Lawswere directors of Barber Asia, against whom a Protection of Investors liability claim is also made: see paragraph 61 of the draftamended statement of claim.  Mr Bedford tells me that the writ has not been served on them and they have now been dismissed fromthe action with the plaintiffsâ consent.  Notwithstanding the fact that they are directors, no claim is made against them.  Theplain inference is that the plaintiffs are satisfied that they would be able to rebut the presumption.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The references to Mr Clark in the statement of claim:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The draft amended statement of claim refers to Mr Clark in paragraph 12.  That plea, added by amendment, is clearly a plea directedat establishing <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability on the part of Mr Clark, a cause of action which I have rejected as far as he is concerned.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  He is referred to in paragraph 16, the plea being effectively merely a formal plea that Mr Clark was a director of ISG.  Paragraph33 of the draft amended statement of claim, (a paragraph not relied upon for the statutory tort), repeats the assertion that Mr Clarkwas a director of ISG and says further that he was actively involved in the FSLP project.  The clear purpose of the paragraph isto establish a basis to assert a conflict of interest impacting upon advice given to the plaintiffs.  The paragraph plainly relatesto <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability.  Paragraph 35, into which Mr Clark is added by amendment, again plainly relates principally to <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Mr Clark is referred to in paragraph 36, which is a plea of evidence, and is not relied upon for the statutory tort.  He is addedto paragraph 41, (not relied upon), but this is merely an irrelevant plea of evidence of events occurring after the acts upon whichany liability may be based.  He is added to paragraph 49, a plea, not of a representation, but of a fact, namely that no guaranteewas in place.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  He is referred to in paragraph 55, by amendment, a paragraph which is not relied upon for the statutory tort, and which clearlyrelates to the claim in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> liability.  References to Mr Clark in paragraphs 57 and 58 of the draft amended statement of claim are irrelevant allegations relatingto events and circumstances after the acts upon which liability might be based, and do not assist.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Discussion:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Having regard to the way in which the pleading has been drawn, and the deliberate decision not to include Mr Clark in the fundamentalallegation contained in paragraphs 6 of the draft amended statement of claim, that a duty is owed to the plaintiffs, I am drivento the conclusion that the cause of action under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a> liability cannot be construed to have been pleaded against Mr Clark.  For a plea under the statutory tort to be successful theremust be a clear pleading imposing a duty on the defendant.  Where the ordinance is specifically pleaded, as is here, and a directoris omitted from those defendants upon whom the duty is alleged, the clear inference is that the pleader does not bring the actionagainst the director who was omitted.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The other references to Mr Clark in the draft amended statement of claim, all other claims against him having gone, merely formwhat was described by Nourse LJ in <i>Balfour Beattie Construction Ltd v Parsons Brown and Newton Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%207%20Construction%20Law%20Journal%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 7 Const LJ 205</a> at 213, as</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âpart of the background narrative and (it) not essential to the claims which are ultimately madeâ. </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">The essence of Mr Bedfordâs submission was to repeat his assertion that, so long as defendant has been named in respect of a causeof action, any other cause of action may be pleaded against him at any time, even if that additional cause of action required thepleading of additional facts, a proposition which I have rejected.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  I reject Mr Bedfordâs proposition that the inclusion of Mr Clark in prayer 2 of the prayers for relief is sufficient to make itclear that Protection of Investors Liability is sought against Mr Clark.  A prayer for relief is a consequence of the pleas madein the statement of claim, and cannot add anything to allegations in the statement of claim.  If the content of the allegations inthe statement of claim does not disclose a reasonable cause of action against a party, they are not improved by merely adding thatparty to a prayer for relief.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Conclusion:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Accordingly, for different reasons, I conclude that the draft amended statement does not disclose a reasonable cause of action againstMr Clark under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/335" class="autolink_findacts">Protection of Investors Ordinance</a>.  Mr Clark succeeds in having that claim against him struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The order made for costs in paragraph 118 of the judgment of 8 March 2007, stands.  I accept Mr Bedfordâs submission that in thelight of the circumstances in which the hearings on 15 March and 23 March 2007, arose, there should be no order for costs in respectof those two days.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center" height="15"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center" height="15">(John Saunders)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance<br />            High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Nigel Bedford, instructed by Messrs Weir &amp; Associates, for the Plaintiffs</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Clifford Smith, SC, instructed by Messrs Tanner de Witt, for the 5<sup>th</sup> Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p style="text-align: left"> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2007/283.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
