At the present hearing the plaintiff seeks interlocutory injunctions for protectionof its rights pending trial.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The plaintiff has operated for a number of years in Hung Hom as a seller and dealer in leaves, ginseng and dried seafood. In 1989it pleads that the interior layout, furniture and fittings, decor and signboard of the Hung Hom shop were re-constructed accordingto certain conceptual designs. These designs were produced by one Lee Kwok Chu, a well-known "fung shui" expert, whom the plaintiffcommissioned to do so. The property in the designs was then assigned by Mr Lee to the plaintiff in June 1989. For the purpose ofthese proceedings, none of this is contested .</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> It is also undisputed that in June 1990 the plaintiff opened another shop in Tsuen Wan based on the said designs, and that the 1stdefendant was employed in that shop and the Hung Hom shop successively from June 1990 to June 1991.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The plaintiff pleads that the defendants have now opened a shop in Hung Hom, very close to its own, with similar design, similarfixtures and fittings, and trading in similar goad. This is said to infringe the plaintiff's copyright in the design drawings usedfor its own shops.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The plaintiff also pleads the use by the defendants in the course of their business of decorated red transparent plastic containerssimilar in style o those used by the plaintiff. This, coupled with the similar decor and layout of the defendants' shop, is saidto be calculated to lead to confusion in public perception between the respective goods and businesses of the plaintiff and the defendants.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> There are therefore two causes of action, breach of copyright and passing-off, for which the plaintiff seeks both damages and injunctions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The summons seeking interlocutory relief was issued on 1st August 1991, shortly after the plaintiff claimed to have become awareof the defendants' shop. This summons, and a subsequent amendment of 9th August which was not formally filed, sought injunctive reliefon a prohibitory basis only. However, the re-amended summons now before me, which was filed on 5th September 1991, seeks both mandatoryand prohibitory injunctions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The mandatory relief sought in the summons comprises the demolition of the existing decoration of the defendants' shop. However,at the hearing the plaintiff suggested that this relief be limited to altering the predominant red colour of the signboard and theterraced display counters, and to altering the terraced and open effect of the counters themselves. It is these factors which apparentlymost resemble the decor of the plaintiff's Hung Hom shop and which hence most offend the plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In addition to the mandatory relief, the plaintiff also seeks two orders restraining both the infringement of the design drawingsand the use of similar packaging to that of the plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> For the principles applicable to prohibitory injunctive relief at the interlocutory stage, I turn to the analysis of Lord Diplockin <u>American Cyanamid Co. v. Ethicon Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 396.</a> These have been summarised as:-</p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">1.</td>            <td width="4%"></td>            <td width="83%">                The plaintiff must establish a good arguable claim to the right he seeks to protects;                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">2.</td>            <td width="4%"></td>            <td width="83%">                In so doing, the plaintiff must only establish a serious question for trial and the question itself is not decidedby the court at this stage.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">3.</td>            <td width="4%"></td>            <td width="83%">If the plaintiff does establish a serious issue for trial, then the court's discretion to award the injunction will rest on the balanceof convenience.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Whilst mandatory injunctions have long been accepted as available on interlocutory application, they have met greater resistancethan prohibitory injunctions. The good practical reasons for this were discussed by Megarry J. in <u>Shepherd homes Ltd. v. Sandham</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20Ch%20340" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 Ch 340</a> at page 348:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"By granting a prohibitory injunction the court does no more than prevent for the future the continuance or repetition of the conductof which the plaintiff complains. The injunction does not attempt to deal with what has happened in the past; that is left for thetrial, to be dealt with by damages or otherwise. On the other hand a mandatory injunction tends at least in part to look to the past,in that it is often a means of undoing what has been done, so far as that is possible. Furthermore, whereas a prohibitory injunctionmerely requires abstention from acting, a mandatory injunction requires the taking of positive steps and may require the dismantlingor destruction of something already erected or constructed. This will result in a consequent waste of time, money and materials ifit is ultimately established that the defendant is entitled to retain the erection."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The learned Judge went on to point out that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"....if a mandatory injunction is granted on motion, there will normally be no question of granting a further mandatory injunctionat the trial; what is done is done and the plaintiff has on motion obtained, once and for all, the demolition or destruction thathe seeks. Where the injunction is prohibitory, however, there will often still be a question at the trial whether the injunctionshould be dissolved or continued; except in relation to transient events, there will usually be no question of the plaintiff havingobtained on motion all that he seeks."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> I have quoted these passages at length as they contain much that is apposite to the present case. The mandatory relief is by farthe most significant of the three orders sought by the plaintiff. It requires, even in its limited form now proposed, the demolitionof important parts of the defendants' premises, with unavoidable expenditure and disruption to business meanwhile. It is a drasticremedy, and the principles on which it is to be applied have provoked a difference of opinion between counsel for the two parties.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Megarry J.'s decision in <u>Shepherd</u> preceeded <u>American Cyanamid</u>, a factor which has led Mr Pow for the plaintiff to argue that the earlier decision has lost some force. Mr Chow on the other handargues that the <u>American Cyanamid</u> decision has not at all had that effect and cites the final paragraph of commentary 29/1/5 to Volume 1 of the Supreme Court Practice-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The <u>Cyanamid</u> guidelines are not relevant to mandatory injunctions. The case has to be unusually strong and clear before a mandatory injunctionwill be granted at the interlocutory stage even if it is sought in order to enforce a contractual obligation."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The necessary inference is that this principle will be all the stronger when the remedy sought is based on an action in tort.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Mr Chow finds material support for his view in the judgment of Mustill L.J. in <u>Locabail International Finance Ltd. v. Agroexport</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%201%20WLR%20657" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 1 W.L.R. 657</a> at page 664-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It was pointed out in argument that the judgment of Megarry J. antedates the comprehensive view of the law as to injunctions ....in <u>American Cyanamid</u> .... but to my mind at least, the statement of principle by Megarry J. in relation to the very special case of the mandatory injunctionis not affected by what the House of Lords said in the <u>Cyanamid</u> case. The matter before the Court is not only an application for a mandatory injunction, but is an application for a mandatory injunctionwhich, if granted, would amount to the grant of a major part of the relief claimed in the action. Such an application should be approachedwith caution and the relief granted only in a clear case."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> This would seem to end the matter, however shortly thereafter in a judgment, if I may say so, of great perception Hoffmann J. distinguishedthe earlier cases in introducing a more flexible approach. The case is <u>Films Rover Ltd. v. Cannon Film Sales Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20WLR%20670" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 W.L.R. 670</a> and it warrants careful consideration.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Hoffmann J. was there also considering an application for an interlocutory mandatory injunction, which arose in that case out ofa contractual obligation. In noting the view of Mustill L.J. that Megarry J's decision in <u>Shepherd</u> was unaffected by <u>American Cyanamid</u>, he nontheless drew a distinction between statements of principle and mere guidelines, He agreed that there was no inconsistencybetween the two cases, but found that Megarry J. intended his approach to provide guidelines only.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Megarry J's test obliged the court considering an interlocutory mandatory injunction to feel "a high degree of assurance" that atthe trial the injunction would prove to be rightly granted. The standard here is higher than that required for a prohibitory injunction.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> However Hoffmann J. decided in <u>Rover Films</u> that the "high degree of assurance" was a guidline in "a normal case" - using the words with which Megarry J. prefaced his formulation.There were moreover "exceptional" cases to which the guideline did not apply. He pointed out that the courtâs dilemma in an interlocutorysituation was that any injunction, prohibitory or mandatory, risked, in the outcome of the trial, being wrong. He went on to say-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A fundamental principle is therefore that the court should take whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice ifit should turn out to have been "wrong" in the sense I have described. The guidelines for the grant of both kinds of interlocutoryinjunction are derived from this principle."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The learned judge than reconciled his approach with that of Megarry J. He pointed out that the features of a mandatory injunctionwould, at the interlocutory stage, usually carry a greater risk of injustice in its granting rather than in its withholding. By thishe was no doubt referring to positive acts, such as demolition, which would often accompany a mandatory injunction, as opposed tothe mere passive restraint of its prohibitory counterpart. To overcome this greater degree of risk, Hoffmann J. said the court shouldhave to feel Magarry J.'s "high degree of assurance" of the plaintiff's likely success at the trial, unless the case was within hisown "exceptional" category.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Where Hoffmann J. appears to have taken the formulation further is in defining his "exceptional" category and in eschewing the "barren... semantic arguments" over classifying injunctions as mandatory or prohibitory. He said that the question of substance was whetherthe granting of the injunction would carry that higher risk of injustice normally associated with the grant of a mandatory injunction.He continued -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If it appears to the court that, exceptionally, the case is one in which withholding a mandatory injunction would in fact carry agreater risk of injustice than granting it even though the court does not feel "a high degree of assurance" about the plaintiff'schances of establishing his right, there cannot be any rational basis for withholding the injunction."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> With respect, this emphasis on the balance of the risk of injustice must be the correct approach. The presence or absence of the"high degree of assurance'' is merely a factor in the "exceptional" case in deciding which way the balance should tilt. Nor is thisinconsistent with the <u>American Cyanamid</u> approach as Lord Diplock's formulation did not differentiate between prohibitory and mandatory injunctions and the case itself concernedonly the former.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> I have sought to analyse the approach at some length as I wish to make clear the basis on which I rest my decision on the applicationfor mandatory relief. I shall relate this later to the various factors emerging from the particular facts of the case .</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> In considering the claims for both breach of copyright and passing-off I have been directed in particular to the plans and photographsof the respective premises appearing as annexures to Lau King-fai's first affirmation. The final draft of the design drawings isat annexure L.2 and the interior layout and photographs of the plaintiff's premises at L.3 and L.4. The defendants' premises areshown in plan and its shelves in cross-section at L.6, with photographs of the premises at L.7.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The approach to be adopted in copyright actions was summarised by Lord Wilberforce in <u>L.B. Plastics Ltd. v. Swish Products Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20RPC%20551" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] RPC 551</a> at page 619 :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"There can be no copyright in a mere idea, so if all that the respondents had done was to take ... the appellants' .... idea, or anyother idea implicit in their work, the appellants could not complain. Nor is there infringement, if a person arrives by independentwork at a substantially similar result to that sought to be protected. The protection given by the law of copyright is against copying,the basis of the protection being that one man must not be permitted to appropriate the result of another's labour. That copyinghas taken place is for the plaintiff to establish and prove as a fact. The beginning of the necessary proof normally lies in theestablishment of similarity combined with proof of access to the plaintiff's productions."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>These comments were of course made in the context of deciding the final issue on appeal. The test at the interlocutory stage, at leastfor prohibitory relief, is merely that of establishing a serious issue for trial. To that extent, Lord Wilberforce's observationis particularly apposite when he says that "the beginning of the necessary proof" is normally found in "similarity combined withproof of access."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> The 1st defendant was employed by the plaintiff for some months in the Hung Hom shop, during which he undoubtedly had access to thephysical representation of the design drawings. Moreover there is evidence that the 1st defendant and two other persons visited theHung Hom shop in early June and without permission took measurements and made notes. This appears from the affirmation of Chan KamKee, a salesman in the plaintiff's employ, who had known the 1st defendant as a colleague in the Hung Hom shop for the previous 6months. This evidence is disputed by the 1st defendant, but it nontheless raises an issue.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The 1st defendant's access to the plaintiff's premises is therefore established as a certainty by his recent employment with theplaintiff. It is taken further and given greater significance by the disputed evidence of the measuring exercise in early June. Shouldthe plaintiff establish an issue on the question of similarity, the serious issue for trial would appear to be established as tocopyright, assuming the design drawings are protected property. It would also be a major step in establishing an issue as to passing-off.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> It is not disputed by the defendants that the design drawings are artistic works, they are therefore capable of attracting the protectionsought by the plaintiff. The defendants however deny that the plaintiff has established even an arguable case of breach of copyright.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Section 3(5) of the 1956 Copyright Act (which applies to Hong Kong) protects an artistic work by, inter alia, restricting the reproductionof the work "in any material form". Section 9(8) of the Act deals with the reproduction into 3-dimensional form of 2-dimensionaldrawings, as is evidently the case here. Whilst conferring the protection of the Act in such circumstances, the subsection does howeverrestrict the protection to 3-dimensional reproductions which can be perceived by a non-expert to resemble the original. Expert evidenceis therefore irrelevant in applying this test.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> This subsection is relied on by the defendants and is pleaded at paragraph 16 of the defence. It is important to realise howeverthat the subsection is of little value at the interlocutory stage. Firstly, the subsection is a defence and must be pleaded and provedby the defendants. It therefore only arises on the establishment by the plaintiff of what would otherwise be an infringement. Thesubsection is therefore virtually useless when the question to be decided is whether or not there is an issue for trial. If the defencecalls in aid subsection 9(8), there inevitably will be an issue for trial. Secondly, the non-expert who decides the issue on theappearance of the reproduction will anyway be the judge, who will apply the same principles of common sense as he would without thesubsection. He is merely deprived of the use of expert evidence.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> I emphasise that it is not my function at this stage to decide complicated matters of law and resolve conflicts on the affidavits.I have to be satisfied that the plaintiff has an issue which is suitable for trial. The plaintiff must show an arguable case thatthe defendants have substantially reproduced the protected drawings in whole or in part. Moreover, in considering the defendants'3-dimensional reproduction, the comparison should be with the original design drawings and not with the plaintiff's own shop.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Mr Pow for the plaintiff has drawn my attention to nine points of similarity between the defendants' shop and the Hung Hom shop ofthe plaintiff. I will restrict these similarities to five which are significant enough for consideration and relate them to the plaintiff'sdesign drawings. The similarities are -</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">1.</td>            <td width="5%"></td>            <td width="83%">                The design relates to a cornershop; the defendants' shop is also a cornershop.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">2.</td>            <td width="5%"></td>            <td width="83%">                The design of the plaintiff's shop and the defendants' shop are both open on two sides.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">3.</td>            <td width="5%"></td>            <td width="83%">                They both have terraced open shelves (called "step-ladder" in the plaintiff's drawing at L.2.) facing the streetat the entrance on the longer of the two sides.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">4.</td>            <td width="5%"></td>            <td width="83%">                They both have large signboards with a red base and golden characters.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">5.</td>            <td width="5%"></td>            <td width="83%">The decor in the defendants' shop and that contemplated by the drawings are both of a predominant red colour.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Mr Chow for the defendants has attacked these similarities in considerable depth and detail and has shown a number of differencesbetween the defendants' shop and the proposals in the drawings. He has also correctly emphasised that it is the drawings that areprotected and not the idea. Thus the idea of a large red signboard with gold lettering is not protected, it is the outward expressionof that concept as originally expressed in the protected drawings. Again, if the 1st defendant has reached a similar conclusion tothe plaintiff in terms of outward expression merely from observation of an idea, but with his own independent creative effort, thatwould not be a breach of copyright. In this regard the 1st defendant says at paragraph 10 of his first affirmation that -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The interior layout and decoration of the (defendants') shop was worked out by consultation between myself and the decorator calledWong Yui Wing. Some of our ideas naturally came from our day to day experience of the usual manner in which such shops are beingdecorated."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This reflects the principle that there is no property in an idea, however it is noteworthy that the decorator himself has not givenevidence.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> In comparing the plaintiff's design drawings at exhibit L.2 with the photographs and plan of the defendants' premises at L.7 andL.6 I conclude that there is a marked similarity overall. It is the overall similarity which is the important factor and in thisregard I particularly note the terraced display counters, which the defence has not adequately dealt with.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> Once the similarity is established and is combined with the 1st defendant's proof of access, it is incumbent on the defence adequatelyto explain how the similarity arose independently of the plaintiff's drawings. The defendants may be able to explain this at thetrial, but the explanation so far given is insufficient.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> I therefore find that the plaintiff has made out a serious issue to be tried and the question of the prohibitory injunction fallsto be resolved on the balance of convenience. The injunction sought is the second in the re-amended summons and it has no bearingon the status quo at the defendants' existing shop. Its effect would be confined to preventing the defendants from copying the plaintiff'sdesigns in the future. For that reason the balance of convenience is very much in favour of granting the injunction and I make theorder in the terms sought. I shall consider the mandatory injunction later.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The basis of the passing-off action is the substantial similarity in design and decoration of the two shops, coupled with the similarityof the goods sold and the wrappings used for customers. The reputation of the plaintiff's business is also relied on and it is notdisputed that the Hung Hom shop has attracted a considerable clientele, nor that the goods traded in the two shops are substantiallysimilar. The likelihood of confusion in the minds of members of the public between the two businesses is the wrong for which theplaintiff seeks redress. In proving its case, the plaintiff does not have to show that the defendants' business is thought by thepublic to be the plaintiff's. It is sufficient if the plaintiff can show an overall impression that the defendants' business is relatedto the plaintiff's business, and thereby a likely poaching of goodwill by the defendants.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The passing-off action on its own relates, for the purposes of this hearing, only to the third item of relief sought, namely therestraint on the use of the similar wrappings. The similar decor of the two premises is adduced with these wrappings to show a possibilityof confusion in the mind of the typical Hung Hom shopper.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> That there is a marked similarity between the wrappings, or boxes, in terms of size, colour and design is readily apparent. The defencehowever has shown that such designs are of common usage and has produced samples from other retailers to illustrate its argument.The red colour and the size and shape of the boxes I accept to be of frequent use. The theme of a ribbon design with a bow in thecorner is also common to all those produced, although not in identical terms. I conclude therefore that in the boxes themselves thereis no particular goodwill requiring protection and hence no confusion in public perception. The confusion may arise only when theboxes are taken together with the decor of the shop.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> At this stage I will digress to consider the mandatory injunction, as the outcome of the relief claimed in the issue of the boxeswill be affected by this larger issue.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The plaintiff has established, on my finding, a serious issue for trial on the breach of copyright claim. Whilst the <u>American Cyanamid</u> principles do not expressly apply to interlocutory mandatory injunctions, it would hardly be possible to consider mandatory reliefif the "serious issue" threshold had not been passed. The next stage, on Hoffmann J's analysis, is to consider whether the case is"exceptional", or merely "normal", when the Megarry guidelines of a "high degree of assurance" of eventual success will be required.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> The argument for the plaintiff is the continuing damage to its business by what it claims to be the defendants' unlawful use of itsprotected designs. This will, it argues, produce unquantifiable damages as some loss of turnover could be ascribed to the legitimatecompetition of the defendantsâ shop even if designed on a totally dissimilar basis. What the plaintiff seeks is to limit its lostturnover to that emanating from fair competition and to exclude what arises from breach of copyright and/or passing-off.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> The defendants' argument against a mandatory injunction at this stage is that it is a drastic remedy, expensive to the defendant,and moreover pre-supposes the major part of the relief sought at the trial.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> In deciding whether or not the plaintiff's position should be protected by a mandatory injunction, I derive the basis for the exerciseof discretion from Hoffmann J. in <u>Rover Films</u>. In assessing the balance of the risk of injustice he appears to have relied on four factors. These are -</p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">1.</td>            <td width="5%"></td>            <td width="83%">                The ease with which the order may be formulated in enforceable form.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">2.</td>            <td width="5%"></td>            <td width="83%">                Whether or not the mandatory order would cause uncompensatable loss to the defendant if it were eventually to win.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">3.</td>            <td width="5%"></td>            <td width="83%">                Whether or not the failure to grant the order would cause loss to the plaintiff which would be difficult to quantifyin the case of its eventual success.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">4.</td>            <td width="5%"></td>            <td width="83%">Which is to be considered the status quo pending trial, the plaintiff's circumstances or the defendants'?</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p>I shall deal with these factors individually, noting that they would apply only if the facts of the case could also place it withinthe "exceptional" category.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> The ease of formulating the order in enforceable form depends very much on the court. I am not bound by the terms of the order sought,even in its limited form, and the order should be in the minimum terms consistent with the plaintiff's protection.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> The loss to the defendant may again be kept to a minimum by the nature of the order. The main source of loss would not be the costof the decoration itself, but the disruption to trade caused by the necessary work. If the redecoration is kept to the minimum consistentwith the plaintiff's protection, the effect on the business could be small and easily compensated by the cross-undertaking.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> I am satisfied that the plaintiff would suffer an unquantifiable loss in the event of its eventual success. This is not only becauseof the difficulty of distinguishing recoverable loss from loss from fair competition, but also because the loss is presently open-ended.The pleadings have only just been closed and the case is unlikely to be heard before the end of 1992, possibly later.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> The final factor according to Hoffmann J. is that of the status quo; the impetus necessarily being to preserve rather than otherwise.In this I find the advantage to be with the plaintiff insofar as its business had been trading for sometime prior to the openingof the defendants' shop. The status quo of the defendants relates to a mere two months prior to the amendment of the plaintiff'ssummons to include mandatory relief.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> The balance of the risk of injustice is therefore very much in the plaintiff's favour. There is however a further factor materialto the "exceptional" nature of the case to be found in the nature of the prohibitory relief already granted. This relief, expressedat paragraph 2 of the amended summons, is very nearly useless to the plaintiff. It would presumably protect him from any attemptby the defendants to open another similar shop, but as to the defendants' present shop it affords no protection whatsoever. Thisis an unusual situation which I find brings the plaintiff within Hoffmann J.'s "exceptional" category even without the "high degreeof assurance" formulated by Megarry J. in <u>Shepherd</u>. I find that it calls for mandatory relief in the plaintiff's favour even at the interlocutory stage. This should however be so framedas to minimise expense and disruption to the defendants' business.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> It is the red signboard and the predominant red colour in the defendants' fixtures which I find to be fundamental to the possibleinfringement of the plaintiff`s rights. This is the case whether the copyright or the passing-off action is considered, as I alsofind sufficient similarity to warrant relief on the latter basis, granted the plaintiff's established business reputation.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> The plaintiff has offered a limited mandatory injunction embracing the signboard, the red fittings and the terraced open displaydrawers. The last named could however only be altered at greater expense and disruption to the plaintiff's business than I considerto be justified. There will therefore be a mandatory injunction directed to the defendants in the following terms-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"That the defendants do so alter the existing decoration of shop 99K(1), Ground Floor, Dock Street, Whampoa Estate, Hunghom, Kowloon,as to eliminate the red colour of the signboard and of the plastic fittings of the display drawers in the said shop."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> I have yet to make an order as to paragraph 3 of the amended summons, concerning the plastic wrappings. Insofar as these may haveinfringed the plaintiff's rights, this can only be in conjunction with the similarity of the decor of the two businesses. The mandatoryinjunction will serve to remove any connection between the decor and the plastic wrappings and the latter do not warrant protectionon their own. In the event paragraph 3 of the summons is dismissed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> I have already granted prohibitory relief in the terms sought at paragraph 2 of the summons. In respect of that and the mandatoryrelief now granted, there will of course be the usual cross-undertakings from the plaintiff. As the plaintiff has been substantiallysuccessful, there will be an order for costs in its favour.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(N.L.R.
