After his death he was foundto be a rich man having an estate of more than HK$180 million.  Under the laws of intestacy in Hong Kong, the persons entitled tohis estate comprised of his relatives living in Shanghai in the Mainland. They included a surviving brother Cai Guo Xiang (âCaiâ)and the surviving children of the deceasedâs brothers and sisters.  Two women also claimed to have an interest in the deceasedâsestate, namely, Madam Wong Siu Mui (also known as Ng Kwan Ying (âWongâ) who claimed to be his lawful wife and Madam Elsa MokHang Won (âMokâ) who had been cohabiting with the deceased until his death.  Mok claimed that the deceased had made a will inher favour.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Cai was the representative of the beneficiaries in the Mainland.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was the attorney of Cai and the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff was and still is a public office in the Mainland vested with the statutory authority to issue notarial certificates. </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The defendant was and still is a firm of solicitors practising in Hong Kong.  </p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The proceedings</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In late 1996 the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff applied to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff for the issue of notarial certificates for the purpose of applying for the grant of letters of administration of the estateof the deceased.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff issued 33 notarial certificates.  </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  According to the plaintiffs, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff was entitled to charge notarial fees at the rate of 5% of the gross value of the estate and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was entitled to be remunerated at the rate of 1% of the gross value of the estate for their services.  </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Due to the efforts of third parties including that of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff the beneficiaries in the Mainland and Wong reached a compromise and they decided to fight Mok for the estate.  They agreedto distribute the estate of the deceased amongst themselves.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 10 June 1997 a deed of family arrangement (âDFAâ) was executed by Cai, the other beneficiaries in the Mainland, Wong andthe 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  They agreed that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff in its capacity as the lawful attorney of Cai shall apply for the letters of administration of the estate of the deceasedin Hong Kong.  Under clause (7) of the DFA, Cai, the Mainland beneficiaries and Wong agreed with the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff that it was entitled to be paid out of the estate of the deceased the expenses set out in the schedule of the DFA whichincluded a 5% notarial fee based on the gross estate value (Clause 5 of the Schedule) and remuneration of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff (acceptance fee of 3% on the gross market value of the estate and administration fee of 1% per annum accruing from November1996) (Clause 8 of the Schedule).  The latter was only relevant if the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff became the administrator of the estate. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  After the execution of the DFA the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff managed to obtain legal aid for Cai and the beneficiaries in the Mainland.  The Director of Legal Aid granted a legal aidcertificate to a Hong Kong person called Lam Fong (âLamâ) who was said to be Caiâs attorney <i>ad litem</i>.  The defendant was appointed to act for Lam and in turn for Cai.  The defendant disputed that it was acting for the plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In November 1997 the defendant issued a probate action (HCAP 13/1997) in the name of Lam as lawful attorney for Cai, naming Mokas the defendant.  The writ claimed that the deceased died intestate and the Mainland beneficiaries were solely entitled to his estate. It claimed that the alleged will given to Mok by the deceased was invalid.  </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Yam J who heard the case decided that Mok had failed to prove the will.  However he also found that the deceased had made a giftin the nature of a <i>Donatio Mortis Causa</i> (â<i>DMC</i>â) in favour of Mok.  By this gift the deceased had practically given all his estate to Mok.  According to the defendant, afterdeducting the portion represented by the <i>DMC</i> gift, the estate to be distributed to the Mainland beneficiaries would only be about $6 million. </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Lam on behalf of Cai lodged an appeal against the judgment.  However before the appeal was heard a settlement was reached betweenthe parties.  By the settlement Mok agreed to take only half of the estate of the deceased.  In simple terms, after deducting expenses,Mok would get about HK$83 million and Cai would get HK$83 million.  The net sum that was to be given to the beneficiaries in theMainland would be about HK$50 million (or 60% of HK$83 million) because Wong would be entitled to 40% of HK$83 million under theDFA.  </p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Bermuda Trust</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Yam J on 13 June 2001 appointed Bermuda Trust (HK) Limited (âBermuda Trustâ) to act as the administrator for the estate of thedeceased and the trustee of the assets given to Mok under the <i>DMC</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Yam J directed that the defendant and Messrs Josip Ma &amp; Co (who acted for Mok) to assist Bermuda Trust âfor the purpose ofapplying for the grant of administration in respect of the estate and the assets of the <i>DMC</i> of the deceasedâ.  </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Bermuda Trust applied for estate duty clearance.  Since the <i>DMC</i> took place within three years before the deceased died, the gift under the <i>DMC</i> was subject to estate duty.  The schedule of the deceasedâs properties for the purpose of estate duty issued by the Estate DutyOffice of the Inland Revenue Department attached to Letters of Administrations later granted to Bermuda Trust showed that the valueof the estate was HK$181,191,399.50. </p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Request for death certificates</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  On 7 July 2001 Bermuda Trust applied in the High Court (HCAG 005504/01) for the Letters of Administration.  </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  By a letter dated 31 July 2001 the Probate Registry (âthe Registryâ) requested the defendant to file death certificates of theparents of the deceased and his six siblings.  </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The defendant responded by a letter dated 13 August 2001 stating that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Concerning Requisition No. 4 [i.e. the request for death certificates], we would like to inform that the subject Deceaseds alldied in China and their death certificates with due authentication would only be issued upon giving of an undertaking to make paymentof notarial charges equivalent to 4% of the overall estate amount including the DMC gift to which undertaking no beneficiary is ina position to make decision on this aspect.</p>        <p class="quote">That being the case and since the applicant herein has already been appointed by the Court as the Administrator of the estate under<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 36</a>, may we hereby apply for the requirement of file death certificates be dispensed with.

First, if the Judge has acted on a wrongprinciple of law (for example, he has misdirected himself on law or has given undue or insufficient weight to the evidence).  Second,if he has made an entirely erroneous estimate of the damages (for example, if the damages are hopelessly incorrect or if it can beshown by calculation that the Judge must have wrongly taken or failed to take certain elements into consideration).

The parties agreed on the measure of damages for conversion.  It is normally the market value of the goods ascertainedat the time of the conversion.  If there is no market for the goods, the value of the goods is ascertained by any available evidence,such as the price at which the goods have been bought, or sold under a subcontract (<i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell On Torts</i> 19<sup>th</sup> Ed para. 17-88, 17-89 and 17-93)</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The parties further proceeded on the basis that the best evidence of the value of the converted properties would be the amount whichthe plaintiffs could reasonably obtain from the use of the notarial certificates.

It is clear that according to the order of Yam J, the estate,in the sense of what the deceased was beneficially entitled to and able to confer on the beneficiaries on his death, was only a smallsum, namely, HK$6 million out of HK$181 million.  The balance of that amount was the <i>DMC</i> gift given to Mok by the deceased.  Although the properties comprised in this gift were also in the name of the deceased, he wasmerely holding them as a trustee for Mok.  He was a bare legal owner of these properties.  The parties i.e. Cai and Mok had latercompromised and agreed to share the estate equally i.e. each would be entitled to $90 million before deduction of expenses, but thiswill not change the nature of their respective entitlement as there was no successful appeal and Yam Jâs order stood.  Mokâsshare was still not by way of succession of the deceasedâs estate but under the gift.  She only agreed to take less of the gift.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The legal position is discussed in <i>In re Hudson. Spencer v. Turner</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1911%5d%20Ch%20D206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1911] Ch D206</a> where a testator made a <i>donatio mortis causa</i> of a sum of money owing to him on a deposit account in favour of a person by the delivery to her of the deposit notes.  The questionis whether so much of the estate duty payable in respect of the testatorâs estate as was attributable to the subject-matter ofa <i>donatio mortis causa</i> was payable out of the general estate of the testator or by the donee.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Warrington J at 211 explained :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The subject-matter of a donatio mortis causa does not pass to the executor as such, in my opinion. All that passes to the executoris the bare legal interest which was vested in the testator up to the moment of his death; but the executor holds that bare legalinterest not qua executor, but as trustee for the object of the giftâhe has no interest in it as executor.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Bermuda Trust was appointed by Yam J in two different capacities.  First, as an administrator for the estate of the deceased andsecond, as a trustee for Mok. The latter appointment was to facilitate the vesting of legal title to the DMC properties on Mok. The fact that Yam J drew this distinction in his judgment put the matter beyond doubt that one must recognize the different natureof the two component parts of the deceasedâs âestateâ.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The fact that under the Schedule of the letters of administration, the value of estate was stated to be HK$181 million was in thecontext of the value for estate duty purpose.  Estate duty was still applicable at the time of the deceasedâs death.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Were the certificates necessary for the grant?</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Mr. Edward Chan SC and Ms Joyce Chan, counsel for the defendant, argued that the Registry did not issue the Letters of Administrationas a result of the photocopied certificates supplied by the defendant.  The Registry required eight death certificates but the defendantonly supplied two of them.  In addition the birth certificates of the deceased and his younger brother not required by the Registrywere also supplied by the defendant.  If the requirement of the Registry was for proof of evidence that prior interest of those whowere entitled to the grant had been cleared, then clearly the documents supplied by the defendant would not be sufficient to meetthis need. </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  In the light of the contemporaneous correspondence, I disagree with the Masterâs view that the certificates were necessary forthe issue of the grant.  As Bermuda Trust was appointed by the Court, there was no question of it being required to clear any priorinterest before it can receive the grant.  The certificates may be relevant to ascertain who were the beneficiaries but I do notregard their production as a prerequisite for the issue of the grant.  A more probable reason for the Registry to later dispensewith the certificates was the terms of Yam Jâs order appointing Bermuda Trust as the Administrator.  Although the defendant, bynot filing the notice of intention to defend, had admitted the claim for conversion of the certificates pleaded in the Endorsementof Claim (see <i>Lam Chi Fat v. Liberty International Insurance</i>)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%202%20HKLRD%20169" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 2 HKLRD 169</a> citing <i>Cribb v.

In respect of the estate underthe Letters of Administration, the value was about $90 million before the deduction of expenses and Bermuda Trust had already paidthe plaintiffs HK$5,435,742 which was half of the 1% charged by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and 5% charged by the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff on HK$181,191,400.  The plaintiffs were not entitled to levy a charge on the DMC gift as well.  The Master was wrong toorder the defendant to pay any further sum by way of damages to the plaintiffs.
