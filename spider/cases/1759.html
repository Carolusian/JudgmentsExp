It concluded on 16 May and judgment was delivered on21 May.</p>        <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a>  The judge found for the Plaintiffs and awarded them $375,000 damages with interest and costs. The Bank no longer challenges thejudgeâs finding that the Bank had converted the note as bailees, but appeals against the quantum of damages. The remaining groundsset out in the Notice of Appeal, of which particulars were later given, are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â(3) The Learned Judge erred in finding that the Banknote had been purchased for $350,000 in 1982.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(4) The Learned Judge erred in finding that the Plaintiffs contracted to sell the Banknote for $10M in 1983.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(5) The Learned Judge erred in law as to the application of the maxim âomnia praesumuntur contra apoliatoremâ.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(6) The Learned Judge erred in finding that the Banknote was an error note.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(7) The Learned Judge erred in law and as to facts in assessing the damages at $375,000.00.â</p>    </blockquote>	<p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a>  The Plaintiffs were not content with the award made in their favour. By their Notice of Cross-Appeal they had said that they shouldhave received $10 million by way of damages in conversion (or alternatively $1 million).</p>        <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a>  They had also said that the judge should have awarded each of them general and special damages âfor mental distress and psychiatricdisorderâ amounting in aggregate to something in the region of $268,000. I shall explain here that the judge had rejected the Plaintiffs'claim for damages for personal injuries arising out of the conversion of the note, as being too remote, but indicated that if suchdamages were recoverable he would have awarded Mr. Chan $40,000 and Madam Law $50,000 as general damages, and their medical expensesas special damages. That is how the amounts sought to be recovered by their cross-appeal under this head had been calculated. ThePlaintiffs had also sought aggravated damages.</p>        <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a>  Howeverï¼on the 8th day of the hearing of the appeal, the entire cross-appeal was abandoned and by 1eaveï¼the Notice of Cross-Appealwas amended so as to become an ordinary Respondentâs Notice which says that the judgment should be affirmed: on the following additionalor a1ternative grounds:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1) that there was no market value of the note, and, therefore,</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2) the measure of damages should be the loss to the Plaintiffsï¼ such loss being assessed by reference to the cost of the note tothem and the 1oss of their chance of selling the note at a high price. </p>    </blockquote>        <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a>  The Plaintiffs' case was as follows. They came to Hong Kong from Mainland China many years ago. [They are now both in their 50's).They were poor but owing to their industry they succeeded in saving money from their various business activities which developedover the years. Madam Law was the person in the family who held the purse strings and invested in the stock exchange and in goldsome measure of success.</p>        <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a>  During the late 1970s Mr. Chan became interested in collecting antiques, paintings, and coins on a small scale. He took up collectingmore seriously after 1978 when the restaurant business they had run together had been sold. It was about 1980 that Mr. Chan beganto collect bank notes.</p>        <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a>  As a young manï¼ a certain Mr. Lau Wai Yee used to patronize a provision store the couple were then running. He must somehow havecome to know of Mr. Chan's interest in collecting and although they had not seen or contacted each other for a period of some 7 years,in May 1982ï¼ out of the blueï¼ Mr. Lau telephoned Mr. Chan from the U.S.A. telling him that he had a $1,000 note issued by theBank which was printed in the wrong colour for, instead of being predominantly yellow, it was printed in the brown colour of a $500note. He also mentioned that he had other specific collectors' items for sale. During the telephone conversation, Mr. Lau's askingprice had been somewhere between $500,000 and $600,000 and Mr. Chan told him that he would not enter into serious negotiations unlessthe items were brought over to Hong Kong for his inspection.</p>        <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a>  Mr. Chan and his wife discussed the matter. When the figures Mr. Lau had in mind were mentioned, Madam Law told her husband thatshe could not agree to their spending a penny more than $400,000. Madam Law did not want to touch other family assets and so, on28 May 1982, she took out a mortgage loan from the Bank of East Asia for $400,000 so that the money would be available.</p>        <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a>  Mr. Lau came to Hong Kong in June 1982 bringing with him the items he had for sale. After bargaining, Mr. Chan agreed to buy the$1,000 note for $350, 000 and two antique mirrors for $50,000. He decided not to buy the other items that Mr. Lau offered him. MadamLaw's reluctance had been overcome because her husband had persuaded her that the note was very valuable.</p>        <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a>  Mr. Chan thought that the note was of exceptional value because it was extremely rare in that it was the only one of its kind inthe world.</p>        <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a>  Before buying the noteï¼he checked it for authenticity with his ultraviolet lamp and examined it through a magnifying glass.</p>        <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a>  By the time Mr. Lau came to Hong Kongï¼Madam Law had used the money she had obtained by way of mortgage for other purposes (includinginvestments) and so it was arranged that Mr. Lau would be paid $100,000 at once and the balance at the end of the month, using otherfinancial resources. After he had been paid Mr. Lau left for Taiwan and has neither been seen nor heard of since. His address hasbeen lost.</p>        <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a>  Acting on her husband's instructions, Madam Law wrote her name "Sim" on the note for identification purposes and set off to placethe note in her safe deposit box at the bank, but she became diverted from her original purpose by engaging in some stock exchangedealings and forgot to put the note in her safe deposit box. Instead she took it home and kept it in her safe.</p>        <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a>  The note remained in Madam Law's safe at home, and until the matter came out at the trial, Mr. Chan thought his wife had carriedout his instructions and that the note had been in the bank all the time.</p>        <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a>  The Plaintiffs knew a Mr. Chan Chun Yip because he came from their village in Mainland China. He now lived in Thailand. After nothaving seen each other for about 37 years, a social meeting was arranged for them to meet in a hotel in May or June 1983. Duringthe course of conversation, Mr. Chan casually asked his former co-villager whether he happened to know anyone who might be interestedin buying his $1,000 note. He mentioned some very high figures as the price he might accept for the note. Mr. Chan Chun Yip saidthat he knew a wealthy collector in Thailand (a Mr. Chan Shun Hoi) and agreed to approach him. It turned out that Mr. Chan Shun Hoidid indeed express an interest in buying the note and negotiations ensued. Mr. Chan Shun Hoi gave Mr. Chan Chun Yip a letter of authorityto buy the note.</p>        <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a>  The deal that was reached was that Mr. Chan Shun Hoi would buy the note for S10 million. He required the note to be verified bythe bank and that the deal should be documented and witnessed in a solicitorâs office. When all this had been done satisfactorilyï¼adown payment of $2 million would be made by Mr. Chan Chun Yip and then Mr. Chan Shun Hoi would come over himself to Hong Kong andcomplete the deal by paying the balance of $8 million.</p>        <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a>  To show that the money for the $2 million deposit would be available, the P1aintiffs were shown a photostat of a time deposit receiptwith the Bangkok Bank evidencing a US dollar deposit in Mr. Chan Chun Yip's name.</p>        <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a>  On 17 September, 1983, the Plaintiffs made an arrangement that Mr. Chan Chun Yip would meet Madam Law outside the Bank of East Asiaâsbranch in Nathan Road so that Madam Law could take the note from her safe deposit and present it to that bank for verification. WhenMadam Law set out for the bank, she could not recall whether or not the note was in her safe deposit box but remembered, on her way,outside a shoe-shop, that it was in fact in her safe at home. So she went home, made an excuse to her husband as to why she had returnedand went back to the Bank of East Asia with the note.</p>        <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a>  At the Bank of East Asiaï¼Mr. Chan Chun Yip checked to see if the note bore the number he had earlier been given, and took a $500note from his pocket to confirm that the note matched the colour of a $500 note. Madam Law then went up to the counter alone to havethe note verified. She was told that the note looked genuine but that it should be verified by the issuing bank. And so, Madam Lawwalked to a small branch of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank also in Nathan Road. Mr.. Chan Chun Yip followed some way behind anddid not go into that bank with Madam Law. Before he was able to enter the Bank, he heard an altercation going on and became worriedbecause he had heard words being used such as "identity card" and "police stationâ spoken by people in the bank. Being afraid,and not wanting to become involved, he went away.</p>        <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a>  According to Madam Law in brief summary, what happened in the second bank on 17 September 1983 was this: she went up to a counterand presented the $1,000 note to a young lady teller. She said that she had brought the note for verification and for verificationonly. The teller reached her hand out to try to take the note but she retained her hold of it saying: "You made it clear to me, thisnote is worth much money.â</p>        <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a>  But the teller took the note and said that if it was genuine it would be returned to her, whereas if it was a fake it would be forfeited.She then went to where the branch manager was standing and was asked for her identification card in a rude manner. Madam Law askedher why they wanted her identification card and was cross at being asked for it.</p>        <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a>  An argument then ensued and the manager was called. He insisted that she must produce her identification card, saying that if sherefused it was the bank's practice to make a report to the police. She took this as a threat and when she still refused, the managerinstructed a young man to phone the police. She became frightened and said: âCome and get it, come and get it.â</p>        <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a>  She thought that she had provoked the manager by not producing her identification card and when the young man was about to dialon the telephone, she became frightened. They refused to give the note back to her and she was given a receipt instead. She was toldthat verification would take 7 days after which if the note was proved to be genuine, it would be returned to her; otherwise, itwould be forfeited.</p>        <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a>  The Plaintiffs made strenuous efforts to recover the note. They made a report to the police on the day the note was seized but weretold that since they had the receipt they should wait until the 7 days mentioned in it had expired to see whether or not the bankwould return the note.</p>        <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a>  On 21 Septemberï¼ Madam Law was telephoned by the bank and as a result of that call, she went to the same branch of the bank inNathan Road and was offered $1,000 but not the note she had handed over. She refused to accept the money she was offered and on thatday, the husband and wife went to the police station to seek their help. The efforts of the police to recover the note from the bankfailed. They made a written statement about the events which was recorded. Madam Law went to the bank again on a number of occasionsbut the Bank did not return the note she was interested in.</p>        <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a>  The Plaintiffss went to their solicitors a week or so after their attempts to get the note back with the help of the police hadfailed. Correspondence ensued between them and the solicitors of the Bank. The Plaintiffs received no satisfaction and this actionwas instituted on 20 January 1984.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a>  I now set out what I consider to be the primary findings of fact by the judge:ã</p><blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1) The Plaintiffs bought a $1,000 note which was of the colour of a $500 note from Mr. Lau Wai Yee for $350,000 in June 1982.  Mr.Chan thought the note was of great value being rare and the only one of its kind in the world.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2) The Plaintiffs had raised $400,000 by way of mortgage on 28May 1982 so that the money would be available for buying the itemsMr. Lau Wai Yee said he had for saleï¼ although the money advanced been used for different purposes.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3) Mr. Chan always thought that his instructions had been obeyed and that his wife had placed the note in their safe deposit boxin their bank.  He only realized that this was not so when madam Law gave evidence in the action.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(4) It was arranged with Mr. Chan Chun Yip, as agent, and Mr Chan Shun Hoi as principal, that the latter would buy the note for $10million.  This was why, on 17 September 1983, the note was taken first to the Bank of East Asia and then to the Hong Kong Bank (bothin Nathan Road) for verificationã</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(5) When Madam Law went into the Hong Kong Bank to have the note verifiedï¼Mr. Chan Chun Yip did not go in but he was present atthe time.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(6) Madam Law made it clear that she thought the note was valuable and never said at any time that she had brought the note in forreplacement.  She was told it would be given back to her if it was genuine but forfeited if it was not.  Madam Law asked for thenote back if it could not be verified there and then and the manager refused to do this relying on Bank procedure.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(7) The Bank was a bailee of the note and there was a mandate to verify it and if it were genuine to return it.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(8) Since it had been destroyed, probably on 21 or 22 September, the Plaintiffs were entitled to damages in conversion.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(9) Mr. Chan, Madam Law and Mr. Chan Chun Yip had in turn examined the note and found it to be exactly the same colour as a $500 note. It was, in fact, exactly the same in colour as a $500 note, and was a genuine error note.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(10) Although a contract for the sale of the note to Mr. Chan Shun Hoi for S10 million was entered into, the chances of the sale actuallybeing effected were remote.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(11) As a result of the loss of the note the lives of the Plaintiffs' family had been devasted and both were suffering from psychiatricproblems.</p></blockquote>        <p>When the judge began to address the question of the genuiness or otherwise of the note which had been convertedï¼ the judge firstmade the point that if it had been available, and had it been produced by the Bank, the issue as to the nature of the note couldhave been resolved with the greatest possible ease. After summarizing the opposing contentions the judge referred to the relianceplaced by the Plaintiffs on the maxim â<u>omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem</u>"ï¼ or as he put itï¼ "more cogently on the principle in <u>Armory</u> v <u>Delamirie</u> 1 Strange 505 (1722)". [For convenience I will hereafter refer to it as "the maxim". He also cited <u>Gray</u> v. <u>Haig</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281855%29%2020%20Beav%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1855) 20 Beav. 65.</a> He concluded that evidence about the noteï¼ even indirect evidenceï¼ was admissible to show what kind of note it was, and thereforehe would admit the testimony of Mr. Thomas of Bradbury and Wilkinsonï¼ the printers of the noteï¼ which he had taken <u>de bene esse</u>ï¼ despite the Plaintiffs' contention that it was inadmissible.</p>        <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a>  However, he saidï¼ the note had been destroyed and destroyed deliberately by the Bank's wrongfu1 act. In his view it was not asimple misunderstandingï¼ nor was the destruction due to simple carelessnessï¼ andï¼ regarded objectivelyï¼ the sending of thenote for destruction was presumptuous. It was also inconsiderate in the light of Madam Lauâs obvious wishes; and it was arrogantin that there was a refusal to return the note coupled with a refusal even to attempt to recover the note if it had not by then beendestroyed.</p>        <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a>  Despite this, in the judgeâs viewï¼ there was no question here of the Bank having deliberately destroyed evidence to gain anadvantage as in <u>Gray</u> v. <u>Haig</u> and it was certainly not a case where the plaintiff was being deprived of evidence in circumstances where the defendant was tryingto seek his own profit as had been the situation in <u>Armory</u> v. <u>Delamirie</u>.</p>        <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a>  The fact that the Bankâs actions were not deliberate to gain an advantage or to gain a profit made a difference to the way inwhich the principle was to be applied. If deliberate, the presumption against the defendant was in practice irrebuttable, almostto the extent of being an estoppel. It all depended on the circumstances. The Bank' s unlawful destruction of the note meant thatthe presumption of the note being of the best quality would only be rebutted by the Bankâs calling cogentï¼ compelling and directevidence as to its natureï¼ always compared with the evidence available to the Plaintiffs.</p>        <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a>  The judge then evaluated what he called the "direct" evidence given by the Bank about the note. He referred to the evidence of Mr.Leung, the bank note examiner in the Bank's Main Treasury. He found his testimony to have been superficial and unimpressiveï¼ andhis evidence about the note and its exact colourï¼ therefore, unhelpful. As to the two lady tellers at the Nathan Road branch ofthe Bankï¼ he did not consider that it was their duty to make any examination of the colour of the note. Once they had decided thatit was of a different colour from an ordinary $1,000 note, their task was to refer the matter to the manager. He noted that he hadfound their evidence was not acceptable on other grounds [as to what was said and what happened when Madam Law handed the note overfor verification] and he found their evidence on this point unhelpful tooï¼ and likely to be unreliable.</p>        <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a>  Turning to the Plaintiffs' direct evidence on this issueï¼ the judge concluded that it was considerably more cogent. This was tobe expected forï¼ Mr. Chanï¼ having paid a great deal of money for the noteï¼was likely to have given it a little more attentionwithin the limits of his knowledge .at the time. Although uninformed, inexpert and a beginnerï¼ he had examined the note and hadbeen satisfied that it was the same colour as a $500 note. Had the note been a different colourï¼ he certainly would have rememberedit. On this matter his evidence was reliable and would be accepted.</p>        <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a>  The matter did not stand aloneï¼ in the judge's view. Mr. Chan had been pressed in cross-examination at very great length aboutthe colour of the note and that served to make him conclude that he was able to rely on him. Mr. Chan had examined the note closely(through a magnifying glass) for smoothness among other things because he had heard that a US bank note could be tampered with byrubbing the colour.</p>        <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a>  The judge then said that he found Madam Lawâs evidence on this matter impressive. She was not always accurateï¼ but she was arather timid and anxious witness trying to give an accurate account. While it was a fact that colours were difficult to rememberunless a direct a direct comparison were to be made, he accepted her evidence that a comparison was made between the note and a $500note and that the colours were exactly the same.</p>        <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a>  The judge was further satisfied that Mr. Chan Chun Yip was at the Bank of East Asia and that there he had made the same comparisonï¼anact Madam Law had described as being âsmart" because he had produced a $500 note from his pocket for that very purpose. Mr. ChanChun Yip had given the same evidence to the comparison of the colour. This significantly supported the comparison that Madam Lawhad made</p>        <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a>  For these reasons) the judge saidï¼ the direct evidence given for the Plaintiffs was far to be preferred to that given for theBankï¼ and the direct evidence led to the conclusion that the note was exactly the same as a $500 note and rendered it highly likelythat the note was printed in that colour and that it was a genuine error note.</p>        <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a>  The judge remarked that it had not been said by any witness that notes of exact1y the same colour as a $500 note could be producedby the discolouration process and none of the notes produced in evidenceï¼ which had been discolouredï¼were of exactly the samecolour. He added that he found the note was a circulated note andï¼thereforeï¼ it was very unlikely that anyone had discolouredit in order to deceive an unsuspecting collector.</p>        <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a>  The judge then reviewed and evaluated what he called the "indirect" evidence called by the Bank. He mentioned that a few other noteshad been produced which were said to be discoloured because they were not the same as either a proper $1,000 note or a proper $500note. These notes had been collectedï¼ so the Bank had saidï¼ since the case began, but the precise circumstances in which theyhad been obtained remained unknown. He noted that although there were, in the agreed bundle, documents concerning discoloured notesï¼therewere no internal documents which related to discoloured notes in the .Bank before the incidents which gave rise to this action.</p>        <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a>  The judge also commented that there was no evidence that any note had been sent to the printers or that the printers had been consultedabout the discolouration of notes before the case arose andï¼ therefore, the nature of such notes as had been described was doubtful.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a>  The judge went on to refer to, and review the evidence given by Mr. Thomas.  He then said:</p><blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âNow I can summarize this evidence quite brieflyï¼ for it is clear that if this system is followedï¼ that is if the notes areprinted according to the system laid down and if the machinery operates properly and if the checking is done properlyï¼ it is highlyunlikely that a thousand-dollar-note could be printed both sides in the wrong colour. Indeed if all those things are done and thechecks are made carefullyï¼it would be near impossible for there to be an error note."</p></blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a>  After remarking that the evidence was that error notes were easily available and that there were some 30 dealers in Hong Kong, thejudge continued:</p><blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â But leaving that aside, the fact is that machines do go wrong, that systems are not followed as they should be, checks are notmade as carefully as they should be and those who are carrying out the systems do not always even try to follow them on occasions.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">Now all those are general matters and it is no criticism in relation to Mr. Thomas. But the evidence of system and checks are notalways a reliable guide as to the result which is achieved. I may say that I have some thirty yearsâ experience at the bar of consideringindustrial systems in relation to things that have happened that never have happened. One knows regrettably that because there isa system, it does not mean that unusual things cannot result.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">So this evidence which is indirect must be put and firmly put into its proper perspective and the question is: Is that evidence enoughto displace the direct evidence which appears on its own to be cogent and compelling, if not, I may sayï¼conclusive?</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">Well nowï¼ when I consider the whole of that matter and I compare the direct evidence with the indirect evidence and then apply properlythe principles in <u>Armory</u> v <u>Delamirie</u>ï¼ then I find that the heavy burden which is placed upon the defendants in these circumstances is not discharged and indeed I findalso that the direct evidence which I have accepted is of itself compelling that this was a genuine error note. I so find."</p></blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a>  Mr. Rogers, who did not appear in the Court below, relied on the maxim before us in support of the judge's conclusions. He submittedthat the maxim had application even in circumstances where no improper motives could be imputed to the act of destroying the evidence.He contended that if a spoliator who is a wrongdoer puts out of the innocent party's power by his wrongful act, evidence by whichthe innocent party might prove or support his caseï¼ it raised a presumption against the spoliator that the evidenceï¼ if producedï¼would sustain the other party's case.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a>  Another way of putting the point would be that the onus of proof shifted to the spoliator to prove that the facts which he allegedin respect of the chattel destroyed are as he alleges. Mr. Rogers accepted the maxim could only apply where there was some evidenceto support the plaintiffâs case, and would be displaced by direct evidence as to the nature of the chattel destroyed.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a>  He argued .that the maxim applied in the circumstances of the present case because:</p><blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(a) the note had admittedly been converted by the Bank;</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(b) there was evidence on which the court could find that the note was a misprinted one;</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(c) the destruction of the note put it out of the Plaintiffsâ' power to call the best evidence to prove or support their case; and</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(d) the Plaintiffs had never had the Banknote examined by experts, it being deliberately destroyed by the Bank without their priorconsent or knowledge.</p></blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a>  Mr. Rogers went on to submit that the effect of the maxim upon the particular facts of this case was that since the Rank contendedthat the note had its brown colour other than by misprinting, the onus was upon them to call evidence to establish that contention.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a>  In the circumstances, since the destruction was tortious, it was incumbent on the Bank to satisfy the Court, not only that the notecould be treatedï¼after printingï¼ so that it could have the same colour as a $500 noteï¼ but also that the note was one thathad been chemically treated after it had come out of the printing processes. In order not to allow the Plaintiffs to suffer fromthe disadvantage to which they were put by the wrongful destruction of the note, it was only right that the Bank should be requiredto prove what is asserted - that the note was one that had been chemically treated.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a>  I will not refer to all the authorities which were cited to us on this point. I begin by quoting a few extracts from the exhaustivetreatment of the subject by the learned authors of <u>Wigmore on Evidence (Chadbourn Revision)</u> (1979) Vo1.2.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a>  At p.192ï¼ we find the following paragraph:</p><blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â285. <u>Failure to produce evidence, as indicating unfavorable tenor of evidence</u>: (1) <u>In general</u>. The consciousness indicated by conduct may beï¼ not an indefinite one affecting the weakness of the cause at large, but a specificone concerning the defects of a particular element in the cause. The failure to bring before the tribunal some circumstance, document,or witness, when either the party himself or his opponent claims that the facts would thereby be elucidated, serves to indicateï¼asthe most natural inferenceï¼ that the party fears to do so; and this fear is some evidence that the circumstance or document orwitnessï¼ if broughtï¼ would have exposed facts unfavorable to the party. These inferencesï¼ to be sureï¼ cannot fairly be madeexcept upon certain conditions; and. they are also open always to explanation by circumstances which make some other hypothesis amore natural one than the party's fear of exposure.

The substance of it, however, remains and is as forcible now as ever;and itÂ· is applicable not merely in prize cases, but to almost all kinds of disputes.   If anyone by a deliberate act destroys adocument which, according to what its contents may have been, would have told strongly either for him or against him, the strongestpossible presumption arises that if it had been produced it would have told against him; and even if the document is destroyed byhis own act, but under circumstances in which the intention to destroy evidence may fairly be considered rebutted, still he has tosuffer.

Ltd. said in hisexpert report furnished before the trialï¼and during the course of his evidence. His report was before the Court and he amplifiedwhat he had written during the course of his evidence. It had been furnished to the Plaintiffsâ solicitors well before the trial.</p>        <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a>  Mr. Thomas is a Chartered Chemist and a member of the Institute of Printing. He also holds a B.S.C. degree from London Universityand has been working for the Bradbury Wilkinson group for about 33 years.</p>        <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a>  In his report he says that Bradbury Wilkinson has been printing bank notes and other security documents since the 1850s. The onlyother organisations which print bank notes in England are De La Rue, the Bank of England and a small firm in Scotland.</p>        <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a>  He then refers to the paper on which the notes are printed.Â· Paper is delivered to Bradbury Wilkinson by the firm which makes it,already having been guillotined to the correct size to make 18 bank notes in three rows of six. The water mark and security threadis put in by the paper firm before delivery.</p>        <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a>  He stated that the pattern on the back of the Hong Kong $1,000 bank note is produced by offset printing. When this system is used,the ink is sprayed on to one roller with a forward image on it and the ink is transferred to another roller in contact with the firstwhich, by this process, acquires a backward image which is then transferred to a third roller on which the' roll of bank notes paperis and thus it requires a forward image.</p>        <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a>  After the offset printing, the lion which appears on the back of a $1,000 note, the denomination and the border is placed on thenote by the Intaglio system. The Intaglio plate is backwards, that is to say, mirrorwise, and is completely covered with ink whichis then applied under the great pressure to the bank notes. Once the back of the note had been printed by the Intaglio process, thefront is then printed by the same process twice, once for the very dark green which appears on the notes to be almost black in colour,and once for the yellow or gold colour. During this process, the notes are still in sheets of 18 and they are then examined by eye.For this highly skilled workers are employed.</p>        <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a>  Mr. Thomas explained that normally there is a 7% to 10% spoilage. This mostly occurs at the beginning of a run of bank notes, whenthe printers are getting the pressure in the printing plate right and achieving precisely the correct ink balance. The practice wastherefore to print more notes than the bank had ordered. The spoilage would not normally be destroyed because the paper used wasexpensiveï¼ amounting to about 50% to the cost of producing each bank note. On a sheet of 18 notesï¼ some of the notes might beperfect and others not. The imperfections would normally consist of smudging.</p>        <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a>  The perfect notes would then be numbered by machine and the sheet of 18 guillotined, at which stage there would be a further examinationof the numbers also by eye. If wrong or faulty numbers were discoveredï¼ these notes would be marked and replaced. There were strictcontrol. The notes would then be bundled into hundreds, sealed in security sheets which were heat shrunk so that they could not beopened undetectedï¼ and then sent to the bank.</p>        <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a>  Mr. Thomas's report continues to say that it should be noted that the back of a note may be printed a week or more before the frontis printed and because of the high compression used in the Intaglio system, slightly different coloured ink would have to be usedso that the colour produced on the back and the front of the finished note appeared the same to the eye.</p>        <p><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a>  The ink used was produced within the Bradbury Wilkinson group and delivered to the printing department in 20 kilo. drums. The printerwas required to sign a receipt for the ink. These printers were highly skilled and experienced man who had been apprenticed, usuallyto Bradbury Wilkinson. They would certainly reject any ink which was of the wrong colour.</p>        <p><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a>  The ink used in the HK$1,000 bank note had several pigments. Its main ingredient was lead chromate which varied in colour from yellowto orange. Other organic dyes were used and carbon black. Because of the repeated inspection of notes after printing and becausethe printers would inspect the colour of the ink supplied to themï¼ it was in his opinion, impossible for discoloured notes to besent out by Bradbury Wilkinson.</p>        <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a>  The report goes on to say that lead chromate could be converted to lead sulphide or hydrogen sulphide or by placing it in a solutionof sodium sulphide in water. It would be difficult and dangerous to convert the lead chromate on a note into lead sulphide by usinghydrogen sulphide because the concentration required would be extremely toxic. On other hand, it would be very easy to dip notesinto a 15% solution of sodium sulphide. Sodium sulphide could easily be bought in wholesale chemist shops. It was cheap arid wasformerly used extensively in photography.</p>        <p><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a>  Anyone with an elementary knowledge of chemistry could change the colour of a HK$1,000 bank note by immersing it in a 15% solutionof sodium sulphide for a quarter of an hour at room temperature. It was his opinion that the discoloured Hong Kong dollar bank noteshe had been shown were discoloured deliberately. He formed this view because the notes were uniformly discoloured â if they hadbeen accidentally exposed to hydrogen sulphide or sodium sulphide, one would expect to find creases showing a lighter or a darkercolour â and it was difficult to think how a note could accidentally come into contact with hydrogen sulphide or a sodium sulphidesolution in sufficient concentration accidentally.</p>        <p><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a>  He had carried out a test on a sample Hong Kong dollar note of a normal colour and had converted in into a dark colour by immersingit in a solution of sodium sulphide. He had re-converted part of the note to its original colour by exposing it to hydrogen peroxide.This had the effect of converting the black lead sulphide on the surface of the note to white lead sulphide so that the note revertedto its original yellow or gold colour.</p>        <p><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a>  In evidence, Mr. Thomas explained that a week or so might elapse between the offset printing of the back and the front of the notebecause the note had to be thoroughly dry otherwise the pressure of the later Intaglio process, which was enormous, would smudgethe offset ink. He said that a week or probably longer would elapse between the Intaglio printing of the back and the front of thenotes. There would be a minder and an assistant present and it was the minder who had to sign for the ink.</p>        <p><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a>  The maximum capacity of the ink well in the Intaglio machine was about 4 kilos. When it ran low, it would be topped up. He couldtell that the note which is the subject matter of this action (by its number) came from a 1979 order for 1.5 million notes from theHong Kong Bank.</p>        <p><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a>  When there was a repeat orderï¼ examples of previous notes were kept and they had a set of guard books on which notes from previousprintings, finished and semi-finished, were placed as examples of each process. These books were available to the manager of eachdepartment who would compare the notes in the machine with the notes which had previously been printed. If a $1,000 note were tobe printed brownï¼ it would have to be a considerable error when the minder signed for the inkï¼ and if the wrong ink were in thedrum it would be obvious from the label to begin with. This was very unlikely in itself.</p>        <p><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a>  If it did happen that the wrong coloured ink was deliveredï¼ the minder, when filling the ink well with ink, would see that itwas of the wrong colour and if the wrong ink was used all the notes would come out in the wrong colour and it would be noticeableat once.</p>        <p><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a>  If the correct ink was in the well originally and brown ink was put in to top up the ink well by mistake, this would produce a darkershade and would be noticed because it would be very easy to see. In the two Intaglio processes, when the notes were dryingï¼ theywould be reeledï¼ that is to say paper would be placed in between each sheet of notes so that the ink from one sheet did not comeout on the other. Later, the sheets would be "dereeled" and the girl responsible would see the wrong colour in the process and woulddraw attention to it.</p>        <p><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a>  In his evidence, Mr. Thomas then went on to explain the later processes but before doing so, he said that in view of the fact thatthe back and the front of the notes were printed in the Intaglio system with a gap of a week or more in betweenï¼ if it turned outthat the front of a sheet of notes or any particular note ended up with the same colour as the back. it meant that the same errorwould have had to have been repeated and at exactly at the right sequence with the shiftï¼ that is to say when the original errornote printed in the wrong colour came up for printing again.</p>        <p><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a>  He repeated the opinion he had expressed in his report that printing a $1,000 note in the colour of a $500 note was just not possible.He referred to a number of notes he were shown which had errors upon them other than being printed in the wrong colour and he thoughthe could explain some and not others.</p>        <p><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a>  In cross-examination, the first reply he gave was that he could categorically state that both sides of a $1,000 note could not beprinted in the wrong colour. He explained that there was a great difference between such errors as the absence of signature, or date,or the lion head not being complete or in the right place. Notes being printed in the wrong colour were errors in completely differentclass. When he was asked whether it was not surprising when millions of bank notes were being printed that freaks should occurï¼he was at pains to emphasize that printing a note in the wrong colour was not a machine fault. He could understand the possibilityof other errors of the kind referred to him but he could not understand how a note could be printed in the wrong colour.</p>        <p><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a>  He was asked how often he visited the offset and Intaglio printing premises and he said usually daily. When asked why, he said thatif a new job was starting he would probably have to go and look at it and see all was going wellï¼ particularlyï¼ if there wasa query or a problem arose. There was a manager of each department, the offset, Intaglio and ink departments. The works manager wasin overall charge and the manager of each department was responsible to him and he, in turn, to the works director.</p>        <p><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a>  At the relevant time, he was more concerned with the ink department. He was not working full time in the offset printing departmentï¼only paying visits to it. When asked: "Putting it rather crudelyï¼ you are an ink man not a printing man?", he answered that thiswas so.</p>        <p><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a>  Mr. Thomas said that the same machine was used to print $1,000 notes and $500 notes. He said that if any ink had been left froma previous job in the ink well, the machine had to be thoroughly washed out. Mr. Thomas was asked:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"If there had been a run of $500 notes and someone had forgotten to change the ink, that is one possibility in which you could havea brown instead of gold [note]?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="auto-style3">He replied:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAt the beginning, no work would be run until the minder had matched the copy for the new job in the machine. When a new job startsthe Intaglio department would have ordered for the new job. Intaglio would request ink for the machine for the new job.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a>  He added that he had never known a mistake of this kind to occur. If the wrong coloured ink was used at the start of printing anew batch of $1,000 notes after a run of $500 notes, the next thing that would happened was that the minder would see the label onthe drum of ink. He said that if the wrong colour appeared on a sheet and someone noticed it, the sheet would be sent to a specialdepartment under strict control.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a>  In my judgment this evidence shows that, in practical terms, a $1,000 note could not be printed in precisely the brown colour ofS500 note. As I have mentioned, the Plaintiffs had Mr. Thomas's report long before the trial and they did not seek to call any expertevidence to challenge what he had there said. For the reasons that he gave, Mr. Thomas expressed his opinion that such an eventualitywas âimpossibleâ. Indeed during the hearing of the appeal Mr. Rogers accepted that the odds against a $1,000 note being printedin the brown ink used for printing $500 notes were several millions to one against; and on more than one occasionï¼ he spoke ofthe likelihood that the converted note was a ânote in a lifetime".</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a>  Of course, a judge trying a case brings all his experience with himï¼ and uses it to help him achieve a just result. But I am boundto sayï¼ with very great respect, that in the absence of any expert evidence to challenge the opinion given by Mr. Thomas, who wasa true expert in the very field that was relevant to the issue the judge was then addressing, the judge did not give this evidencethe weight it deserved.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a>  I am unable to accept Mr. Rogersâ submission, in effect, that the testimony of Mr. Thomas was of little value because, for example,no documents were produced to show the signatures of those taking over the drums of inks; there was no evidence regarding the competenceof those involved; and there was no specific evidence regarding the actual printing of the relevant series of notes. With regardto another submission on this pointï¼ I do not see any suggestion on the record that Mr. Thomas was challenged on the basis thathe was not giving evidence of the system of printing which prevailed at the time the banknote in question was printedã</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a>  I would stress here, that the plank upon which the Plaintiffsâ case was based was that, as the judge found, the note which hadbeen converted was exactly the colour of a $500 note. Of course, the Bank could have called evidence, which it did not, that it waspossible to discolour a properly printed $1,000 note so that its colour became that of a $500 note. Their case would, undoubtedly,have been stronger had they done so. But the Bank were relying on evidence from tellers who handle notes all day (which in the eventthe judge did not accept) that the note which they seized was of a lighter shade of brown than a $500 note. The Plaintiffs were freeto call, if they could, expert evidence to show that no method of treatment, chemical or otherwise, could change the colour of a$1,000 note so that it looked to the eye to be of the same colour as a $500 note.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a>  The judge, as we have seen, classified the evidence on this issue as âdirectâ and âindirectâ and placed the evidence givenby Mr. Thomas in the âindirectâ category. I am not sure that this approach was right. However that may be, although the judgefound as a fact that the note was exactly the colour of a $500 note, this finding was based on evidence that it appeared to be ofthat colour in the eyes of the Plaintiffsâ witnesses. One does not know how reliable was their individual perception of colour.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a>  Before applying the principles in <u>Armory</u> v. <u>Delamirie</u> the judge had arrived at what I take to have been a preliminary conclusion, that since the note was of the exact colour of a $500note, it was highly likely that the note had been printed in this colour and that therefore it was a genuine error note. With respect,I do not think that the evidence as a whole, properly evaluated, justified this tentative, but firmly expressed, conclusion. Indeed,in my view, the evidence showed that it was highly unlikely that this was so.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a>  If the principles in <u>Armory</u> v. <u>Delamirie</u> are applied to the limited extent I have suggested might be proper, and if its application cast any onus on the Bank, or requiredthem to rebut an inference against them, then it seems to me clear that the ordinary civil standard of proof, on the balance of probabilities,would be involved and it was wrong to speak of a âheavyâ burden or that the Bank was required to lead âcogent, compelling anddirectâ evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a>  As I have already perhaps indicated, I am unable to accept that the evidence led by the Plaintiffs to establish that the note wasa genuine error note in so far as its colour was concerned, âwas of itself cogent and compelling, if not â¦. conclusiveâ, asthe judge said.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a>  In my respectful judgment the Bank has succeeded in demonstrating that the judgeâs reasoning and approach on this issue cannotbe supported, and since the Plaintiffs accept that the note would have had no numismatic value unless it had been printed in thecolour of a $500 note, the Bankâs appeal should succeed on this ground alone.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a>  In case I am wrong in my view of the law embodied in the principle applied in <u>Armory</u> v. <u>Delamirie</u>, I turn to address grounds [3] and [4] in the Bankâs Notice of Appeal. Moreover, since so many days were taken up during the hearingof this appeal on these issues, I think the parties are entitled to the decision of this Court upon them.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a>  Although the Bankâs liability in conversion has now been acknowledged, since the judgeâs findings of fact in relation to theissues which still divide the parties are challenged, it is necessary to consider the principles upon which a Court of Appeal actswhere an action has been tried without a jury. These principles have, over the years, been discussed, and stated and re-stated, byCourts of the highest authority. Although the proper approach of a court of Appeal in such cases is well-known, in a case such asthe present, it is as well to be reminded of the principles to be applied. The choice of authorities from which citations could bemade is very wide. They indicate, of course, that the Bank faces a heavy task indeed.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a>  I begin by citing from the speech of Lord Summer in <u>S.S. Hontestroom</u> v. <u>S.S.

Of course, there is jurisdiction to retry the case on the shorthand note, including insuch retrial the appreciation of the relative values of the witnesses, for the appeal is made a rehearing by rules which have theforce of statute: Order LXVIII., r.1. It is not, however, a mere matter of discretion to remember and take account of this fact;it is a matter of justice and of judicial obligation. None the less, not to have seen the witnesses puts appellate judges in a permanentposition of disadvantage as against the trial judge, and, unless it can be shown that he has failed to use or has palpably misusedhis advantage, the higher Court ought not to take the responsibility of reversing conclusions so arrived at, merely on the resultof their own comparisons and criticisms of the witnesses and of their own view of the probabilities of the case. The course of thetrial and the whole substance of the judgment must be looked at, and the matter does not depend on the question whether a witnesshas been cross-examined to credit or has been pronounced by the judge in terms to be unworthy of it. If his estimate of the man formsany substantial part of his reasons for his judgment the trial judgeâs conclusions of fact should, as I understand the decisions,be let alone."</p>    </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a>  At p.50, Lord Summer said that the material questions were:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"(1) DoesÂ· it appear from the President's judgment that he made full judicial use of the opportunity given him by hearing the vivavoce evidence? (2) Was there evidence before him, affecting the relative credibility of the witnesses, which would make the exerciseof his critical faculties in judging the demeanour of the witnesses a useful and necessary operation? (3) Is there any glaring improbabilityabout the story accepted, sufficient in itself to constitute 'a governing fact, which in<br />        relation to others has created a wrong impression,' or any specific misunderstanding or disregard of a material fact, orany 'extreme and overwhelming pressure' that has had the same effect?</p>    </blockquote>        <p><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a>  Then, in <u>Powell</u> v. <u>Streatham Manor Nursing Home</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1935%5d%20AC%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1935] A.C. 243</a>, Viscount Sankey had this to say, at p.249:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"It is perfectly true that an appeal is by way of rehearing, but it must not be forgotten that the Court of Appeal does not rehearthe witnesses. It only reads the evidence and rehears the counsel.  Neither is it a reseeing Court â¦. the onus is upon the appellantto satisfy the Court that his appeal should be allowed â¦. On an appeal against a judgment of a judge sitting alone, the Court ofAppeal will not set aside the judgment unless the appellant satisfies the Court that the judge was wrong and that his decision oughtto have been the other way.â</p>    </blockquote>        <p><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a>  At p.250, Viscount Sankey cited with approval from the speech of Lord Shaw in <u>Clarke</u> v. <u>Edinburgh Tramways Co.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1919%5d%20SC%20%28HL%29%2037" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1919] S.C.

I can of course quite understand a Court of Appeal that says that it will not interfere in a case inwhich the Judge has announced as part of his judgment that he believes one set of witnesses, having seen them, and heard them, anddoes not believe another. But that is not the ordinary case of a cause in a Court of justice. In Courts of justice in the ordinarycase things are much more evenly divided; witnesses without any conscious bias towards a conclusion may have in their demeanour,in their manner, in their hesitation, in the nuance of their expressions, in even the turns of the eyelidï¼ left an impression uponthe man who saw and heard them which can never be reproduced in the printed page. What in such circumstances, thus psychologicallyput, is the duty of an appellate Court? In my opinionï¼ the duty of an appellate Court in those circumstances is for each Judgeof it to put to himself, as I now do in this case, the questionï¼ Am I - who sit here without those advantagesï¼ sometimes broadand sometimes subtle, which are the privilege of the Judge who heard and tried the case - in a position, not having those privileges,to come to a clear conclusion that the Judge who had them was plainly wrong?

Where a question of fact has been tried by a judge without a .jury, and there is no questionof misdirection of himself by the judge, an appellate court which is disposed to come to a different conclusion on the printed evidence,should not do so unless it is satisfied that any advantage enjoyed by the trial judge by reason of having seenÂ· and heard the witnesses,could not be sufficient to explain or justify the trial judge's conclusion;  II. The appellate court may take the view that, withouthaving seen or heard the witnesses, it is not in a position to come to any satisfactory conclusion on the printed evidence; III.The appellate court,  either because the reasons given by the trial judge are not satisfactoryï¼ or because it unmistakably so appearsfrom the evidence, may be satisfied that he has not taken proper advantage of his having seen and heard the witnesses, and the matterwill then become at large for the appellate court. It is obvious that the value and importance of having seen and heard the witnesseswill vary according to the class of case, and, it may be, the individual case in question."</p>    </blockquote>        <p><a name="p94" class="pseudopara" id="p94">94.</a>  The cases, I would note here, draw a distinction between the trial judgeâs view of conflicting testimony and the inferences whichhe draws from facts which are not in dispute. They also draw a distinction between the finding of a specific fact and a finding whichis in reality an inference drawn from facts specifically found. Where the drawing of proper inferences is concerned an appellatecourt will more readily form an independent opinion, subject to the weight which must always be given to the opinion of the trialjudge: see e.g. <u>Benmax</u> v. <u>Austin Motor Co. Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%20AC%20371" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] A.C. 371</a>, <u>per</u> Viscount Simonds, at pp. 373-374.</p>        <p><a name="p95" class="pseudopara" id="p95">95.</a>  The obligation imposed upon an appellate court even where findings of fact are involved is constantly stressed in the cases.

But the parties to the cause are nevertheless entitled, as well on questionof fact as on questions of law, to demand the decision of the Court of Appeal, and that Court cannot excuse itself from the taskof weighing conflicting evidence and drawing its own inferences and conclusions, though it should always bear in mind that it hasneither seen nor heard the witnesses, and should make due allowance in this respect."</p>    </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a>  I conclude my references to the authorities with a citation from the judgment of Lord Greene M.R. in <u>Yuill</u> v. <u>Yuill [1945]</u> p.15, at pp.19-20:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"We were reminded of certain well-known observations in the House of Lords dealing with the position of an appellate court when thejudgment of the trial judge has been based in whole or in part on his opinion of the demeanour of witnesses. It can, of course, onlybe on the rarest occasions, and in circumstances where the appellate court is convinced by the plainest considerations, that it wouldbe justified in finding that the trial judge had formed a wrong opinion.  But when the court is so convinced it is, in my opinion,entitled and indeed bound to give effect to its conviction.  It has never been laid down by the House of Lords that an appellatecourt has no power to take this course. Puisne judges would be the last persons to lay claim to infallibility, even in assessingthe demeanour of a witness. The most experienced judge may, albeit rarely, be deceived by a clever liar, or led to form an unfavourableopinion of an honest witness, and may express his view that his demeanour was excellent or bad as the case may be.  Most experiencedcounsel can, I have no doubt, recall at least one case where this has happened to their knowledge.  I may further point out thatan impression as to the demeanour of a witness ought not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of theevidence of the witness in question. If it can be demonstrated to conviction that a witness whose demeanour has been praised by thetrial judge has on some collateral matter deliberately given an untrue answer, the favourable view formed by the judge as to hisdemeanour must necessarily lose its value.â</p>         </blockquote>            <p><a name="p98" class="pseudopara" id="p98">98.</a>  I think, it is here desirable to set out what the judge had to say about his impression of the witnesses as they gave evidence beforehim.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p99" class="pseudopara" id="p99">99.</a>  He said that although Madam Law was almost illiterate, she was c1early intelligent.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p100" class="pseudopara" id="p100">100.</a>  About the go-between for the sale of the note for $10 million, Mr. Chan Chun Yip, the judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âHe was considerably pressed in cross-examination and in examination-in-chief about the nature of the note which he thought he wasbuying and about his comparison.

The reasons for this given by the plaintiffs are frankly unconvincing."</p>    </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">And later:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"I have already mentioned some very unusual and surprising features of the plaintiffsâ account of the acquisition of the note -no documentation; an inability to trace the vendor;  a possible coincidence in relation to the price and the money available on mortgage.â..</p>    </blockquote>        <p><a name="p105" class="pseudopara" id="p105">105.</a>  In the light of these comments, I think it to be necessary to review what the Plaintiffs said about Mr. Lau Wai Yeeâs address,the absence of a receipt and the raising of the money by way of mortgage in readiness for the purchase of the note.</p>        <p><a name="p106" class="pseudopara" id="p106">106.</a>  When asked about the whereabouts of Mr. Lau Wai Yee in cross-examination, Mr. Chan said that he used to have his address but whenhis solicitors had asked him for it, Mr. Lau had moved. His was an address in: the U. S .A., in San Francisco. They had since lostcontact. He had written Mr. Lau's address down in a diary, not in an address book, and he had thrown the diary away when he and hiswife had moved house in September or October 1982. When Mr. Lau had come to Hong Kong to sell the note, he had told him that he wasliving in San Francisco and that he might be moving. He had thrown the diary away when they were moving "when I saw it was not significant."</p>        <p><a name="p107" class="pseudopara" id="p107">107.</a>  His solicitors had asked him to see if he could locate the address of the person who had sold him the note. He had gone back hometo look for the address and it had then occurred to him that he had thrown it away with other writings in a heap which were not thoughtto be important. He wanted to phone a friend to see if he could locate Mr. Lau but it turned out that the friend was no longer atthe address he rang. He had made no further enquiries and could not find Mr. Lau.</p>        <p><a name="p108" class="pseudopara" id="p108">108.</a>  Madam Law said in cross-examination that she did not know where Mr. Lau Wai Yeeâs address was. She had no copy. She had been toldby her solicitors to give them his address. She had given all the correspondence and the address to her solicitors (which she named)who were then acting for her. She said that it was written on a piece of paper with his address and telephone number on it.</p>        <p><a name="p109" class="pseudopara" id="p109">109.</a>  When it was suggested to Madam Law that if they had really bought the note for $350,000, they would have obtained a receipt, shereplied:</p>   <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âBut Lau did not have a shop. It would have been useless for him to write a receipt on a blank sheet. At time I thought I was willingto buy and he was wanting to sell. It was not necessary to have a receipt."</p>   </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p110" class="pseudopara" id="p110">110.</a>  When Mr. Chan was asked why they had not obtained a receipt, he replied: âBy that time I was not in this trade at all. I onlycollected as I loved it."</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p111" class="pseudopara" id="p111">111.</a>  In connection with the lack of documentation, I think it is necessary to refer to another part of Madam Lawâs cross-examination.She said that whenever her husband bought "antiques" she raised a mortgage to provide the money. She had borrowed money by way ofmortgage when they had bought No. 7 Argyle Street, but all the subsequent mortgages were raised to pay for "items". It is clear fromthe tenor of her evidence that she was including her husbandâs collection of bank notes in the expression âantiques". She hadkept separate accounts in relation to the antiques which had been bought. Then she said that she had made âcasual notes here andthere" in her son's exercise book, but had thrown everything away after their business had been closed. She concluded this pieceof evidence by saying::</p>   <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"The exercise book was thrown away. He [her husband] accused me of burning important documents.  Then I retorted that I was in a fitof anger and I might even have burned your collection.â</p>   </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">The judge noted that the exercise book had not been included in the Plaintiffsâ List of Documents.</p>        <p><a name="p112" class="pseudopara" id="p112">112.</a>  In this context, I would mention that Mr. Chan displayed 16 bank notes to the trial judge, some of which were acquired before, andsome after, the note for which he paid $350,000 to Mr. Lau Wai Yee. He said he could not remember exactly when he bought each ofthe 16 notes.</p>        <p><a name="p113" class="pseudopara" id="p113">113.</a>  In cross-examination he was asked what he had paid for each note and he wrote down the figures. I think that if one adds these sumstogether they come to something in the region of $2.4 million. Among the notes he had collected were a $1,000 note for which he hadpaid $1 million and a $500 note which was bought at $700,000; both came into his hands after he had bought the note which is thesubject matter of this action.</p>        <p><a name="p114" class="pseudopara" id="p114">114.</a>  The only receipt Mr. Chan produced which related to these purchases was one dated 22 August 1985 for a $10 note for which he paid$100,000. He explained the wording on the receipt by saying that a $10 note could not be verified under a light and so it had tobe recorded that the seller would be responsible if there were a âmistakeâ. When asked about the absence of receipts for theother notes, he said he had been given receipts for the ones he had bought from the U.S.A.. He had been given one for the $100,000transaction because the seller was able to write on paper which bore letterhead. He added: âFor others they were on blank piecesof paper which would not have been useful.â</p>        <p><a name="p115" class="pseudopara" id="p115">115.</a>  As to the mortgage, in examination-in-chief, when being asked where the money came from for the purchase of the note for $350,000and the two mirrors for $50,000, Mr. Chan looked at a bank document showing that their bank had made a mortgage loan in their favourfor $400,000 and said that this document was relevant to the loan for they had raised the money from the mortgage for the purchases.</p>        <p><a name="p116" class="pseudopara" id="p116">116.</a>  What Mr. Chan said about the mortgage in cross-examination was that the money had been advanced (as the document showed) on 28 May1983 but the money had been withdrawn bit by bit, not in one lump sum. He had to be ready with the money and the advance had beenmade, but his wife had altered the arrangements, for some of the money had been lent to others. They had to collect the money andgive it to Mr. Law Wai Yee in one lump sum. When it was suggested to him that the mortgage had nothing to do with the purchase ofthe bank note, he replied: "You would have to ask my wife. I know there was a mortgage and she had to collect the money."</p>        <p><a name="p117" class="pseudopara" id="p117">117.</a>  He explained that it was his wife who drew the cheques and had withdrawn the money. He had had nothing to do with it. He acknowledgedthat the price of $400,000 for the items they bought had not been agreed until Mr. Lau Wai Yee had come to Hong Kong and it was suggestedto him that the $400,000 had not really been earmarked for the purchase of the note. He said:</p>   <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"In fact, this money was not specifically for buying this note.  I still had money from my sale of premises in Prince Albert Roadbut I had to get the money available in the event of a purchase.   That does not mean that the $400,000 was definitely for the purchaseof this note.â</p>   </blockquote>        <p><a name="p118" class="pseudopara" id="p118">118.</a>  In examination-in-chief, Madam Law had explained to the Court how reluctant she was to allow her husband to spend a great deal ofmoney on buying the bank note but she had been persuaded by him that it was extremely valuable and gone along with his plans emphasizingthat she would not allow even five cents more than $400,000 to be used for the purchase.</p>        <p><a name="p119" class="pseudopara" id="p119">119.</a>  She had been asked by her husband to make arrangements for raising the money and she had agreed in May that she would do so. Shehad mortgaged the shop which belonged to them in Argyle Street for this purpose. The bank had advanced her $400,000 but, althoughshe could not remember very well about the exact timing, since Mr. Lau Wai Yee had not come when expected, the money had been requiredfor speculation in gold or stocks with Sun Hung Kai. The money advanced had been used for those purchases âor if not, it was lentto othersâ. She had used the money elsewhere. She was not quite sure when Mr. Lau Wai Yee had come to Hong Kong. She had been indifficulty in raising the money and she explained how she had utilized money from other sources.</p>        <p><a name="p120" class="pseudopara" id="p120">120.</a>  When it was suggested to Madam Law that the raising of the loan for $400,000 in May had nothing to do with the purchase of the banknote, she replied:</p>   <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"I disagree.  I have said  the mortgage was for the transaction and he came a month late by which time I spent the money. My husbandwas buying antiques so I had to get the mortgagee to get the money for him."</p>   </blockquote>        <p><a name="p121" class="pseudopara" id="p121">121.</a>  It was then suggested to her that it was quite a coincidence that the money raised turned out to be the exact sum paid to Mr. LauWai Yee when he came later with the items he had for sale. She acknowledged that no price had been agreed when the mortgage had beenraised and said that the price paid for the items they decided to buy was not a matter of coincidence.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p122" class="pseudopara" id="p122">122.</a>  Referring to the mortgage, in the course of his judgment, the judge said this:</p>        <p><a name="p123" class="pseudopara" id="p123">123.</a>  But I am satisfied on the whole of the evidence that this note was purchased and that it was purchased for a very considerable sum.I have no reason to doubt that it was purchased for three hundred and fifty thousand dollars because of the support that this isgiven by the mortgage that was obtained, although the money was used in a different way, and that it was obtained from LAW Wai-yee.â</p>        <p><a name="p124" class="pseudopara" id="p124">124.</a>  Mr. Rogers has suggested, in effect, that the judge could not have meant precisely what he said. Of course, passages in judgmentsmust not be read in isolation. They are not be construed as if they were statutes and therefore made subject to minute dissection.Moreover the judge had indicated elsewhere that he believed all the important aspects of the Plaintiffsâ case for other reasons.But; with all respect, I think the Bank is entitled to point to this passage as a misdirection. If a person borrows $10,000 froma bank to buy a gold watch for that sum, of course, the Court may believe that he did so, but if he spends the money he borrowedon something else, and the price he paid for the watch is in issue, the loan agreement itself cannot lend support to his evidencethat he paid $10,000 for the watch.</p>        <p><a name="p125" class="pseudopara" id="p125">125.</a>  I return to the judge's comments. No doubt when he used the words "surprising features" the judge would also have had in mind, too,whether it was inherently likely that Mr. Chan would pay so large a sum as $350,000 for an error note when he had just began to collectthem (this being the first "significant" note he had bought) at a time when he knew nothing whatever about the value of such notes.The judge would, of course, have considered the reasons Mr. Chan had given for spending so much money on it.</p>        <p><a name="p126" class="pseudopara" id="p126">126.</a>  As to the agreement by Mr. Chan Shun Hoi to buy the note for $10 million, the judge said that while he was satisfied that the accountgiven about this transaction was âextremely bizarre" he felt sure it was not a fabricated account. However, he felt that once Mr.Chan Shun Hoi had come to his senses in the matter, the chances of the sale going through for $10 million was âquite remoteâ.He gave his assessment of Mr. Chan Shun Hoi as a man with âa great deal more money than senseâ and mentioned his lack of knowledgeabout error notes and their rarity. He concluded as follows:</p>   <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"But if one thinks through what was likely to have happenedï¼ CHAN Shun-hoi wanted a certificate in relation to the notes showingthat it was genuine. That could not have been obtained from the bank on the day that Chan Chun-yip was there.  If a certificate hadbeen sought,  a lot of tests would have been necessary. They would have gone to solicitors.  Once solicitors were brought in, I believethat CHAN Shun-hoi would have come to his senses and the chances of this deal going through in the end were remote.  However, I doaccept that so far as the plaintiff was concerned, he really believed that it would go through."</p>   </blockquote>        <p><a name="p127" class="pseudopara" id="p127">127.</a>  The judge was fully justified in describing the account of this transaction as being âextremely bizarreâ. Quite apart from whatthe other witnesses said about it, one has only to read Mr. Chan Shun Hoiâs evidence to see what an curious story it was.</p>        <p><a name="p128" class="pseudopara" id="p128">128.</a>  Mr. Chan Shun Hoi is a business man and runs night clubs and as well as selling electrical products. He lives, and all his businessactivities are, in Thailand.</p>        <p><a name="p129" class="pseudopara" id="p129">129.</a>  He told the Court that he had heard about the $1,000 note printed in the colour of a $500 note during a telephone conversation withMr. Chan Chun Yip. He could not remember exactly when this was, but it was some time in April, May or June 1983. He was told thatthe note was for sale. He felt that it was not possible that there could be such a note but if there were, he was interested in buyingit. The asking price mentioned by Mr. Chan Chun Yip was HK$15 million and he told him that he was interested but only if a bargainprice could be reached.</p>        <p><a name="p130" class="pseudopara" id="p130">130.</a>  Mr. Chan Chun Yip had returned to Thailand. They had talked about the note again and at that time bargaining about the sale pricewas still going on. He told Mr. Chan that he would be willing to pay $10 million for it and that he should act as his agent on hisbehalf.</p>        <p><a name="p131" class="pseudopara" id="p131">131.</a>  The reason why he was prepared to pay such a high price for the note was because in his opinion there was no other note like itin the world. He had other notes in his possession "in old money". These notes were from several countries including Thailand andthe U.S.A.. He also collected antiques.</p>        <p><a name="p132" class="pseudopara" id="p132">132.</a>  He gave Mr. Chan a written authorization to act on his behalf and the arrangement was for the Bank to certify that the note wasgenuine and then a deposit of $2 million would be paid by Mr. Chan on his behalf. This money was to come from cash in Mr. Chan'sname in Hong Kong, but which belonged to him. Later, Mr. Chan told him that the note had been seized by the Bank and the deal fellthrough.</p>        <p><a name="p133" class="pseudopara" id="p133">133.</a>  When, later still, Mr. Chan Chun Yip told him that there might be a chance of getting the note back, he told him that if this werepossible he still wanted to buy the note. If all had gone well, there could have been a certificate from the bank to say that thenote was genuine and then a contract for sale and purchase would be made out at a solicitor's office. He would then have come himselfto Hong Kong to pay the balance of $8 million.</p>        <p><a name="p134" class="pseudopara" id="p134">134.</a>  When asked in cross-examination where the HK$8 million would have come from, he said he would have sent the money to Hong Kong viathe black market. There were agencies to whom money could be given in Thailand and the equivalent collected in Hong Kong.</p>        <p><a name="p135" class="pseudopara" id="p135">135.</a>  He said that he had bought the note because he thought he could make a large profit from it. He had heard about a stamp which wasworth between USS600,000 and US$700,000 and he thought that the bank note could make a greater profit than that. He had no idea ofprice or value at that time, He just wanted to buy the note and keep if for a while until the right time came to sell it.</p>        <p><a name="p136" class="pseudopara" id="p136">137.</a>  Since there was no other bank note of its kind in the world it would be worth more than the stamp he had heard about. It was onlythe price of this stamp he had read about which made him form this opinion. He could not remember the most he had ever paid for astamp. People told him about stamps and he simply paid them. He knew nothing about their importance, so he could not give any detailsabout his purchases of stamps.</p>        <p><a name="p137" class="pseudopara" id="p137">137.</a>  All he knew about his antiques was that they were expensive. He had so many antiques that he could not remember them all. Therewere labels on them which had been read to him. He was particularly interested in buying Buddhas and had a large collection of them.The most he had ever paid for one which was $1 million Baht. He gave an exchange rate to the Court of $3.5 Baht for HK$l [this comesto something over HK$285,000].</p>        <p><a name="p138" class="pseudopara" id="p138">138.</a>  He acknowledged that he knew nothing about error notes, and when asked why he had been prepared to pay $10 million for one, he answered:</p><blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"Like Buddhas - they are lot of good ones, also mis-printed stamps, you can sell at a high price â now if I got the note, thereis no other one in the world and if I have it there is no other one in the world."</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p139" class="pseudopara" id="p139">139.</a>  He could not remember when he had read In a newspaper about the sale of the stamp for something in the region of US$500,000. Itwas a long time ago. Nor could he remember what sort of stamp it was. He remembered the price was in that region although he couldnot be sure about the exact figure.</p>        <p><a name="p140" class="pseudopara" id="p140">140.</a>  He accepted that although he knew nothing about error bank notes he had made no enquiries as to whether there were other similarones to be had, but said that he would not have bought such a note if other similar bank notes were in existence. Nor did he knowanything about prices paid for error bank notes and yet he had not sought the opinion of anyone as to the value of such notes.</p>        <p><a name="p141" class="pseudopara" id="p141">141.</a>  He thought that the note would be worth more than the stamp he had heard about because it was the only one of its kind in the world.</p>        <p><a name="p142" class="pseudopara" id="p142">142.</a>  With great respect to the judge's conclusion quoted above, Mr. Chan Shun Poi had sworn to the Court that he was always ready togo ahead with the deal as evidenced by the "certificate" produced by his agent Mr. Chan Chun Yip. If, despite this, he was likelyto have come to his senses and gone back on the deal when the transaction was being formalized in a solicitor's office, I think itwould be legitimate to comment that it might well be that in the real world no one would agree to buy a note which he had not seenfor $10 million, particularly when he had never bought an error note before and hoped to make an eventual profit.</p>        <p><a name="p143" class="pseudopara" id="p143">143.</a>  The judge will not comment on his impression of this witness when he was giving evidence but I am bound to say that his evidenceseems barely credible as one reads the record.</p>        <p><a name="p144" class="pseudopara" id="p144">144.</a>  Since the judge recognized, and rightly recognized, the inherent difficulties in the evidence led by the Plaintiffs to prove thepurchase of the note for $350,000 and the agreement for sell it for $10 million, it is of great importance to pay particular attentionto anything Mr. Chan or his wife might have said about these matters before they came to Court.</p>        <p><a name="p145" class="pseudopara" id="p145">145.</a>  Miss Christina Lau and Miss Annie Pau, the two tellers who gave evidence for the Bank, told the Court that when Madam Law had broughtthe note in for verification, she told them that it had been given to her by a customer who was making a purchase and, if the notewas found to be genuine, she would telephone her husband at the shop to give the customer change.</p>        <p><a name="p146" class="pseudopara" id="p146">146.</a>  In cross-examination, Miss Christina Lau said that Madam Law had said that a customer was waiting for change, she thought that thiswas the reason why she was impatient â because she did not know whether the customer should be given change or not.</p>        <p><a name="p147" class="pseudopara" id="p147">147.</a>  In cross-examination when it was suggested to Madam Law that the true origin of the note was that it came into their hands in thecourse of business from a customer, she replied as follows:</p><blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"Regarding this I was not connected with the Hong Kong Bank  when I presented the note.  She said:  âWhere did you get the note? Give me your I.D. card.â  Why should I tell her when she threatened me ....Â·Â·"</p></blockquote>        <p><a name="p148" class="pseudopara" id="p148">148.</a>  When it was pointed out to her that the girls would give evidence to the effect that she had said that the note had been given toher husband in the course of business, she replied that the teller had asked her so many questions and she had asked the teller whyshe was being questioned. She added: âI said why and I said I got it in business.â</p>        <p><a name="p149" class="pseudopara" id="p149">149.</a>  When it was put to her that she had in fact said that if the Bank acknowledged that the note was genuine, she would phone so thatthe customer could receive change, she said she would not say something that was not true.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p150" class="pseudopara" id="p150">150.</a>  She was then asked:</p><blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"Did you tell the teller that your husband was with the customer and you would phone so that he could give him the change?â</p></blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p151" class="pseudopara" id="p151">151.</a>  She replied:</p><blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"I never said anything about my husband.â</p></blockquote>        <p><a name="p152" class="pseudopara" id="p152">152.</a>  This is what Madam Law said about the statement she made and signed in the police station on 21 September 1983, in examination-in-chief:</p>        <p><a name="p153" class="pseudopara" id="p153">153.</a>  âI say [in the statement] that I got the note in the course of business. When I was making this statement, the policeman toldme what had happened had to be reduced into writing and I repeated what I said at the Bank . When I presented the note she shoutedat me and demanded the card. Under the circumstances I was not frank and I wanted to conceal. She asked me how I got the note andI wanted to conceal and said I got it when I was doing business. I wanted my police statement to conform with what I said at theBank. He told me to tell what I said there the other day and so I repeated what I said. I said that because I was threatened by theteller and I wanted to conceal.â</p>        <p><a name="p154" class="pseudopara" id="p154">154.</a>  Madam Law was cross-examined on her police statement. This statement was in the nature of a complaint against the Bank and explainedhow her note had been missed. In the statement she had said:</p><blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAround 6 pm on 16.9.83, I received a HK$1000 note No.CO88191 (belongs to Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank) while I was doing businessat the above address. At that time, I saw that the colour of the HK$1000 note was different from that of the normal HK$1000 noteof HKSB. The colour of the note was the same as that of HK$500 note. Moreover, I was able to identify the water mark on the noteby using a counterfeit money detector. At the time, I knew that the note is a misprinted one. I think that the note is very valuableand I will keep it because it is often reported in the newspapers that the value of misprinted bank notes is very high.â</p></blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p155" class="pseudopara" id="p155">155.</a>  The following question and answer is recorded towards the end of the police statement:</p><blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ. Are you sure that the misprinted note is very valuable?â</p>        <p class="quote">âA. I myself think that the misprinted bank notes [are] very valuable. Moreover, I will not sell it even though someone offereda high price because my husband and I have the hobby of collecting and keeping valuable property.â</p></blockquote>        <p><a name="p156" class="pseudopara" id="p156">156.</a>  She said that the policeman had asked her what had happened and so she had told him. The police officer had shown the statementto her husband but he had refused to sign it.</p>        <p><a name="p157" class="pseudopara" id="p157">157.</a>  It was suggested to her that what she had said in her statement about the note being handed in during the course of business was,in fact, the truth. She said she did not agree. It was then put to her that she had told the same story to the teller. Her repliesthen became very confused and confusing because she mixed together what she told the tellers and what she told the police. She saidthat this was not true and that she was evading questions for it was not necessary for her to tell the teller anything. She had notrevealed what business she was engaged in to the teller. She had been forced into saying this. She had made a report to the policein the hope that the note would be returned. It was not necessary for her to say "that muchâ. She had not told the teller whereshe had got the note from. She had been asked how she had come by the note and she had replied that she was a business person andthe note was a genuine one.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p158" class="pseudopara" id="p158">158.</a>  She then said in reply to a question:</p><blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"Yes, I told the police what happened - about I.D. card - about threats - about the note being alleged forged.  I said I receivedthe note in the course of my business. I told the police what happened at the bank about [the note] being suspected to be a fake- asked for I.D. card - refused to give it - and then upon repeatedly being asked I said to the bank people âWould it be alrightfor me to have received the note in the course of my businessââ.</p>   </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p159" class="pseudopara" id="p159">159.</a>  It was suggested to her that she was making up her story as she went along and she denied this.</p>        <p><a name="p160" class="pseudopara" id="p160">160.</a>  Then occurs the following passage and here she was referring to what she told the tellers in the bank and not what she related tothe police:</p>        <p><a name="p161" class="pseudopara" id="p161">161.</a>  âI told them I was in the fashion business and then under threats I told them I had come by the note in the course of my fashionbusiness. I also told them my husband was a collector. It occurred to me after report was made to the police the note would be returned.I went with the officer. I thought the note would be returned.â</p>        <p><a name="p162" class="pseudopara" id="p162">162.</a>  When the sentence in her police statement about receiving the note during the course of business on 16 September 1983 was specificallyput to her, she replied:</p>   <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"I had been threatened.  At this time I did not think I had to say much â after all, I had ownership of this note. I thought I didnot have to tell a long story about the note. Also I told the police that the note was very valuable.  At that time I was suspectedthat the note was forged.  I wanted to avoid the question.â</p>   </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p163" class="pseudopara" id="p163">163.</a>  She later said:</p>  <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt was my idea. When I was threatened I said as I related I have told the police. What the teller said to me. I think receipt wasused to deceive me. I thought I had avoided the question when teller asked me. I told the police the same story. I thought therewould be no problem about how I got the note if it was authentic.â</p>  </blockquote>        <p><a name="p164" class="pseudopara" id="p164">164.</a>  When the whole of the paragraph containing her account of how the note came into her hands was put to her, she said:</p>  <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"This is not a true statement. I was forced and I was afraid of being arrested and I just went along as matters came to me. I couldhardly do anything if they said it was false.  I do not have the guts.  This is my own affair</p>  </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p165" class="pseudopara" id="p165">165.</a>  When she was asked about the question and answer recorded at the end of the statement, she replied:</p>  <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âI thought that if I gave full story it would be very long and I was concerned with the validity of the receipt and most importantpoint was the note's authenticity. Subsequently I cried and said the note was valuable. I do not admit statement over my dead body.Truth was otherwise, Later I cried and told the bank the truth."</p>  </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p166" class="pseudopara" id="p166">166.</a>  Madam Law was not asked anything in re-examination about the account she gave at the bank about the way the note came into her handsor about her statement to the police.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p167" class="pseudopara" id="p167">167.</a>  The police statement was also put to Madam Lawâs husband, Mr. Chan, in cross-examination. I would remark here that it was commonground that the police statement was really a joint statement made by both husband and wife although it records only Madam Lawâsspeaking and only she signed it.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p168" class="pseudopara" id="p168">168.</a>  He said that the police had been helpful on that day and he had no complaint about the conduct of the interview which resulted inthe statement recorded. The police officer had told him to say what had happened. The reason he had not told the police that he hadthe valuable contract on the note was because he was afraid that if he said it was valuable then the Hong Kong Bank would take it.They would take away valuable items.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p169" class="pseudopara" id="p169">169.</a>  He said he had told the police that the note was very valuable and that he would not sell it no matter how high the price offeredwas, as stated in the report.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p170" class="pseudopara" id="p170">170.</a>  Mr. Chan went on to say that he did not have to tell the police about the contract with Mr. Chan Chun Yip. When his attention wasdirected to the passage in the statement about receiving the note in business on 16 September he said this was not true and explainedthat his wife had been "relating events in accordance with sequence. It is not true on this point." His wife had signed a false statementon that point.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p171" class="pseudopara" id="p171">171.</a>  He said he had hoped throughout that the Bank would give the note back to them. That was why he had said it had been received inthat way. He had hoped that the Bank would act in good faith and give it back to him. Both he and his wife thought at that time thatthe note would be returned to the them and he added:</p>  <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"If we said that the note did not have any excessive value it might be given back to us.â</p>  </blockquote>        <p><a name="p172" class="pseudopara" id="p172">172.</a>  Later, Mr. Chan said that they had âcooked upâ a story to tell the police on their way to the police station from the Bank.They had agreed that they should not tell others about the value of the note. He added:</p>  <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âI am saying that 1 cooked up a story on way to police station that we received the note the previous day."</p>  </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p173" class="pseudopara" id="p173">173.</a>  After being further cross-examined on the matter, this is what Mr. Chan said:</p>  <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhen I told them this, I did not expect it [the police statement] to be presented in Court today. I thought I could get the noteback in 10 days and that the statement would be destroyed. I told the detective that the note was valuable because I hoped that theywould make efforts to get the note back for me. I thought that if the bank returned me the note, then this would not be disclosedand I did not expect it to be presented in Court today.â</p>  </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p174" class="pseudopara" id="p174">174.</a>  This is what Mr. Chan said in re-examination about the police statement:</p>  <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThere is no inconsistency with me telling the police that it was valuable. In the police station, I said it was valuable in thehope of them getting it back for me. I did not tell them about the $10 million contract because I did not have to. It sufficed totell them that it was valuable for them to get it back. There is a difference between me saying it was valuable and saying that acontract for $10 million to sell it [had been made]. If I had said $10 million, the police officer might not have believed me andnot tried to get it back.â</p>  </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p175" class="pseudopara" id="p175">175.</a>  Mr. Chan added that the reason for not telling the bank about the $10 million contract was that the note had been taken for verification.He had not instructed his wife to tell the bank about the contract. Since there would be a large number of people in the bank, hehad been afraid that âif the transaction was mentioned it would affect the matter.â When he had himself gone to the bank to tryto recover the note, he had not said anything about the $10 million contract because he did not have to say anything about it. Itwas his own affair.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p176" class="pseudopara" id="p176">176.</a>  The importance of what I will call these plainly inconsistent statements is, of course, that they go to the credibility of the Plaintiffson the central issues of the case. The previous statements make no mention of the purchase of the note, or of the agreement for itsre-sale, or of the money involved at each stage, and give a different account of the way the note came into their hands. Placed sideby side with the evidence given in Court, both versions cannot be true. The discrediting effect of such previous inconsistent evidencedoes not depend upon whether or not the Plaintiffs were deliberately lying. The Plaintiffs, however, revealed defects of recollectionor honesty which must render their testimony in Court potentially unreliable.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">We are denied the advantage the judge had of seeing the Plaintiffs giving evidence over a number of days, but demeanour apart, anappellate court is in a position to reach its own conclusions as to whether any explanations given for the previous inconsistentstatements are inherently credible. In relation to Madam Law, when dealing with the bailment issue, the judge said this about herprevious accounts:</p> <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â I have not overlooked the fact that at some stage the second plaintiff indicated or implied that she got the note in the courseof business. If her evidence is examined, it is clear that she was uneasy about error notes and about her husbandâs possessionof them. She was not sure at one stage, it seems, whether anyone ought to have such notes in their possession.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">It was when she was being challenged and it was suggested that it might be a forgery that she implied, perhaps not directly, thatshe got the note in the course of business; and she repeated that lie â because even if she implied it, it was one â in her statementlater to the police.</p>        <p class="quote">Further, I donât overlook the fact that she might have said something about her husband waiting for the result of the verification.If she said something like that, it was done in her anxiety and her distress to try and get the note back and try to persuade thebank to rely upon the light.â</p> </blockquote>        <p><a name="p177" class="pseudopara" id="p177">177.</a>  The judge went on to say that these matters did not in any way disturb his finding that Madam Law had indicated to the Bank thatshe wanted the note verified and handed back to her, and had indicated that she thought the note was valuable.</p>        <p><a name="p178" class="pseudopara" id="p178">178.</a>  The judge did not refer again to Madam Lawâs previous statements to the Bank and to the police about the provenance of the notewhen he was addressing the issues whether or not there had in fact been a purchase of the note for $350,000 from Mr. Lau Wai Yee,and an agreement to sell it for $10 million to Mr. Chan Shun Hoi. It is unlikely that he overlooked these matters when dealing withthose issues, but in a long case like this it could happen, if I may be permitted to say so.</p>        <p><a name="p179" class="pseudopara" id="p179">179.</a>  As I read the passage from the judgment I have quoted, I do not think that it can be said that the judge was rejecting the tellersâevidence that Madam Law had told them that the note had been given to her by a customer during the course of business and if it werefound to be genuine she would telephone her husband so that he could give the customer change. If this reading is correct, then MadamLaw did not admit that she had said all this and therefore she herself offered no explanation for what she had earlier said. I remarkin passing that she had said in evidence that her husband was minding their shop and this was why he had not accompanied her to thebank.</p>        <p><a name="p180" class="pseudopara" id="p180">180.</a>  As to her police statement, I am bound to say that as the record reads, without the benefit of seeing her giving her evidence, MadamLawâs explanations, varying as they went along, about its contents appear evasive and unconvincing.</p>        <p><a name="p181" class="pseudopara" id="p181">181.</a>  On one essential point, the statement was consistent with what she had told the tellers (that they had come by the note in the courseof business) and inconsistent with what she said in Court. Her explanation, in so far as one can understand it, that she wanted herpolice statement to conform with what she had said at the bank[although it was not true because the police officer taking down thestatement told her to say what had happened at the Bank, does not, in print at least, have the ring of truth about it.</p>        <p><a name="p182" class="pseudopara" id="p182">182.</a>  Be all that as it may, the reasons given by both husband and wife for answering the question at the end of the police statementin the way that they did, on the bare record, seems highly suspect. Here they were, making a formal complaint to the police of theseizure of the note which they wanted to recover. If they really had bought it for the huge sum of $350,000 and secured a re-saleat the enormous sum of $10 million, when they were asked how they could be sure that the note was valuable, having earlier stressedthat it was so, even if the figures involved were to be concealed, surely they would have said either, âwe bought it for a largesumâ or âwe have agreed to sell it for a large sumâ or both. And one must ask how they could have told the police that theywould not sell the note even if a high price were offered to them, when they had already agreed to do just that.</p>        <p><a name="p183" class="pseudopara" id="p183">183.</a>  The judge did not indicate that he had considered the possible effect upon Mr. Chanâs credibility about his account in Court ofthe acquisition and re-sale of the note by reason of the contents of the police statement, which, as we know, he acknowledged tobe, in effect, a joint one. He admitted, as we have seen, that he and his wife had deliberately combined to tell a false story tothe police about how they came by the note, and his explanation for having done so, on paper, strains credulity too far.</p>        <p><a name="p184" class="pseudopara" id="p184">184.</a>  Then there in his astonishing statement that although he was impressing upon the police that the note was valuable, he thought thatif he mentioned the $10 million contract, the police officer might not have believed him, and might not have tried to recover thenote. But this is not all. There is also his later explanation that he thought that the police statement would be destroyed so thathe did not expect to be confronted with it.</p>        <p><a name="p185" class="pseudopara" id="p185">185.</a>  The judge did not refer to a visit made by Madam Law to the Bank early in October and what she said about the provenance of thenote on that occasion. It was common ground that she had visited the Bank on several occasions after the incident that occurred on17 September 1983, in fruitless efforts to recover the bank note.</p>        <p><a name="p186" class="pseudopara" id="p186">186.</a>  The teller, Miss Christina Lau, told the Court that early in October Madam Law had come to the Bank and shown her an album. Thefirst page contained a $500 note with discrepant numbers on it and there was a blank space next to it. Madam Law told her that herhusband had bought the note which had been kept by the Bank as well as the $500 note still in the album for $100,000. She said thatshe had been afraid that her husband might have been cheated and this was why she had taken it out from her husbandâs safe andpresented it to the Bank for verificiation</p>        <p><a name="p187" class="pseudopara" id="p187">187.</a>  Miss Lau pointed out that she had told her earlier that it had come from a customer during a purchase. Madam Law had replied thatshe had earlier lied to her about that. She asked for the return of the note and was crying. Miss Lau said she could not help andMadam Lau had left the Bank still in tears. She was corroborated on this piece of evidence in every detail by the other teller, MissAnnie Hau.</p>        <p><a name="p188" class="pseudopara" id="p188">188.</a>  The record indicates that although in relation to their evidence in general it had been suggested to each of the tellers that theyhad combined to tell a false story out of their loyalty to the Bank, a suggestion which they vehemently denied, they were very sketchilycross-examined on this visit.</p>        <p><a name="p189" class="pseudopara" id="p189">189.</a>  When this incident had been put to Madam Law in cross-examination, and she had been asked whether it was not true that she had toldthe tellers that she had taken the album from her husbandâs safe without his consent because she wanted to make sure that the notewas genuine, she denied it. She had only said that her husband was a collector and she had shown the album for that purpose.</p>        <p><a name="p190" class="pseudopara" id="p190">190.</a>  When she was pressed that she had said she wanted the note verified because she was afraid that her husband had been cheated, sherepeated that she had only produced the book to show that her husband was a collector, adding that she had told the teller that shemust be given the note back otherwise her husband would throw her into the sea. It was put to her that the teller had asked her whyshe had told a different story on 17 September about getting the note in the course of business and that she had admitted that shehad told a lie on that occasion. She replied, somewhat enigmatically, that the girl in question was not the one who had taken thenote on 17 September.</p>        <p><a name="p191" class="pseudopara" id="p191">191.</a>  This, to my mind, was very significant evidence for it showed, if the tellersâ account could be relied upon, that Madam Law wasgiving yet another account about the acquisition and value of the note. Moreover, of course, if she really did say that, and it werethe truth, it gives the lie to the whole story of the $350,000 purchase and the $10 million re-sale. It wou1d explain why she reallywent to the bank to have the note verified. Moreover it makes her husbandâs anger with her for having lost the note more understandableand would account for all that happened after the note was seized. It is certainly very difficult to give credence to the reasonMr. Chan himself gave for being so angry with his wife - because she had gone on to the Bank after her visit to the Bank of EastAsia without his knowledge and consent.</p>        <p><a name="p192" class="pseudopara" id="p192">192.</a>  Mr. Rogers suggests that the judge could not have overlooked this evidence and that it must be assumed that he preferred Madam Law'sversion of what took place on that occasion. But the judge did not disbelieve the whole of the tellers' evidence. Rejecting thispart of their evidence would mean that they had put their heads together to take advantage of Madam Law's October visit to the Bank,and her bringing her husbandâs album to show them, to add to what she really said. One must ask what would be the point of MadamLaw showing them the album to indicate her husband was a collector of bank notes without opening it? And so the two different versionsof what happened coincide to a striking degree.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p193" class="pseudopara" id="p193">193.</a>  In my view, the Bank was entitled to a finding on this crucial piece of evidence.</p>        <p><a name="p194" class="pseudopara" id="p194">194.</a>  However, if Madam Law was telling the truth as to what she had said on this visitï¼ and had been begging for the return of thenote, in tears, because otherwise her husband would throw her into the sea, she again did not mention what she now says was the trueprovenance of the note, the money paid for it and the agreement for its re-sale.</p>        <p><a name="p195" class="pseudopara" id="p195">195.</a>  Indeed, I would comment here, that the first the Bank knew of the enormous claim against them in money terms was when they saw theaffirmation Mr. Chan filed on 10 March 1984 (in support of an application for Interrogatories) 6 months after the incident whichgave rise to the action, and nearly 2 months after the issue of the Writ which was indorsed with a Statement of Claim which thenmade no reference to the loss of the $10 million deal. Nor was there any mention of the sums involved in the pre-action correspondence.</p>        <p><a name="p196" class="pseudopara" id="p196">196.</a>  I now examine the support given to the Plaintiffs' case by the agent for the re-sale of the note, Mr. Chan Chun Yip. The judge commentedthat "his account of the events which followed him leaving the Bank of East Asia [was] very strange". One has only to read his evidence,to see how strange it was. If his evidence could not properly be relied upon, the whole of the Plaintiffs' case breaks down, so crucialis the role played.</p>        <p><a name="p197" class="pseudopara" id="p197">197.</a>  In examination-in-chief, Mr. Chan Chun Yip said that in accordance with the arrangements that had been made to have the note verified,he had gone to the Bank of East Asia branch in Nathan Road with Madam Law. He sat down inside the bank near the entrance and lookedat the bank note. He then told Madam Law to present it to the bank teller for examination. She did so, and a member of the stafftold her that the bank note was genuine, but since it had not been issued by their bank, she should take it to the Hong Kong Bankfor verification.</p>        <p><a name="p198" class="pseudopara" id="p198">198.</a>  They left the Bank of East Asia and walked towards the Hong Kong Bank but Madam Law had gone ahead of him while he came on behindher slowly. He did not go into the second bank for, when he reached the doorway, he saw that Madam Law was quarrelling with someonein the bank. He could not hear what was being said but he knew a quarrel was going on because someone asked for Madam Lawâs identitycard and there was a mention of reporting the matter to the police. He became afraid that there was something improper about thebank note so he went away.</p>        <p><a name="p199" class="pseudopara" id="p199">199.</a>  In cross-examination, Mr. Chan said that Madam Law had left the Bank of East Asia walking very fast and he had followed her slowlybecause he was old and his legs would not allow him to walk faster. When asked why in the Bank of East Asia he had not gone up tothe counter with Madam Law to hear what was being said about the note, his reply was that he considered that once the note had beenproduced to the staff they would tell the truth as to whether it was genuine or not. He added that it was not necessary for him todo so â if the staff of the bank thought that the note was not genuine and could not he used, then the bank would seize the note.</p>        <p><a name="p200" class="pseudopara" id="p200">200.</a>  He explained that Madam Law told him to go to the Hong Kong Bank and she left first. He was slow in getting up from where he hadbeen sitting in the Bank of East Asia. On the way to the Hong Kong Bank, he was smoking and he saw her going ahead very hurriedly.She went into the bank and when he reached the door of the bank he wanted to finish his cigarette before going in because it wasquite long. He was afraid of entering the bank while still smoking in case someone should scold him. He said he would have gone intothe bank but for cigarette.</p>        <p><a name="p201" class="pseudopara" id="p201">201.</a>  When it was put to him that if everything had gone smoothlyï¼ he would have had to report back to his principal that he had notbeen present when the note had been verified, he said this was not so because he would have gone into the bank when he had finishedsmoking his cigarette. He was able to hear that someone was demanding Madam Lawâs identity card and the mention of the police station.This was all he heard,. and he managed to hear this because from time to time someone opened the door of the bank outside which hewas standing.</p>        <p><a name="p202" class="pseudopara" id="p202">202.</a>  He had intended to go into the bank originally but he had become afraid and gone away. He was afraid that it might be a forged noteand he was also afraid that he might be required to become a witness; this was why he had gone away. He was afraid of becoming involvedand he did not wish to be a witness. He had ceased being afraid when he knew it was not a forged note.</p>        <p><a name="p203" class="pseudopara" id="p203">203.</a>  It was suggested to him that it was unreasonable to suppose that the person who took a bank note to a bank for verification wouldbe accused of forgery. He replied that he was aware of that, but he heard the quarrel and realised that the note would be taken awayby the bank. Since this was so he would not have been able to obtain the note, and thus there was no point in him staying there anymore.</p>        <p><a name="p204" class="pseudopara" id="p204">204.</a>  He first said that Madam Law had come out and told him that she had been asked for her identity card but immediately afterwardssaid that Madam Law had not spoken to him at all. He had seen her pocketing her identity card and that was how he had realized shehad been asked for it, and so he had gone away.</p>        <p><a name="p205" class="pseudopara" id="p205">205.</a>  He was asked why he had not stayed to hear from Madam Law what had happened. He said he had heard the argument about the note andthen he had noticed that Madam Lawâs "countenance was not good".</p>        <p><a name="p206" class="pseudopara" id="p206">206.</a>  I would mention here that Madam Law told the Court that she had told Mr. Chan Chun Yip to go with her when she went up the counterin the second bank to seek verification of the note. She went to the counter on her own. She did not know how far Mr. Chan Chun Yipwas behind her and did not even know if he come into the bank with her. She had assumed that Mr. Chan Chun Yip was behind her butshe never looked over her shoulder. After the dispute, she looked round and found he was not there. She did not know when he hadleft.</p>        <p><a name="p207" class="pseudopara" id="p207">207.</a>  As we have seen, the judge was impressed by Mr. Chan Chun Yip's evidence and we must, as the authorities emphasise, be guided bythe impression he made on the judge. But in my judgment, and with very great respect, his evidence, as one reads it, seems hardlyworthy of belief.</p>        <p><a name="p208" class="pseudopara" id="p208">208.</a>  Elderly though he was, he had come all the way from Thailand to do a job, and his explanation as to why he was not with Madam Lawat the counter, where he would naturally be expected to be, when she took the note to be verified (because he wanted to finish thecigarette he was smoking) is as inherently incredible as is the reason he gave for going off and not waiting to talk to Madam Lawabout what had happened. In my respectful opinion, he just did not behave, judged by standards of ordinary human conduct, unsophisticatedas he undoubtedly was, in the manner of a person helping to advance a $10 million transaction.</p>        <p><a name="p209" class="pseudopara" id="p209">209.</a>  I would mention here that Mr. Chan Chun Yip spoke of his comparison of the note with a $500 note before he and Madam Law went intothe Bank of East Asia, and said that he thought the note was exactly the same as a $500 note in all respects save that the figure1,000 were upon it. About this, the judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"I am satisfied that in giving that evidence he is not giving false evidence. If he were giving false evidence, one would not finda witness coming to court and making such an elementary error in the account he was supposed to give. "</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">I may be permitted to remark that this,  rare though it may be, does occasionally happen.</p>        <p><a name="p210" class="pseudopara" id="p210">210.</a>  I now turn to another matter. In my view, it was of great importance in this case, when evaluating the evidence of the two Plaintiffs,to have regard to Mr. Chan's conduct towards his wife after the note had been seized by the Bank.</p>        <p><a name="p211" class="pseudopara" id="p211">211.</a>  Madam Law acknowledged that the trouble which had ensued between herself and her husband had originated from the fact that he blamedher for losing the note. She accepted that when she had been to the bank on three or four occasions, she had cried and, at the Bank'smain treasury, when she was trying to recover the note, she had revealed that her husband had threatened to push her into the sea,and had begged the Bank not to cause her family to be broken up.</p>        <p><a name="p212" class="pseudopara" id="p212">212.</a>  She did say, however, that she was not afraid of her husband and had never been afraid of him. She denied that her children in theU.S.A. had offered to come back to look after her because of the problems she was having with her husband. She said that the quarrelswere really due to the fact that she kept refusing to give her husband money to institute the action against the Bank because shethought that they were not in a position to maintain an action against so formidable an opponent. She said that her husband had,indeed, threatened to feed her to the fish but this was before the destruction of the note.</p>        <p><a name="p213" class="pseudopara" id="p213">213.</a>  Madam Law admitted that her husband had hit her when pressing her to raise money to sue the Bank. In examination-in-chief when givingevidence in support of her claim for mental distress, she said that her husband and she had quarrelled and fought over the matter.He had hit her and she was aggrieved. They quarreled incessantly. When she cried, her three children cried with her.</p>        <p><a name="p214" class="pseudopara" id="p214">214.</a>  Mr. Chan was asked about his treatment of his wife in cross-examination, and he said that the first time he had beaten her was aftershe had presented the note and it was not returned. He said he had slapped her face once and this was on 17 September. He had donethis because he had told her to go to the Bank of East Asia and she had gone to the Hong Kong Bank without informing him. She hadacted unreasonably because she had not obtained his consent.</p>        <p><a name="p215" class="pseudopara" id="p215">215.</a>  He accepted that after the Bank had refused to return the noteï¼ he had been continuously quarrelling with his wife but he saidhe had not beaten her so badly that she had had to seek medical treatment. However, he did acknowledge that he had assaulted herto the extent that she had made a report to the police and had to consult a bone-setter.</p>        <p><a name="p216" class="pseudopara" id="p216">216.</a>  He said that he was not a naturally violent man but he had picked on his wife because she had caused him to lose his bank note.He was desperate and had taken it out on her. She had done wrong because he had not told her to take the note to the Hong Kong Bank.He went on to say:</p>        <p><a name="p217" class="pseudopara" id="p217">217.</a>  âMy wife is sometimes not scared of me. Sometimes she was hit by me and sometimes we fought. We struggled â after she had beenhit by me, she would not take it as such and end the matter so we struggled.â</p>        <p><a name="p218" class="pseudopara" id="p218">218.</a>  He accepted that it was true that the only reason his children had not gone to the United States was to stay and protect their mother.He was also prepared to accept that he was lucky that his wife still stayed with him despite all their troubles.</p>        <p><a name="p219" class="pseudopara" id="p219">201.</a>  In my judgment, this poignant and distressing story, demonstrating Mr. Chan's harsh treatment of his wife following the Bank's retentionof the note, required to be placed in the scales and a conclusion reached whether or not Madam Law's testimony was consciously orunconsciously influenced by her husband's domineering behaviour. This approach in my opinion was particularly critical because itwas common ground that both husband and wife were suffering from serious psychiatric illness at the time of the trial.</p>        <p><a name="p220" class="pseudopara" id="p220">220.</a>  There is one further matter to which I feel I should refer. We have seen that the judge concluded that what had occurred when theBank seized the note was not due to a to a simple misunderstanding, and that the action of the Bank thereafter was presumptuous,inconsiderate and arrogant. With every respect to the judgeâs views, I beg to doubt whether such epithets were wholly justified.Madam Law had demanded Bank the very note she had handed over and made it clear that she thought the note was valuable, but in thejudgeâs words: âI do not think she repeatedly said anything about this because her husband had told her not to say anything aboutthe deal which had been made. â¦.â However she said she had received the note during the course of business. Earlier the judgehad acknowledged that âthe background [was] unknown to those in the Bank â¦ about the acquisition of the note and the importanceof that note, at least to the Plaintiff.â</p>        <p><a name="p221" class="pseudopara" id="p221">221.</a>  It seems to me, with respect, that in these circumstances Madam Law was, herself, partially to blame for the way the whole unfortunateincident developed. The tellers and the manager could not have appreciated the reason for what must have appeared to them the somewhateccentric behaviour of someone who, without saying why, ascribed a special value to a note which seemed to be worth, if it were genuine,just $1,000. When they gave her a receipt for the note, in their eyes, they could not have thought that they were depriving MadamLaw of anything. Had she told the Bank on the first occasion simply that the note was a collector's item, things might have turnedout very differently and this immensely expensive litigation avoided.</p>        <p><a name="p222" class="pseudopara" id="p222">222.</a>  I now seek to app1y the principles derived from the authorities which govern the approach of a Court of Appeal where the appealis against conclusions of fact arrived at by the trial judge.</p>        <p><a name="p223" class="pseudopara" id="p223">223.</a>  The judge tried the action with anxious care and gave a very full judgment. All that I have said about his treatment of the evidence(as I hope I have indicated) and will say, is said with the utmost respect to a judge of great experience.</p>        <p><a name="p224" class="pseudopara" id="p224">224.</a>  In my judgment, the judge did not give sufficient weight to the difficulties created by the Plaintiffs for their case by their ownout of Court statements about the provenance of the note, for they both plainly revealed that habitual veracity was not one of theirattributes. This must gravely affect the credit to be accorded to the evidence they gave in Court, that they bought the note for$350,000 (upon which account, in the event, the judge based his award of damages), and agreed to sell it on for $10 million.</p>        <p><a name="p225" class="pseudopara" id="p225">225.</a>  In my view the judge did not demonstrate, that in adopting his favourable impression of the demeanour of the Plaintiffs and theirwitnesses, he had tested his impression against the whole of the evidence each was giving (recalling the words of Lord Greene M.R.in <u>Yuill</u> v.<u>Yuill</u>, at p.20.)</p>        <p><a name="p226" class="pseudopara" id="p226">226.</a>  As to the alleged agreement to sell the note for $10 million, if the Plaintiffs' impressive demeanour can be said to have justifiedthe judge accepting their evidence as to the purchase of the note from Mr. Lau Wai Yee despite "the very unusual and surprising features"of their account, there were, to my mind, such glaring improbabilities in the stories given in turn, by Mr. Chan Chun Yip and Mr.Chan Shun Hoi of their part in the affairï¼ and accepted by the judge, that however convincing their demeanour may have appeared,neither was a witness who could safely have been relied upon. I have taken the expression "glaring improbabilities" from the speechof Lord Sumner in <u>S.S. Hontestroom</u> v. <u>S.S. Sagaporack</u> (at p.50). These were, in my judgment, so evident that they were "sufficient in [themselves] to constitute a governing fact, whichin relation to others â¦ created a wrong impression."</p>        <p><a name="p227" class="pseudopara" id="p227">227.</a>  As I have earlier remarked, the judge did not comment on Mr. Chan Shun Hoiâs demeanour but that, too, must have impressed himfor he accepted the "extremely bizarre account" of the $10 million transaction, which, of course, the Plaintiffs and Mr. Chan ChunYip also supported.</p>        <p><a name="p228" class="pseudopara" id="p228">228.</a>  Whatever may be said about the evidence regarding the purchase of the note for $350,000, if the Plaintiffs did not, as I think tobe the position, by credible evidence, establish on the balance of probabilities that there was an agreement to sell the note toMr. Chan Shun Hoi for $10 million, then the reason given by the witnesses for Madam Lawâs visit to the Bank on 17 September 1983could not be relied upon. The truth might lie in one of the earlier versions given by the Plaintiffs about the provenance and valueof the note, or entirely elsewhere.</p>        <p><a name="p229" class="pseudopara" id="p229">229.</a>  In these circumstances, the evidence given by the two Plaintiffs and Mr. Chan Chun Yip about the precise colour of the note (onwhich the judge based his finding that it was a genuine error note) cannot be depended upon.</p>        <p><a name="p230" class="pseudopara" id="p230">230.</a>  I have been persuaded that this is one of those very rare cases where the Appellants have succeeded in discharging the extremelyheavy onus which was upon them, for I am convinced that my judicial obligation is to give an affirmative answer to the question suggestedby Lord Shaw in <u>Clarke</u> v. <u>Edinburgh Tramways Co.</u>, and approved by Viscount Sankey in <u>Powell</u> v. <u>Streatham Manor Nursing Home</u>:</p>        <p><a name="p231" class="pseudopara" id="p231">231.</a>  âAm I â who sit here without those advantages, sometimes broad and sometimes subtle, which are the privilege of the Judge whoheard and tried the case â in a position, not having those privileges, to come to a clear conclusion that the judge who had themwas plainly wrong?â</p>        <p><a name="p232" class="pseudopara" id="p232">232.</a>  For the reasons I have attempted to give, I would allow the Bankâs appeal and enter judgment in favour of the Plaintiffs for theface value of the note: $1,000, a sum the Bank was always willing to give them. I find no basis upon which an award of even nominaldamages could be made.</p>	<p> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><strong>Kempster, J.A. :</strong></p>    <p><a name="p233" class="pseudopara" id="p233">233.</a>  On 17th September 1983 and following a visit to the Bank of East Asia Madam Lam Sim Yuk, the second plaintiff and wife of the first,Chan Yiu Wah, asked a young female teller at the small Nathan Road mini-branch of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation,the defendants, to authenticate an unusually coloured used HK$1,000 note issued in 1979 and which she said, had been received inthe course of business. She delivered the note to the teller who consulted her manager. He thought that only the defendants' CentralTreasury could determine with assurance whether the note was genuine or counterfeit. The second plaintiff was told that it wouldbe sent for examination accordingly. She did not agree to this course and demanded its return. Her request was refused; even aftershe had procured the intervention of the police.</p>        <p><a name="p234" class="pseudopara" id="p234">234.</a>  The second plaintiff was provided with a receipt for the note "suspected of being counterfeit" which stated "This receipt shouldbe presented after seven days from the date hereof at which time the Bank will advise whether or not it is prepared to accept thenote for deposit. The issue of this receipt does not imply any obligation on the part of the Bank to make any payment in respectof the said note whether in the amount of its face value or otherwise.â Subsequently the note was found to be genuine but, nonethe less, destroyed. The defendants have at all material times been willing to furnish the plaintiffs with another HK$l,000 note.</p>        <p><a name="p235" class="pseudopara" id="p235">235.</a>  On 20th January 1984 the plaintiffs, both of whom since 17th September 1983 have been suffering from severe depression involvingacts of violence by the husband against the wife, issued a specially indorsed writ claiming against the defendants the return ofthe note and damages. The Defence denied any liability to return the specific note. The pleadings subsequently underwent a seriesof amendments but the defendantsâ liability to pay even nominal damages for detinue or conversion remained in issue. The hearingof the action before Mortimer J. took 24 days and on 21<sup>st</sup> May 1986 he found that the defendants had converted the note and awarded the plaintiffs HK$375,000 being his assessment of its value.Against that award, though not against the finding of conversion which is unarguable even on their own evidence, the defendants appeal.The plaintiffsâ cross appeal, seeking a higher award, to reflect their psychiatric illnesses and the injury to their feelings causedby the high-handed attitude of the defendants in retaining and destroying the note, has been abandoned. Mincing no words the defendantscontend that the story told by the plaintiffs and their witnesses was incredible if not fraudulent.</p>        <p><a name="p236" class="pseudopara" id="p236">236.</a>  The trial judge described the case as "one of the most interesting and fascinatingâ with which he had ever been concerned. Theevidence had ranged from the plaintiffs' arrival in Hong Kong from China in about 1958, virtually penniless, through a time of affluenceand, eventually, to an occasion in October 1983 when the second plaintiff made a final visit to the defendantsâ mini-branch inNathan Road, showed them an album andï¼ apparently unwilling to accept that it had been destroyed, implored the teller to whom shespoke to return the note. According to the tellers at the bank she said that on 17th September she had lied about the note havingbeen received in the course of business and that the truth was that she had taken it from her husbandâs collection without hisknowledge or consent in order to check whether or not he had been deceived into buying that and another note for HK$100,000. Thewhole of this conversation the second plaintiff denied albeit she admitted in court that she had indeed lied in saying that the notehad been obtained in the course of business.</p>        <p><a name="p237" class="pseudopara" id="p237">237.</a>  By that time the plaintiffs had instructed solicitors, the return of note âCO88191â had been demanded and solicitors for thedefendantsï¼ admitting that the note had been destroyed, had asserted a public interest in removing discoloured banknotes from circulation.</p>        <p><a name="p238" class="pseudopara" id="p238">238.</a>  The October 1983 incident and a much later conversation between the first plaintiff and Dr Green apart, the judgment of MortimerJ. sets out in circumstantial detail the material evidence adduced before him in terms which reflect a careful observation of theage, psychiatric state, mental awareness or confusion, agility, acumen, literacy, fears, backgrounds, relative roles and motivation,as the case may have been, of the witnesses. He mentions the first plaintiff's propensity for making generous but ill-advised loansto his friends for example and the disclosure by the second plaintiff, for the first time when she gave evidence, that she had notpreviously revealed to her husband her speculations on the stock-exchange, her failure to deposit the HK$1,000 note at the Bank ofEast Asia as he had directed and her substantial holding of US$ notes. On all essential matters the judge accepted the testimonyof the two plaintiffs; as regards both being influenced by the way they had respectively dealt with the many questions properly putto them in the course of cross-examination. Insofar as it is suggested that, because he did not say so, the judge did not rely upondemeanour the submission is unsustainable.</p>        <p><a name="p239" class="pseudopara" id="p239">239.</a>  The story recounted by the plaintiffs and their witnesses was that during the late 1970s, after a restaurant and a provision shophad successfully been established in Argyle Street, the first plaintiff began to collect antiques, paintings, coins and banknotes.This propensity became known to one Law Wai Yee who in due course departed to the United States as a student. During the first halfof 1982, by which time the first plaintiff had become a more serious collector of erroneously printed banknotes, Law phoned him fromAmerica to ask if he was interested in buying for a very substantial sum certain mirrors, paintings, a Chinese Imperial Decree and,more particularly, a HK$1,000 note issued by the defendants which, instead of being yellow in colour, was brown; like the defendantsâHK$500 note. The first plaintiff told him that no realistic negotiations could take place before he had brought the items in questionto Hong Kong.</p>        <p><a name="p240" class="pseudopara" id="p240">240.</a>  After the two plaintiffs had conferred together the second plaintiff, who tended to have the last word on matters of money, putHK$400,000 as the top figure for any purchases from Law. On 28<sup>th</sup> May she borrowed such a sum from the Bank of East Asia on mortgage. The following month Law arrived in Hong Kong with his treasuresby which time, unbeknown to her husband, the second plaintiff had reinvested all the money she had borrowed. None the less they agreedto buy two antique mirrors for HK$50,000 and the HK$1,000 note for HK$350,000; to be paid as to HK$100,000 forthwith and the balanceof HK$300,000 in a matter of weeks. The note had been compared with a HK$500 note issued by the defendants and examined by the firstplaintiff under ultra violet light. As the judge expressly reminded himself there was no documentation and no receipt for the price.The plaintiffsâ explanation for such lacunae he found unconvincing. He also remarked on the subsequent disappearance of Law withouttrace.</p>        <p><a name="p241" class="pseudopara" id="p241">241.</a>  By June: 1983 the plaintiffs, though still wealthy, were short of ready cash. Opportunely there arrived on the scene from Thailanda man whom they had known many years before in their home village in China called Chan Chun Yip. The subject of the brown HK$1,000note having arisen in conversation and the plaintiffs beingwilling to sell, Chan Chun Yip agreed to mention it to Chan Shun Hoi,a wealthy neighbor in Bangkok who was a collector of such rarities. Negotiations by telephone between Hong Kong and Thailand ensuedand Chan Chun Yip returned to Hong Kong in July armed with written authority from Chan Shun Hoi to conclude an agreement for thepurchase of the note on his behalf âat all costsâ. In due course a provisional oral agreement was reached for its sale and purchaseat a price of HK$10 million of which HK$2 million was to be paid once the authenticity of the note had been warranted by a bank anda formal document been drawn up at a solicitorâs office. Chan Shun Hoi was thereafter to come to Hong Kong to pay the balance.Hence the events of 17<sup>th</sup> September 1983 The whole of this story is stigmatized by the defendants as incredible.</p>        <p><a name="p242" class="pseudopara" id="p242">242.</a>  In accepting the plaintiffsâ story both as regards the acquisition of the note for HK$350,000 and the inchoate sale for HK$10million the trial judge described the former, on two occasions in the course of his judgment, as âsurprisingâ and the latteras âextremely bizarreâ. Insofar as it is suggested that he failed to take into account probabilities, the second plaintiffâsfear of her husband or the interest of the plaintiffs in their account of events where it differed from that of, presumably, disinterestedtellers such submission is also unsustainable.</p>        <p><a name="p243" class="pseudopara" id="p243">243.</a>  The acceptance, in great measure, of the plaintiffsâ account of the history of HK$1,000 note number âCO88191â is importantbecause it formed the basis for the judgeâs assessment of damages. Shrinking, perhaps, from the logical conclusion of his findings,which would have been that in all probability the defendants, by converting the note, had deprived the plaintiffs of a sale priceof HK$10 million, he found that Chan Shun Hoi would have required a written certificate of authenticity, consulted solicitors andâcome to his sensesâ. Mortimer J. had obviously formed the opinion that even on the most favourable construction of the evidencethe note was not worth anything like the price that he had found provisionally agreed. He then sought to ascertain its value andarrived at the figure of HK$375,000 by adding to the sum which the plaintiffs had paid for it âa modest increaseâ; presumablyto allow for the fall in the value of money between June 1982 and September 1983. There is no cross appeal by the plaintiffs againstthis finding.</p>        <p><a name="p244" class="pseudopara" id="p244">244.</a>  It has correctly been submitted to us on behalf of the defendants that the only part of the inherently unlikely evidence given bythe plaintiffs and their witnesses which was open directly to challenge and, therefore, afforded an opportunity of testing theircredibility was that relating to the events of 17<sup>th</sup> September 1983 which the judge called âthe nub of the caseâ.</p>        <p><a name="p245" class="pseudopara" id="p245">245.</a>  Referring only to some of the more important conflicts of evidence the second plaintiff had said that the note was dark brown, likea HK$500 with which she had compared it on at least two occasions, that when asking for verification she had said âThis note isworth much moneyâ and that she had been promised its return if found genuine. In answer to a question from one of the tellers shehad said that the note had come into her possession in the course of her fashion business. In evidence she admitted she admittednot only that this was a lie but that it had been repeated in the statement made by her to the police. The first p1aintiff had beenpresent when she made it and, to put it no higher, not demurred.</p>        <p><a name="p246" class="pseudopara" id="p246">246.</a>  The two tellers on the other hand testified that the first plaintiff had asked for the HK$1,000 note, which was of a lighter brownthan a norma1 HK$500, to be authenticated as a matter of urgency since it had been handed over in the course of business and herhusband was waiting to provide the customer with change. They also said she had been told that she would be provided with HK$1,000if the note was genuine and that it would be forfeited if found counterfeit. Although both said the note was lighter than a HK$500note it appears from the notes of evidence that one of them, Miss Lau, said â- well by the look of it I though it was HK$500 butit was HK$1,000 â â.</p>        <p><a name="p247" class="pseudopara" id="p247">247.</a>  In preferring the second plaintiffâs version of events the judge did not overlook the fact that in the bank the second plaintiffhad indicated or implied that she had got the note in the course of business and had said so in terms in her statement to the police.He further concluded that she might have said something about her husband waiting for the results of the verification; finding nonethe less that âshe wanted the note verified and passed back to her and â indicated that she thought the note was valuableâ.For my part I cannot thereby conclude that the judge was accepting the tellerâs evidence that the second plaintiff had said thather husband was waiting to give change; by necessary inference treating the note as money rather than as a valuable chattel. No morecan I accept that by omitting to refer to the visit paid by the second plaintiff to the mini-branch during October 1983 or to thefirst plaintiff's apparent ignorance, when interviewed by Dr. Green, of the name of the American who had sold him the note he failed,in assessing relative veracity, to take such matters into account and in particular what was said about the second plaintiffâsvisit by the tellers. Certainly the confession attributed to the second plaintiff is fully consistent as well with the judgeâsfindings as to what transpired on 17th September as with the terms of the plaintiff's solicitor's letter of 28th September 1983.None the less I am not persuaded to doubt the judgeâs word when he said .. âI am satisfied on the whole of the evidence thatthis note was purchased - I have no reason to doubt that it was purchased for HK$350,000â. As Lord Simonds stated when referringto the judge of first instance in <u>Watt</u> v. <u>Thomas</u>)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">(1)</a> at p 492 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â â your Lordships are entitled and bound, unless there is compelling reason to the contrary, to assume that he has taken thewhole of the evidence into his consideration.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p248" class="pseudopara" id="p248">248.</a>  Citing this passage in <u>Onassis</u> v. <u>Vergottis<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">(2)</a></u> at p 421 Lord Morris observed :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn the same way it would, I think, be unsound to assume that some arguments have been ignored merely because they may not be fullyrecited in a judgment.â</p>    </blockquote>        <p><a name="p249" class="pseudopara" id="p249">249.</a>  If, then, the judge took all the evidence and that probabilities into account and also relied upon his observation of demeanourwhen resolving the conflict of evidence as to the events of 17th September a heavy burden rests on the defendants to satisfy a courtrehearing the case on the basis of notes of evidence and documents that he was misled let alone fraudulently deceived.</p>        <p><a name="p250" class="pseudopara" id="p250">250.</a>  The evidence given by Chan Chun Yip and Chan Shun Hoi warranted examination as careful as that afforded to the evidence of the plaintiffsthemselves. The varying testimony of the former included such surprising features as his lingering outside the mini-branch to finisha cigarette while the second plaintiff sought verification of the note he had come to buy on behalf of his principal, a rather tendentiousexplanation of resources available to him in Hong Kong and an unconvincing account of the comparison which he made between the designsof the HK$1,000 and HK$500 notes. Chan Shun Hoi demonstrated ignorance about the several types of article which he claimed to collect.Indeed, so meticulous has been the analysis of inconsistencies and improbabilities as in the evidence called on behalf of the plaintiffsthat were I not to look beyond the written materials available to this appellate court I would hesitate to accept it. I look beyondsuch materials because the judge took the inconsistencies, improbabilities and the explanations ofÂ· Chan Chun Yip and Chan ShunHoi into account before finding that Chan Chun Yip had not given âfalse evidenceâ and that the account of a projected sale ofthe note for HK$10 million had not been "fabricated". It is to be emphasized both that we are not a reseeing court and that, in thecontext of a society in which, without complaint, large fortunes are made and lost as the result of business gambles, the improbabilitiesalready outlined are not of such an order as to falsify the findings on credibility of the seeing judge. Â·No more am I preparedto find that he failed to check his impressions by a critical examination of the whole of the evidence.Â· As Lord Greene said in<u>Yuill</u> v. <u>Yuill</u><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3">(3)</a>at p 19 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âIt can, of course, only be on the rarest occasions and in circumstances where the appellate court is convinced by the plainestconsiderations, that it would be justified in finding that the trial judge had formed a wrong opinion."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In that case, much relied upon by the defendants, the judge had âentered the arenaâ and, again in the words of Lord Greene<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4">(3)</a> at p 20, was liable to have his vision clouded by the dust of the conflict". I cannot accept the defendants' submission that no conclusionis possible except that the judge misused his relative advantages and made erroneous findings as a result. "If his estimate of theman forms any substantial part of his reasons for his judgment the trial judge 's conclusions of fact should - be let alone." perLord Sumner in <u>Hontestroom (Owners)</u> v.<u>Sagaporack (Owners)<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5">(4)</a></u> at p 47. A final quotation in this regard from Lord Wright in <u>Powell v. Streatham Manor Nursing Home<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6">(5)</a></u> at p 267 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â- as the evidence proceeds through examination, cross examination and re-examination the judge is gradually imbibing almost instinctively,but in fact as a result of close attention and of long experience, an impression of the personality of the witness and of his trustworthinessand of the accuracy of his observation and memory or the reverse. He will not necessarily distrust a witness simply because he findshim inaccurate in some details : he can give such inaccuracy its proper place, particularly if he sees that the witness is tired,or antagonized, or confused, or perhaps impatient, and especially if the matter of the inaccuracy is of minor or collateral importance.But such inaccuracies may appear in a very different light when pointed to as isolated passages in the shorthand notes and abstractedfrom the human atmosphere of the trial and from the totality of the evidence. The judge will form his impression from the whole personalityof the witness : he can al1ow for the nervous witness standing up in a crowded Court or worried by the strain of cross-examination.The judge may be deceived by an adroit and plausible knave or by apparent innocence : for no man is infallible; but in the main acareful and conscientious judge with his experience of Courts is as likely to be correct in his impressions as any tribunal, unlessperhaps, as some would say, a jury of twelve members is preferable.â</p>    </blockquote>        <p><a name="p251" class="pseudopara" id="p251">251.</a>  Accepting, therefore, the material parts of the plaintiffsâ evidence it remains to assess the propriety of the judge's assessmentof damages; particularly the finding, which alone afforded the note a value exceeding that on its face, that its dark co1ouring derivedfrom an error in the printing process. Here we enter the realm of inference where we are at no relative disadvantage as comparedwith the trial judge and act directly within our jurisdiction as provided by R.S.C. Order 59 rule 10(3).</p>        <p><a name="p252" class="pseudopara" id="p252">252.</a>  Accepting the testimony of the plaintiffs and of Chan Chun Yip, the primary finding of fact upon which Mortimer J. relied in referringthat the unusual colour of the converted HK$1,000 note derived from printing errors was its exact match with the colour of the defendantsâHK$500 note. This cannot be construed as a finding more definite than that the colours appeared to those witnesses so to match orless definite than that the colours comprised not only the distinctive dark brown but also the whole rather sophisticated patternsof colour on the front and back as well. I regard an initial inference as fairly drawn on that footingÂ·</p>        <p><a name="p253" class="pseudopara" id="p253">253.</a>  Also cogent in this context, however, was the evidence of Mr. Thomas, the Technical Manager of Bradbury Wilkinson (Inks) Ltd., anassociate company of the printers of the note. He had been employed by the Bradbury Wilkinson Group for thirty-three years and thetrial judge had no option but to concede that "if the notes are printed according to the system laid down and if the machinery operatesproperly and if the checking is done properly it is highly unlikely that a HK$1,000 note could be printed both sides in the wrongcolour. Indeed, if all those things are done and the checks are made carefully, it would not be near impossible for there to be erroran error note.â I would add that the defendantsâ HK$1,000 and HK$500 notes differ in size and it is difficult to understand howan error note of the colour described could have passed undetected through their hands and into circulation. But as the trial judgeremarked, relying upon his experience at the Bar and on the Bench : âmachines do go wrong â systems are not followed as theyshould be, checks are not made as carefully as they should be and those who are carrying out the systems do not always even try tofollow them on occasions.â I have personally no doubt that had the Superintendent of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant been askedabout his safety system prior to the recent disastrous escape of radiation he would have given convincing evidence that such an eventualitywas impossible.</p>        <p><a name="p254" class="pseudopara" id="p254">254.</a>  The judge also found that examples of misprinted notes issued by the defendants were readily available for purchase in Hong Kongfrom some thirty dealers. Systems and checks are not infallible. However, the errors proved were attributable to machine malfunctionon the application of facsimile numbers, signatures and dates and the alignment of the patterns. In one instance the lionâs headappeared on the front as well as the back of a HK$1,000 note. The distinctive yellow of the HK$1,000 note is applied by the intagliosystem first to the back and a week or so later to the front of a sheet of notes. Though it was proved that the colour of notes canbe changed after issue by chemical or related processes there was no evidence as to whether or not so great a change could or couldnot thereby be brought about as to produce the apparent matching observed.</p>        <p><a name="p255" class="pseudopara" id="p255">255.</a>  On the basis of the primary facts found and of the material evidence I am unable to infer on the balance of probability that theunusual colour of the converted note derived from errors in the printing process. No more am I able to draw any inference to thecontrary. Without more, therefore, I would have accepted the defendantsâ submission that the trial judge was wrong to draw theinference he did and, an, as a result, to award the plaintiffs a sum in excess of the face value of their note. In the circumstancesit falls to consider another factor taken into account by Mortimer J. That factor was the applicability of the maxim "omnia praesumunturcontra spoliatoremâ which can, I believe, loosely be regarded both as an aspect of the more general proposition that a party shouldnot be allowed to gain an advantage from his own wrong and an admonition to judges to use their common sense when considering theirapproach to a partyâs destruction of or failure to produce a document or record which might materially assist an opponent in theproof of his case. In most instances I would expect the approach to be as described by Staughton J. in <u>Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Greenstone Shipping S.A.</u><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="" id="_ftnref7">(6)</a> at p 885 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â- if the wrongdoer has destroyed or impaired the evidence by which the innocent party could show how much he has lost the wrongdoermust suffer from the resulting uncertainty."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Quite how the wrongdoer is to suffer involves some, though far from an exhaustive, reference to the volume of learning with whichwe have been favoured in this regard.</p>    <p><a name="p256" class="pseudopara" id="p256">256.</a>  The plaintiffs rely strongly on two judgments given on motion for a retrial in <u>Williamson v. Rover Cycle Co.</u><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="" id="_ftnref8">(7)</a> Madden J., at p. 208, expressed the view that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âa party from whom evidence has been kept back which, if produced, might have established his case is entitled to call upon thecourt to draw an inference in his favour from the mere fact of the suppression of the evidence â a party who destroys or suppressesevidence is a spoliator of evidence within the meaning of this maxim although he may have had no improper motive at the time. Itwould be sufficientâ he thought âif the effect of the wrongful act had been to deprive the plaintiff of evidence by which hiscase might be supported.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Palles C.P., also emphasizing that the failure to produce certain bicycle parts was unexplained, gave judgment to like effect. Theopinion of Madden J. was obiter because, in the event, he found that the defendants were not spoliators since the plaintiff had hadample opportunity to inspect the subsequently destroyed parts critical to his case, Kenny J. had said, at p 203 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"I think there can be little question that if - a destruction (was) effected for the purpose of concealing the truth - the: onus mightbe shifted â I doubt very much whether the maxim is applicable in the absence of circumstances suggestive of motive or of a wrongfuldestruction.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>With this view Palles C.B. expressly disagreed. Little distinction is to be drawn between inference and shifting the burden of proof.In neither event contrary evidence is called for from the other party. Further, though the defendants in the instant case acted wrongfullyin that their destruction of the HK$1,000 note constituted the tort of conversion it was accepted that they had not intended to suppressevidence which might be favourable to the plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p257" class="pseudopara" id="p257">257.</a>  English authority at the time of the Irish decision does not appear to have borne hardly upon an innocent destroyer of evidencepotentially favourable to another party to litigation. To quote from the judgment of Dr. Lushington in <u>The Johanna Emilie</u> <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="" id="_ftnref9">(8)</a>at p 327 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf papers are destroyed when the capturing vessel is in sight or there is a chance of capture, it is the strongest proof that thesepapers contain some matter which would incure to condemnation â but if the papers are destroyed a long time antecedently beforethere is any probability that they were destroyed for fraudulent purposes, then, though there is no spoliation and though, no doubt,the inference of law is against the act during war, yet the case is of a less stringent nature.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The meaning of the words âof a less stringent natureâ was, I believe, explained by Sir Arthur Channell giving the advice of thePrivy Council in <u>The Ophelia</u> <a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="" id="_ftnref10">(9)</a>at p 229 :</p>    <p>Authorities more recent than those two prize cases have shifted in the direction of the judgment of Madden J. in <u>Williamson v. Rover Cycle Co.</u> in <u>Seager v Copydex</u><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="" id="_ftnref11">(10)</a> at p 258 Winn L.J. stated :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â â since the basis on which damages are to be recovered in this case is â¦. tortious â¦. where thre is insoluble doubt betweenany two possible versions or assessments when the tribunal of fact is pursuing the factual issues it should be borne in mind thatthere is a general principle that âomnia praesumuntur contra spoliatoremâ.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>A strong Court of Appeal in <u>General Tire and Rubber Co. v. Firestone</u><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="" id="_ftnref12">(11)</a> at p 267 did not :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âdoubt the validity of this view in the context of that case ââ</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and this Court gave judgment to similar effect in <u>Hong Kong and Kowloon Wharf and Godown Co Ltd v. Bank Wegara Indonesia</u><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="" id="_ftnref13">(12)</a>. Persuaded, perhaps, by these authorities the defendants have conceded that their destruction of note Co88191 is a factor to be takeninto account if we cannot otherwise resolve whether or not its unusual colour was due to errors in the printing process. In the lightof that concession, rightly made in my view, I am able, like the trial judge, to infer that the unusual colour derived from sucherrors. It was therefore a collectorâs piece of unusual rarity.</p>        <p><a name="p258" class="pseudopara" id="p258">258.</a>  The final question arises as to whether the converted error note had a value of HK$375,000 as found below. Again this is a questionin which we are in no position of disadvantage as compared with that of the trial judge. The note would have had a market value amongcollectors, albeit there was no âavailable marketâ, in the sense described by Lord Denning M.R. in <u>Building &amp; Civil Engineering Holidays Scheme Management Ltd v. Post Office</u><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="" id="_ftnref14">(13)</a> at p 264 in the passage cited by the judge :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"The market value here means the price at which the goods could be expected to be bought and sold as between willing seller and willingbuyer, even though there may be only one seller and one buyer and even though one or both may be hypothetical rather than real.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>That price cannot, I am satisfied, in any way be related to the sum which the first plaintiff, thinking he had a bargain, paid toLaw Wai Yee for the note in Â·June 1982. No more do I feel able to rely on the other large sums which he gave for further error notesmuch more recently. These prices arc greatly in excess of those paid, by the defendantsâ emissary shortly before trial and by knowledgeablecollectors whom they called, for notes having similar flaws. At the time of his purchase of the HK$1,000 note âhe was uninformed,inexpert and in any event only a beginnerâ as the judge reminded himself. The evidence does not suggest any subsequent increasein his expertise.</p>        <p><a name="p259" class="pseudopara" id="p259">259.</a>  Chan Kwai' s most expensive acquisition had cost him some HK$6,300 but Law Yiu Ching, called by the plaintiffs, had bought a HK$10note with half the print on one side missing for some HK$117,000 and sold it for more. Leung Tai Leung, whose evidence the judgefound acceptable despite his lowly occupation, said that he had been offered HK$260,000 for a pair of error notes which he was seekingto sell on a commission basis.Â·Â·</p>        <p><a name="p260" class="pseudopara" id="p260">260.</a>  While the defendants, if anyone, must suffer from the uncertainly as to value insofar as it is occasioned by their destruction ofa HK$1,000 error note of unusual rarity, like Mortimer J. I discount as speculative the prospects of an actual payment by an uninformedthough keen collector of an exorbitant price. A Court must be wary of awarding exemplary damages under another guise. The meagrerelevant evidence will not, in my opinion, support a finding of value exceeding HK$250,000. I would allow the appeal and substitutethat figure for the HK$375,000 awarded below; interest to run from 22<sup>nd</sup> September 1983 until 25<sup>th</sup> May 1986 at the rate of one percent above the prime rate from time to time prevailing during that period.</p>	<p> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><strong>Hunterï¼ J.A.:</strong></p>        <p><a name="p261" class="pseudopara" id="p261">261.</a>  The circumstances which give rise to this appeal have already been most carefully and fully set out in the judgments already delivered.I shall therefore proceed separately to consider the three issues raised in this appeal namely :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1) The . judgeâs findings of primary fact.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2) The judgeâs finding that the note was misprinted in the colour of a HK$500 note and was not discoloured.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3) The judgeâs finding that the note was worth HK$375,000.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading" style="text-align:left">I. The Judgeâs finding of primary fact</p>        <p><a name="p262" class="pseudopara" id="p262">262.</a>  The judge faced a difficult task in making his findings of primary fact in four critical areas of dispute. These were:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1) The alleged purchase of the note for HK$350,000.  In the absence of any supporting oral or documentary evidence, beyond that ofthe bank borrowing, his conclusion depended entirely upon his view of the credibility of the two plaintiffs.  His most significantfindings here were:-</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(a)  The first plaintiff : âI am satisfied that this note was of great importance to the first plaintiff.  He thought that the notewas of great value and he thought it was extremely rare, the only one of its kind in the worldâ. p. 36(2)</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(b) The second plaintiff : âOn this matter, I remain impressed by Madam Lawâs evidence and I take into account criticisms thatmay be made of it and can be made properly. She was cross-examined at very very great length and in sometimes happens that a cross-examinationof great length destroys a witness absolutely.  It sometimes happens that in the course of cross-examination it becomes clear tothe court that there are matters upon which the court can rely and that was so in this caseâ p.36(5).  Later âI am satisfiedthat I can rely upon what was said inspite of the obviously unusual nature of the account.  I am quite satisfied that the note waspurchased, as I said, for HK$350,000â. p 37(3)</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2) The events at the mini-branch of the bank on 17th September 1983.</p>        <p>Here the judge had to weigh the evidence of the second plaintiff against that of the two bank tellers. His conclusion was : "I preferMadam Lawâs accountâ p 42(3).</p>        <p>This conclusion extended to the whole of her evidence subject to the express qualifications noted in the judgment between pages 44(2)and 45(5) where the judge found her evidence in part unreliable, but acquitted her of telling lies.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3) The eyeÂ·witness evidence, what the judge called direct evidence, bearing upon the colour of the note.  Here the judge had toweigh the evidence of Mr. Leung Pak Nam and the two tellers against that of the first and second plaintiffs and Mr. Chan Chun Yip. He reached a firm conclusion in favour of the latterâs evidence which he described as âcogent and compellingâ p.36(2).  Inrelation to the particular witnesses he concluded :-</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(a)  First plaintiff : âHe was pressed at a very great length about the colour of the note, and again that served, so far as I wasconcerned, to make me think, far from the fact I could not rely upon him, that I am able to rely on himâ p. 52(4).</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(b) The second plaintiff : âSo far as Madam Law was concerned I found her evidence upon this impressive.  Not because she was alwaysaccurate, because I found she is not always accurate.  She was rather a timid and anxious witness trying, I think, to give an accurateaccount, and she was giving an account of things that her husband did not know of until she was in the witness box â¦.  She said,and I accept, that the comparison was made between this note and a HK$500 note, and she said the colours were exactly the sameâp 52(6) &amp; (7).</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(c)  Chan Chun Yip.  In part the judge found him to be unreliable but not untruthfull : p 29(5) to p 30(5).  The overall assessmentof his evidence was : âSo far as the comparison of the colour is concerned, I think it significantly supports the comparison thathad been made by âMadam Lawâ p 59(3).</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(4) The âsaleâ of the note to Chan Shun Hoi.  Since the suggestion was that both the oral evidence of Chan Chun Yip and Chan ShunHoi, and the so-called âsupportingâ documents was false and fabricated, that was the key issue before the judge. Again it turnedupon the impression they made upon him as witnesses.  The judgeâs conclusion, having heard both men, was : âI do not think thatthis is a fabricated account.  It is extremely bizarre, but I am quite sure that it is not a fabricated accountâ p 57(3).</p>    </blockquote>        <p><a name="p263" class="pseudopara" id="p263">263.</a>  Mr. Gilbert Rodway , Q.C. for the appellant Bank, has launched an impassioned and detailed attack upon these findings. The plaintiffâscase at the trial was he submitted a âscamâ : by which I understand him to mean that it was a false case fraudulently presentedand supported by perjured and fabricated testimony. The four principal witnesses, the two plaintiffs, Chan Chun Yip and Chan ShunHoi, assisted by Law Yui Ching and Leung Tai Leung, had successfully combined to deceive the trial judge. This Court, so the submissionwent, only had to read judge's notes of evidence to conclude that the critical phrases frequently used by Mr. Rodway like âcompletelylying witnessâ, âconcocted storyâ, âwholly dishonestâ, ânot credibleâ, âcock and bull storyâ, could properly andaccurately be used to describe much of their evidence individually and collectively. This court should therefore re-try the caseon the documents and dismiss the plaintiffsâ claim.</p>        <p><a name="p264" class="pseudopara" id="p264">264.</a>  Mr. Rodway founded upon a dictum of Lord Greene, M.R. in <u>Yuill v. Yuill</u> <a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="" id="_ftnref15">(1)</a> at p 22 where he said that in that case the trial judge :</p>   <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âcannot, I think, have subjected the evidence to an adequate scrutiny before expressing the view which he did as to the demeanourâ</p>   </blockquote>    <p><a name="p265" class="pseudopara" id="p265">265.</a>  of two vital witnesses. The suggestion here was that had the trial judge given himself more than the four days he took to considerthe position after the conclusion of the hearing, and thus been able more carefully to re-read his notes, he would not have falleninto the errors attributed to him.</p>        <p><a name="p266" class="pseudopara" id="p266">266.</a>  It is perhaps noteworthy that the most quoted dictum of Lord Greene in <u>Yuill</u><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="" id="_ftnref16">(1)</a> is :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"It can, of course, only be on the rarest occasions, and in circumstances where the appellate court is convinced by the plainest considerations,that it would be justified in finding that the trial judge had formed a wrong opinion.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p267" class="pseudopara" id="p267">267.</a>  p 19. This is principally because, in relation to findings of primary fact, as opposed to inferences drawn from such facts, a crucialpart of the evidence never reaches the appellate court. Most regrettably in Hong Kong, we do not presently enjoy a transcript ofthe evidence in civil cases. This case demonstrates the urgent need to remedy this situation. But even where a transcript is available,it does not record the material upon which a trial judge has mostly to rely in a case like the present. What is lost to the appellatecourt was graphically described by Lord Wright in <u>Powell v. Streatham Manor Nursing Home</u><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="" id="_ftnref17">(2)</a> at p 267 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âas the evidence proceeds throught examination, cross-examination and re-examination the judge is gradually imbibing almost instinctively,but in fact as a result of close attention and of long experience, an. Impression of the personality of the witness and of his trustworthinessand of the accuracy of his observation and memory or the reverse. He will not necessarily distrust a witness simply because he findshim inaccurate in some details : he can give such inaccuracy its proper place, particularly if he sees that the witness is tired,or antagonized, or confused, or perhaps impatient, and especially if the matter of inaccuracy is of minor or collateral importance.But such inaccuracies may appear in a very different light when pointed to as isolated passages in the shorthand notres and abstractedfrom the human atmosphere of the trial and from the totality of the evidence. The judge will form his impression from the whole personalityof the witness : he can allow for the nervous witness, standing up in a crowded Court or worried by the strain of cross-examination.The judge may be deceived by an adroit and plausible knave or by apparent innocence : for no man is infallible; but in the main acareful and conscientious judge with his experience of Courts is as likely to be correct in his impressions as any tribunal, unlessperhaps, as some would say, a jury of twelve members is preferableâ</p>    </blockquote>        <p><a name="p268" class="pseudopara" id="p268">268.</a>  These considerations have led to several formulations of the principles to be applied by an appellate court, two of which are convenientlyto be found in the speech of Lord Thankerton in <u>Watt Or Thomas v. Thomas</u><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="" id="_ftnref18">(3)</a> at p 487. The first is Lord Thankertonâs formulation : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â(1) Where a question of fact has been tried by a judge without a jury, and there is no question of misdirection of himself by thejudge, an appellate court which is disposed to come to a different conclusion on the printed evidence, should not do so unless itis satisfied that any advantage enjoyed by the trial judge by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses, could not be sufficientto explain or justify the trial judgeâs conclusion;</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(2) The appellate court may take the view that, without having seen or heard the witnesses, it is not in a position to come to anysatisfactory conclusion on the printed evidence;</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(3) The appellate court, either because the reasons given by the trial judge are not satisfactory, or because it unmistakably so appearsfrom the evidence, may be satisfied that he has not taken proper advantage of his having seen and heard the witnesses, and the matterwill then become at large for the appellate court.â</p>   </blockquote>        <p>The second is that approved by Viscount Sankey L.C. in <u>Powell v. Streatham Manor Nursing Home</u><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="" id="_ftnref19">(2)</a> and cited by Lord Thankerton as follows :</p>   <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"Am I â who sit here without those advantages, sometimes broad and sometimes subtle, which are the privilege of the judge who heardand tried the case â in a position, not having those privileges, to come to a clear conclusion that the judge who had them wasplainly wrong?  If I cannot be satisfied in my own mind that the judge with those privileges was plainly wrong, then it appears tome to be my duty to defer to his judgment.â</p>   </blockquote>        <p><a name="p269" class="pseudopara" id="p269">269.</a>  When these principles are applied to the facts of this case, in my judgment they reveal four fatal obstacles to the acceptance ofMr. Rodwayâs submissions. First, as the quoted extracts sufficiently show, it is the âlostâ evidence upon which the trial judgeparticularly relied. This was far from being a case where he was able to accept one witness or a group of witnesses totally in preferenceto others. His assessments of each witness was both qualitative and quantitative. He had to dissect the truth from the false : thereliable from the unreliable. In a case like the present the factors described by Lord Wright are quite as important, and may transcendin importance the recorded content. Because it is notorious that âevidence may read well in print but may be rightly discountedby the trial judge or, on the other hand, he may rightly attach importance to evidence which reads badly in printâ per Lord Reidin <u>Bemmax v. Austin Motor Company Ltd</u><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="" id="_ftnref20">(4)</a> at p 375. It seems to be a classic example of a case where âan appellate court can never recapture the initial advantage of thejudge who saw and believedâ per Lord Atkin in <u>Powell v. Streatham Manor Nursing Home</u><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="" id="_ftnref21">(2)</a> at p 255.</p>        <p><a name="p270" class="pseudopara" id="p270">270.</a>  Secondly, I see no substance in the suggestion that the trial judge failed sufficiently to scrutinize his note. The breadth andscope of the judgment is wholly against this. Without attempting the impossible task on dealing with every single point, he wentinto the matter in considerable detail. We are âentitled and bound, unless there is compelling reason to contrary, to assume thathe has taken the whole of the evidence into his considerationâ per Lord Simonds in <u>Watt Or Thomas v. Thomas</u><a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title="" id="_ftnref22">(3)</a> at p 492. I see no such reason.</p>        <p><a name="p271" class="pseudopara" id="p271">271.</a>  Thirdly, I am not impressed by the repeated invitation to regard much of the evidence of the four main witnesses as improbable.Here again I turn to Lord Wright at p 269 in <u>Powell v. Streatham Manor Nursing Home</u><a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="" id="_ftnref23">(2)</a> who said this :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhen this delay is spoken as a glaring improbability, it must be inquired what is the standard of probability to be taken. Is itthat of the normal man in normal circumstances, if such an abstraction is conceivable? Any such standard would obviously be fallacious,since the true question can only be what was probable if you take, as you must, these particular individuals situated in the particularcircumstances in which they were. I can see no reason to reject the judgeâs conclusion, even if it were competent for me to speculateon probabilities of this kind.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Those words were spoken in the context of medical negligence. In this case the obstacles I detect in my path are infinitely greater.The case has introduced me to a market of which I have no prior experience. I have no idea by what touchstone I am supposed to judgeprobabilities in the context of persons with the background of the plaintiffs, in a market where conduct may be motivated in an infinitevariety of ways between the extremes of a determination to possess the rare for its own sake, to the taking of a stimulating gamble.I feel unable to place any reliance on personal perception, as against the judgeâs observations.</p>        <p><a name="p272" class="pseudopara" id="p272">272.</a>  Fourthly, the judge observed these four witnesses being cross-examined at length and he believed them. At the same level of professionalnegligence Lord Wright said this about the doctor, in <u>Powell v. Streatham Manor Nursing Home</u><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title="" id="_ftnref24">(2)</a> at p 271 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI can only observe that â¦. he was, after being cross-examined at great length, believed by the judge.

The judgeâs finding that the note was an error note of HK$1,000 denomination misprinted in the colour of a HK$500 note.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p274" class="pseudopara" id="p274">274.</a>  The judge reached this conclusion by two separate but parallel routes namely : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1) By inference from his findings of primary fact and from his conclusions on the discolouring and printing evidence.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2) By the application of the principle of <u>Armory v.

We were much pressed with the supposedexperience of bank tellers in differentiating between the colour of bank notes. In some circumstances this can be compelling. Butas the judge observed : âit is a fact that colours are difficult to remember unless a direct comparison is madeâ p 52(7). Directcomparison also meets the criticism that different persons may see different colours in a different way. These tellers did not purportto make any such comparison : their recorded descriptions varied : and the judge was not impressed by their evidence. I am not persuadedthat his conclusion was âplainly wrongâ.</p>        <p><a name="p277" class="pseudopara" id="p277">277.</a>  In relation to the evidence on discolouring the judge correctlyï¼ observed that no witness had asserted that notes of the colourof a HK$500 note were produced by discolouring, and that none of the notes produced and alleged to have been discoloured were exactlythe same as the colour of a HK$500 note â or I might add anywhere near it. He summarized the system evidence given by Mr. Thomasthe Technical Manager of Bradbury Wilkinson (Inks) Ltd. But this did not persuade him that the multiple human error necessary toproduce a misprinted note in the wrong colour could never have occurred.</p>        <p><a name="p278" class="pseudopara" id="p278">278.</a>  The bank had by its evidence sought to make good two complementary propositions. First that it was a simple matter chemically tochange the colour of a HK$1,000 note. Secondly that it was impossible for the printers to print and release a miscoloured note. Consideringits importance the evidence on discolouring was surprisingly incomplete.</p>        <p><a name="p279" class="pseudopara" id="p279">279.</a>  The printers used two quite distinct colours for the proper printing by the contaglio process of the principal colours on the HK$500and HK$1,000 notes. For the HK$500 note this was a strong, deep distinctive brown which I shall call â500 brownâ. For the HK$1,000note this was a clear, chrome yellow which I shall call â1,000 yellowâ.</p>        <p><a name="p280" class="pseudopara" id="p280">280.</a>  A range of âdiscolouredâ notes were produced in evidence by the bank in exhibit D7. They all appear to have been rescued fromthe normal destruction process subsequent to the plaintiffsâ complaints. Broadly speaking they fell into three different colourcategories which I shall call A, B and C.</p>            <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:left">(1) Category A were basically yellow/orange in colour, but were slightly dirtier in colour that the true clear 1,000 yellow.  Examplesare numbers 5, 6, 11 &amp; 26 in D7.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2) Category B are still predominantly orange/yellow but are distinctly dirtier in colour than Category A.  In the subjective areaof description I would be minded to adopt âvery light coffeeâ.  Examples are numbers 7 and 8 in D7.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3) Category are stronger and deeper in colour, with a distinct brown tint to the yellow.  My personal description would be âyellowbrownâ.  Examples are numbers 2 and 4 in D7.  Although I have used the word brown in my description, the colour to my eye is verymarkedly different to 500 brown.</p>    </blockquote>        <p><a name="p281" class="pseudopara" id="p281">281.</a>  All these notes were evenly discoloured overall. For reasons which carry conviction accidental discolouring was ruled out by Mr.Thomas. This leaves only two possible explanations : deliberate discolouring : or printing error.</p>        <p><a name="p282" class="pseudopara" id="p282">282.</a>  On discolouring, Mr. Thomasâ evidence was that the major ingredient in 1,000 yellow was lead chromate to which was added yellow,orange and red organic dyes and carbon black. Lead chromate he said can be converted to lead sulphide, which he said was black ordark brown in colour, by dipping the note in a 15 percent solution of sodium sulphide. His statement of evidence, as orally corrected,concluded as follows :-</p>            <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"I have carried a test on a sample HK$1,000 banknote normal colour, and have converted it to a dark colour by immersing it in a solutionof sodium sulphide.  I have reconverted part of the note to its original colour by exposing it to hydrogen peroxide.  This convertsthe black lead sulphide on the surface of the note to white lead sulphate, so that the note reverts to its original yellow or goldcolourâ.</p>            </blockquote>        <p><a name="p283" class="pseudopara" id="p283">283.</a>  These two test notes, signed by Mr. Thomas and dated 27/6/85, were numbers 18 and 19 in D7. In each case the part reconverted canbe seen in the top left hand corner. This indeed appears as original 1,000 yellow. But what Mr. Thomas called âa dark colourâis no more than category A in my scale. The note is still a slightly dirty orange in colour : not brown at all like the notes incategory C : and no where near 500 brown.</p>        <p><a name="p284" class="pseudopara" id="p284">284.</a>  The only other tested notes produced in evidence were numbers 5 and 6 in D7. In relation to them there is indirect evidence thatboth were treated with a 15 percent solution of sodium sulphide, and then number 6 was reconverted with a solution of 30 percenthydrogen peroxide. Again the conversion of number 5 has only led to a category A type slightly dirty orange note : and the reconvertednumber 6 appears only slightly cleaner and with an apparent serious thinning of the paper.</p>        <p><a name="p285" class="pseudopara" id="p285">285.</a>  If in fact it was chemically simple, feasible or possible, to convert a HK$1,000 yellow note into various shades of brown up toand including 500 brown, it would have been very simple to produce a range of notes expressly so converted. All that was proved wasthat a particular process could produce a dirty orange note. Further this evidence does not persuade me that the same process couldproduce a note of 500 brown. I note particularly the words âon the surface of the noteâ in part of the amendment to Mr. Thomasâstatement. This raise doubts in my mind as to how deep into the pigments of the note the chemicals penetrate in either the conversionor reconversion process. When also one can see how comparatively little was achieved in notes 5, 18 and 19, and what a very longway remained to go, I would be minded to infer that this process alone, without the use of additional dyes or pigments, would notproduce the distinctive 500 colour.</p>        <p><a name="p286" class="pseudopara" id="p286">286.</a>  This leaves the notes in categories B and C, and especially the latter, explained by no direct evidence. The proven chemical discolouringprocess stopped short of achieving a 500 brown colour. Although it would seem that the bank had quite a number of these notes inits possession, not one was treated with hydrogen peroxide. They seem simply to have been described by Mr. Wong, the bank officialwho took the statements from the bankâs two expert witnesses, as âfailedâ notes, which description was thereafter accepted.</p>        <p><a name="p287" class="pseudopara" id="p287">287.</a>  These notes have some bearing upon Mr Thomas' evidence of impossibility, which the appellants argue that the judge should have acceptedand acted upon. Mr Thomas described what he called a system of âstrict controlâ at all stages in the production and inspectionof the notes. He was not happy with the number of error notes in court, some of which were put to him. These apparently showed machinefailure in printing, followed by human error in failing to exclude them on subsequent inspection. But he claimed that a miscolourednote could only result from multiple human error which he dismissed as âjust not possibleâ; or âI do say the odds are so highthat I do not believe that this could have happenedâ.</p>        <p><a name="p288" class="pseudopara" id="p288">288.</a>  One of the strongest points in Mr Thomasâ favour was that the fronts and backs of the notes were printed by the intaglio processseparately and more than a week apart. The colour mix for the second printing differs slightly from the first, by reason of the compressionof the paper brought about by the first. Therefore for a note to be evenly printed both sides in the wrong colour the identical mistakewould have had to have been made twice. This would have to be followed by several failures to detect and reject the wrong colourednote.</p>        <p><a name="p289" class="pseudopara" id="p289">289.</a>  The number on the missing note led by Mr Thomas to conclude that it was printed early in a run. It was also at this time that mostof the note inconsiderable wastage, put at 7 to 10 percent, occurred, whilst pressures and the correct ink balances were got right.The same intaglio machine was used for both the yellow and brown processes. Of course between each colour change the machine oughtto have been thoroughly cleaned. But in the course of discussing in his evidence in chief what printing a discoloured note wouldhave involved, Mr Thomas considered as a hypothetical possibility the topping up of the machine with yellow ink from which all thebrown ink had not been removed. He said : âTo begin with the brown ink would mix with the yellow ink and produce a darker shadeâ.We went on to say that this mistake should never have happened, and should in any event have been obvious to the operator. It wouldfollow that any such note should be added to the wastage and dealt with under the same âstrict controlâ.</p>        <p><a name="p290" class="pseudopara" id="p290">290.</a>  This brings one back to the untested cause of discolouring of the notes in categories B and C. They, and particularly category C,are âa darker shadeâ. Their colour could have resulted from a mixing of the yellow ink with some brown. If they, or any of them,were so printed, then their existence would tend to show that insufficient cleaning of the machine between inks did occur, and occurredmore than once, and that the wastage âstrict controlâ was also not perfect. On this hypothesis the impossible would have occurred,and the question whether the error could have extended to a 500 brown note would become one of the degree. The failure to excludeany such possible explanation of these notes by simple testing to my mind raises a very serious question mark over that most difficultof concepts being advanced, the suggestion that multiple human errors could never have occurred.</p>        <p><a name="p291" class="pseudopara" id="p291">291.</a>  For my part therefore I would add to the judgeâs primary findings of fact these conclusions upon the discolouring and printingevidence namely :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(4) The evidence on discolouring did not address the real problem and stopped well short of revealing any method by which a note couldbe converted from 1,000 yellow into this particular 500 brown.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(5) Like the judge I am not satisfied that the printing of a HK$1,000 note in the 500 brown colour could not have occurred.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">I would accordingly be minded to draw the same inference from this evidence as did he.</p>        <p><a name="p292" class="pseudopara" id="p292">292.</a>  In addition the judge relied upon the principle of <u>Armory v. Delamirie</u><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title="" id="_ftnref26">(5)</a>. For this purpose the material facts, additional to the three findings of primary fact, are these. The destruction of the note wastortious. The description itself prevented the testing which would quickly have decided the issue of misprint or discolour. No othertesting evidence was available to the plaintiffs, who had had no occasion to obtain it prior to the destruction of the note. Do thosefacts give rise to an inference against the bank that the note was a misprint, which it is for the bank to rebut? Or in other wordsdo those facts have the effect of transferring to the bank the evidential burden of proving on the balance of probabilities thatthis note was in fact discoloured. In my judgment these questions should be answered in the affirmative.</p>        <p><a name="p293" class="pseudopara" id="p293">293.</a>  We have the benefit of a much more detailed argument and more extensive citation of authority on this aspect of the case than didthe trial judge. The authority seems to me to show that the principle encapsulated in the maxim âomnia praesumuntur contra spoliatoremâand applied in <u>Armory v. Delamirie</u><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title="" id="_ftnref27">(5)</a>, may be no more than a particular application of the maxim ânemo ex suo delicto meliorem suan conditionem facere potestâ âno man can place himself in a better position by his own wrong. It operates at two quite different levels, but without overall verbaladjustment to the terms of the maxim itself.</p>        <p><a name="p294" class="pseudopara" id="p294">294.</a>  The highest level of application is where there is evidence suggesting deliberate destruction by the spoliator. Here âallâ isindeed âpresumedâ against him. The presumption may be virtually irrebuttable : or the court may conclude that the spoliatorsâhave by their acts put themselves in such a position that their evidence cannot be relied upon" per Sir Arthur Channell in <u>The Ophelia</u><a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title="" id="_ftnref28">(6)</a>. Since the judge negatived deliberate destruction, the appellants originally contented that the maxim had no application to the caseat all. But Mr. Rodway resiled from this in reply and acknowledged a limited application of the maxim at the lower level.</p>        <p><a name="p295" class="pseudopara" id="p295">295.</a>  At the lower level of application no inconsiderable rewriting of the maxim seems to me really to be necessary. First, in certaincontexts at least, spoliator can be equated with tortfeasor e.g. where the act of destruction is also an act of conversion howeveraccidentally caused. Secondly, âallâ requires two qualifications. First, the destruction has to be of something which might asstto prove the plaintiffâs case, which, secondly, puts the plaintiff in particular difficulty owing to the lack of other evidencein his possession. Thirdly, there arises not so much a presumption with the consequences considered above, but an inference whichtransfers the evidential burden of proof upon the very matter rendered uncertain by the destruction.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p296" class="pseudopara" id="p296">296.</a>  These conclusions seem to me to have the supported of :-</p><blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1) The Queenâs Bench and Court of Appeal in Ireland in <u>Williamson v. Rover Cycle Co</u><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title="" id="_ftnref29">(7)</a> , where the application of the maxim was excluded by the presence of other evidence in the plaintiffâs position, but where thisstatement of principle is to be found in the judgment of Palles C.B. p 102 :</p>        <p class="quote">âAll that I think necessary to lay a foundation for the application of the well known maxim, âomnia praesumuntur contra spoliatoremâis that the loss or destruction is as against the plaintiff wrongful; and that that which was lost destroyed or not produced, mightreasonably, with other evidence, had been sufficient to maintain the plaintiffâs case â¦. I purposely use the word âmightâas distinguished from âwouldâ because when evidence is not forthcoming, it is often, as it was in the present case, uncertainwhat its exact weight might have been. The additional risk thus involved I hold to lie on the wrongdoer. Viewed in this, its verymildest light, the rule operates not so much as a punishment, but as the provision of an equivalent, for that which has been wrongfullytaken awayâ.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2) Atkin L.J. in <u>Smith v.

Subject only to one reservation, I therefore agree with the judgeâs conclusion, and substantially with his reasoning. Onone reading of his judgment at page 51(c), it might be said that he was applying a higher standard than the balance of probabilities.With this I could not agree, but I doubt if this reading is correct. I think he was doing no more than using the same adjectivesthat he used to describe the plaintiffsâ evidence e.g. at p 56(2).</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">III. The judgeâs finding that the note was worth HK$375,000.</p>    <p><a name="p298" class="pseudopara" id="p298">298.</a>  This I have found the most difficult aspect of the case. The first problem is that the note was destroyed when it had been examinedfrom a numismatic viewpoint only by the plaintiffs and Chan Chun Yip, and not by anyone who could claim greater experience. In answerto the plaintiffsâ solicitorâs first letter seeking the return of the note the bank replied on 5<sup>th</sup> October 1983 in these terms :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe Banknote was duly analysized by our Main Treasury Division who confirmed that it was genuine though discoloured. Where a banknote(or coin) which has been presented for analysis is of numismatic interest (for some reason or other) it is our practice to returnthe banknote (or coin) to presenter â¦. We confirm that the value of banknote C088191 (which was analysized by two currency experts)was that shown on its face, HK$1,000 and that the note had no âpremiumâ value in respect of its colouring (or any other distinguishingfeature)â.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p299" class="pseudopara" id="p299">299.</a>  We were told that one of the two experts there referred to was Mr. Leung Pak Nam who gave evidence. We disclaimed any expertise,and said he examined notes only to see if they were genuine or forged. It thus appears that the bank was aware of the risk of destroyingnotes which might have numismatic value without prior examination. The oral evidence did not disclose the existence of the practicesuggested in the letter, but if it in fact existed it was clearly not followed. A tortious destruction of the note in such circumstancesjustifies a court in applying the maxim âomnia praesumuntur contra spoliatoremâ in the manner considered above and in drawingadverse inference if it finds itself faced with âinsoluble difficultiesâ per Winn L.J., or âresulting uncertaintyâ per StaughtonJ. in the assessment of damages.</p>    <p><a name="p300" class="pseudopara" id="p300">300.</a>  The second problem is the very special nature of such market for error banknotes as can be said to exist. Here I think that thejudge was right to conclude that there was no available market for such a note in the sense that it could readily be bought or sold.This was because a note of this character was so rare as to approach or to be unique. On the evidence the available market in errornotes extended no further than notes displaying various types of printing errors. The judge in my view was right to recognise thatthe market with which he was concerned was in the words of Lord Denning M.R. in <u>Building and Civil Engineering Holiday Scheme Management v. the Post Office</u><a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title="" id="_ftnref39">(16)</a>Â· which he quoted:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">One where âthere may be only one seller and one buyerâ and where âone or both may be hypothetical rather than realâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The judge had to assess the price which the note in question might have realized on about 22<sup>nd</sup> September 1983 on a sale by the assumed willing plaintiffs to some hypothetical willing purchaser.</p>    <p><a name="p301" class="pseudopara" id="p301">301.</a>  I have not found it easy to identify the likely characteristics of such a purchaser. By the sober standards of the western banker,who can happily accommodate the futures market, this market might well be condemned as pure speculation or a pure gamble. This maybe putting it too high, but I am minded to think that any buyer must possess courage : a confident readiness to back his own judgmentor instinct : and to relish the taking of a risk. But how relevant or material is knowledge or experience? Knowledge of the printingprocesses which might point to a noteâs true rarity might, as the judge suggested, help. But no buyer could ever really âknowâor discover in fact how rare a particular note is. He has to make his own assessment and base his price upon it. Nor can I see thatexperience in the existing market for misprinted notes, which produces no true comparables, would do much more than provide a startingpoint. Another relevant characteristic may be something of a collectorâs zeal, that peculiar feeling of satisfaction derived fromthe possession of something thought to be exceedingly rare. But I would be minded to regard the ultimate dominating factor as thebuyer's personal conviction that he is acquiring something rare for a price which will appreciate because others in the future willrecognize its value at a greater sum.</p>        <p><a name="p302" class="pseudopara" id="p302">302.</a>  The significance of this attempted analysis is that it would suggest that the first plaintiff was by no means untypical of thatperhaps small group of persons prepared to enter the upper strata of this market at all. I do not question the truth of the judgeâsview that he was âuninformed, inexpert and only an beginnerâ, p 52(3); and that both he Chan Chun Yip and Chan Shun Hoi did notknow much about error notes or the printing processes. What I question is the significance of this. Their lack of knowledge of theprinting processes was shared by all the other valuers. This plaintiff convinced himself of the rarity of the note and backed hisjudgment. The fact that the knowledge of printing processes may have assisted this, seems to go more to support his view, than tolead to the conclusion that his approach was quite peculiar and unrepresentative. I accept that the dual process of perception ofrarity and the backing of judgment, being personal to every buyer, is calculated to lead to a wide range of prices. But for my partI do not feel justified in dismissing this price of HK$350,000 as pure speculation and as of no assistance at all. I see it ratheras giving an indication of this range.</p>        <p><a name="p303" class="pseudopara" id="p303">303.</a>  On this aspect of the case also I see no reason to dissent from the judgeâs findings of primary fact. These were :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)His preference for the evidence of Leung Tai Leung, the street trader, who he found âa good deal more street-wise and to havea good deal more knowledge of the real market than the other experts who were calledâ, at the market level with which he was familiar. We were invited to conclude that he was a liar largely by reason of answers given in relation to his pre-trial âstatementâ. But it is clear that he was not given a proper opportunity to read through, correct and sign any statement written in his own language,and the judge expressly accepted his account that this was a result of ârather casual conversationâ with the plaintiffsâ solicitor. The judgeâs conclusions were clearly and expressly based upon the impact each witness made upon him and I am far from satisfiedthat he was âplainly wrongâ.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)ârarity is a test for valueâ.  This seemed to be common ground between all the valuers.  In the case of something which isapparently exceptionally rare, this must I think mean the buyerâs perception of rarity.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3)âThat error notes are sold for sums which were quite unknown in a amount to the defendantâs expertsâ.  This conclusion wasbased first upon the evidence of Law Yiu Ching that he had paid US$15,000 (now equivalent to HK$117,000) for a HK$10 note with halfthe printing on its face and the number missing : and had later sold it for US$17,000.  Secondly upon the evidence of Mr Leung himselfparticularly in relation to two pairs of notes he had then available on offer at HK$450,000 and HK$400,000 respectively.  His viewon the first pair was that it was worth HK$450,000 but the minimum price he expected to be accepted was HK$200,000 : whereas in relationto the second he had had an offer of HK$260,000.</p>    </blockquote>        <p><a name="p304" class="pseudopara" id="p304">304.</a>  The judge accepted these figures as a guide to value : as the best comparables he had. They all related to notes containing printingerrors, and may be said to represent the top end of the range for this type of note. But all the evidence tended to show that thecolour error established was of a much greater order of rarity. The problem is to identify the factor which has to be applied tothese comparables to reflect this.</p>        <p><a name="p305" class="pseudopara" id="p305">305.</a>  This is what divides the judge and Kempster J.A.. The judge (at its highest) adopted a factor of four having regard to the printingevidence and to the purchase price. Kempster J.A. feels unable to place any reliance upon the purchase price and arrives at a correspondingfactor of the order of two.</p>        <p><a name="p306" class="pseudopara" id="p306">306.</a>  My initial view as to agree with the judge. The printing evidence alone seemed to me show this factor to be realistic and not excessive,and for the reasons I have sought to give I derive some assistance from the purchase price. To my embarrassment I now found myselfcast in the decisive role. I have therefore most anxiously reconsidered my position. Having done so I am not persuaded that the judgewas wrong.</p>        <p><a name="p307" class="pseudopara" id="p307">307.</a>  There is another approach to this problem which may reflect the uncertainties and peculiarities of this market. It is to considerthe plaintiffsâ loss as the loss of a chance. It may not be inappropriate to liken the plaintiffsâ purchase of this note to thetaking or acquisition by him of three chances. The first chance was that the note was genuine â as it was. The second chance wasthat it was misprinted and not discoloured â as the judge has found. The third chance was that in his own time he would find asimilarly minded buyer at a price which would show him a profit or at least no loss. This is the lost chance which has to be evaluated.It is essentially a jury question. In the words of Fletcher Moulton L.J. in <u>Chaplin v. Hicks</u><a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title="" id="_ftnref40">(17)</a> :</p><blockquote>        <p>âThe jury must give what they think to be an adequate solatium under all the circumstances of the caseâ.</p></blockquote>    <p>On the whole of the evidence in this case I think a hypothetical reasonable jury would be most unlikely to assume against the plaintiffsand in favour of the wrongdoer that the first plaintiff had necessarily gambled and lost. I think it much more likely that such ajury would have evaluated this chance at the figure which would have shown the first plaintiff a very modest profit. This would mirrorthe judgeâs approach.</p>    <p><a name="p308" class="pseudopara" id="p308">308.</a>  For my part therefore I would dismiss this appeal.</p><p>  </p><!--sino section representation --><representation>    <p>Mr. Gilbert Rodway, Q.C. and Mr. Michael Bunting (Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master) for Appellant/Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">Mr. Anthony Rogers, Q.C. and Mr. Benjamin Yu 	(A.C.Y.
