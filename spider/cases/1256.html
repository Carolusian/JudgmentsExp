The Plaintiff, who is a successful businessman, claims that he was motivated by an appeal made by the2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to place advertisements which were to promote democracy in Hong Kong.  After placing such advertisements in 15 local newspapers,the Plaintiff now claims against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant for contribution of half of the advertising expenses incurred by him in placing such advertisements.  As the Plaintifflearnt about the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs appeal from an interview of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant reported in a magazine published by the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant, and such report, says the Plaintiff, did not truly reflect the offer made by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, the Plaintiff also claims against the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants for damages of negligent misstatement. </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  There is a certain degree of political dimension in this case, as the advertisements placed by the Plaintiff were about the reformof the political system in Hong Kong.  At the outset, I must emphasis that the court is not a proper forum to debate the politicalviews of individuals, and it is not the role of the court to decide which proposal should be adopted for the future development ofthe political system in Hong Kong.  However in order to determine legal issues such as the legal effect of the offer made by the2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, it is necessary for the court to take into account what happened in the political arena at the relevant time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Background of the case</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The following facts are not in dispute in the present case.  The Plaintiff, Mr. Koo Ming Kwon, is a successful businessman and heis the founder and chairman of an electronics manufacturing and designing company in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is a major media company with subsidiaries publishing widely circulated newspapers and magazines in Hong Kong.  Of suchpublications, the âApple Dailyâ and the âNext Magazineâ are amongst the most popular news publications.  It is the Plaintiffâscase that the publications of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant are widely recognized to be in support of democracy and âimmediate universal suffrageâ in Hong Kong, an allegationwhich is not disputed by the Defendants in the present case.  On 7 December 2006, the Plaintiff was granted leave to discontinuethe claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, Mr. Lai Chee Ying, Jimmy, is the well-known chairman of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  It is the Plaintiffâs case that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is an influential figure in the Hong Kongâs political arena because of his control over a huge media conglomerate, hisclose association with the pro-democratic political figures and his out-spoken attitude.  Again, such allegation is not disputedby the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, Mr. To Kun Sun, James, is a longstanding member of the Legislative Council.  It is common ground that he is widely regardedas a fervent supporter for democracy and âimmediate universal suffrageâ in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>   The 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant is a subsidiary company of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant publishing the Next Magazine.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>   In 2005, one of the matters of great concern in the political scene in Hong Kong was whether there should be universal suffragefor both the elections of the Chief Executive in 2007 and all the Legislative Councillors in 2008.  On 19 October 2005, the Governmentof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region published a proposed constitutional reform package for the future development of thepolitical system in Hong Kong (âthe Government Reform Packageâ).  As no fixed timetable for universal suffrage was provided inthe Government Reform Package, it attracted criticisms from certain sectors of the public including the members of the so-calledâDemocrat Campâ.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  After the publication of the Government Reform Package, an âanonymous old manâ placed a full-page advertisement in 5 local newspaperson 28 October 2005.  The advertisement contained a question: âåè¨´æï¼ ææçè¦æ®é¸çä¸å¤©åï¼â (the agreed Englishtranslations as âTell me, will I be able to see the day when we have universal suffrage?â)  The message of this advertisementwas clear, the âanonymous old manâ wanted to have immediate universal suffrage for both the elections of the Chief Executiveand the Legislative Councillors.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 2 November 2005, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant wrote an article in Apple Daily (âthe 2<sup>nd</sup> November Articleâ) with the title: âé¦æ¸¯äººï¼è«æ«çè¯ç¥è¡åºä¾â (the agreed English translations as âHongKongers:Please listen to your conscience and step outâ).  In this article, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant praised the âanonymous old manâ for the courage in publishing the said advertisement.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant then appealed to all the people in Hong Kong to step forward to fight for immediate universal suffrage and to join themass demonstration scheduled on 4 December 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article contained the following paragraph in bold prints which is the subject matter of the contractual claim against the2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant (âthe Subject Paragraphâ):</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âæå¿çåç·å¥³ï¼å¦æä½ è¦åèä¼¯é£æ¨£å¨ãèææ¥å ±ãè³£å»£åï¼ä½åºæ°ä¸»çæå¼ï¼æé¡æçµ¦ä½ åå¹åªæ ãç¶ç¶ï¼æåæ¯ä¸å¸å¬å¸ï¼æªå¾è¡æ±ææ¬ï¼ææ²ææ¬éæ¨£åãä¸éæå¯ä»¥æ¿è«¾ï¼ä½ å¦æè¦å¨ãèææ¥å ±ãè³£å»£ååèµ·é¦æ¸¯äººçæ°ä¸»æè­ï¼æé¡æèªæè·åæ¿ä½ ä»ä¸åå»£åè²»ãâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">The agreed English translations are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote"><i>âFor any kind-hearted man or woman who cares, if you want to publish an advertisement in âApply Dailyâ like what the old manhad done to roar for democracy, I shall be willing to offer you a 50% discount.

The format and the wordings of the proposed advertisement were provided in such notice, and anyone wishingto take part in the campaign was asked to pay $200 to Apply Daily Limited.  After making the payment, the name of the supporter wouldthen appear as a signatory supporting the message contained in the proposed advertisement.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Later on 10 November 2005, the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant published an article in the Next magazine (âthe 10<sup>th</sup> November Articleâ) with the title:  âç¡åé¿ä¼¯ç­æ°ä¸»â (the agreed English translations as âAnonymous old man strivesfor democracyâ).  This article is of some importance as it is the subject matter for both the contractual claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and the negligent misstatement claim against the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants.  Part of the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article was about areport of an interview with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, who told the reporter how he had assisted the anonymous old man mentioned above in placing the advertisements in newspapers. The article then went on to say that the stance of some of the Legislative Councillors in the Democrat Camp was ambiguous and hadsoftened, as they were prepared to have further discussion about the development of the political system in Hong Kong even withouta timetable for universal suffrage.  However, said the article, ever since the publication of the first advertisement by the anonymousold man, there were more voices in the community demanding for immediate universal suffrage.  After the voicing out of such view,some of the Legislative Councillors in the Democrat Camp changed their stance and insisted the Government to provide a timetablefor universal suffrage.  According to the article, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantalso had a conversation with a second anonymous old man, who had earlier donated money to produce street boards to opposethe enactment of legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law, with the relevant passage as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âãæåä½¢ï¼ä½ ç¥åç¥å£¹å³åªä¸»å¸­é»æºè±è©±éåç»å»£åï¼ä½¢åºä¸åï¼ä½ åå¤å¢è¬åªåèååããçµæåä¸é¿ä¼¯è¢«ãæ¿ãåµäºãâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">The agreed English translations are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote"><i>â'I asked him, do you know that Lai Chee Ying, the Chairman of Next Media, said he would pay half of the cost for anyone who publishedan advertisement.

Wilkinson &amp; Grist, witha view to publish such advertisement in the front pages of all the major newspapers in Hong Kong.  After finalising the draft, Mr.Ho sent the draft to one Madam Wong Shui Ching (âMadam Wongâ, who is also known as Madam Anissa Lee) of Liko Advertising DesignCo., Ltd. (âLikoâ) who then liaised with the major newspapers for the publication of the advertisement.

The Plaintiff suspected that the anonymous old men referred to by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article did not actually exist, and he therefore requested the Legislative Council to investigate whether there was anyimpropriety on the part of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant.  As the Legislative Council refused to take up his complaint, the Plaintiff went to a police station to lodge the samecomplaint against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant.  On the same day, the Plaintiffâs solicitors, Messrs. Wilkinson &amp; Grist, sent a demand letter to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant asking him to contribute half of the advertising expenses of the Plaintiffâs Advertisements.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was given 3 days to make the payment, failing which, said the demand letter, legal action would be instituted by the Plaintiffagainst the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  As no reply was given to the Plaintiffâs solicitors before the deadline, the Plaintiff commenced the present actionagainst the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants on 21 November 2005.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The claims and the issues in this case</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  It is the Plaintiffâs case that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had, in the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article, made an unilateral offer to the members of the general public that, should any person place advertisements in newspapersto participate in the discussion of the Government Reform Package, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would contribute and pay half of the advertising expenses concerned.  Acting upon such offer, the Plaintiff had acceptedthe 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer by placing the Plaintiffâs Advertisements in 15 newspapers in Hong Kong.  As the Plaintiff contends that therewas a valid binding contract between the parties, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is liable to indemnify the Plaintiff of half of the advertising expenses.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The Plaintiffâs original claim as pleaded in the Amended Statement of claim amounts to $554,152, which is half of the amount ofthe advertising expenses for all the 15 newspapers.  However at the commencement of the trial, Mr. Pow SC, counsel for the Plaintiff,conceded that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer, when properly construed, was only limited to advertisements placed in Apple Daily only.  Hence, the amount ofthe Plaintiffâs contractual claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantis reduced to $55,500, which is half of the cost for placing the Plaintiffâs Advertisement in Apply Daily on 16 November2005.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>   It is also the Plaintiffâs case that, before he placed the Plaintiffâs Advertisements, he did not learn about the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer directly from reading the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article, and instead he knew about the offer from a report of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantâs interview contained in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article published in the Next Magazine.  As it was not stated in 10<sup>th</sup> November Article that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer was limited to advertisements placed in Apple Daily only, he was not aware of such limitation in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer.  The Plaintiff therefore contends that the report in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article was false, misleading and inaccurate, and the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants are liable to pay him damages caused by such negligent misstatement.  The total amount of such claim is $470,222.50, whichis half of the advertising expenses for all the 15 newspapers after deducting the commission charged by Liko.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  There is only one major factual dispute in the present case.  According to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants, one Mr. Tang of Apple Daily Limited had, prior to the publication of the Plaintiffâs Advertisements on 16 November2005, told Madam Wong of Liko that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would not pay any contribution for the advertising fees of the Plaintiffâs Advertisement because such advertisement didnot comply with the terms of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer.  The Plaintiff disputes such allegation.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Based on the matters raised in the pleadings and the said factual dispute, the issues of the contractual claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(a)  whether the terms of the alleged offer contained in the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article were sufficiently certain so that there was a valid contract made between the Plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(b) assuming that the terms of the offer were certain, whether the Plaintiff had complied with the terms of such offer by placingthe Plaintiffâs Advertisements with the messages and contents contained therein;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(c)  by making and accepting the alleged offer, whether there was any intention on the part of the parties to create legal relationship;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(d) as the Plaintiff did not learn about the offer directly from the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article and he was not by then aware of all the terms of the offer, whether the placing of the Plaintiffâs Advertisementsconstituted a valid acceptance of the offer; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(e)  as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant claims that his agent had, prior to the publication of the Plaintiffâs Advertisements, expressly informed the Plaintiffâsagent that the contents in the Plaintiffâs Advertisements did not comply with the terms of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer, whether such factual allegation, if found to be the truth, properly constitutes a valid defence to the Plaintiffâscontractual claim.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  For the claim of negligent misstatement against the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants, the issues are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(a)  whether the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants did owe a duty of care to the Plaintiff relating to the accuracy of the contents in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(b) whether the report contained in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article was false, misleading or inaccurate;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(c)  whether the Plaintiff did in fact rely on the contents in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article in publishing the Plaintiffâs Advertisements.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  I must point out here that any ruling in favour of the 2<sup>nd</sup> to the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants on one single issue above would have been sufficient to dismiss the claims.  However, the Plaintiff fails miserably innearly all of these issues and so his claims cannot possibly succeed.  For the sake of clarity, I will deal with each of these issuesin turn and set out the reasons for my rulings against the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The contractual claim</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(i)  Certainty of the terms of the alleged offer</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The first 3 issues of the contractual claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, which relate to certainty of terms, meaning of the terms of the offer and intention to create legal relationship, arevery much interrelated issues.  In a way, whether the terms of the offer were sufficiently certain depends very much on the constructionof the meaning of the offer.  On the other hand, whether the parties did have any intention to create legal relationship has to beconsidered in the light of the meaning of the offer and the certainty of the terms used in the offer.  In any event, I start withthe first issue about the certainty of terms.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  It is trite law that an agreement is not a binding contract if it lacks certainty, either because it is too vague or because itis obviously incomplete.  In deciding whether the terms of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer were sufficiently certain, the court has to try to ascertain the meaning of such offer.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  According to the pleadings, the Plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant have different understandings about the terms of the offer.  The Plaintiff contends that the offer covered any advertisementswhich could be regarded as a participation in the discussion of the Government Reform Package.  On the other hand, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant maintains that his offer only covered advertisements which fully supported the fight for universal suffrage in respectof the elections of the Chief Executive and all the Legislative Councillors in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Although this is not a forum for political debate, it is clear that the political view expressed by the Plaintiff in the PlaintiffâsAdvertisements was completely different from that of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  In the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had expressly stated that there should be immediate universal suffrage for both the elections of the Chief Executive andall the Legislative Councillors in 2007 and 2008, or at least, there should be a timetable for the introduction of universal suffragein Hong Kong.  On the other hand, the Plaintiff, whilst agreeing generally that there should be democracy in Hong Kong, supportedthe Government Reform Package with no fixed timetable for universal suffrage.  As admitted by the Plaintiff in his oral testimony,timing for the introduction of universal suffrage was the crux of the political debate by that time.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I am not here to decide which political view should be preferred for the future development of the political system in Hong Kong. This is not the role of the court.  However, I must stress that the subjective understandings of the parties are quite irrelevantfor the court to determine the meaning of the offer.  In the construction exercise, the terms of the offer have to be construed objectivelyby reference to all the surrounding circumstances of the case at the time of the making of the offer.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In ascertaining the meaning of the terms, Mr. Pow has urged the court to adopt the so-called âblinker approachâ.  As the authorof the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article had deliberately highlighted the Subject Paragraph in bold prints with a view to attract the attention of the readers,the court, says Mr. Pow, should just focus on the words in the Subject Paragraph in construing the meaning of the offer.  On theother hand, Mr. Chow SC, counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants, submits that the court should look at the contents of the whole 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article in ascertaining the meaning of the offer.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  In my judgment, the result of this case would be the same whichever approach is to be adopted.  First, I start with Mr. Powâsblinker approach.  According to the wordings in the Subject Paragraph, the expressions âä½åºæ°ä¸»çæå¼â(to roar for democracy)and âåèµ·é¦æ¸¯äººçæ°ä¸»æè­â (to arouse the democratic consciousness of Hong Kong people) were used to describe the advertisementscovered by the offer, and so the advertisements placed by the offeree must fit with these 2 descriptions.  However, I agree withMr. Chow that the words âä½åºæ°ä¸»çæå¼â(to roar for democracy) are inherently vague and uncertain, and there is simplyno objective yardstick or standard which can be used to determine whether any advertisement is one which amounts to a âroar fordemocracyâ.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Further, it is also difficult to judge whether an advertisement is one which arouses the democratic consciousness of the peopleof Hong Kong.  As I see it, the words âdemocracyâ and âdemocratic consciousnessâ are political terms.  Very much influencedby the political view of each individual, different persons may have different understandings as to what amounts to democracy ordemocratic consciousness.  This is particularly the case when there was a heated political debate about the Government Reform Packageand the timing for the introduction of universal suffrage at the time of the making of the offer.  The usage of such terms to describethe advertisement was therefore inherently vague, and that is why I say that the terms of the offer were uncertain.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Mr. Pow submits that as the wording of the offer was only ambiguous, the court can resolve the issue by adopting an interpretationwhich is against the interest of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant who was maker of the offer.  In fact, the court in the classic case of <i>Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1893%5d%201%20QB%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1893] 1 QB 256</a> did apply the rule of <i>contra proferentem</i> in construing the meaning of an offer made in a newspaper advertisement against the interest of the advertiser.  However in my judgment,such rule should only be applied if the court, after considering the literal and natural meaning of the words, is capable to findout, with some certainty, 2 or more alternative interpretations of the offer, the court can then apply the rule and adopt a meaningwhich is against the interest of the maker of the offer.  It is quite different from the present case that, by reason of the inherentvagueness and uncertainty of the terms used in the offer, the court simply cannot ascertain the meaning of the terms.  Hence, thePlaintiff cannot benefit from the <i>contra proferentem</i> rule in the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  I also disagree with Mr. Powâs submission that the phrase âto roar for democracyâ was only figurative and descriptive of theact of speaking out in support of democracy, and the court should ignore such expression in ascertaining the meaning of the advertisementqualified for the offer.  The facts here clearly show that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was appealing for support from the members of the public to join his political propaganda campaign.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had expressly used such phrase to describe the support, it then follows that such support, which took the form of placingpolitical advertisements in newspapers, must be one which amounted to âa roar for democracyâ before the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was prepared to pay the contribution.  Hence, the court cannot ignore such phrase in construing the meaning of the offer. As I find that the meaning of such phrase is inherently vague and uncertain, the Plaintiff cannot benefit from the blinker approachput forward by Mr. Pow.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Further, I find that such approach is wholly unrealistic.  Unlike other offers made in a commercial context, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer was an unusual one.  It referred to advertisements in support of a political propaganda campaign, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant himself was prepared to make substantial contribution for advertising expenses to anyone responding to such appeal.  Takinginto account the unique nature of such offer, I do not accept that a normal and reasonable reader would just look at the very vagueand general expressions used in the Subject Paragraph in understanding the meaning of the offer.  They would certainly read the whole2<sup>nd</sup> November Article in trying to find out what sort of advertisement would be covered by the offer before making a decision whetherto incur substantial advertising expenses in response to such appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  If one purports to read the whole article, the meaning of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer may become clearer.  The author of the article was of the view that there should be immediate universal suffragein both the elections in 2007 and 2008, or at least there should be a timetable for the introduction of universal suffrage in HongKong.  The words âto roar for democracyâ and âwith the intent to arouse the democratic consciousness of Hong Kong peopleâmust therefore be construed in that context.  In other words, âdemocracyâ or âdemocratic consciousnessâ must mean that theadvertisements had to support the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs political view of universal suffrage as expressed in the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article.  Further, it was clear that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was lobbying support to oppose the Government Reform Package published in October 2005, and I do not find that any reasonablereader, after viewing the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article, would seriously believe that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would be prepared to spend money on any advertisement which did not support his political view.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  However, does it mean that, after reading the whole article, the meaning of the offer was sufficiently clear?  In my judgment, theanswer is still no.  In the Re-Amended Defence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, it is pleaded that the offer only covered advertisements which supported the fight for universal suffrage in respect ofthe elections of the Chief Executive and all the Legislative Councillors in Hong Kong.  This was certainly in line with the viewexpressed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article.  However, one may then raise the following question: was an advertisement which advocated the introduction of universalsuffrage at a later date, for example in 2012 or 2017, covered by the offer?  The answer is unclear even after reading the wholearticle.  Hence, no matter what approach is to be adopted, I do not find that the terms in the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article were sufficiently clear to constitute a legally binding offer, and the Plaintiffâs contractual claim must thereforefail.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(ii) Compliance with the terms of the alleged <i>offer</i></p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Assuming that I am wrong on the aforesaid analysis and that the terms of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer were sufficiently certain, then in my judgment, it is quite obvious that the Plaintiffâs Advertisements didnot comply with the terms of the offer.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In the Amended Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff pleads that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer covered any advertisements which could be regarded as a participation in the discussion of the Government ReformPackage.  However, it is clear that the actual wordings used in the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article did not support such a contention.  The Subject Paragraph in the article referred to advertisements which âarousethe democratic consciousness of Hong Kong peopleâ.  These words are very different from the terms put forward by the Plaintiffin the pleading.  Hence, the Plaintiff has simply failed to prove his case as pleaded.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Apart from the pleading issue, it is clear that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer, when construed objectively, carried a different meaning.  If one reads the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article, there could not be any real doubt that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was making an appeal to the public to speak out in support of the fight for universal suffrage of the elections of theChief Executive and all the Legislative Councillors in 2007 and 2008 respectively.  He referred to the advertisements placed by theanonymous old man and praised his heroic deed in the fight for universal suffrage.  Further, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was lobbying support to oppose the Government Reform Package.  In such circumstances, I do not find that any reasonablereader would have understood the offer to cover all advertisements which could just be regarded as a participation in the discussionof the Government Reform Package, which is the case put forward by the Plaintiff.  On the contrary, the terms of the offer, whenconstrued objectively, only covered advertisements which supported the fight for universal suffrage in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Neither could there be any real doubt that, objectively speaking, the Plaintiffâs Advertisements, which expressed a full supportfor the Government Reform Package and thus a denial of universal suffrage of the elections of the Chief Executive and all the LegislativeCouncillors in 2007 and 2008 respectively, is precisely the opposite of what the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was appealing the general public to do.  Hence, there was no performance on the part of the Plaintiff which could possiblyqualify as an acceptance of the offer. </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  I am not here to decide whether the political view of the Plaintiff or that of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant should be preferred for the future development of the political system in Hong Kong.  However, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was entitled to set out his own terms on what sort of advertisements would qualify for the payment under his offer.  AsI see it, the terms used by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant were not sufficiently certain and so such offer did not constitute a legally binding offer, and even if the meaning ofthe offer was clear, the Plaintiffâs Advertisements did not comply with the terms of such offer.  Hence whatever way you look atthe Plaintiffâs contractual claim, it is bound to fail.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(iii)    Intention to create legal relationship</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  The rulings on the aforesaid issues would have been sufficient to dismiss the Plaintiffâs contractual claim.  However, for thesake of completeness, I should perhaps also deal with the few remaining issues of such claim.  Before I do so, I should stress thatfor such issues to become live issues, one has to proceed on the following premises: firstly, the meaning of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer was sufficiently clear; and secondly, such offer was very wide as it covered any advertisements which could beregarded as a participation in the discussion of the Government Reform Package.  As I have mentioned above, such premises were whollyunrealistic, but for the following discussion to be meaningful, such assumptions have to be made.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Assuming that the offer was that wide, I do not find that any objective bystander, after reading the offer, would have seriouslybelieved that there was any intention to create legal relationship on the part of the parties.  In fact, the terms of the offer wereexceptionally wide, and nearly any advertisement which touched upon the political development of Hong Kong, no matter what was thepolitical view advocated therein, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would be subject to legal obligation to pay half of the advertising expenses.  The liability might just be unlimited. Further, the advertisement might contain views which were contrary to the political idea of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  In such case, why would the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant be so generous to have agreed to pay half of the advertising expenses?  This does not make any sense.  Hence in my judgment,no reasonable reader would have seriously believed that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had had the intention to enter into legal relationship based on such wide offer.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  On the other hand, if the offer was restricted to only advertisements which supported universal suffrage, it seemed that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would have had all the intention to honour his âpromiseâ to pay half of the advertising expenses.  In fact, exceptfor the Plaintiffâs Advertisements, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had honoured his âcommitmentâ for all the other advertisements placed in response to his appeal.  Undoubtedly, allthese advertisements supported the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs political view as expressed in the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article.  I must stress again that the subjective intention of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is not relevant for the court to determine, objectively, whether there was any intention to create legal relationship onthe part of the parties.  However, based on the analysis above, I do not find that any objective bystander would have believed thatthe 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and the Plaintiff had had the intention to enter into legal relationship if the terms of the offer were that wide.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(iv)    âAcceptanceâ with no knowledge of all the terms of the offer</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  It is the Plaintiffâs case that he had not read the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer as contained in the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article, and rather he learnt about the offer through the report of an interview with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant contained in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article.  Hence, one of the issues arising in the present case is that, with no direct knowledge of all the terms of the2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer, whether there was valid acceptance of the offer on the part of the Plaintiff in publishing the PlaintiffâsAdvertisements on 16 November 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Again, for such issue to become a live issue, I have to proceed on the basis that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer was wide enough to cover any advertisements which could be regarded as a participation in the discussion of theGovernment Reform Package, otherwise the Plaintiffâs claim would fail as the Plaintiffâs Advertisements did not fall within theterms of the offer.  This assumption would have a significant bearing on the consideration of such issue.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  The general view is that acceptance in ignorance of an offer cannot create a contract since the parties must reach agreement.  Itis not enough that the wishes of the offeror and offeree just happen to coincide, and the act or promise constituting the acceptancemust be âgiven in exchange for the offerâ (see: <i>Trietel, The Law of Contract</i>, 12 ed., paras. 2-047).  In other words, there must be some sort of consensus between the parties before the court can find thatthere is a binding contract.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  In <i>R v Clarke</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281927%29%2040%20CLR%20227" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1927) 40 CLR 227</a>, the High Court of Australia gave a very comprehensive analysis of the issue whether âacceptanceâ in ignorance, or forgetfulness,of the offer can give rise to a binding contract.  In that case, a reward was publicly offered by the Government of Western Australiaâfor such information as shall lead to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons who committed the murdersâ of 2 policeofficers.  One Mr. Clarke gave information that led to the arrest of a person, who together with another person were subsequentlyconvicted of the murder of one of those officers.  Mr. Clarke therefore claimed for the reward.  The trial judge found that whenMr. Clarke provided the information, he did so without reference to the offer, but rather he provided the information with a viewto clear himself from a false charge of murder.  As the claimant had not performed the conditions of the offer acting on the faithof or in reliance upon the offer, the High Court of Australia upheld the decision of the trial judge that there was no acceptanceof the offer.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  In the judgment, the High Court of Australia had carefully reviewed most of the relevant English authorities on the subject.  Accordingto the learned justices, unless the offereeâs conduct was done âwith reference toâ or âin reliance ofâ or âwith intentionto acceptâ the offer, there was no acceptance of the offer.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  The present case, however, is not one where the Plaintiff was completely ignorant of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer.  The question is therefore, as Mr. Chow puts it, what is the minimum that the Plaintiff must have known beforethere could be a valid acceptance of the offer.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In this regard, Mr. Pow submits that for there to be a valid acceptance, it is sufficient for the offeree to know the existenceand the essence of the offer when he performed the act which complied with the terms of the offer.  On the other hand, Mr Chow contendsthat the offeree must at least know all the material terms of the offer before it can be said that his conduct was done âwith referencetoâ or âin reliance ofâ or âwith intention to acceptâ the offer.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  In my judgment, there is very little difference between the 2 tests put forward by counsel.  For there to be a valid acceptance,the offeree must first know about the existence of the offer.  Further, the offeree must know the essence of the terms of the offerso that the court can confidently say that there is some sort of consensus between the parties and the offereeâs conduct was doneâwith reference toâ or âin reliance ofâ or âwith intention to acceptâ the offer.  As I see it, it is very difficult forthe court to lay down more specific guideline, and what is sufficient knowledge must be decided on the facts of each individual case.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  However, if the terms of the offer are very general, it would be easier for the offeree to say that he knew enough of the essenceof the offer.  In the present case, assuming that the terms of the offer were wide enough to cover any advertisements which couldbe regarded as a participation in the discussion of the Government Reform Package, then it seemed that the Plaintiffâs understandingof the terms of the offer was correct and the publication of the Plaintiffâs Advertisements was done by the Plaintiff âwith referencetoâ or âin reliance ofâ or âwith intention to acceptâ the offer.  However, I have already ruled that the meaning of the2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer could not have been that wide, and even if the meaning was that wide, the terms of the offer were either uncertainor that there was no intention on the part of the parties to create legal relationship based on such wide terms.  Hence, even ifthe Plaintiff can succeed on the acceptance issue, it cannot benefit his claim.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  I have also one more observation about this issue.  It is the Plaintiffâs evidence that he relied on the contents in 10<sup>th</sup> November Article and simply believed that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer covered any advertisements which could be regarded as a participation in the discussion of the Government ReformPackage.  I have great difficulty in accepting such evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  In the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article, only a very general account was provided with reference to the offer:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote"><i>â'I asked him, do you know that Lai Chee Ying, the Chairman of Next Media, said he would pay half of the cost for anyone who publishedan advertisement.  You got so much to say, might as well take part in it.â  As a result, another old man was âactivatedâ andencouraged.â</i><i> </i> (the agreed English translations)</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">However, this statement did not state the subject matter which the advertisement was required to be on.  Nor did it state the viewsor stance which the advertisement was required to express in order to qualify for payment under the offer.  As I see it, no reasonablereader would simply rely on such general statement and then incur substantial advertising expenses without taking the trouble tofind out more about the terms of the offer from the original source. </p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  In fact, if one reads the statement in the proper context of the whole article, it would not be too difficult for one to reach theconclusion that in order to qualify for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer, the advertisement must be one similar to that published by the âanonymous old manâ, which was to supportthe fight for immediate universal suffrage and to oppose the Government Reform Package.  The Plaintiffâs evidence is thereforewholly incredible.   Together with the findings I make later in this judgment about the motive of the Plaintiff, I have reason tobelieve that the Plaintiff had either looked at the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article before placing the Plaintiffâs Advertisements, in such case acceptance without knowledge of the terms of the offerwould not be an issue; or that the Plaintiff had deliberately made use of the vagueness of the report in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article as an excuse to commence the present proceedings against the Defendants, and in such case the Plaintiff had notin fact relied on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer in placing the Plaintiffâs Advertisements.  Whichever is the truth, the Plaintiffâs contractual claim isbound to fail.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(v) Express refusal by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to pay half of the advertising expenses</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>    According to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, one Mr. Tang Kit Chuen of Apple Daily, who was tasked with the job of handling advertisements placed by members of thepublic in response to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs appeal, had, prior to 16 November 2005, told the Plaintiffâs agent, Madam Wong of Liko, that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would not pay half of the advertising expenses because the Plaintiffâs Advertisement did not comply with the terms ofthe 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer.  By reason of such conversation, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant claims that the Plaintiff, in placing the Plaintiffâs Advertisement, cannot be regarded as having acted âwith referencetoâ or âin reliance ofâ or âwith intention to acceptâ the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Based on the findings made in the last section of this judgment, I have already held that the Plaintiff could not have acted inreliance of the offer in placing the Plaintiffâs Advertisements, and so it is absolutely unnecessary for me to determine this particularissue.  However, since the parties had devoted considerable time at the trial to deal with the evidence about this only factual dispute,I should perhaps also give my findings on this issue.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  According to Mr. Tang, who was the Account Manager (Sales and Marketing) of Apple Daily Limited, Madam Wong approached him sometime in November 2005 to arrange for the publication of the Plaintiffâs Advertisement.  Given the political nature of the advertisement,which was different from the other normal commercial ones, he passed the draft Plaintiffâs Advertisement to the legal departmentof Apple Daily and his superior, Mr. Peter Hui, for approval.  Before the actual publication of the Plaintiffâs Advertisement,Madam Wong asked Mr. Tang whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would contribute half of the advertising expenses.  After discussing the matter with Mr. Hui, he told Madam Wong that the2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would not do so because the contents of the Plaintiffâs Advertisement did not comply with the terms of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer.  Despite such reply, Madam Wong still proceeded with the order in Apple Daily.  Further, Mr. Tang had not askedMadam Wongâs client to delete or revise the footnote in the Plaintiffâs Advertisement because it was not the policy of AppleDaily to censor the contents of advertisements.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Madam Wong, on the other hand, disputes that she had ever asked Mr. Tang about the contribution of advertising expenses.  Accordingto her, she did not look at the details of the draft of the Plaintiffâs Advertisement when she placed the orders on behalf of thePlaintiff.  She also did not pay attention to the contents of the footnote in the draft.  Some of the newspapers changed the wordingsin the footnote of the Plaintiffâs Advertisement.  However, Madam Wong did not read the final published versions prepared by thedifferent newspapers, and she did not pay attention to the fact that the footnotes in some of the published advertisements were differentfrom the others.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Having carefully considered their evidence, I prefer to accept Mr. Tangâs version on the balance of probabilities.  In determiningwhether Madam Wong had expressly asked Mr. Tang about the contribution of advertising expenses, one of the key considerations iswhether Madam Wong knew about the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer before her dealing with Mr. Tang.  In her oral testimony, Madam Wong maintains that she had no such knowledge. She said that there was nothing in the draft of the Plaintiffâs Advertisement which attracted her attention, and she just actedas a conduit in passing the documents and the orders between the sales departments of the various newspapers and the Plaintiffâssolicitors.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  In my judgment, this does not make a lot of sense.  Unlike other commercial advertisements, the Plaintiffâs Advertisement wasa unique one involving highly sensitive political issues.  Even out of curiosity, I would expect that an advertising agent handlingthe order would have read through the contents of the advertisement.  Further, the Plaintiffâs order was a big and profitable transactionfor Madam Wongâs company, and it involved an unusual political advertisement to be published in the front page of every major newspaperin Hong Kong.  In such circumstances, Madam Wong should have devoted extra effort in handling this particular order, including checkingthe accuracy of the final published versions of the Plaintiffâs Advertisements prepared by the different newspapers.  This shouldhave been her professional duty.  Hence, I do not accept her evidence that she had not paid attention to the contents of the PlaintiffâsAdvertisements when she placed such orders.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Further, Madam Wongâs evidence about the lack of knowledge of the offer is wholly contradictory to her evidence given in paragraph4 of her supplemental witness statement, in which she admitted that she knew about the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer from her peers and friends before she was approached by the Plaintiffâs solicitors to arrange for the placementof the Plaintiffâs Advertisements.  The supplemental statement was a very short statement made not too long before the commencementof the trial specifically to challenge Mr. Tangâs evidence about the alleged conversation, and so it is very difficult to explainwhy there is such glaring inconsistency in her evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  In fact, Madam Wong is not a very forthcoming witness.  She tries very much to distance herself from the tasks that she was instructedto perform at the relevant time.  Further, it is very difficult for me to accept her evidence about her role in the revision of thefinal published versions of the Plaintiffâs Advertisements.  Clearly, some of the newspapers had asked the Plaintiff to changethe wordings in the footnote of the Plaintiffâs Advertisement.  This was certainly an important matter for Madam Wongâs client,and advertising agent like Madam Wong should have played an important role in the communications between the various newspapers andthe Plaintiffâs solicitors about the finalisation of the published drafts.  Yet, Madam Wong tries to distance herself and claimsthat she paid very little attention to the contents of the Plaintiffâs Advertisements.  As I see it, this is only an attempt byMadam Wong to cover up the fact that she had had knowledge of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer when she placed the orders for the publication of the Plaintiffâs Advertisements.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  According to Mr. Tang, Madam Wong proceeded with the order despite being told that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would not pay the contribution for the advertising expenses.  In such case, Mr. Pow argues, why should Madam Wong havemade the enquiry in the first place?  As I see it, it was quite natural for Madam Wong to make such enquiry in view of her knowledgeof the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer.  Obviously, the Plaintiffâs Advertisement was an unusual one, and she might want to know more about the paymentarrangement in the case that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was prepared to make the contribution.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Further, I do not find that there is any material inconsistency in Mr. Tangâs evidence.  Whilst Mr. Tang would be in the positionto deal with most of the matters relating to the placement of advertisements in response to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs appeal, Mr. Tang should have been more careful in dealing with Madam Wongâs order.  It was obvious that the politicalview expressed by the Plaintiff in the Plaintiffâs Advertisement was very different from that of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant stated in the 2<sup>nd</sup> November Article, and yet Madam Wong made an enquiry with him as to whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would contribute half of the advertising expenses.  As I see it, it would only have been sensible and normal for Mr. Tangto have further consultation with Mr. Hui on such enquiry.  Further, whether the name of the Plaintiff had been expressly mentionedin the various conversations between Madam Wong and Mr. Tang is also a minor matter, as I would not expect Mr. Tang to memorise everydetail of the conversations.  I do not find that such matters affect the creditability of Mr. Tang as a reliable witness.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Mr. Pow also challenges Mr. Tang as to why he had allowed the footnote in the Plaintiffâs Advertisement to remain in the originalversion when the same was published in Apple Daily.  The footnote of the original draft stated that the Plaintiff had been encouragedby the offer made by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to subsidize half of the advertising expenses to take part in the discussion of the constitutional reform.  As the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was not prepared to pay the contribution, the contents of the footnote could not be right, and yet Mr. Tang had allowedthe original version of the footnote to be published in Apple Daily.  However, Mr. Tang was a relatively junior staff and there wasno reason for him to take the initiative in revising the contents of the footnote, in particular the draft had been approved by thelegal department of his company.  In any event, the declaration in the footnote only reflected the personal stance of the Plaintiff,and so there was no point for Mr. Tang to depart from the policy of Apple Daily in not censoring the contents of the advertisementsplaced by its clients.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Mr. Pow also argues that Mr. Tangâs version of events is only a recent fabrication, as such defence was not raised in the originalDefence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant but only in the subsequent amendments.  Mr. Tang has already provided an explanation for this in the witness box, and Iaccept it to be the truth.  In my judgment, given that Mr. Tang is a not qualified lawyer, one cannot expect him to have been soalert as to approach the legal advisers of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to offer assistance on his own initiative. </p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>   Hence, I resolve this factual issue in favour the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  As there is no dispute that Madam Wong was acting as the agent of the Plaintiff at the material time, the Plaintiff,after having knowledge of the express refusal by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to pay the contribution and not bothering to check the terms of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer from the true source, could not have relied on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer in placing the Plaintiffâs Advertisements on 16 November 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  By reason of the aforesaid, the Plaintiff fails in nearly all of the issues above and the Plaintiffâs contractual claim must thereforefail.  I then turn to the negligent misstatement claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The n</b><b><i>egligent misstatement claim</i></b></p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(i)  Duty of care</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The Plaintiff claims that the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants were guilty of making negligent misstatement, as they had failed to clarify in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer was limited to advertisements placed in Apply Daily only.  The first issue I have to deal with the negligentmisstatement claim is whether the 3<sup>rd</sup> or the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant did owe a duty of care to the Plaintiff in respect of the accuracy of the contents of the report in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  As established by the leading authority of the House of Lords in <i>Hedley Bryne &amp; Co.

However in <i>BCCI (Overseas) Ltd. v Price Waterhouse (No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20PNLR%20564" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] PNLR 564</a> at 583, Sir Brian Beill stated that the fact that all 3 tests have been used and approved by the House of Lords suggests that: (i)it may be useful to look at any new set of facts by using each of the 3 approaches in turn; and (ii) if the facts are properly analysedand the policy considerations correctly evaluated, the several approaches will yield the same result.  Thus the 3 tests are mutuallysupportive rather than exclusive in their application.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Whichever test is to be applied, the learned authors in <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell, ibid,</i> have identified the following factors to be considered by the court in determining the issue of duty of care in each case:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(i)    the purpose of the statement;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(ii)  the knowledge of the defendant, including knowledge of particular use of the statement, knowledge of reliance on such statement,and knowledge of the class to which the advisees belong; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(iii)    reasonable reliance or dependence on the statement, which includes considerations such as dependence and vulnerability, availabilityof independent advice, authority and skill of defendant, status of defendant, and informal or social context.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  There is no disagreement between the parties about the legal principles mentioned above, and the divergence lays on the applicationof these principles.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Mr. Chow submits that the consideration of the aforesaid factors would lead to a clear and unmistakable conclusion that there cannotpossibly be any duty of care owed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> or the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant to the Plaintiff.  I agree.  The purpose of the statement in question was a mere report of a conversation between the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant and an old man, and it was not, nor did it purport, to be a report of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer or an announcement on behalf of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant of his offer.  Further, taking into account the nature of the contents of the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article which was about an interview between the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant and a reporter, the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants cannot be expected to have knowledge that a reader of such article would use and rely on the reported conversation asbeing a statement, or containing the terms, of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs unilateral offer and acted upon it without any further verification of the true terms of the offer.  Neither is thereany basis for thinking that the 3 or the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant would reasonably be expected to know that the Plaintiff was a member of a class of persons likely to be relying on thereported interview for such purpose.  In such circumstances, it was wholly unreasonable for the Plaintiff to have treated and reliedon the reported conversation as being a statement, or setting out the terms, of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs unilateral offer and acted on it as such.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Further, the readers of the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article were plainly not in any position of dependence or vulnerability.  Taking into account the nature of the report,one would not expect the readers to treat the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article as setting out the full terms of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer.  By that time, the offer was already in the public domain, and it would have been a very simple matter for thereaders to check out the terms of such offer from the true source.  The fact that the Plaintiff himself had all along been actingwith the benefit of legal advice from his solicitor further weakens the Plaintiffâs claim in this regard.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  In addition, the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants did not purport to act as professional persons giving advice intended to guide the conduct of advisees.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was just a political figure giving an interview to a reporter, and the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant was only a publisher of a local magazine reporting on a matter of political concern at the material time.  The magazinewas quite different from a legal or financial document like a company prospectus or an audited account.  The 10<sup>th</sup> November Article was also not a legal notice published in the gazette or a newspaper which the readers would normally take the contentsas correct without the need of further verification from other sources.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Based on the aforesaid considerations, the result of this case would be the same no matter what is the test to be adopted in determiningthe issue of duty of care.  If one were to apply the assumption of responsibility test, there is simply no basis to say that the3<sup>rd</sup> or the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant had assumed any responsibility to the Plaintiff, being one of an indefinite class of readers, for the accuracy of the reportedconversation between the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant and the old man as setting out the full and complete terms of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer.  If one were to apply the three-stage test of foreseeability, proximity, and fairness, justice and reasonableness,it cannot possibly be argued that it was reasonably foreseeable by the 3<sup>rd</sup> or the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant that a reader of the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article would simply act on the reported conversation between the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant and the old man without carrying out any further checking on the full and complete terms of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer, or that there was any proximate relationship between the 3<sup>rd</sup> or the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant on the one part and the Plaintiff on the other, or that it is fair, just or reasonable to impose a duty on the 3<sup>rd</sup> or the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant in this situation.  Lastly, if one were to apply the incremental test, there is also no existing authority which is evenremotely similar to the current situation such that the imposition of a duty of care on the part of the 3<sup>rd</sup> or the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant can be said to be incremental.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  In his submission, Mr. Pow argues that the object of the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article was to lobby public support for the political propaganda campaign initiated by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant earlier.  This was also the same purpose when the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant gave the interview to the reporter of the Next Magazine.  Given the highly sensitive political atmosphere at the relevanttime and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was an influential political figure, it was foreseesable, says Mr. Pow, that readers would be motivated by the contentsof the report and proceed to place advertisements in newspapers in response to such appeal.  Further, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was the chairman and the majority shareholder of the Next Media Limited and Next Magazine was one of its major publications,readers of such Magazine would, therefore, naturally take that the contents in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article would truly reflect all the essential terms of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  With the greatest respect, Mr. Pow has ignored the nature and the context of the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article.  I may agree that the author of the article seemed to support the fight for immediate universal suffrage.  However,it did not alter the fact that the article was meant to be a general report about the fight for universal suffrage at the politicalscene in Hong Kong at the relevant time.  The article did not purport to be a report of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer or an announcement of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer.  The article only contained a very brief report of a conversation between the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant and the old man, and very little information or particulars about the offer were provided in the article.  In such circumstances,if a reasonable reader wanted to respond to the appeal and determined to place advertisements in newspapers, he or she would certainlyhave ascertained the true terms of the offer from the original source.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  Mr. Pow has also referred me to a number of authorities in which the court, in the context of determining the ambit of the defenceof qualified privilege to a claim for defamation, had expressed an emerging view of the public policy regarding the duty of the press,which in turn led to the development of the notion of âresponsible journalismâ.  However in my judgment, such notion would onlybe relevant if the court has to deal with the policy considerations as to whether to impose a duty of care for the making of thealleged negligent misstatement on the part of the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant.  As the Plaintiff has not even passed the assumption of responsibility, foreseeability or proximity test mentioned above,these authorities cannot assist the Plaintiff in establishing the necessary special relationship between the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Based on the aforesaid, I do not find that there was a duty of care owed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> or the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant to the Plaintiff in respect of the accuracy of the report contained in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article, and the Plaintiffâs negligent misstatement claim cannot therefore succeed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(ii) Falsity of the report in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Mr. Chow raises a pleading issue about the negligent misstatement claim.  According to the Plaintiffâs pleaded case, his claimis based on the premise that the âreport of what was said by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was false, misleading or inaccurateâ (see: paragraph 19 of the Amended Statement of Claim).  In the answer to the Requestfor Further and Better Particulars of the Amended Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff states that the report was âfalse, misleadingor inaccurateâ if the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant did not make the âOfferâ which is defined in paragraph 1 of the Amended Statement of Claim.  The Plaintiffâs caseis therefore based on the assumption that if the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had not in fact made the âOfferâ as defined, then the report would be false, misleading or inaccurate.  However, asa matter of fact, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had never made any offer in the terms as pleaded in paragraph 1 of the Amended Statement of Claim, it then follows thatany true report of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer would necessarily be false, misleading or inaccurate on the Plaintiffâs case.  The argument is therefore whollycircular in nature.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Perhaps one may ignore this technical pleading issue and examine the Plaintiffâs case in substance.  Apparently, the Plaintiffâsmain complaint is that the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article did not set out the full terms of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer, and that was why the report was false, misleading or inaccurate.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  However, one must realise that the report, for what it was, was only a report of a conversation between the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant and an âold manâ, and not a report of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer.  If it was a report of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer or an announcement on behalf of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant of his offer, there may be more substance in the argument that the report ought to have set out the full terms of thatoffer.  Hence, all that could be required of the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant is that it should faithfully report what was truly said by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, and there is no evidence to suggest that what was reported was not an accurate reproduction of what the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant said to the old man.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  As a matter of fact, in any ordinary day-to-day conversation between 2 persons, it is of course not the case that everything isstated with complete literal accuracy or comprehensively.  Much will depend on their relationship and their common knowledge, andthe context in which the conversation takes place.  As I see it, a reasonable reader viewing the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article would also approach the contents in the article in the same manner.  Hence, no fair reading of the report of whatthe 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant said to the âold manâ, considered in the context of the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article as a whole, can lead to the conclusion that the report was in any way false, misleading or inaccurate.  In suchcase, the Plaintiffâs claim cannot succeed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(iii)    Reliance on the report in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  In the course of the trial, both Mr. Chow and Mr. Lee, counsel for the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, had challenged the Plaintiff that there was ulterior motive behind the present litigation.  If there was indeed such motive,it may mean that the Plaintiff had not in fact relied on the contents of the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article in placing the Plaintiffâs Advertisements, and the Plaintiffâs alleged loss in failing to recover half of theadvertising expenses from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was not caused by the report of the interview in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  I must emphasis once again that it is not role of the court to decide which political view should be preferred for the future developmentof the political system in Hong Kong.  Looking at the background of the Plaintiff, I may respect him as a charitable person, butwith much regret, I must say that the facts of this case strongly support the inference that the Plaintiff had ulterior motive inpursing the present litigation.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  Firstly, the Plaintiff claims that he relied on the contents of the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article in placing the Plaintiffâs Advertisements.  He simply wanted to participate in the discussion of the GovernmentReform Package, believing that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was so generous in offering to pay half of the advertising fees for such advertisements.  However, as I have mentionedin paragraph 57 above, no reasonable reader viewing the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article should have come to such conclusion.  In fact, the contents of the article clearly indicated that, in order forany advertisement to qualify for the offer, it should be one similar to that placed by the anonymous old man which contained themessage calling for the introduction of immediate universal suffrage in Hong Kong.  Further, if the offer were to cover advertisementsto be placed in newspapers other than Apple Daily, as it was the belief of the Plaintiff after viewing the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article, the offer then became very âunrealâ as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs liability might just be unlimited and he would actually be subsidizing his competitors for the revenue arising fromsuch advertisements.  In such circumstances, I have great reservation in accepting the Plaintiffâs evidence that he was so naÃ¯veby that time and he was simply âactivatedâ or encouraged by the contents in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article in placing the Plaintiffâs Advertisements.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  As I see it, making a legal offer through a newspaper advertisement was unusual.  What was more unique was that, unlike other commercialadvertisements, the offer related to an advertisement in support of a political propaganda campaign.  Nevertheless, despite the benefitof having legal advice at that time, the Plaintiff âreliedâ on a very general account of a conversation reported in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article, and proceeded to incur substantial expenses in placing advertisements in the front page of every major newspaperin Hong Kong.  This did not make a lot of sense.  In my judgment, even a layman would have taken the trouble of finding more informationabout the so-called offer from the true source, and yet the Plaintiff decided not to do so despite the benefit of having legal adviceby that time.  To me, the Plaintiff had deliberately made use of the vagueness of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer as an excuse for bringing the present legal action against the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  In a way, the Plaintiffâs attitude towards the whole affair was somewhat inconsistent.  On the one hand, he simply trusted thevery brief statement about the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer reported in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article.  Without taking any step to protect himself by checking out the true terms of the offer, the Plaintiff proceededto incur substantial advertising expenses for the publication of the Plaintiffâs Advertisements.  On the other hand, the Plaintiffwas very minded to protect his own interest by including a footnote in the Plaintiffâs Advertisements, declaring that he had beenâactivatedâ and encouraged by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer in joining the discussion of the Government Reform Package.  In my judgment, it is very difficult to explainwhy the Plaintiff had adopted these selective and yet inconsistent approaches in the handling of the matter.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  The conduct of the Plaintiff on the day of the publication of the Plaintiffâs Advertisements also casts doubt on the genuinenessof the Plaintiffâs motive.  When the Plaintiffâs Advertisements were published on 16 November 2005, the Plaintiff went to theLegislative Council and the police to lodge a complaint against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant for allegedly making up the stories of the anonymous old men with the purpose of luring public support for the fight ofimmediate universal suffrage in Hong Kong.  The Plaintiffâs solicitors, also on the same day, sent a demand letter to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, giving the latter only 3 days to make the payment for the contribution of the advertising expenses failing which legalproceedings would be commenced against him.  The Plaintiff meant his words and legal proceedings were commenced against the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants a few days later on 21 November 2005, with no pre-action letter sent to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant.  In my judgment, these whole series of events and the aggressive manner in which he handled the whole affair are quiteinconsistent with the Plaintiffâs evidence that he was simply motivated by the contents in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article in placing the Plaintiffâs Advertisements.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  In his testimony, the Plaintiff explains that he lodged the complaint against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant so as to provide the latter an opportunity to substantiate his stories about the anonymous old men.  If the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant could put forward such evidence, the Plaintiffâs complaint would actually do the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant âa favourâ.  In the own words of the Plaintiff, he lodged the complaint with a view to âprotectâ the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  In my judgment, such explanation is wholly unbelievable.  As admitted by the Plaintiff in his own evidence and in the letter tothe 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant dated 1 August 2006, he disapproved the way in which certain members of the Democrat Camp had adopted in the fight forimmediate universal suffrage.  He believed that these persons had made up false stories to lure support for their political campaign. It is clear that the Plaintiff did not trust the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants and the publications of the Next Media Limited, and yet he claims that he âreliedâ on the very brief account of the2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs offer as stated in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article.  Such inconsistent attitudes did not make a lot of sense.  Even worse, the Plaintiff has tried to disguise hishostility by saying that the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants are still very much his respected persons and it is his intention to protect them.  Obviously, the Plaintiff has not beenhonest about his motive in lodging the complaint against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  Lastly, after the Plaintiff knew that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant would not give oral evidence at the trial of this action, the Plaintiff, quite unusually, wrote to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant expressing his dissatisfaction about such decision.  However, if the Plaintiff only wanted to succeed in his claim, heshould not have been frustrated if the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant did not testify at the trial.  As admitted by the Plaintiff in the said letter dated 1 August 2006, he commenced the presentaction against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant with a view of putting pressure on the latter to deal with the issue of the âanonymous old menâ in public.  As the3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant decided not to testify at the trial, the Plaintiff had lost the opportunity to cross-examine the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant in the witness box.  Although the Plaintiff had not tried to conceal such motive, this has nothing to do with the Plaintiffâsclaim for the contribution of the advertising expenses from any of the Defendants.  In my judgment, political differences shouldbe resolved outside court, and it was not proper for the Plaintiff to make use of these proceedings to put political pressure onthe 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant to substantiate the stories of the âanonymous old menâ in public.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Based on the aforesaid observations, I have no choice but to conclude that the Plaintiff had some other ulterior motives in commencingthe present action against the Defendants.  The Plaintiff may be under the erroneous or misguided belief that he is only fightingthis case on matter of principle, but the evidence clearly shows he has tried to make use of the vagueness of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs appeal as an excuse to commence the present proceedings against the Defendants, with the additional purpose of puttingpolitical pressure on the Defendants, in particular the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, to put forward evidence to substantiate their political propaganda campaign.  Such findings cast serious doubt on theevidence of the Plaintiff that he had just relied on the contents in the 10<sup>th</sup> November Article in placing the Plaintiffâs Advertisements.  As the element of actual reliance is missing, the Plaintiffâs negligentmisstatement claim cannot succeed.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  In the premises, I dismiss all the Plaintiffâs claims.  By reason of the findings I have made about the motive of the Plaintiffin commencing the present action, I make an order <i>nisi</i> that the Plaintiff do pay to the 2<sup>nd</sup> to the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants the costs of this action on an indemnity basis to be taxed if not agreed.  The order <i>nisi</i> shall be made absolute 14 days after the date of the handing down of this judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to all the counsel for the assistance that they have rendered to this court.</p>    <p>  </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(David Lok)<br />            District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr. Jason Pow SC and Mr. Jose-Antonio Maurellet, instructed by Messrs.
