Provided that there is no antecedent breach of any of the terms and conditions therein contained,the plaintiff shall refund the deposit to the defendant without interest within 30 days from the date of delivery of vacant possessionof the premises to the plaintiff or settlement of any payment owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, whichever is later.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Clause 7 goes on to provide, inter alia, that the rent and/or any charges payable by the defendant thereunder or any part thereofshall be unpaid for seven days after the same shall become payable (whether legally demanded or not) or the defendant shall commita breach of any of the terms and conditions therein contained, it shall be lawful for the plaintiff at any time thereafter to re-enterthe premises upon the tenancy agreement, whereupon the tenancy agreement shall absolutely determine, and the plaintiff may deductany loss or damage suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the defendantâs breach upon the deposit, without prejudice to any otherright of action or any remedy of the plaintiff in respect of such breach by the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The defendant paid the deposit and the monthly rent of HK$13,500 for the period from 16 June to 15 July 2006 (hereinafter calledâadvance rentâ) to the plaintiff.

The defendantclaims it was entitled to rescind the tenancy agreement, which it did, due to (a) misrepresentation by Midland, which at all materialtimes acted and/or was held out as the plaintiffâs agent; and/or (b) the plaintiffâs breach of express or implied terms of thetenancy agreement.  The defendant further claims that on or about 8 June 2006 its staff notified Midland and/or the plaintiff thatit decided to cancel the tenancy agreement.  The defendant also claims that the plaintiff has failed to mitigate his loss. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The defendant counterclaims for the refund of the advance rent and deposit in the total sum of HK$40,500 and for damages sufferedas a result of the plaintiffâs misrepresentation or breach of contract in the sum of HK$58,136 comprising extra agency commissionfor renting alternative premises (being HK$7,064), the difference between the rental of the premises and that of the alternativepremises over two years (being (HK$14,128 - HK$13,500) x 24 months) and extra electricity charges not included in the rental of thealternative premises (being HK$1,500 x 24 months).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On 18 September 2006, Eastern Realty Company confirmed by two faxes to the plaintiff that the clients, Worldwide Sourcing Limited,Woodsland Timber Co and Mr Chan, visited the premises on (a) 1 September 2006, (b) 4 September 2006, and (c) 15 and 18 September2006 respectively.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The plaintiff as landlord and NMG Digital Limited (hereinafter called âNMGâ) as tenant entered into a tenancy agreement dated1 October 2006 (hereinafter called âreplacement tenancy agreementâ) whereby the plaintiff agreed to let and NMG agreed to rentthe premises for a period of two years from 1 November 2006 to 31 October 2008 at a monthly rent of HK$14,500, together with a rent-freeperiod from 1 to 31 October 2006.

On the return day of the defendantâs first summons, i.e. the first day of trial, without objection from the plaintiff,the defendant applied to withdraw such summons and agreed to pay the costs of such summons to the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  On 20 April 2006, the defendant issued a summons under section 5 of the Small Claims Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap. 338</a>, and under this courtâsinherent jurisdiction for striking out the plaintiffâs claim for want of jurisdiction (hereinafter called âthe defendantâssecond summonsâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  On the same day, the plaintiff issued  a summons to apply to amend the voluntary FBP by removing the deduction of the deposit fromthe plaintiffâs claim for loss and damages, resulting in an increase of the quantified loss and damages to HK$54,815 (hereinaftercalled âthe plaintiffâs summonsâ).</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The defendantâs first summons</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  There is no dispute between the parties as to the disposal of the defendantâs first summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  I have granted leave to the defendant to withdraw such summons and further ordered the defendant to pay costs of such summons tothe plaintiff assessed at HK$800 by way of gross sum assessment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In my view, the defendant ought not to have issued the defendantâs first summons in the first place.  Quite simply, the DistrictCourt does not have any power to transfer any case before it to the Small Claims Tribunal.  There is no statutory provision grantingsuch power to the District Court and as an inferior court the District Court does not have inherent jurisdiction to do so.  I drawsupport from the decision by His Honour Judge Carlson in <i>Sit Ka Yee v Lai Wai Ho</i>, DCPI271/2000, unreported, 22 October 2001, a case which I have referred to both parties.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mr Suen, counsel for the plaintiff, accepts that the costs involved are not substantial.  They relate to the perusal of the defendantâsfirst summons, consideration of the courtâs written directions of 19 April 2007, and the brief appearance before me on the firstday of trial to withdraw such summons.  The defendantâs solicitors have already intimated an intention to withdraw such summonson 19 April 2007.  Mr Suen submits that an appropriate award of costs is HK$1,000.  Mr Chu, counsel for the defendant, says thatthe appropriate quantum is HK$500.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Looking at the matter globally but without conducting mini taxation, I have assessed the relevant costs to be HK$800. </p>    <p class="heading"><u>The plaintiffâs summons</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  It is easier to deal with the plaintiffâs summons first, although it is necessary in any event for me to deal with the defendantâssecond summons.  If I do grant leave to the plaintiff to amend the voluntary FBP as applied for, the plaintiffâs claim as prayedfor will exceed the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal, but Mr Chu says I still have to consider the defendantâs secondsummons because the defendant contends that, even under that scenario, this court does not have jurisdiction.  On the other hand,if I refuse leave for the plaintiff to amend the voluntary FBP, then I will necessarily have to go on and consider the defendantâssecond summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Mr Chu informs me that the defendantâs sole objection to the proposed amendments is that the plaintiff must, as a matter of lawor interpretation of the tenancy agreement, take into account the deposit in quantifying his loss and damages.  He fairly agreesthat the defendant will not be relying on any complaint of lateness of the plaintiffâs application or any prejudice that may besuffered by the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In such circumstances, the question here is whether there are arguable merits to the proposed amendments so that the new avermentshould be left for trial or whether the proposed amendments are so immaterial or useless or unarguable that they should not be allowed. The court will always look at the materiality of the proposed amendments to pleadings and will not allow amendments that are unarguablebad.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Mr Suen submits that it is clear from clause 7 of the tenancy agreement that, even if there is no antecedent breach of any of theterms and conditions of the tenancy agreement, which is denied, the plaintiff need only refund the deposit to the defendant withoutinterest within 30 days from the date of delivery of vacant possession of the premises to the plaintiff or settlement of any outstandingpayment owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, whichever is later.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Mr Suen argues that the defendant shall be in no better position if there an antecedent breach of the tenancy agreement since itis trite that a person cannot benefit from his own wrong, âHence, the same time limit shall apply, i.e. the plaintiff need onlyrefund the [deposit] to the [defendant] without interest within 30 days from the date of delivery of vacant possession of the [premises]to the plaintiff or settlement of any outstanding payment owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, whichever is later.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  It is said that, since the defendant has failed to pay the arrears of rent and damages suffered by the plaintiff, the plaintiffis not required as yet to refund the deposit and need not take into account the same in quantifying its loss in the present claim. It is only if the plaintiff succeeds in its claim that the deposit is required to be refunded without interest to the defendantwithin 30 days after it has settled all outstanding payment owed to the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Mr Suen points out that, although clause 7 of the tenancy agreement provides that where there is an antecedent breach of the tenancyagreement, the plaintiff <i>may</i> (but not must) deduct any loss or damage suffered by him as a result of the defendantâs breach from the deposit.  Further, clause7 specifically preserves the plaintiffâs right but not duty to make deduction <i>without prejudice</i> to any other right of action or any remedy of the plaintiff, so the plaintiffâs independent and separate cause of action in recoveringloss and damages (which cause of action is adopted in the present proceedings) as distinct from his right to make deduction fromthe deposit (which right the plaintiff says he will not exercise) is preserved in full.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Mr Suen says that, since an award of damages may attract interest, if the plaintiff exercises the right to deduct damages from thedeposit which is refundable without interest within 30 days of settlement of the outstanding amount by the defendant, the plaintiffwill lose out on his entitlement to interest on or after the date of deduction in respect of the damages claimed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Further, Mr Suen argues that there is no time limit in respect of the plaintiffâs right to make such deduction whilst his claimfor damages will be time barred after six years.  Given the differences between the right to deduction and the right to claim fordamages, Mr Suen submits that the plaintiffâs right to deduct any loss or damages suffered by him as a result of the defendantâsbreach of the tenancy agreement is an âadditionalâ right, but he is not obliged to (and will not) exercise such right.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Mr Chu submits that, since it is not in dispute that the plaintiff has received the deposit, Mr Suenâs above submissions on theinterpretation of clause 7 of the tenancy agreement, which denies any need on the part of the plaintiff to give credit for the depositin its claim for damages, is an ouster of the jurisdiction of the District Court to grant any relief(s) it may consider appropriatein the present proceeding which is not permitted.  When I ask Mr Chu for legal authority in support of such a proposition, he submitsthat it is trite law that litigants cannot dictate what reliefs the court may grant. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Whilst I accept that the District Court is the adjudicating tribunal in respect of the cases brought before it, I do not understandMr Chuâs proposition as trite.  A claimantâs pleading sets out his cause(s) of action, the material facts in support of suchcause(s) of action and the reliefs he seeks.  To limit the reliefs claimed in oneâs pleading is not an ouster of the jurisdictionof the court to grant reliefs.  Indeed, as I see it, the issue here is the courtâs power to determine the award of damages at trialand not a question the courtâs jurisdiction to grant reliefs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  If the proposed amendment is allowed and if the plaintiff succeeds on liability at trial, the court will proceed to assess the quantumof damages.  In deciding on the quantum of damages to be awarded in favour of the plaintiff, the court will have to determine whethernotwithstanding the amendment the plaintiff should give credit for the deposit or not.  If the court concludes that such credit shouldbe given, it will reduce the amount of damages by the sum of the deposit and the plaintiff will have failed in its pleaded avermentthat such deduction ought not to be made.  In short, there is no ouster of jurisdiction and no merit in Mr Chuâs submission inthis respect.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The true question in respect of the plaintiffâs summons is whether it is clear that the proposed amendments are bad and thereforeshould not be allowed.  It is essential to return to basic contractual and landlord and tenant principles.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  An aggrieved landlordâs entitlement to damages for wrongful repudiation follows general contractual principles (see <i>Hop Woo Cheung Limited v Intergroup Industries Limited</i> [1982] HKC436), and <i>Sano Screen Manufacturers v J &amp; R Bossini</i> [2000] 3HKC216).  The normal measure of damages is the difference between the total amount the landlord would have received had thelease been duly performed, i.e. the amount payable were the lease to be permitted to run its full course, less the actual amountwhich the landlord received from the tenant.  Account must also be taken of the landlordâs duty to mitigate loss if such is putin issue by the tenant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Mr Suen in his submissions does not disagree with the above statement of the normal measure of damages (see also the succinct summaryin paragraph 49 of the judgment of Reyes J in <i>Goldon Investment Limited v NPH International Holdings Limited</i> <i>formerly known as Nam Pei Hong International Holdings Limited</i>, HCA5457/1999, unreported, 10 August 2004). </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  It is not hard to understand why the normal measure of damages for repudiation of a lease requires that credit be given for theamount received by the landlord.  Once repudiation is accepted, those parties are discharged from performance of the lease, but theparty accepting the repudiation must sue for the accrued loss (for example, arrears of rent) and damages occasioned by the repudiation(for example, loss of rental income over the unexpired term of the lease), subject to a duty to minimise loss.  Since this coversthe actual loss that may be suffered by the landlord, if the party accepting the repudiation fails to give credit for any amountreceived from the repudiator, there is a risk of duplicated recovery.  This situation is quite different from forfeiture of a leasewhere no damages can be claimed by the landlord in respect of that unexpired portion of the lease (see <i>Chan, Annie v Lau Wai Kwong and Others</i> [1984]  HKC231).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Mr Suen has cited the case of <i>Orient Bright International Limited v Hiang Kie Hong Kong Limited</i>, CACV220/2004, unreported, 11 May 2005.  At the hearing before me, there was some doubt as to the cause of action relied on by theplaintiff landlord in that case.  A perusal of the judgment of the lower court by Suffiad J, HCA10411/2000, 10 June 2004, revealsthat pursuant to a supplemental agreement varying the monthly rent payable under the lease, the monthly rent payable for a definedperiod of the tenancy term was reduced.  After the rental reduction period, the monthly rent was increased but the defendant failedto pay rent since 1 November 2000 and the balance of the rental deposit due to the increase in rent.  The plaintiff issued a writfor two monthsâ arrears of rent and the balance of the rental deposit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The statement of claim was subsequently amended to include a claim for possession of the premises on the basis that, by issuingthe writ, the plaintiff accepted repudiation of the defendant by its breach of the lease.  About 10 months later on 16 October 2001,the defendant vacated and delivered up vacant possession of the premises.  The plaintiff re-amended the amended statement of claimto limit his claim to forfeiture of the rental and management fee deposits and quantified his damages as being the outstanding rentand mesne profits for the period from 1 November 2000 to 16 October 2001.  But for the repudiation by the defendant, the term ofthe lease was due to expire much later on 31 October 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  It is, therefore, plain that, although the plaintiffâs claim was for repudiation of damages, it did not claim for loss of rentalincome for the unexpired term, but limited its claim to arrears of rent and mesne profits up to the delivery of vacant possessionof the premises.  The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff was entitled to forfeit the deposit pursuant to the forfeiture clausein the lease.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  I pause here to say that in the present case we are not concerned with forfeiture of the deposit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  To return to the case under discussion, the express provision of the lease did not require the plaintiff to give credit for thedeposit in respect of the damages otherwise recoverable, but more importantly the Court of Appealâs decision was affected by thefact that â[in] any event, regardless of the position with common law damages, the plaintiffâs claim here is essentially formesne profits, which is measured by the value of the accommodation to the trespasser, rather than the actual loss of the landlord. There is no question of giving credit for the forfeited deposit.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Here, the position is entirely different for the plaintiffâs claim is for actual loss of the whole of the unexpired term as aresult of the defendantâs repudiation.  There is no justification for not bringing the deposit into account.  Mr Suen accepts thatthere is no further loss that the plaintiff can claim beyond what has been pleaded in the voluntary FBP.  It is difficult to understandwhy, as a matter of law, in the assessment of damages the court should not take into account the deposit but must leave the plaintiff,if he succeeds in the claim, to receive payment of the assessment of the damages assessed and then refund the deposit 30 days laterto the defendant, and if the plaintiff fails to do so the defendant would be obliged to pursue another claim for recovery of thedeposit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Mr Suen next argues that his contentions rest on the true meaning of clause 7 of the tenancy agreement.  He fairly acknowledgesthat, on the face of clause 7, insofar as it is relevant to the present situation, it only deals with (a)      refund of the depositwhere there is no antecedent breach; and (b) the plaintiffâs right to deduct loss and damages from the deposit when the defendantfails to pay rent or when the defendant is in breach of the tenancy agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  He accepts that clause 7 does not expressly empower the plaintiff to retain the deposit in case of acceptance of repudiation bythe defendant.  Scenario (a) is inapplicable here.  In respect of scenario (b), Mr Suen says that clause 7 preserves âany otherright or action or any remedy of the Landlord in respect of such breach by the Tenant.â  But, if the plaintiff chooses not to exercisethe right to make a deduction from the deposit under clause 7, which Mr Suen says is an additional right, what other right of actionor remedy does the plaintiff have or, to put it in another way, what other right of action or remedy is preserved by clause 7?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Essentially, it is the plaintiffâs claim for common law damages as a result of the defendantâs repudiation, i.e. accrued lossand actual loss of rental income for the unexpired term, and Mr Suen accepts that, under the normal measure of damages, paymentsreceived by the plaintiff should be taken into account.  I also refer to my analysis above to say that there is a real differencebetween a claim for mense profits and a claim for actual loss.  The suggestion that the defendant cannot benefit from its own wrongdoes not come into play. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Mr Suen asked me to bear in mind the nature of a security deposit which is to ensure due performance of the terms of the lease. He argues that such purpose cannot be served if the deposit is to be refunded immediately. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  In the present case the issue is not whether and when the deposit is to be refunded.  The relevant question is the extent of damagesto which the plaintiff is entitled to claim and whether the plaintiff can withhold taking the deposit taking the deposit into accountin assessing damages.  Whilst I accept that appropriately wording contractual provision may possibly allow for the situation contendedby Mr Suen, clause 7 falls far short of what is required for such purpose.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  As regards Mr Suenâs submission that the plaintiff will be prejudiced by losing out on the accrual of interest on damages to whichhe is entitled if credit is given for the deposit, I reject such argument.  The general rule is that damages for breach of contractshould be assessed as at the date when the cause of action arose, i.e. at the date of the breach or the date of the acceptance ofrepudiation, subject to mitigation of loss.  Since the assessment of the plaintiffâs damages under the normal measure of damages,subject to mitigation of loss, requires the deposit to be taken into account, the argument that the plaintiff loses out on interestthat may subsequently accrue on the damages that should be set off and/or deducted from monies received by the plaintiff, falls away.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  In these circumstances, I am not with Mr Suen on his interpretation of clause 7 or of the tenancy agreement which asks the courtto read more into the provision than is permitted on its terms.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  I, therefore, dismiss the plaintiffâs summons.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The defendantâs second summons</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  I now turn to the defendantâs second summons.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap. 338</a>, provides, inter alia, that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="648" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote" width="12">â</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote" width="33">(1)</td>                <td valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote" width="603">The tribunal shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the claims specified in the Schedule.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="12" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>                <td width="33" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">(2)</td>                <td width="603" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">Save as provided in this Ordinance, no claim within the jurisdiction of the tribunal shall be actionable in any other court in HongKong.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="12" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>                <td width="33" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">(3)</td>                <td width="603" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">A claim within the jurisdiction of the tribunal may be brought in another court if there is included in such claim a claim for someother relief, redress, remedy, other than a claim for costs......â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The Schedule of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap. 338</a>, provides, inter alia, that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal includes any monetary claim founded in contract, quasi contractor tort where the amount claimed is not more than HK$50,000, whether on balance of account or otherwise, the provisos not being applicable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  The starting point in considering the defendantâs second summons is that it is an application to strike out the plaintiffâsclaim for want of jurisdiction.  Mr Chu accepts that such a striking out application can only be made if the absence of jurisdictionis plain and obvious.  He also agrees that the defendant, in making the application, carries the burden of establishing it is plainand obvious that this court has no jurisdiction over the plaintiffâs claim, but submits that the defendant has discharged suchburden.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  The hearing before me is, in fact, the first day of the trial.  Mr Suen complains that the defendantâs application to contestjurisdiction is plainly late.  He refers to <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2007</i>, Volume 1, paragraph 18/8/16 at page 310, to say that the defence of want of jurisdiction should be specifically pleaded and thatthe defendant in practice should not wait to plead this defence but should, after giving notice of intention to defend and withinthe time limit for serving the defence, apply to stay or dismiss the action.  Mr Chu argues that, since the plaintiff only quantifiedhis claim by the 3/4/07 letter and filed the voluntary FBP on 16 April 2007, it does not lies in the plaintiffâs mouth to complainof lateness.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  In my view, irrespective of whether the application is late or not, the court should deal with such a fundamental challenge raisedin the defendantâs second summons.  As stated in <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2007</i>, supra, the court, if it considers appropriate, may allow an objection to jurisdiction to be raised even at  trial.  More importantly,the learned text further says that where the court lacks jurisdiction by statute, as what is contended here, it is its duty to disclaimjurisdiction irrespective of whether or not the defendant pleads the defence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  I agree with such statement which is an important one, as will be seen below.  Whether the court has jurisdiction is a fundamentalmatter.  The court cannot be seized of any matter before it unless it has jurisdiction.  This is so whether any of the parties raisesthe issue of jurisdiction with the court or not.  Jurisdiction cannot be conferred by agreement of the parties or by their inactivityor silence where there is actually no jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  At first blush, it seems that Mr Chuâs written submissions that the plaintiffâs complaint on jurisdiction stems from a considerationof the plaintiffâs statement of claim endorsed on the writ of summons.  However, on finer reading of his written submissions andas I have tried to elicit from Mr Chu at the hearing, it appears that the defendant holds the view that the plaintiffâs quantificationof his claim and/or the voluntary FBP, both of April 2007, do have a bearing on the jurisdiction issue.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  In respect of the plaintiffâs pleaded claim at the commencement of the action, paragraph 4 and 5 of the statement of claim arerelevant and are summarised as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="91%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the plaintiff has accepted the defendantâs repudiation on or about 20 July 2006;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="91%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the plaintiff has recovered vacant possession of the premises on or about 15 August 2006;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="91%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the plaintiff claims for arrears of rent for the period from 16 July to 15 August 2006 in the sum of HK$13,500;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(d)</td>                <td width="91%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the plaintiff claims for damages, being loss of benefit of the tenancy agreement and loss of rental income he would otherwise havereceivedthereunder, âthe exact details of which the plaintiff can only provide upon quantification and discoveryâ.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Mr Chuâs stance has evolved in the course of his submissions before me.  At first he submits that, in considering whether thecourt has jurisdiction over the plaintiffâs claim, the court should consider the plaintiffâs claim at the commencement of theaction and is not obliged to determine whether it has jurisdiction from time to time as the case progresses.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Mr Chu then argues that if the plaintiffâs monetary claim is not quantified at the commencement of the claim but it is quantifiedsubsequently in the course of the proceedings, such quantification can ârelate backâ to the commencement of the claim, so thecourt is required to consider and determine whether it has jurisdiction over the plaintiffâs claim.  If the subsequent quantificationthat ârelates backâ to the original claim is under HK$50,000, then the District Court has no jurisdiction over the plaintiffâsclaim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  In his submissions in reply, Mr Chu submits that the plaintiffâs unquantified claim at the commencement of the action becomesirrelevant when it is replaced by a subsequent quantification of his claim made in the course of the proceedings and that the courts,in determining jurisdiction, should not fettered by the plaintiffâs claim at the commencement of the action.  This is because,he says, the court is concerned or should be astute to consider at any and all times whether it has jurisdiction over any claim broughtbefore it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Mr Chu also submits that, in the present case, even at the commencement of the action, there is a âhigh probabilityâ that thenormal measure of repudiation damages as claimed by the plaintiff is less than HK$50,000, but in any event once the plaintiff hasquantified his claim, the normal measure of repudiation damages becomes irrelevant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Mr Chu goes on to say that the defendant can pray in aid the provisions in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336">Cap. 336</a>, to support the contention that the District Court is, by analogy, empowered to strike out a claim which is within theexclusive jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal, provided that it can be shown that the plaintiff knew or ought to have knownthat the District Court has no jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Mr Chu has not explained how all these propositions sit together, but I will consider them all.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  I agree that the appropriate time to consider whether the Plaintiffâs claim is within the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunalis at the commencement of the action (see <i>Chow Wai Fun Amy v McKeon, Brendan Hugh</i>, DCCJ5684/2000, unreported, 28 February 2001).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  There is no dispute that the plaintiffâs claim is a monetary claim founded on contract.  As explained above, it is now trite thatwhere the breach is repudiatory the landlord can invoke common law remedies, such as damages for repudiation including loss sufferedfor the unexpired term (see <i>Well Century Holdings Limited v Leung Kung Yue</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%202%20HKLRD%20653" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 2 HKLRD 653).</a>  In essence, this is what the plaintiff claims as his loss in damages in his statement of claim at the commencement of the action,i.e. special loss being particularised arrears of rent and general damages which have not been particularised.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  There is no obligation on the plaintiff to particularise his claim for general damages so long as he has pleaded his cause of actionand the material facts in support of a claim for general damages.  It is where a claimant claims that he has suffered damages ofa kind which is not the necessary and needed consequence of the wrongful act that he has the duty to plead full particulars to showthe nature and extent of damages (see <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2007</i>, supra, at paragraph 18/12/10, at page 315). But here the general damages claimed by the plaintiff in the statement of claim aremerely the normal measure for repudiatory damages.  This the plaintiff has done and has made abundantly clear by an express pleathat the damages claimed are the loss of benefit of the tenancy agreement and loss of rental income he would otherwise have receivedthereunder.  The plaintiff has also pleaded the monthly rent of HK$13,500 and the term of two years to show the rental income hewould have received under the tenancy agreement.  In the circumstances, the measure of general damages claimed by the plaintiff atthe commencement of the present proceedings well exceeds the limit of HK$50,000, even if credit is given for the deposit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Mr Chu places strong emphasis on the phrase âamount claimedâ in the Schedule of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap. 338</a>.  He argues that the plaintiff <i>must</i> have an âamount claimedâ when he commenced the present proceedings and that failure to particularise the general damages claimeddoes not alter the fact that such general damages must still represent an âamount claimedâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  I am not persuaded that this is how the matter should be approached.  When one reads <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5(2)</a> and the Schedule of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap. 338</a>, together, they essentially provide, inter alia, that any monetary claim in contract or quasi contract, where the amountclaimed is not more than $50,000, shall not be actionable in any other court in Hong Kong.  So if it cannot be plainly establishedthat the âamount claimedâ under a monetary claim in contract or quasi contract is not more than $50,000, such claim does notfall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  In my view, and explained above, the plaintiffâs claim at the commencement of the action exceeds HK$50,000.  At the very least,the defendant has failed to show that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffâs claim was outside the jurisdiction of the DistrictCourt at the commencement of the action.  I will deal with the issue of mitigation of loss below.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Further, the plaintiff is entitled not to particularise the general damages he claims in his statement of claim.  It is incumbentupon the defendant to show at the commencement of action the âamount claimedâ under the plaintiffâs claim is not more thanHK$50,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Mr Chu says that this is a âhigh probabilityâ.  He points out that the plaintiff has failed to give credit for the deposit inthe statement of claim dated 16 August 2006 but, as I have explained above, even taking into account the deposit, the plaintiffâsclaim at the commencement of the action as pleaded is above HK$50,000.  Mr Chu goes on to say that â[on] that day the deposit madeby the defendant had not been used up (or most likely so) after the deduction of $13,500 for July to August 2006.  Had trial takenplace on that day, the Plaintiff may not be able to recover any damages or he might even be liable to pay back the Defendant 1 monthof deposits.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  Mr Chu also says that the plaintiff should not be allowed to wait and hope his damages might accumulate to exceed the jurisdictionof the Small Claims Tribunal one day, since it is trite that the plaintiff has to mitigate his damages in any event.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  This is a plain misreading of the plaintiffâs claim.  The plaintiffâs claim is not limited to accrued loss, i.e. arrears ofrent, when he issued the claim.  He has a claim for general damages which I have explained above and shall not repeat here again. There is no need for the plaintiff to wait for his claim to accumulate.  His claim subsisted at the time of the issuance of thewrit of summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  The fallacy of Mr Chuâs argument is that he requires the plaintiff to quantify or particularise the amount that is being claimedright at the commencement of the claim.  The short answer is that the plaintiff is not required to do so.  But, even if Mr Chu isright in saying that there is a âhigh probabilityâ that the plaintiffâs claim was less than HK$50,000 at the commencement ofthe action, it is not good enough for striking out for want of jurisdiction, for the lack of jurisdiction must be plain and obvious. The defendant has to show that the âamount claimedâ is not more than HK$50,000.  As explained above, the measure of generaldamages open under the plaintiffâs claim on his pleadings far exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the Small Claims Tribunal. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  On such analysis the defendant has no hope of establishing that at the commencement of action the plaintiffâs claim must be exclusivelywithin the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  This leads obviously to Mr Chuâs submission that I should not be bogged down by consideration of the situation at the commencementof the action.  He argues that proper account must be  taken of the plaintiffâs duty to mitigate his loss and of the plaintiffâssubsequent quantification of his claim in determining whether the court has jurisdiction and that, if the plaintiff fails to quantifyhis loss and damages in the statement of claim, he must bear the consequences.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  In fact, it was only in the course of the present proceedings, i.e. after the commencement of the action, and even after the findingof the defence and counterclaim, that the plaintiff re-let the premises on 1 October 2006 to NMG. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Mr Chu fairly accepts that, on a striking out application, it is not an appropriate stage for the court to consider whether therehas been proper mitigation of loss or whether reasonable mitigation could have taken place at an earlier time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Mr Chu argues that, even though the plaintiffâs claim for general damages is unquantified at the time of the issuance of the writof summons, once the plaintiff realises that his claim is reduced below HK$50,000 as a result of mitigation of loss, the plaintiffshould quantify his loss, which he eventually did, by way of the voluntary FBP.   Such quantification then ârelates backâ tothe original claim to become the plaintiffâs claim as acknowledged by him or, alternatively, the original claim becomes irrelevantas having been replaced by the quantified claim, again as acknowledged by the plaintiff.  By reason thereof, it is argued, the courthas no jurisdiction over the plaintiffâs claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  The nature and purpose of voluntary further and better particulars have been succinctly set out in <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2007</i>, supra, at paragraph 18/12/65, at page 325.  Since the defendant has not objected to the voluntary FBP, it stands as part of thepleadings.  Order 18 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 9</a> of the Rules of the District Court allows any matter arising at any time, including events which happened since the writ of summons,to be pleaded.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  The pleas in the voluntary FBP relating to the plaintiffâs mitigation of loss and to the quantification of the plaintiffâs claimfor general damages following such mitigation plainly relate to events which have happened after the commencement of the presentproceedings.  In my view they are nothing more than what His Honour Judge Lok described in <i>Chow Wai Fun Amy</i>âs case, supra, as âevents which occurred after the commencement of the action [that] would not deprive this court of the jurisdictionto deal with the matterâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Given Mr Chuâs strong reliance on the plaintiffâs mitigation of loss in October 2006 and the plaintiffâs quantification inApril 2007 that followed from such mitigation, it is necessary to look more closely at such grounds which he has put forward in supportof his contentions.  His main argument turns on what he describes as the proper reading of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5(2)</a> and the Schedule of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap. 338</a>.  He submits that, since there is no express reference to the commencement of legal proceedings in the statutory provisions,there is no justification for determining jurisdiction on the basis of the âamount claimedâ at that time.  Rather the âamountclaimedâ refers to the plaintiffâs monetary claim in contract at any time so that, once the plaintiff quantifies his claim tobe below HK$50,000, the District Court ceases to have jurisdiction either at that time or as a result of ârelation backâ to theoriginal claim.  Mr Chu says such quantification is an acknowledgement of the âamount claimedâ which discharges the defendantâsburden in establishing lack of jurisdiction.  It is, however, difficult to fathom why the ârelation backâ argument is necessaryor even relevant at all if, as Mr Chu submits, the court is required to consider jurisdiction at any and all times. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  The interpretation suggested by Mr Suen is that jurisdiction should be determined at the commencement of the action.  This approachis supported by the learned views of His Honour Judge Lok.  On the other hand, Mr Chuâs suggestion of a floating obligation throughoutthe course of the legal proceedings whereby the court and the parties are required to vigilantly consider the issue of jurisdictionwhenever quantification is made or revised following the occurrence of subsequent events raises an onerous duty that is not expresslyprovided for in the legislative provisions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  I agree with Mr Suen that, concerning the crucial and fundamental issue of jurisdiction of the court, such onerous obligation, ifviable and applicable, would have attracted express provision.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  There is fallacy in Mr Chuâs contention that an ouster of the jurisdiction of the District Court may be caused by a subsequentevent, such as the reduced quantification of the claim as a result of successful mitigation of loss after the commencement of proceedings. Although a claimant landlord is expected to act reasonably and to take such steps as are necessary to re-let vacant premises ata market rent, it falls on the errant former tenant and not on the claimant landlord to establish that mitigation has not taken place(see <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure</i><i> </i><i>2007</i> supra, at paragraph 18/8/7A, at page 310).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  The âamount claimedâ by the claimant landlord should not turn on defence arguments that may or may not be raised or on the fortuityof whether successful mitigation can be achieved.  The âamount claimedâ at the commencement of the action prior to successfulmitigation is not what Mr Chu describes merely as âpossible amount which can be big or smallâ that only crystallises on quantification. The accrued loss and repudiatory damages so claimed is a genuine claim since there is no mitigation as yet.  It would be differentif there has been mitigation prior to the commencement of the action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  This can be simply illustrated.  If the claimant issues a claim for damages for breach of contract and assuming that he quantifieshis loss as exceeding the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal at the commencement of the action, there is an âamount claimedâwithin the District Court jurisdiction and the claimant cannot issue his claim in the Small Claims Tribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  Further assuming that the claimant has all along taken proper steps to mitigate but because of the exigencies of the circumstances,say, low interest in the market for a unique item made to the wrongdoerâs specification, he can only successfully mitigate losssome time after the commencement of the claim.  If the claimant chooses to amend his pleadings to reduce his claim to below HK$50,000to reflect such mitigation of loss properly achieved during the course of the proceedings, according to Mr Chuâs submissions theDistrict Court will have no jurisdiction and the claim is liable to be struck out.  The harshness of such a proposition is made evenmore stark if the limitation period has expired.  The plaintiff then faces the further jeopardy of a striking out application againif he attempts to reissue his claim in the Small Claims Tribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  I make a few observations.  First, if the reduced quantification relates back to the original claim, as Mr Chu at one stage submits,to oust the jurisdiction of the District Court, then all steps taken in the course of the proceedings in the District Court becomenull and void.  But this does not sit well with the fact that the original claim in the above illustration at the commencement ofthe claim cannot be issued out of the Small Claims Tribunal because of the âamount claimedâ exceeds its jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  Secondly, if the reduced quantification ousts the jurisdiction of the District Court as at the date of such quantification so thatthe original claim becomes irrelevant, what then is the effect of the prior steps taken by the parties or the court orders grantedin the course of the legal proceedings prior to the reduced quantification?  Do they still bind the parties or the Small Claims Tribunalif the claimant successfully reissues the claim there?  The provisions in relation to jurisdiction in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap. 338</a>, do not envisage such jurisdictional quagmire. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Thirdly, as Mr Suen points out, the defence contentions discourage mitigation and/or quantification of loss which cannot have beenthe intended sequelae of the legislation.  Mr Chuâs answer is that it is incumbent upon the claimant to think carefully about hischoice of venue right from the start.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  I do not agree with Mr Chuâs submission that it is a hard fact of life for the claimant that he has to bear the consequences ofany âmisjudgmentâ on the litigation venue as a result not of his own error, but because of developments by subsequent events. In the above illustration, the plaintiff is not at fault at all for he could not have issued his initial claim in the Small ClaimsTribunal and he could not have properly mitigated prior to commencement of the action.  Mitigation of loss is not entirely in thehands of a claimant for it usually depends on whether there is a willing party in the market.  The claimant cannot gaze into a crystalball and predict what the future will bring.  His obligation is merely to take reasonable steps and the threshold obligation is nothigh.  It will cause untold hardship if the claimant is bound by the consequences of his choice of litigation venue, the correctnessof which depends on some event that cannot be predicted when he makes the choice.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  Fourthly, Mr Chu is, therefore, constrained to argue that in such circumstances, i.e. where the full circumstances relating to themitigation of loss have not fully unfolded, the claimant should make his claim at an appropriate time.  This is reflected in hisarguments in relation to the present case, i.e. that it was improper for the plaintiff to have issued his claim on 16 August 2006â......[Had] the plaintiff waited until all the [deposit] had been used up, i.e. 15 September 2006, one would have note that hehad already some potential tenants visiting the [premises], at least on 1 September 2006, 4 September 2006 and 15 September 2006......just around 2 weeks before the Plaintiff actually enter into another tenancy agreement on 1 October 2006...... (keys delivered on30 September 2006)â.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  There is no merit in such argument, which only serves to reflect the desperation of the defendantâs case on the jurisdiction issue. A claimant is entitled to issue his claim at any time within the limitation period.  There is no obligation for him to wait untilhe has successfully mitigated loss or until he is able to form the view that mitigation is not possible in the ordinary course ofbusiness.  Mr Chu has not cited any authority for his proposition.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  In any event, in considering whether a claim ought to be struck out for want of jurisdiction, the relevant consideration is notwhether the plaintiff has issued the claim unreasonably which, according to the authorities, may affect the courtâs exercise ofdiscretion on costs, but rather the consideration is whether it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffâs claim is within the jurisdictionof the Small Claims Tribunal or not.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  Fifthly, the sensible approach, which I accept, is that in the above illustration it is still within the jurisdiction of the DistrictCourt to deal with a reduced claim, but the claimant may be visited with a reduced level of cost should the court consider it isappropriate to exercise its discretion accordingly.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  There can be other illustrations of unreasonable situations contemplated under the defence contentions.  Mr Suen asks what if thereis to be a split trial so that consideration of the issues relating to damages is to be deferred.  It would be strange indeed if,after judgment on liability is granted, it is discovered that court had and/or has no jurisdiction upon quantification of damagesin the course of preparation for the hearing of the assessment of damages under Order 37 of the Rules of the District Court. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  It is also difficult to appreciate why, in the case of a personal injuries claim in court, the court has no jurisdiction where theclaimantâs claim, as initially quantified in his statement of damages upon commencement of the action, is drastically reduced tobelow District Court level due to substantial physical or mental recovery that exceeds the expectation of reasonable medical opinion. In such situation, the claimant cannot be faulted for exceptional recovery or for not anticipating such recovery, yet accordingto Mr Chuâs submissions, he will be placed in an invidious position of not being able to issue his original claim in the SmallClaims Tribunal in the first place and to have his claim struck out when he files and serves the revised statement of damages toreflect his acknowledged reduced quantification.  He will be triply unfortunate if his claim is by that time time barred. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  The above serves to underline the fallacy of the defence contentions.  I am not persuaded by Mr Chuâs interpretation of the jurisdictionprovisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap. 338</a> that does not reflect the plain meaning of the provisions and that create unreasonable and unjustified hardship.  The claimneed only be a proper one, i.e. a monetary claim in contract where the amount claimed exceeds HK$50,000, at the time of the commencementof the action, and that is what is plainly claimed by the plaintiff here.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  Subsequent events do not affect jurisdiction but may affect the ultimate award and the question of costs.  It is not right to requirethe âamount claimedâ to be a liquidated and quantified sum for the law permits a claim for general damages to be assessed.  Ifthe claim for general damages as pleaded can exceed HK$50,000, then it is simply not a claim where the amount claimed is not morethan HK$50,000.  I have explained why subsequent events do not affect jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  Mr Chu has cited a number of cases and I propose to deal with them briefly below.  <i>Sit Ka Yee</i>âs case is a personal injuries claim.  In that case the statement of damages itself valued damages for pain, suffering and lossof amenities at HK$30,000 and special damages of HK$12,085, which were collectively lower than the jurisdictional limit of the SmallClaims Tribunal.  The learned judge held that the claim belonged to the Small Claims Tribunal, âIt can only be issued in that tribunalwhich has sole jurisdiction to hear it.  The action must therefore be struck out......â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  Mr Chu says that <i>Sit Ka Yee</i>âs case, supra, is similar to the present case in that the plaintiff has acknowledged the claim to be under HK$50,000.  I disagree. I have read the judgment carefully, including the learned judgeâs summary of arguments by the plaintiffâs solicitors.  It hasnot been suggested that the plaintiff in that case ever claimed for damages beyond HK$50,000.  Indeed, the statement of damages valuedthe claim to be under HK$50,000.  Plainly the Small Claims Tribunal is the appropriate venue if, all along, the monetary claim incontract or tort is under HK$50,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  In the present case, at the commencement of the claim, the general damages claimed were well in excess of such jurisdictional limit,and it was only after the issuance of the writ that the plaintiff mitigated loss by re-letting the premises, thereby reducing hisclaim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  Mr Chu also relies on <i>Chow Wai Fun, Amy</i>âs case, supra, which dealt with a tenancy situation.  In that case the plaintiff applied for summary judgment for unpaid rent andmense profits for the period from May to October 2000 which was limited to HK$40,000 after credit was given in respect of the rentaldeposit.  The learned judge accepted that at the commencement of the action, the case and claim properly fell within the jurisdictionof the District Court.  At that time the plaintiff had a claim for possession of the premises, but the defendant subsequently on30 October 1990 surrendered possession of the premises, so the claim for possession was no longer necessary.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  As Mr Chu points out, the date of 30 October 1990 is likely to be a typographical error.  I do not wish to speculate whether itrefers to 30 October 2000 although it is not unlikely since the claim for mesne profits was up to October 2000.  The learned judgeconsidered, but rejected, the defendantâs challenge to jurisdiction and granted summary judgment. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  Mr Chu seizes on the words of His Honour Judge Lok as follows, âIt is only because of the subsequent conduct of the Defendantin surrendering the premises that the claim for possession is no longer necessaryâ, to support his contentions.  He tries to distinguishthis case by saying that the learned judge referred to the fact of the defendantâs surrender of possession of the premises as the<i>only</i> event that brought the plaintiffâs out of the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal, but the learned judge did not say whetherthe monetary claim of HK$40,000 alone would fall within such exclusive jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  Mr Chu further says that, since the claim for mesne profits was up to October 2000, it is evident that the exact amount of mesneprofits claimed was unknown at the time of the commencement of the action.  âHH Judge Lok did not comment on whether this was proper. In particular, HH Judge Lok did not say whether the plaintiff knew or should have known that the Court had/did not have jurisdiction(see  below) if that situation was considered alone.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  I do not see any advantage in analysing in minute detail the factual matrix that is stated or not stated in the judgment of HisHonour Judge Lok.  The relevant consideration is not a comparison of the facts of that case with those of the present one. Instead,the useful task is to elicit the <i>ratio</i> of the case which offers guidance. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  I agree with Mr Chu that, at the time of the commencement of the action in <i>Chow Wai Fun, Amy</i>âs case, supra, the precise dollars and cents of the monetary claim were known.  At that stage the defendant had not yet deliveredvacant possession of the premises, so the amount of mesne profits calculable up to the delivery of possession could not have beenknow at that stage.  In those circumstances it cannot be said that at that time there was an âamount claimedâ that was underHK$50,000, in which case the District Court had jurisdiction.  But if Mr Chu is right in his contentions, once possession was recoveredand mesne profits payable up to the surrender of the possession was, to adopt Mr Chuâs words, acknowledged to be under HK$50,000at the latest at the hearing before His Honour Judge Lok, the learned judge should have found that such quantification or acknowledgementârelated backâ to the original claim and/or that such quantification or acknowledgement replaced the original claim with theresult that the District Court had no jurisdiction.  But, instead of disclaiming jurisdiction which the learned judge should havedone if the court lacked jurisdiction, the learned judge held that the District Court had jurisdiction to deal with the quantifiedclaim of HK$40,000 without the possession claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  Mr Chu next refers to <i>Yu Yiu Kong Samuel v Kobylanski, Stephen AndrÃ©</i>, DCCJ5371/2000, unreported, 11 July 2001.  In that case the plaintiff claimed for possession of premises (which were subsequentlysurrendered by the defendant), arrears of rent/mesne profits, and various items of claim.  Mr Chu refers to paragraph 7 of the judgmentof His Honour A Cheung, as he then was, in which he discussed costs.  The learned judge said that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quate">â[the] normal rule is that costs should follow event.  But the net amount recovered by the Plaintiff is small.  It would have followedwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal but for that fact that originally there was a claim for vacant possession. However two days after the Writ was issued, possession was delivered back to the Plaintiff......  In relation to the Writ and Statementof Claim, they were prepared at a time when possession was still in use.  The plaintiff should be entitled to the legal costs expendedon it, but once possession was delivered up, the matter within dispute would really be within the jurisdiction of the Small ClaimsTribunal.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  Mr Chu distinguished <i>Yu Yiu Kong Samuel</i>âs case, supra, by saying that, apart from the claim for possession which was not pursued, the amount claimed by the plaintiff inthat case exceeds HK$50,000 and it is only held by the learned judge after trial that the amount of damages awarded was less thanHK$50,000.  Since Mr Chu cites this case for the purpose of distinguishing it, I need say no further, except that I am unable todraw assistance from this case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  Mr Chu also distinguishes <i>M Beraha &amp; Co. Ltd v Ng Wai Lun</i>, CACV256/2003, unreported, 18 April 2004, on a similar basis.  In that case, the plaintiff claimed for refund of the rental depositin the sum of HK$52,000 and the defendant sought to offset two sums of HK$10,400 and HK$5,000 respectively.  At the trial hearing,the parties agreed that a sum of HK$4,870 should be deducted from the deposit so the learned judge entered judgment for the sum ofHK$47,130 without the trial.  Mr Chu says that since the amount claimed by the plaintiff in that case is HK$52,000, the case is distinguishable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  I find that this does not sit well with his other submissions that the issue of jurisdiction can be considered at any and all timeseven after the commencement of the action.  Plainly at the trial hearing in that case, the plaintiff, to adopt Mr Chuâs words,âacknowledgedâ that HK$4,870 should be deducted from the deposit.  Once the plaintiff acknowledged such deduction and agreedto a reduction of his claim from HK$52,000 to HK$47,130, such revised quantification emanating from the plaintiffâs acknowledgmentand not from determination after trial should, on Mr Chuâs submissions, show that the District Court had or no longer had jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  But in that case, without any demur from the Court of Appeal and despite the Court of Appealâs endorsement of the learned judgeâsview that âhad the plaintiff properly taken into account the amount of $4,870 for distress of rent in its consideration of theproper venue to bring its claim against the defendant, the claim would and should have been brought before the Tribunal, as opposedto the District Courtâ, and notwithstanding the duty of the court to disclaim jurisdiction where it lacks jurisdiction by statute,the learned judge entered judgment against the defendant for the sum of HK$47,130 and adjudicated on costs.  This flies in the faceof the defenceâs contentions that there is no jurisdiction where there is clear acknowledgment of a monetary claim below HK$50,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  In discussing the above cases, Mr Chu lays emphasis on the fact that the plaintiff has only a monetary claim and does not claimfor possession of the premises in the present case.  This is irrelevant.  The relevant consideration is whether the plaintiffâsclaim at the commencement of the action was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal or not.  One may easilycome to a negative answer if there is a possession claim but jurisdiction does not necessarily turn on whether there is or is nota possession claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  Next, Mr Chu draws an analogy from the provisions in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41(1)</a> and (2) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336">Cap. 336</a>, which provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(1)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">The court shall, either of its own motion or on the application of any party, order than an action or proceeding be transferred tothe Court of First Instance where an action or proceeding commenced in the Court, not being a counterclaim, is outside the jurisdictionof the Court but within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(2)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">The court may, if it thinks fit, instead of ordering that the action or proceeding be transferred, order that it be struck out where,on the application of a defendant, it appears to the Court that the plaintiff or, if more than one, one of the plaintiffs knew orought to have known that the Court had no jurisdiction.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  Mr Chu in his written submissions argues that, although <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41(1)</a> refers to transfer in cases from the District Court to the Court of First Instance without any mention of the Small Claims Tribunal,the heading of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41</a>, i.e. âProcedure where proceedings beyond the jurisdiction of the court are commenced in the Courtâ, which is submitted to be<i>including</i> the situation where the District Court has no jurisdiction because the claim falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the SmallClaims Tribunalâ.  In his oral submissions before me, Mr Chu submits that he refers to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41</a> for analogy only.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  Mr Chu argues that by analogy to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41(2)</a>, the District Court may strike out a claim before it that is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal if theplaintiff âknew or ought to have known that the court had no jurisdictionâ.  Mr Chu submits that, since the plaintiff knows orought to have known this court has no jurisdiction, the plaintiffâs claim ought to be struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  Such argument is without merit.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 18(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap. 1</a>, provides that â[a] marginal note to section heading to any provision of any Ordinance shall not have any legislative effectand shall not in any way vary, limit or extend the interpretation of any Ordinance.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  It is difficult to see how the heading of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41</a> will assist in âincludingâ within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41</a> a power to strike out a claim exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal or in giving a power to so strikeout by way of analogy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  Apart from abuse of process which this court has inherent jurisdiction to deal with but which is not the basis of Mr Chuâs submissions,striking out a claim is a draconian power that should be exercised when such power is clearly provided and where the case for strikingout is plain and obvious.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  When one reads <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41(1)</a> and (2) together, it is plain that the statute is dealing with proceedings beyond the jurisdiction of the District Court as meaningoutside the jurisdiction of the District Court but within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance.  I cannot see how suchstatutory provision can apply to a situation where the claim falls within the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal.  Mr Chusays there is no express reference to the Court of First Instance in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41(2)</a>, but one must read the section in its entirety to give meaning to its provisions.  Further, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41(2)</a> contemplates striking out a claim where the court decides not to exercise its discretion to transfer the action or proceeding.  Suchdiscretion to transfer is provided for in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41(1)</a> which refers to a transfer to the Court of First Instance.  In any event, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41(2)</a> cannot apply to an action or proceeding that is within the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal because the District Court simplyhas no power to transfer cases to the Tribunal.  There is no merit to this argument at all.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  There is also no need to go further to consider whether the defendant has shown that the plaintiff knew or ought to have known thatthe District Court has no jurisdiction since <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41(2)</a> cannot be prayed in aid by way of analogy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  Since Mr Suen abandons reliance on the matters raised in paragraph 38 of his written submissions or on the case of <i>Ramos Mirazul A. v Pro Search (Asia) Limited</i>, DCCJ5878/2002, His Honour Judge L Chan, unreported, 10 June 2005, I need not deal with the same.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  In the shortness of time I have not been able to set out the fullness of counselâs arguments and submissions.  Suffice to saythat I have considered their submissions most carefully.  Having considered their submissions and the above matters, I am not satisfiedthat the District Court lacks jurisdiction such that the plaintiffâs claim ought to be struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  I find the defendantâs contentions untenable and reject them.  There is no merit to the application, which regrettably only servesto delay the trial and add a further layer of costs to what can only be termed as a modest claim on either side of the fence.  Thedefendantâs second summons is dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(Discussion on further conduct of the case and costs)</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  So, by consent, judgment be granted in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant for the sum of HK$27,815, together with interestthereon at 10.75 per cent per annum from the date of the writ, which is 16 August 2006, to the date of judgment, which is today,and thereafter at judgment rate until payment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  By consent the defendantâs counterclaim is dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(Discussion on costs)</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  So the plaintiffâs summons dated 20 April 2007 is dismissed.  The plaintiff do pay the defendant costs of the plaintiffâs summonsdated 20 April 2007, to be taxed if not agreed on District Court scale with certificate for counsel.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  The defendantâs summons dated 20 April 2007 is dismissed.  The defendant do pay the plaintiff costs of the defendantâs summonsdated 20 April 2007, to be taxed if not agreed on District Court scale with certificate for counsel.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  The whole day of the hearing on 23 April 2007 and two hoursâ hearing time on 24 April 2007 be apportioned as to one-third forthe plaintiffâs summons of 20 April 2007 and two-thirds for the defendantâs summons of 20 April 2007 in order to assist the taxingmaster.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  I make the aforesaid apportionment on a broad basis to assist the taxing master.  Mr Chu says that the appropriate apportionmentis 50/50, while Mr Suen says that the apportionment should be one-third to two-thirds, or one-quarter to three-quarters.  My impressionof the hearing yesterday is that more time was spent on the defendantâs summons.  This is reflected by the more confined issuesof the plaintiffâs summons.  After all, only one authority is cited in relation to the same.  This is also reflected in the scopeof discussions in my decision delivered today.  On a broad basis and with my impression of the hearing yesterday still fresh in mymind, the aforesaid apportionment is considered appropriate.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(Discussion on costs)</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  I reserve the ruling of costs of the action to be handed down.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Marlene Ng)<br />            District Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Jenkin Suen, instructed by Messrs Chan, Wong &amp; Lam, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr Chu Wai-kei, instructed by Messrs Lau Pau &amp; Co., for the Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2007/159.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
