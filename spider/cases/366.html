The agreement for sale and purchase was enteredinto on 30 June2001.  It was in the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs standard form.  I shall refer to thisagreement as the âProvisional Agreementâ.  There were three parties to thatagreement: the plaintiff as purchaser (âthe Purchaserâ), the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant asvendor (âthe Vendorâ) and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as agent (âthe Agentâ).</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The Purchaser is a company controlled by Mr Shum Wai Lung (âMr Shumâ).  The Vendor is a company controlled by Mr Leung Sai Tat(âMr Leungâ).  Mr Leung and his family previously resided in the Property.  Thefoundation for the proceedings is a tragic accidentwhich occurred about a yearbefore the Provisional Agreement.  In July 2000, Mr Leungâs son, who was then about four years old,accidentally fell from the balcony of the Property to the ground floor.  He was taken to hospital and was certified dead about eighthours later.  The accident was reported in the press at the time, although the parties have notadduced any evidence of the extentof the publicity.</p>    <p class="heading">The agreements</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Mr Leung moved out of the Property in November 2000 into rentedaccommodation.  In January 2001, he decided to sell the Property andengagedthe Agent in looking for a buyer.  He signed, on behalf of the Vendor, an EstateAgency Agreement with the Agent in a formprescribed by the Estate Agents Authority (see Form 3 of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/511C" class="autolink_findacts">Estate Agents Practice (General Duties and Hong Kong Residential Properties) Regulation</a>). Clause 2 of that agreement makes itclear that the agency relationship between the Vendor and the Agent was to bea dual agency,in other words, that the Agent would also act for the Purchaser.  Schedule 1 to that agreement lists the duties of the Agent.  Itprovided that</p>    <p>the Agent shall :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)    market the Property on behalf of theVendor;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)    obtain information in relation to the Property for the Vendor;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)    arrange for purchasers to inspect the Property;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d)    conduct negotiation and submit all offers in relation to the Property to theVendor; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(e)    assist the Vendor in entering into a binding agreement for sale andpurchase with a purchaser.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Under Schedule 2, the Vendor agrees to pay the Agent commission at the rate of 1% of the transacted price of the Property if a bindingagreementto sell is entered into between a specified period, but the Vendor wouldbe under no obligation to pay any commission ifcompletion of thetransaction fell through without fault on the part of the Vendor.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> In March 2001, Mr Shum was in the happy position of having recentlybecome a father and was looking for a new home for his family. He engagedthe Agent to introduce properties to him.  The person he contacted was oneJacky Lee, who was working in the Whampoa Branch.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> In June, Jacky Lee introduced Mr Shum to Mr Victor Yeung at the YauYat Chuen branch of the Agent.  Mr Yeung was held out as specialisinginproperties in Yau Yat Chuen.  It is common ground that on 28 June 2001, Mr Yeung took Mr Shum and his wife to view the Propertyand on Mr Shumâsrequest, a second inspection of the Property was carried out on the same day.  At the time of the inspection, theProperty was furnished but unoccupied.  Access to the Property was gained through the assistance of a Filipino maidhired by the Leungfamily.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> After the two inspections, Mr Shum expressed his interest in purchasingthe Property.  Negotiation ensued, and ended with Mr Shumsigning theProvisional Agreement on behalf of the Purchaser on 30 June.  Mr Leungsigned for the Vendor on the same day.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The agreed price was HK$10 million.  The Purchaser paid a deposit ofHK$300,000 upon signing.  Under the terms of the ProvisionalAgreement, theAgent was entitled to receive HK$100,000 as commission from each of the Vendor and the Purchaser, and if either theVendor or the Purchaser fails tocomplete the sale and purchase, the defaulting party shall compensate the Agent HK$200,000 as liquidateddamages.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The Provisional Agreement called for a further sum of HK$700,000 tobe paid upon signing of a formal agreement for sale and purchaseon or before16 July 2001.  This never happened.  A few days after the ProvisionalAgreement was signed, Mr Shum learnt about the tragicincident from a friendwhom he said also worked as an estate agent.  He said he felt cheated and gavenotice in early July to terminatethe Provisional Agreement.  The Vendor denied that thePurchaser had any right to terminate the Provisional Agreement and duly forfeitedthedeposit.   The Agent in turn claims that since the sale was aborted by reason ofthe Purchaserâs default, the Purchaser shouldcompensate the Agent for its lossin commission. </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Before I outline the disputes between the parties from which the issuesarise, I must mention one other fact. On the same day as thedate of theProvisional Agreement for sale and purchase, the Purchaser signed an estateagency agreement with the Agent.  That agreementwas in a form prescribed by the Estate Agency Authority (see Form 4 under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/511C" class="autolink_findacts">Estate Agents PracticeGeneral Duties and Hong Kong Residential Properties) Regulation</a>). Schedule2 of that agreement sets out the duties of the Agent, which are :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">obtain information in relation to the properties for the Purchaser;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" height="20">ã</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" height="20">ã</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">arrange for the Purchaser to inspect the properties if requested to do soby the Purchaser;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">ã</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">ã</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">conduct negotiation and submit all offers to the vendor of the propertiesas instructed by the Purchaser; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(d)</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">assist the Purchaser in entering into a binding agreement for sale andpurchase with the Vendor of any one or more of the properties.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>There are also provisions as to the payment of commission, which aresimilar to those found in the Estate Agency Agreement for theVendor.</p>    <p class="heading">The dispute of fact and evidence</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> What is in dispute is what happened during and after the inspections.  ThePurchaserâs case is that during the second inspectionof the Property, Mr Shumasked Mr Yeung the questions âæç¡å¤éç²¾æªâ and âç¡å¢åå¦¥ååâ (translated as : is thereanything weird or unusual), to which Mr Yeungallegedly responded in Chinese âno, no, noâ and said that the Vendor wassellingthe Property because the Vendorâs family was emigrating to Australia.  According to Mr Shum, he made a remark at the time âå¢åæåä»²ç§»æ°â(translated as : emigrating at this time?).</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The Purchaserâs case is that two days later on 30 June 2001, when Jacky Lee and Mr Yeung went to Mr Shumâs office with the formfor theProvisional Agreement, Mr Shum repeated the same questions after he signedthe agreement and the cheque for the deposit butbefore handing over the cheque, and drew a similar definite response from Mr Yeung.</p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The Agent does not dispute that Mr Shum did ask the questions, but itscase is that the questions were only asked once, and that wasinside Mr Shumâscar after the second inspection.  More importantly, the Agentâs case is that Mr Yeung answered Mr Shum by sayingânot to my knowledgeâ rather than witha definite negative and denied he made any remark about the Vendoremigrating.    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> There is another relatively inconsequential factual dispute between thePurchaser and the Vendor as to what Mr Shum allegedly saidto Mr Leung inthe presence of Jacky Lee and Victor Yeung some days after Mr Shum foundout about the tragic incident.  On the whole,Mr Yeung supported Mr Shumâsversion.  I regard this episode as of marginal relevance even on credibility. </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Each party called one witness.  The Purchaser called Mr Shum.  TheVendor called Mr Leung and the Agent called Mr Yeung.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> All three parties filed valuation reports.  At the trial, counsel for thePurchaser indicated that he was not going to rely on anyvaluation evidence asagainst the Vendor.  Consequently, counsel for the Vendor abandoned anyreliance on valuation evidence.  As betweenthe Purchaser and the Agent, bothparties agreed the contents of a Joint Report dated 21 October 2004 compiledby the valuers engagedby the Purchaser and that engaged by the Agent.  Thisreport expresses a joint opinion that the open market value of the Propertywouldbe reduced by 7.5% by reason of the accident.  The valuers also agreedthat in the case of suicide or murder, property values wouldbe reduced between25 to 30%.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Thedifficulty I find with this evidence is that the report does not deal with a numberof matters which common sense suggests wouldbe relevant, such as (1) whether the amount of reduction would depend on (a) the extent of publicity givento the tragic incidents,and (b) the time lag between the occurrence of theincidence and the notional valuation date, and (2) the extent, if any, to whichpropertyprices (and the comparables relied on) could be affected by whetherthere was any urgency on the part of the vendor in selling theproperty after thetragic event.  Nevertheless, the significance of this evidence is that the Agent accepts that the tragicincidentdoes have a bearing on the open market value of the Property. </p>    <p class="heading">The claims</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> In this action, the Purchaser seeks rescission of the ProvisionalAgreement and the return of the deposit of HK$300,000 paid to theVendor on thebasis that the Purchaser was induced to enter into the Provisional Agreement bymisrepresentation made by the Agent asagent for the Vendor.  It also seeksdamages against the Vendor and the Agent in the sum of HK$300,000, althoughthis claim is in substancean alternative to the return of the deposit and is madeon the basis that the Agent acted in breach of its duties to the Purchaser,causingloss to the Purchaser in the forfeiture of the deposit.  The Purchaser alsoseeks a declaration that the Agent is not entitled toany commission. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> There is a counterclaim by the Agent against the Purchaser for the sumof HK$200,000 being the commission that the Agent would haveearned had thePurchaser not rescinded the Provisional Agreement. </p>    <p class="heading">The issues</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Although the issues pleaded are wide ranging, including a challenge ontitle, allegations of fraud material non-disclosure and collateralcontract, counselâs arguments focused on the following issues :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">was there a misrepresentation by Mr Yeung to Mr Shum;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" height="20"> </td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" height="20"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">did the Agent have either actual or ostensible authority on behalfof the Vendor in making the alleged representation to thePurchaser;and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">ã</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">ã</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">was the Agent in breach of its duties to the Purchaser either incontract or in tort.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Purchaserâs case against the vendor</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> I shall first consider the Purchaserâs case against the Vendor.  I havealready noted that many of the issues raised in the Re-amendedStatement ofClaim were no longer pursued at the trial.  Counsel for the Purchaser expresslywithdrew the allegation of fraud.  Hemade no submission on the question oftitle.  He conceded that the Vendor had no duty in law to make any disclosureof the tragic incidentto the Purchaser, a concession which appears to me to be well justified, see <i>Sykes v. Rose</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/299.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] EWCA Civ 299.</a> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The only remaining argument against the Vendor was a claim that thePurchaser entered into the Provisional Agreement by reason of</p>    <p>misrepresentation by the Agent, acting on behalf of the Vendor.  This raises two issues : was there a misrepresentation by the Agent,and if so, did the Agenthave authority, actual or apparent, from the Vendor in making thatrepresentation.</p>    <p class="heading">Was there a misrepresentation?</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The burden of proving misrepresentation is on the Purchaser.  Twoquestions arise : (1) what was said between Mr Shum and Mr Yeungon 28 June and on 30 June, and (2) what was the meaning of what was said.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> I do not find the conflict between Mr Shumâs evidence and that of Mr Leung easy to resolve.  There were other witnesses which couldhave beencalled but were not.  On the Purchaserâs case, the first relevant conversationtook place in the presence of Mrs Shum,whilst thesecondrelevantconversation took place in the presence of a Mr Thomas Ho, who was themanaging director of the Purchasercompany.  On the Agentâs case, there wasone other witness : Jacky Lee.  However, none of these witnesses was called.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Having considered the totality of the evidence, I would, on balance,prefer the evidence of Mr Shum on the issue.  In particular,I accept Mr Shumâs evidence that Mr Yeung did not qualify his answer and that had Mr Yeung done so, he would not have been satisfiedand would have asked himhow well did he know the Property.  Mr Shum is, I believe, right in saying thatMr Yeung was eager to concludethe transaction.  I have the same impressionfrom the evidence.  Such eagerness could well be the reason why Mr Yeung didnot botherto make any inquiry before responding to Mr Shumâs query andgave him a less than truthful answer to fend off further inquiry. I also acceptMr Shumâs evidence that he asked the questions again on the occasion whenhe signed the Provisional Agreement and thatMr Yeung gave a definiteresponse in the negative.  I find that the Agent did represent to the Purchaserthat there was nothing weirdor unusual about the Property. </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Was the representation false?  This depends on what the representationcould reasonably be understood to mean.  Mr Shumâs evidence(which I accept) was that whenhe asked the questions, he was seeking to find out whether any mysterious ortragic event occurred inthe Property.  In my view, the first question couldreasonably be understood to be directed to finding out whether there wasanythingmysterious about the Property.  The second question appears to me tobe wider.  Different people are likely to understand it differently. The meaningof the question was ambiguous and accordingly the representation was ambiguous.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Counsel accepted that where, as here, the representation is ambiguous, the law is correctly stated in <i>Halsburyâs</i> <i>Laws of England</i>,para. 747 whichreads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhere the representation genuinely and reasonably can have more thanone meaning, the representee must show in which of the possiblesenseshe understood it, and that in that sense it was false.  Where he is able soto do, the fact that it might have been understoodin a different sense,which was not false, will not avail the representor.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(See also <i>Spencer</i> <i>Bower, Turner and Handley, Actionable M</i><i>isrepresentation</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed.

In my view, if a tragic event such as murder, suicide orfatal accident tookplace in a property, an ordinary person is likely to regard that somethingunusual happened.  For the Agent, MrMaurellet for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant pointed out that Mr Leungâsson only died some eight hours after the fall and he died in hospital, and contendedthat arepresentation that nothing tragic happened within the Property was notfalse.  I do not accept that submission.  The fall took placefrom within theProperty.  The child suffered fatal injuries from the fall, from which he diedshortly thereafter.  An ordinary personwould regard the tragic incident to berelated to the Property. </p>    <p class="heading">Authority of agent</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Merely proving that the Agent made a misrepresentation does not entitlethe Purchaser to rescind the Provisional Agreement.

The agent gave thepurchaser a plan which shows erroneously that thearea was 950 sq. ft.  Thequestion was whether the misrepresentation was made on the vendorâs behalf.  Godfrey J (as he then was)had this to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âBut was the misrepresentation made on the vendorsâ behalf? In myjudgment, it is not.  An agent in the property market in HongKong isnot, as it seems to me, in quite the same position as an estate agent inEngland and Wales (as to this, in relation to misrepresentationby an estate agent, see <i>Mullins v. Miller</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281882%29%2022%20Ch%20D%20194" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1882) 22 Ch D 194).</a>  An agent inHong Kong acts as a broker, usually, though not always, taking âcommissionâ from both vendor and purchaser.  No doubt,in some cases,even in Hong Kong, a misrepresentation made by an agent to a purchaserwill, on the facts, be held to have been madeon the vendorâs behalf.  ButI am now concerned only with the facts of the present case.  Here, thevendors all along thought thatthe area of the flat was between 800 and900 sq. ft.  They had not given the agent any actual authority to representto the purchaserthat its area was 950 sq. ft. or to produce the sketch tohim.  Nor, in my judgment, did they confer on the agent, merely byappointingit to act as their agent for the purpose of selling the flat, anyapparent (or ostensible) authority to supply the purchaser withthe sketch,not from any document given to the agent by the vendors, but from theagentâs own records (on the question of the apparentor ostensibleauthority of an agent in England or Wales comparison may usefully be made with <i>Overbrooke Estates Limited v.

The learned judgeexpressed the view that the question is one of fact in each case.  Withrespect,I agree.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> The Estate Agency Agreement between the Vendor and the Agent madein January 2001 did not confer authority on the Agent to furnishto thePurchaser any information not supplied to the Agent by the Vendor.  There isno express term to such effect, and none can beimplied.  Whilst the Agent hadthe duty to market the Property and conduct negotiation, it is not necessary forthe Agent to have suchauthority from the Vendor in the performance of suchduties.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Nor do I find that the Vendor has clothed the Agent with any apparentor ostensible authority in making the representation reliedon.  The only pleadedfact which the Purchaser relies on is the fact that the Vendor allowed Mr Yeung to show the Property to thePurchaser.  In my view, this is not sufficientto clothe Mr Yeung with apparent or ostensible authority to make therepresentation.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> I should mention one further matter here.  The Ordinance and Regulationsprovide for a mechanism by which certain information concerningthe property should be passed to the purchaser.  One of the forms prescribed under the EstateAgents Practice (General Duties andHong Kong Residential Properties) Regulationis a âProperty Information Formâ.  There are two parts in this form.  Part 1 wasto be filled in by the estate agent.  This includes matters such asparticulars of current ownership and subsisting encumbrances registeredin theLand Registry, floor area, year of completion, user restriction etc.  Part 2 wasto be filled in by the Vendor.  This includesquestions on whether there has beenany structural alterations to the property and whether there was anyreinstatements, rectifications,repairs or improvements of any part of theproperty or the building of which the property forms part which are requiredby Governmentor the management office or the owners incorporation of thebuilding.  In the present case, only Part 1 of the Form was filled in. Mr Leungâs evidence, which I accept, is that Jacky Lee and Mr Yeung toldhim he was not required to fill in the Part 2.  In theEstate Agency Agreementsigned by the Purchaser at about the same time as the signing of the ProvisionalAgreement, there was a tickindicating that the Purchaser waived its right toreceive the Property Information Form.  No evidence was led from thePurchaser onthis aspect.  Mr Yeungâs evidence was that he ticked the boxbecause Mr Shum indicated at the time that he would waive his rightto receivethe information.  If a purchaser is provided with the Property Information Form,he would be entitled to rely on the informationcontained therein, especially inPart 2 of the Form, as being information provided by the vendor or with hisauthority.  In the presentcase, the information was not contained in the form(and indeed is not required to be so included) and Mr Shum did not evenreceiveit.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Moreover, one must not forget that when the questions were asked byMr Shum, Mr Yeung was acting as the Purchaserâs agent.  Indeed,there is noevidence to suggest that on the first occasion when the questions were asked (on28 June 2001), Mr Shum was even awarethat the Agent was acting in a dualcapacity.  He was only provided with the Estate Agency Agreement later, on30 June.  The questionswhich Mr Shum asked were, in my view, moreconsistent with Mr Shum seeking to find out information from his own agentthan with aninquiry through the Agent with the Vendor.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> For these reasons, I find that the Purchaserâs claim against the Vendorfails.  The Purchaser was not entitled to rescind the ProvisionalAgreement.  TheVendor was entitled to forfeit the deposit.  In my view, the Purchaser had littlejustification for suing the Vendor.</p>    <p class="heading">Negligent misrepresentation and duty of agent</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> A professional agent engaged for reward is under an implied contractual duty to exercise reasonable care and skill on behalf of hisclient, see <i>Chitty</i> <i>on C</i><i>ontracts</i>, <i>Hong Kong Specific Contracts</i>, para. 1-103.  Such duty arises bothin contract and in tort.  Mr Maurellet does not dispute that the Agent owes aduty of care tothe Purchaser.  None of the counsel has referred to me to anyauthority on the scope or standard of duty that may be owed by an estateagentin Hong Kong.  There is one relatively recent case where the Court had to consider the scope of duty of an estate agent.  In<i>Chiu Wai Ling v. Chan Yau Chi</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20HKC%20154" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 HKC 154</a>, the vendor accepted that the title was defective because ofpotential liability for estate duty by reason of a deed of gift, andsought to claimagainst the estate agent (as third party), for alleged breach of duty in failing toadvise the vendor properly (suchas inserting a proper clause in the provisionalagreement or to warn the vendor to seek independent legal advice).  Judge Lokheldthat the estate agent did not owe the duty contended for, holding that thedegree of skill and care expected of estate agents in HongKong would notextend to legal matters on which estate agents received no training.  Inparagraph 31 of his judgment, the learned judgereferred to a provision in theCode of Ethics issued by the Estate Agency Authority which requires estateagents to provide servicesbased on knowledge, training, qualifications andexperience in real estate business.  The case is in my view distinguishable.  Whatisexpected of the Agent in the present case is not knowledge or experience onquestions of law, but the passing on of accurate and reliableinformation aboutthe Property concerned.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> The standard of care and skill is that possessed by a person of ordinary competence exercising the same calling, see <i>Charlesworth on Negligence</i>, 10<sup>th</sup> ed. para. 8-03.  It has been said that if an allegation of negligence is madeagainst a professionally qualified man, the court usuallyrequires evidence fromthose within the same profession as to the standard expected on the facts of thecase and the failure of theprofessionally qualified man to measure up to that standard, see <i>per</i>Butler-Sloss LJ in <i>S</i><i>ansom v.</i> <i>Metcalfe Hambleton &amp; Co.</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20PNLR%20542" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] PNLR 542.</a>  However, this is not an inflexible rule and one may debatewhether an estate agent comes within the category of professionally qualifiedmen. Nonetheless, my task has not been made easier in this case by the absenceof any evidence of the practice of estate agents on thissort of matter. </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> It seems to me that if an estate agent acting for a purchaser knows orought to have known of the occurrence of a tragic incidentin a property, andknew or ought reasonably to have known that this would materially affect thevalue of the property, that agent wouldowe a duty to alert its client to that fact.  In the present case, there is no evidence that the Agent was aware of theoccurrenceof the tragic incident at the time the representation was made.  Although there is some evidence fromMr Leung and Mr Shum as to thefact that the tragic incident was publicisedat the time and that apparently some estate agents knew about this, thePurchaser hasnot adduced sufficient evidence to satisfy me on the balance ofprobabilities that a prudent agent ought reasonably to have knownof theincident.  Mr Kwok did not even cross-examine Mr Yeung on the basis that he knew or ought to have known of the incident.  Althoughit is now agreed between the Purchaser and theAgent that the tragic incident would have an adverse effect on the market value ofthe Property, there is no evidence before me that a prudent estate agent ought reasonably to have known that an accident such asthe one in question here would have a material effect on the market value. </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> However, in the present case, the Purchaser specifically raised a query withthe Agent.  The Agent did not answer the query by simplydisclaiming anyknowledge.  As stated above, I find that Mr Yeung assured Mr Shum thatthere was nothing unusual about the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> It was one of the express terms of the Estate Agency Agreement betweenthe Purchaser and the Agent that the Agent would obtain informationconcerningthe Property for the Purchaser.  It must be implied that the Agentwould exercise reasonable care and skill when providing such information. Therelationship between the parties is also such that the law would impose that dutyin tort.  Mr Yeung must have known that Mr Shumwould rely on the information he was providing, and it was certainly foreseeable that the Purchaser may suffer loss anddamage ifthe Agent did not exercise reasonable care and skill in the collection and passing on of information concerning the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Mr Yeung made no inquiry before answering the questions.  In myjudgment, Mr Yeung should have undertaken reasonable inquiry beforeansweringhis clientâs query and he failed in his duty when he gave theassurance to Mr Shum without first having done so.  On the evidence,therewould not have been any difficulty in his finding out the tragic incident. </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> In my judgment, the Agent was in breach of its duties, both in contractand in tort.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> I have no hesitation in accepting Mr Shumâs evidence that he relied on the representation by Mr Yeung.  I accept his evidence thatbecause he wasbuying the Property as a residence, he was concerned about whether there wasanything untoward about the Property andhence raised the questions.  Also, hisimmediate action in seeking to rescind the transaction once he found out aboutthe tragic incidentsupports this conclusion.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Agent acted in breach of itsduties to the Purchaser, and am further satisfied thatthe Purchaser has sufferedloss and damage as a result.  The amount of loss claimed is quantified at HK$300,000, being the amountof deposit forfeited to the Vendor.</p>    <p class="heading">The counterclaim</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The Agent counterclaims against the Purchaser on the basis of the termsof the Provisional Agreement.  Clause 10 provides that ifeither the Vendor orthe Purchaser fails to complete the sale and purchase, the defaulting party shallcompensate the Agent HK$200,000as liquidated damages.  Here, as between theVendor and the Purchaser, it was the Purchaserâs default that led to the abortionofthe sale and purchase.  It would, however, hardly seem fair for the Purchaserto have to pay the Agent HK$200,000 when, as betweenthe Purchaser and theAgent, it was the Agentâs breach of duty which was the cause of the problem.  It is trite that an agent cannotrecover its remuneration if the agent acted inbreach of his duties as agent, such breach either going to the root of thecontractor otherwise justifying the principalâs repudiation of liability to pay, see <i>B</i><i>owstead and Reynolds on Agency</i>, 17<sup>th</sup> ed. para. 7-047.  In my judgment,it must necessarily be implied in the Provisional Agreement that the Agentcannot recover this sumif it was the Agentâs breach of duty that led to thedefault.  In any event, if the Agent were to be allowed to claim the HK$200,000,thiswould only have increased the amount of damages suffered by thePurchaser as a result of the Agentâs breach.  To avoid circuitry,I would dismissthe counterclaim.</p>    <p class="heading">Order</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> In the premises, I would :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">dismiss the plaintiffâs claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" height="20">ã</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" height="20">ã</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">dismissed the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs counterclaim;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">ã</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">ã</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">order that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant pay to the plaintiff the sum of HK$300,000; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(4)</td>                <td width="85%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">order that the sum under (3) should bear interest from the date ofthe writ until judgment at the rate of prime + 1%.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> I make an order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiff do pay to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant its costsof the action; and that as between the plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant shall pay to the plaintiff the plaintiffâs costs of the action against the2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and of the counterclaim, such costs not to include the plaintiffâscosts of the action against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.
