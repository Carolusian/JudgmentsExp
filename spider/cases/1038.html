Sinclair, conducted an enquiry, pursuant to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/504" class="autolink_findacts">Coroners Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/14">Cap. 14</a> (the Ordinance), into the untimely and unhappy death of Mrs. Shirley Ann Boyde. It is, I think, widely known that Mrs Boydewas having what was a relatively routine operation at Canossa Hospital on 14th January 1989 to reduce a fracture of her ankle. Forthis purpose she was given a general anaesthetic by the anaesthetist, Dr. Michael John Bascombe. Unfortunately, the hospital oxygensupply, unbeknown to everyone concerned, contained nitrogen. Mrs. Boyde received so much nitrogen that she ultimately died of cerebralanoxia.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Before the enquiry commenced, counsel on behalf of Dr. Bascombe wrote to the coroner's officer expressing concern that the coronermight direct the jury that a verdict of lack of care was open to them and that such a verdict would involve consideration of whetherthere was a failure to meet a fair and reasonable standard of care. Counsel cited authority in support of his view that lack of careis a very special verdict, requiring careful direction, and does not amount to a finding of, effectively, negligence. The coroner'sofficer replied, in a somewhat non-committal way, that in his view a verdict of misadventure aggravated by lack of care is permissible.He did not vouchsafe his view on the nature or meaning of lack of care.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Upon on the opening of the enquiry on 17th April, counsel took the matter up again because he apprehended the Hong Kong Oxygen Co.Ltd., which was responsible for supplying oxygen to the hospital, intended calling evidence with a view to establishing that negligentor inadequate medical treatment was the effective cause of death. The coroner ruled upon this. He said "the purpose of the enquiryis to make a full, frank and revealing investigation into all aspects of death - so far as they are relevant" and went on :</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">                "It is for the Coroner's Officer, with my directions, to call such evidence as reveals to the Court, to the publicand most particularly to the Jury, all of the circumstances.

If there is other evidence whichtends to negate that, then that is also relevant and that will also be called by the Coroner's Officer. One cannot restrict the verdictswhich are open; the verdicts as I say, which will be left to the Jury are those which in my opinion, based on the evidence, can properlyDe left to them to properly describe how it was this unfortunate lady came to her death."                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="89%">                He finished by saying :                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">"I will look very carefully to ensure that no parties raise questions of individual witnesses which are designed solely to shift blameor put blame on any individual; they will only be allowed to put those questions if it is felt the answers thereto will tend to increaseour knowledge of how it came about that Mrs. Shirley Boyde died, and enables the Jury to return a proper verdict."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The enquiry lasted 5 weeks. Over a week was spent examining the medical and anaesthetic aspects of the episode, during which Dr.Bascombe was questioned persistently not just on what he did at the time but on his training, experience and knowledge. Expert witnesseswere closely examined as to how a reasonable anaesthetist should have reacted when the emergency occurred.

The coroner ruled that, subject to the evidence supporting it, such a verdict might be left to the jury.He went on to sum up to the jury, in the course of which he said :</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="88%">        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">                "Now, members of the jury, you have heard an amount of evidence given by expert witnesses called to give opinionon the treatment and care received by Mrs. Boyde when in operating Theatre No. 3. This is because a physician owes a duty to hispatient to use diligence, care, knowledge, skill and caution in administering his treatment. The law requires a fair and reasonablestandard of care and competence. What is meant by fair and reasonable is to exercise ordinary skill and care, according to the ordinaryand reasonable standards of those who practise in the same field of medicine. The standard for the specialist is the standard ofthe specialists. A doctor is not negligent if he has acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible bodyof medical people skilled in that particular field, even though other doctors may adopt a different practice. Now we have heard fromseveral eminent professors of anaesthesiology about what they say should have been done, or what could reasonably have been expectedto have been done in Theatre No. 3 to save Mrs. Boyde's life.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">                What is the relevance of this evidence?

He is concerned that fellow practitioners should not have to undergothe same ordeal and asks this court to clarify the law. The Medical Defence Union Ltd., however, while echoing Dr. Bascombe, alsohas a very real financial interest. Worldwide it has 175000 members including a large proportion of all Hong Kong practitioners.Its chief objects are the conduct of legal proceedings on behalf of members and giving advice on professional technical matters.Although retaining a discretion, it generally indemnifies a member from all damages and costs in legal proceedings. Unlike in othercountries, it expends considerable funds on death enquiries in Hong Kong because, as it perceives the position, some coroners, asin the present case, regard it as their function to examine whether a medical practitioner exercised a reasonable standard of careand skill as being potentially relevant to a lack of care verdict.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Mr. Whaley, who appeared for the coroner, argued that the Union has no sufficient interest in the matter to which this applicationrelates to give it locus standi. He referred me to the notes 53/1 - 14/31 in the Supreme Court Practice. He maintained that the Unionhas no direct or personal interest in the relief sought; that it was not a party as such at the enquiry; and that it would createan undesirable precedent if a body like the Union, which is little more than an insurer, can intervene to protect its own ratherthan a public cause.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> For the Union, Mr. Thomas referred me to a number of authorities.

Mr. Beloff to advance the argument which he wished to reserve. However, we make it clear that in ourview the question of locus standi goes to jurisdiction of the court and therefore the approach adopted by the department in thiscase, while understandable, is not appropriate. The parties are not entitled to confer jurisdiction, which the court does not have,on the court by consent and, if this court had peen minded to grant declaratory relief, would have had to advance any arguments whichwere available to them or to accept the consequences of not doing so. Having regard to the outcome of this appeal we can contentourselves by indicating that, on the evidence but without the advantage of argument, we have not doubt that it was in order for thiscourt and Schiemann J. to treat the application for judicial review as being one which the court had jurisdiction to hear."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The applicants in the latter case would never themselves be applicants for benefit.

Second, it is said that the enquiry was conducted in a manner which was unfairto Dr. Bascombe, that is to say in breach of the rules of natural justice. While standing on its own, Mr. Thomas also used it insupport of his first and principal ground.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> In so far as it is a separate ground, I will deal with the latter first. Immediately I must emphasise, as Mr. Thomas was at painsto acknowledge, no attack is made upon nor complaint made about the way in which Mr. Sinclair conducted the enquiry. Mr. Sinclair,it is fairly acknowledged, was patient, courteous and did his best to ensure that everyone said or asked what they wanted, subjectto relevancy and subject to the Rules prescribing for procedure at a death enquiry. So much is evident from the transcript of theproceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Mr. Thomas' argument was that, if the coroner is right about the extent of his jurisdiction, the Rules are inherently flawed.

I would observe only that theRules do not prohibit such notification but rather prescribe the bare minimum that must be done. Whether anything more is ever doneis perhaps debatable because the coroner himself appeared vague about precisely what is notified - see p 670 Transcript.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Next it was said Dr. Bascombe was given no notification of what would be said against him. It is true he received no formal notificationfrom the coroner or his officer. It is clear from the transcript, however, that Dr. Bascombe and those advising him knew what wasin the wind. They raised it early in the enquiry. While there is a dispute as to whether or not the coroner's officer was preparedto supply them with copies of witnesses', particularly expert witnesses', statements or reports before the enquiry opened (on whichI express no opinion), it is clear that the officer was prepared to make them available at the hearing. Those documents would undoubtedlyhave shown Dr. Bascombe precisely what he could expect. Therefore any failure formally to notify Dr. Bascombe in advance was curedat that stage.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Then it is said Dr. Bascombe suffered because he was unable to grapple with matters raised by medical witnesses called after him.As to that, I have 3 observations. First, the documents would have permitted Dr. Bascombe's counsel to tackle these matters withhim. Second, the coroner would no doubt have considered sympathetically an application to recall Dr. Bascombe or for an adjournmentto gather additional material. Page 671 of the transcript certainly suggests this. Third, an expert whose evidence was favourableto Dr. Bascombe was called by the coroner at Dr. Bascombe's instigation. I consider that there is nothing in this point.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Further, Rule 13 gives the coroner a discretion as to the order in which a witness shall be questioned. I have no doubt the coronerwould sympathetically have entertained a request that Dr. Bascombe's counsel be first to question him.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Rule 28 provides that "no person shall be allowed to address the coroner or the jury as to the facts". This provision, argued Mr.Thomas, both suggests that it was unlikely that a public enquiry into someone's conduct was ever contemplated, and is wholly unfair,removing as it does the usual right to address a tribunal after the evidence has been heard. Assuming that the coroner correctlyfound the ambit of his jurisdiction, there seems to me nothing in this point. The provision may be undesirable if a detailed enquiryinto an individual's conduct is justified by the legislation, but if the legislature sees fit to include it, so be it. In practicalterms I see little difference between this and the prohibition on legal representation before certain tribunals. A layman can addvery little to what he says in evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> In my judgment Dr. Bascombe was not treated unfairly. This ground must fail.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> I turn then to examine the extent of a coroner's jurisdiction. It is common ground that a coroner's enquiry is a thorough fact findingenquiry but is not concerned to find or apportion guilt or fault : <u>R v. South London Coroner, ex parte Thompson</u> (1982) Times L.R. 372. Mr. Thomas argued that such an enquiry admits of asking a person what he did or did not do, why, and whathe had in mind; it does not admit of going on to ask questions aimed at discrediting his actions or of leading other evidence withthat purpose. The facts thus established will speak for themselves. An evaluation of a person's conduct is beyond a coroner's remit.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Mr. Whaley said that it would be wholly artificial to draw a line there. It is permissible for a coroner to go on and lead evidencethat is relevant to establishing a cause or contributory cause of death. Provided the evidence is adduced for that purpose the factthat it may overlap with the possibility of fault or negligence on the part of a witness is unfortunate. An evaluation of a person'sconduct, judged if necessary in relation to what are the reasonable standards of such person's calling or profession, is inevitableif a proper and thorough enquiry into the cause of death is to be made.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The coroner's jurisdiction is to be found, prima facie, in s. 6 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/14">Cap. 14</a> which reads:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(1)  Whenever any person dies suddenly, or by accident or violence, or under suspicious circumstances, or whenever the dead bodyof any person is found within the Colony or is brought into the Colony, a coroner may, if he considers that an inquiry is necessary,inquire into the cause of and the circumstances connected with the death of such person, with or without a view of the body as hemay think fit, and may determine the cause of death."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Mr. Thomas argued that "determine" relates only to "cause of death" and not to "circumstances connected with the death". "Circumstances"he said are included only in so far as they may assist in determining cause. It is not clear, however, what is encompassed by "circumstances".The section has a broad meaning and, in order to ascertain its limits, resort may be had to the Rules.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Mr. Whaley contended that, unless there is some indication in the Ordinance to the contrary, which there is not, the words of S.6 should be given their plain and ordinary meaning. The words give, and were intended to confer, a broad jurisdiction to carry outa full and thorough enquiry. There is no need to find a limit to "circumstances" which admit of no ambiguity.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> I find myself unable to accept that contention. In my experience, "circumstances" is commonly used as a catch-all of no great precision.Whilst I accept, as does Mr. Thomas, that there was intended by the legislature that there should be a full and vigorous examinationof the cause of a death, I cannot accept that there was intended an almost carte-blanche on the part of a coroner to examine, asthe coroner here put it, "all aspects of the death" - p. 25. To accept the latter, would mean a quasi-commission of enquiry if acoroner was so minded.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> It is permissible therefore to look at the Rules as an aid to construction: <u>Hanlon v.

A fortiori,argued Mr. Thomas, no question should be framed which appears to establish such liability nor should evidence be led for such a purpose.If this approach is right, individuals will be encouraged to give an honest account of what happened, which can only be in the publicinterest.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The Rules show therefore that the Chief Justice, who is the rule-making authority, was anxious that an enquiry should not becomeentangled in questions of civil liability. The only question to be determined is <u>how</u> and not <u>why</u> a death occurred.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Mr. Thomas said that, if that argument is wrong, one would have expected better provision for the rules of natural justice and conductof the proceedings. In the absence of, indeed, because of the exclusion of certain rights, it is unlikely that a public examinationof conduct was contemplated.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> I have already referred to rules 15 and 16. In addition to the lack of provision to notify a person of any allegations about hisconduct, Mr. Thomas pointed out that there is no other reference to person and conduct in the Rules. Therefore those 2 rules canonly relate to rule 23(c) and, together, do not confer a general power to call in question the conduct of anyone outside of the matterslaid down in rule 23. To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with rule 24 (1).</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Again, I have referred already to rule 28. Mr. Thomas made the additional point that a person caught by rule 23(c) will have an opportunityto answer any charge later on. It is unfair that a person can be brought into a public enquiry, questioned about his conduct witha view to obtaining damaging evidence but not have the opportunity to address the tribunal at the conclusion of the evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> This case, said Mr. Thomas, is a perfect illustration of the unsatisfactory situation that can arise if a coroner has a wide jurisdiction. Dr. Bascombe was, by the verdict of the jury, effectively "acquitted" of any fault or blame because of the time limit factor. Muchcriticism was, however, made of him and that criticism remains largely unresolved, particularly in the mind of the public at large.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> In <u>Ex parte Minister of Justice; Re Malcolm; Re Inglis and Coroners Act  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1960%2d1963%201965%20NSWR%201598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1960-1963</u> (1965) N.S.W.R. 1598</a>, McClemens J. was reviewing the sufficiency of an enquiry that found the cause of death in a man, who had become seriously ill atwork, to be pneumonia. At p. 1604, he said :</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="91%">        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">                "There is, however, another reason why, in my view the enquiry should be quashed and a further inquiry had. The problemof causation has bedevilled philosophers for centuries and will do so in the future. If a man is knocked down by a car and the injuryto his system is such that it causes heart failure, does he die from injury or from heart failure? If a senile person who has beensinking for weeks slowly into death contracts a terminal pneumonia and that actually carries him off, does he die of senile degenerationor does he die of terminal pneumonia? Without examining such things as precipitating causes, contributing causes, cause sine quanon and all the other elements of causation, suffice it to say that I think where the Coroners Act speaks of the cause of death itmeans the real cause of death, namely, the disease, injury or complication, not the mode of dying as e.g. heart failure, asphyxia,asthenia, etc. In this case, obviously, the pneumonia was not the real cause of death, this was merely a final result operating ona man who was suffering from a bed sore, bladder infection, secondary infection from the bed sore, who was inert, vegetative, andincontinent of urine and faeces. But were these things in him caused by the inhalation of poison gas? They might have been, theymight not. If what really brought him to this pass was "poisoning" and hence caused the death then the poisoning can be fairly saidto be the real cause of death ..... the following observations from Jervis on Coroners, at p. 83, are important : -               <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">                All deaths can in a sense be regarded as natural. This is true in a philosophic sense in that it is part of man'slot to die. It is also true in a medical sense in that in all cases death is brought about by the failure of one or other of man'sorgans. In order, therefore, to distinguish between one sort of death and another it is necessary to consider not the terminal causeof death but the cause which was the real cause of death. Difficult legal and medical questions may be raised in deciding how farback in the chain of causation a coroner should go in considering what was the real cause of death .... It is suggested that in sofar as the terminal cause of death directly and consequentially follows from a definable event the death should be regarded as beingcaused by the definable event.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">                "Other difficulties arise where there are two or more causes to which the death may be due.

Thus a person may be shot and would die in any case from the wound: an operation is performedin an attempt to save his life but the person dies during the operation from shock or haemorrhage. Should the death be regarded asbeing caused by the shot or by the operation? Where the operation was rendered necessary by the wound and was properly performed,the law will hold the cause of death to be the wound and, in appropriate cases, a verdict of murder will result. If an operationis performed on a person suffering from some disease such as cancer and the person dies, it is suggested later that there are argumentsin favour of the same test being applied and that, if the operation is properly performed and is necessary, the death should be regardedas being due to the cancer, the operation being incidental."

Indeed, the Ordinance itself speaks of thecause and not causes. In this case, he said, the effective cause of death was clearly the introduction of nitrogen into the hospital'ssystem and ultimately into Mrs. Boyde. There was no warrant for investigating what might have happened thereafter, only what didhappen.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Just as the problem of causation has bedevilled philosophers, so has the verdict "lack of care" bedevilled lawyers. It appears thatin Hong Kong there are 2 schools of thought amongst coroners - one, that of Mr. Sinclair; the other, that the verdict is restrictedto a death that occurs because of starvation, exposure or similar causes brought about by self-neglect or the failure of other personsproperly to look after the deceased. The former, it is thought, has contributed to the view that a coroner may legitimately evaluateconduct. The verdict was examined with some care by a Divisional Court in <u>R. v. Southwark Coroner, ex party Hicks</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%202%20All%20ER%20140" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 2 All E.R. 140.</a> At p. 144, Croom-Johnson L.J. said :</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">                "Whether such a verdict is either permissible or appropriate depends first on the meaning to be give to the word'care'. The prime meaning is that of physical attention, preventing death from starvation, exposure, or bad nursing or medical care.Since the great extension in this century of the concept of a legal duty of care, breach of which may lead to an action in tort fornegligence, there is now growing up the notion that 'lack of care' means also a breach of such a duty. we have had cited to us arecent case reported in The Times for 19 September 1985. A boy aged 6, a non-swimmer, was taken to the Serpentine lido in Hyde Parkin a party of children. It seems the excursion was not properly supervised. He drowned and his body was recovered under a divingboard. The jury returned a verdict of 'an accident aggravated by lack of care'. In another case reported on 5 July 1985, a drunkenmother slept while her baby was savaged by the family alsatian dog. The jury returned 'lack of care'.....                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">                The history of the verdict 'lack of care' indicates that it is appropriate only to the physical condition of thedeceased as causing the death and should not be used to indicate a breach of duty by some other person. Questions of criminal negligenceamounting to manslaughter were always a different problem, and now that they are out of the way the verdict of 'lack of care' canbe given its original and proper meaning. It should generally be regarded as the other side of the coin to self-neglect, and consequentlywas an inappropriate verdict in the case to which I have referred of the child who drowned in the Serpentine. The verdict in thatcase of 'an accident aggravated by lack of care' was, in any event, illogical. The lack of care in supervising the bathing partymay nave been the cause of the accident, but it did not aggravate anything at all.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">                Junior counsel for the applicant, in his, speech in reply, submitted that the lack of care which could form the basisof the verdict could be a legitimate method used by the jury of expressing a view that there was a culpable breach by someone ofa legal or moral duty to take care of the deceased which would be distinct from the general duty of care on which the modern lawof negligence is based. He listed a number of special relationships where the deceased would be dependent on that other person. Beingin prison was one of them. There is no need to presuppose the existernce of such a range of duties. What the verdict of 'lack ofcare' presupposes is that some other persons had at least the opportunity of rendering care (in the narrow sense of that word) whichwould have prevented the death. There is no need to go beyond that, although in many circumstances such persons would have had aduty, either legal or moral. The opportunity should have been a real opportunity of doing something effective. This verdict shouldnot be used as a means of levelling disguised criticism at people who do not act in an emergency or take a wrong or inadequate decisionin such cases. I doubt if the inaction of the priest and the levite who passed by on the other side would have justified such a verdict,but if one regards the verdict, at its lowest, as reflecting a missed opportuhity, then 'lack of care'  without naming names willnot be in breach of s 4(3) or r 42. it. should not attribute blame or fault..... If the verdict is proper when, the deceased is notgiven enough nourishment by those caring for him it is also proper if the deceased is not given enough medicine. There is no difference.It may be a 'free-standing' verdict, on its own. Self-neglect is, after all, a free standing verdict (see R v Surrey Coroner, exp Campbell  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%202%20All%20ER%20545" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 2 All ER 545</a> at 555, [1982] QB661 at 676-677)..... The word 'how' is wide and it is not possible to foresee every way in which someone may meethis death. Nevertheless, common sense indicates that if the death is caused by accident it it unlikely in the extreme that it willalso have been caused by lack of care. In those cases where it is thought to be a possible verdict or part of a verdict, the juryshould receive a very careful direction as to its meaning and the need for a clear causal connection between the lack of care andthe death.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">In the case of Keith Hicks my conclusion is that if there had been evidence of insufficient medical treatment, a verdict of 'lackof care' might have been possible."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> That case was cited with approval by another Divisional Court in <u>R. v.

If a coroner withdraws from the jury a verdict which should be open to them, he is improperly restricting their answer tothe question, "How?" This would, in our view, be failure to exercise his jurisdiction. Mr. Sedley submits, and we agree, that inthis case the coroner was apparently concerned hot to transgress rule 33 of the Coroners Rules 1953 as amended by the Coroners (Amendment)Rules 1977. That rule now reads:</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <table border="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="11%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="84%" class="quote">'No verdict shall be framed in such a way as to appear to determine any question of - (a) criminal liability on the part of a namedperson, or (b) civil liability.'</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It is immediately apparent that there may, in some cases, be a possibility of conflict between rule 33(b) and the duty under section4 to inquire "how" the deceased came by his death. Mr. Sedley therefore submits that rule 33(b) is ultra vines. This apparent conflictis discussed in a passage in Jervis on Coroners, 9th ed. (1957), p. 179, in a section dealing with the verdicts of 'Self-neglectand lack of care.' The passage reads:</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">'The verdict of lack of care is recommended where a person who, owing to his inability to look after himself, is being cared for byothers, dies and his death is due to starvation or exposure or similar causes brought about by the failure of such other personsto look after him properly. There is an obvious danger that such a verdict will conflict or appear to conflict with rule 33 of theCoroners Rules 1953, which forbids the verdict to appear to determine any question of civil liability. To avoid such conflict theverdict is careful to refrain from stating that the death was aggravated by the lack of care of any particular person or personsand merely states that it was aggravated by lack of care. There is, therefore, no suggestion that any person owed a duty of caretowards the deceased breach of which would render that person liable for civil or criminal negligence.'</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <table border="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="90%" class="quote">                We agree with this comment. A verdict of 'lack of care by another or others' without more is clearly one which ajury is competent to find if the evidence warrants it without transgressing rule 33.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="90%" class="quote">On this issue it seems to us that there may have been a misunderstanding between the coroner and the jury. It appears to have beenthe coroner's view that a verdict of lack of care would inevitably be understood to mean lack of care by the staff of the AshfordRemand Centre. The jury, on the other hand, seem to have been concerned about the lack of facilities and staff at the two hospitalswhich declined to keep, or admit, the deceased. Be that as it may, it is our view that on the facts of this case a verdict of 'lackof care' would not have contravened rule 33. It is therefore not necessary for us to decide whether the rule is ultra vires. But,we think we ought nevertheless to express our conclusion upon this point which is that Mr. Sedley's submission upon it is ill-founded.Such conflict as may in any given circumstance appear to arise between rule 33 and the duty to inquire "how" must be resolved infavour of the statutory duty to inquire whatever the consequences of this may be."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> Accepting the final remarks of Watkins L.J., Mr. Thomas contended that a lack of care verdict is only appropriate where a deceasedhas been deprived of the essentials of life such as food, warmth or medicine. He said that it is the obverse of self-neglect andmight more accurately be termed "want of care". Further, it can be the real cause or an aggravation of the real cause. However, theneglect or want of care must precede the physical condition leading to death. Thus, in the present case, although Dr. Bascombe wasa link albeit unwitting in the chain by which Mrs. Boyde was given nitrogen, anything he did or did not do thereafter did not aggravatecerebral anoxia but only failed to ameliorate it.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> Mr. Thomas also suggested that Watkins L.J. was there equating "circumstances" with facts, from which inferences may be drawn.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> A recent New Zealand case (unreported) bore considerable similarity to this case: <u>Louw v. McLean</u>, High Court of New Zealand, CP. 445/87. An anaesthetist, who thought it probable his conduct was likely to be questioned, asked thecoroner not to admit evidence which tended to discredit him or to establish some form of liability on his part. The coroner declinedto make the orders sought. In dismissing the application for review, Hardie Boys J. said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Nonetheless, for an inquest to have a useful social function it must I think be able to go beyond the mere medical cause of death.I agree with the comment in <u>Halsbury's Laws of England</u> 4th edn vol 9 para 1110, note 1, that the coroner must also investigate "the circumstances surrounding the death". This must necessarilyinvolve in this case not only a determination of the procedures that were employed, but also a determination as to whether the correctprocedures were employed. If the evidence does not enable the Coroner to determine that, then he must not do so. But if it does,then I consider that it is part of his function to do so. This is not necessarily the same thing as allocating blame. That is notthe Coroner's function. There are other means of doing that..... By the same token it would be wrong for the inquest to become acivil or a disciplinary trial. But if in order to ascertain or explain how death occurred, in the wider sense of the events thatwere the real cause, the implicit attribution of blame is unavoidable, then, as the Coroner himself observed, "so be it". This wasthe view taken by Watkins LJ in <u>R v Surrey Coroner, ex parte Campbell</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%202%20All%20ER%20545" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 2 All ER 545</a>, 555, where in discussing a possible conflict between the duty imposed by s. 4 of the Coroners Act 1887 and the Rule</p>        <p class="quote">prohibiting the determination of civil or criminal liability, he said that the conflict "must be resolved in favour of the statutoryduty to inquire whatever the consequences of this may be". As the same learned Judge observed in <u>R v West London Coroner</u>, the difficulty, if there be one, is usually capable of resolution by careful drafting of the finding. And he added:</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">'Interested parties may look at the circumstances of the case and seek to draw from them and the verdict an inference or inferencesas to blameworthiness on someone's part for causing death. That is almost inevitable. It can be neither avoided nor legislated against.So long as on the face of the inquistion the verdict does not give the appearance of identifying by name or otherwise anyone as blameworthyfor the cause of death, r. 42 is complied with.'</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <table border="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="11%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">                A similar kind of discretion is required in controlling the questioning of witnesses.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">                It follows that if, to use the terminology of the prayer for relief in the statement of claim, evidence is adducedthe substantial purpose of which is to discredit the applicant, in the sense of showing that he was at fault, the Coroner will stopit, for the purpose of the inquest is not to discredit or to blame Dr. Louw, but to ascertain how Mrs. Hendrie died. If however evidencedirected to that topic tends to discredit or place blame on the doctor, that cannot be helped. Similarly with cross-examination ofthe doctor himself. Counsel are entitled to discredit him in the sense of showing that his evidence should not be accepted, and theyare entitled to cross-examine him as to the relevant circumstances; but they are not entitled simply to show him to have been atfault. I have no doubt that the Coroner is quite able to deal with these points as they arise, to protect witnesses from unfair publicityby resort to his powers to prohibit publication (s. 16(1)), and to bring down a finding that is in accordance with, and within theconfines of, his statutory function.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">For this reason, and because the Coroner's ruling of 12 November neither contains nor threatens any error of law, and because it isquite impossible for me to foresee what may develop at the resumed hearing, I am satisfied that there are no grounds upon which theapplicant should have relief."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> "Procedures" as used there, said Mr. Thomas, relate to procedures laid down, e.g. the operating instructions of a particular pieceof equipment. It is legitimate to see if they have been followed. That apart, he contended that the judge was there grappling withthe line that a coroner has to draw, and clearly drew it where he himself asks me to draw it.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> For his part, Mr. Whaley said that <u>Louw</u> equally clearly expressed his basic argument: that evidence may be led which may have the effect of indicating blame, provided itis led for the purpose of establishing cause. It is not permissible, he said, to limit the word "procedures" as contended for. Correctprocedures must be determined in order to ascertain whether there was a falling short of proper standards and, if so, whether thatcontributed to death.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> The lack of care verdict, he said, should likewise not be restricted. Nothing in <u>Campoell</u> prevented an evaluation of medical treatment as long as it is causally relevant, while the reference in <u>Hicks</u> to "bad nursing or medical care" put the matter beyond doubt. The principle, he said, is whether the person was responsible for thedeceased's survival.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> I find myself unable to accept this view of the "lack of care" verdict. I accept that the passages from the judgment of Croom JohnsonL.J. in <u>Hicks</u>, which I have set out, are not perhaps as clear as Mr. Thomas suggested. However, the thrust, in my view, is of something fallingfar short of a legal evaluation of conduct. In the same case, Peter Pain J., after agreeing with Croom Johnson L.J., went on at p.149 :</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It seems to me very proper that in such an inquiry the question whether there has been any lack of care should be considered. I reiteratewhat Croom-Johnson LJ has already said, that in this context the inquiry should be whether the prisoner has been properly cared forwhilst in custody. It bears no relation to the question whether there was a duty of care in the Donghue v Stevenson sense(see M'Alisterv Stevenson  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1932%5d%20AC%20562" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1932] AC 562</a>, [1932] All ER Rep I) and whether that duty or care has been breached."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> In my judgment, "lack of care" means conduct on the part of a person who had some responsibility towards the deceased, which causedor contributed to the physical condition bringing about the medical cause of death. That conduct should be judged or evaluated accordingto the standards of the reasonable man, that is to say, the jury, rather than the standards as laid down by experts whose views mayoften be conflicting. In other words, would the members of the jury, having heard what happened, say "We would not have allowed thedeceased to get into that state."</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> In reaching this conclusion, I have been at pains to bear in mind that a lack of care verdict flowing from evaluation of conductmight be permissible if the legislation defining a coroner's jurisdiction warrants such an evaluation. Having found therefore whatconstitutes such a verdict in the light of English authorities based upon English legislative provisions, I must not allow that toaffect my construction of the Hong Kong legislation. If the Hong Kong legislation is of wider ambit, it may admit of a wider lackof care verdict.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Coming to the construction of the Ordinance, I think I can summarise the points made by Mr. Whaley without doing him an injustice:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top">1.</td>            <td width="82%">                S.6 is not ambiguous, as I have already mentioned.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top">2.</td>            <td width="82%">                even if resort must be had to the Rules, they are consistent with a broad interpretation of S.6.               <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top">3.</td>            <td width="82%">                in particular, rule 23 is not concerned with findings or verdict but goes to the heart of what the enquiry is; rule24(1) does not prohibit a wide investigation; rule 30 is to rule out any determining of civil liability when the investigation ofthe facts suggests that a person did not do that which he should or might reasonably be expected to have done.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top">4.</td>            <td width="82%">                public policy expects a full enquiry so as to fulfil an important social need - see The Law Reform Commission ofHong Kong, Report on Coroners, passim.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top">5.</td>            <td width="82%">there are differences between Hong Kong's coronial legislation and that of other jurisdictions.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <div style="margin-left: 4em">        <p style="text-align:center"> </p>    </div>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> As the passage from <u>Campbell</u> shows, a coroner's jurisdiction in England is confined to the matters appearing in Hong Kong Rule 23(a) and (b). The English coroneris not enjoined, like his Hong Kong counterpart, to enquire "into the cause of and the circumstances connected with the death". Norhas he powers to ascertain who, if anyone, should be charged with murder etc, or to make recommendations. He is, on the face of it,far more circumscribed.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> With these points firmly in mind, I am nonetheless satisfied that the legislature did not intend that a coroner should carry outa wide-ranging investigation of 'all aspects' of a death involving, as it often seems to do, a microscopic examination of the conductof a person who may have made a contribution, or been a link in the chain leading, to death. Such an enquiry entails the expenditureof much time and money. I do not think such expenditure of public funds justified when there are so many professional, disciplinaryand watch-dog bodies to follow up any suggestion of improper conduct or matters of public concern that the evidence may produce.And there is certainly no warrant for an individual having to mount an expensive defence of his reputation.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> I find it unrealistic to draw the line where Mr. Whaley asks me to draw it. For all practical purposes, an enquiry conducted as thisone is a trial of the liability of the person or persons under attack in the strict civil sense. Duty of care (usually undisputed,I imagine), breach thereof which involves establishing appropriate standards and whether there has been a falling short of thesestandards, and finally whether any breach caused or contributed to the death, must necessarily be examined. However it is dressedup, such an enquiry is not just an unfortunate overlap into the field of civil liability, it is the same exercise. The only realdifference I can see is that an enquiry, by law, does not after all that name anyone.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> In my judgment, a coroner is charged with finding the effective cause of death. That involves finding the facts - what was done,what was not done and why. Such findings will undoubtedly show a person in a bad light from time to time. No doubt inferences maybe drawn, as watkins L.J. accepted. The coroner must not then go on to evaluate conduct to see if there may have been some contributorycause of the death when the effective cause will usually be plain and obvious.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> Having come to this conclusion, I am satisfied that the lack of care verdict, as I earlier found it to be, is equally applicablein Hong Kong. I venture to suggest it might more appropriately be termed "want of common care".</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> I do not, however, rule out the evaluation of conduct entirely. Clearly it is of crucial importance in relation to the possible criminalcharges. It may also be crucial in determining whether some intervening factor was the effective cause of death - see <u>Malcolm, Inglis</u>. Thus, if Mrs. Boyde had died during the operation from a cause other than that found, it might well have been proper to evaluatethe surgeon's or Dr. Bascombe's counduct.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> In the present case, the coroner did not have the benefit of my view of a lack of care verdict. Had he done so, I have no doubt theenquiry would have taken a very different course. He would have appreciated that the supply of nitrogen effectively led to the anoxia,through no fault of Dr. Bascombe although of course he was a link in the chain of causation. He would have appreciated that therewas no lack of care as I have now defined it. He would largely have confined his investigation to the supply of nitrogen - and indeedhe spent much time on that.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> It is possible, of course, that as the evidence came out the coroner might have felt constrained to investigate Dr. Bascombe's conductmore vigorously. Indeed, in the course of any enquiry the evidence may warrant the investigation of someone hitherto largely uninvolved.If so, the coroner has ample powers to adjourn the enquiry, notify that person (preferably providing details of what is alleged)and resume the enquiry when that person has had a reasonable time to prepare and respond.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> It follows therefore that I think the coroner misdirected himself in dealing with Dr. Bascombe as he did. I do not however proposeto grant the declaration sought. From what has gone before, Dr. Bascombe is vindicated in the approach he adopted before the coronerwhile coroners generally nave, I hope, some guidance as td their jurisdiction for the future. The declaration would be personal toDr. Bascombe and, in the circumstances, would be otiose and academic.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(N.J.
