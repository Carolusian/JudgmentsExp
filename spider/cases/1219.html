The plaintiffâs claim was for lossof use of a piece of land (âthe propertyâ) and for an order for partition or sale of the property.  In addition, the plaintiffclaimed an order for an account and an enquiry into his share of rents and other profits arising from the property.  Unfortunately,the plaintiff died shortly before the trial of the action and the action was ordered to continue with his son as the executor ofhis estate.  The judge ordered that the property should be sold and that a date should be fixed for consequential directions withnotice of the hearing to be served on two brothers of the plaintiff and defendant namely Chan Shu Chun and Chan Shu Nam (âthe twobrothersâ).  The judge also ordered that the plaintiff should receive the sum of $32,000 in damages.  At the conclusion of thehearing of this appeal, this court dismissed the appeal with costs, with reasons to be handed down in writing.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The plaintiffâs case was simple.  It was that he was the holder of a 1/5 interest in the property, the defendant was the holderof 2/5 interest in the property and the two brothers also owned 1/5 each.  It was the plaintiffâs position that he had residedin the property between 1971 and 1991 at which time he was excluded from the property by the defendant and deprived of the use ofit.  In claiming the 1/5 share the plaintiff based his claim on a deed of gift dated 13 October 1981 (the âdeedâ).  The effectof the deed was that the defendant assigned 3/5 of the interest in the property, which was registered in his name, in the proportionof 1/5 to each of the plaintiff and the two brothers, retaining 2/5 of the interest to himself.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The defence was, again, relatively simple.  It was that the defendant himself, whilst he was still under the age of 21, had earnedenough money from farming, namely growing vegetables and rearing pigs and chickens on land which had been loaned to him, to purchasethe property.  Since he was under age, the property was put in the fatherâs name.  When the father died in February 1960, the defendantsucceeded to his father and had the succession to the property registered in his name.  In 1981 the plaintiff and the two brothershad requested the defendant to add their names as registered owners of the property so that they could qualify for compensation ifthe property were resumed by the government.  It was said that the plaintiff and the two brothers represented that they would notclaim any interest in the property.  In consequence, the pleading continued, the plaintiff and the two brothers were trustees holdingtheir interest under the deed as trustees for the defendant.  One of the other matters which the defendant sought to raise was thatthe father had had two other sons (âthe other sonsâ) by his Kit Fat wife.  They had been born earlier than the plaintiff, thedefendant and the two brothers.  The other sons had lived in the United States.  Whether or not they could be located is not entirelyclear although it does seem that one of the other sons had died leaving two of his own sons.</p>    <p class="heading">The judgment below</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The judge considered the defendantâs evidence very carefully.  Over the course of about 10 pages he set out what that evidencewas and in five of those pages proceeded to analyse his findings in respect of it.  He said that the defendant did not impress himas an honest and credible witness.  The judge held that he was evasive when giving evidence about the succession in 1960.  That isnot surprising because the defendant had seemingly represented to the District Officer that he was the sole son of the father.  Thatclearly could not have been so on any footing.  The judge considered the contradictions in the defendantâs evidence.  He consideredin some detail the probability of the defendantâs evidence being true.  He took into consideration such evidence as there was asto the fatherâs means.  Having done that, carefully and fairly, he came to the conclusion in paragraph 50 of the judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âHaving considered the totality of the evidence, I do not consider the Defendant credible.  I reject his evidence.  He has failedto discharge the burden of proving that he provided the funds for the purchase of the Property.  That would be sufficient for meto find for the Plaintiff.  But on the evidence, I am quite prepared to go further to find that it was more likely than not thatthe Property was purchased by the Father with his own money.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  At the trial, the defendant sought an adjournment on the basis that the other sons or their representatives should be joined asparties to the proceedings.  The judge rightly rejected that argument relying, in part, on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352" class="autolink_findacts">Partition Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352">Cap. 352</a> (âthe Ordinanceâ).  In my view the judge was correct in this.  It was open to any party to bring proceedings underthe Ordinance and a defendant was not entitled to object on the basis that other persons should have been joined as parties.  Inmy view the judge correctly rejected the defendantâs argument and also quite rightly refused an adjournment to facilitate an interlocutoryappeal.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The judge went on to consider what order should be made under the Ordinance and correctly assessed the situation on the basis thatthe four headings in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the Ordinance applied and that the property should be sold.  In view of the size of the property namely 13,200 sq. ft. and thelayout thereof, with one house thereon, and the number of persons who had an interest in the property, the judge had no difficultyin coming to the conclusion that the only viable course was to make an order for the sale of the property with a view to a divisionof the proceeds.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The judge then considered shortly the plaintiffâs claim in respect of loss and damage suffered since 31 December 1999.  Againhe had no difficulty in holding in the plaintiffâs favour.  The defence which was run was that since the plaintiffâs claim wasbased on his eviction in 1991 his claim was statute barred.  As the judge pointed out, the deprivation by the defendant of the rightof entry to the plaintiff was a continuing tort and since the writ was issued in January 2002 there was no difficulty in the plaintiffclaiming loss and damage suffered over the two years prior to the issue of the writ.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Since the plaintiff had in 2000 commenced proceedings against the defendant in the Small Claims Tribunal to recover rent receivedfrom letting the property as a coach park and the Small Claims Tribunal was thus seized of that matter, the judge declined to makean order for an account or enquiry in that respect.</p>    <p class="heading">This appeal</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On this appeal Mr Siu sought to reiterate the point which he had failed upon in the court below namely that the plaintiffâs evidencewas that as of 1960 there were six claimants to the land (namely the plaintiff, the defendant, the two brothers and the other sons)and that the plaintiffâs pleading contradicted that by reason of his claim to 1/5 interest.  As the judge said, the plaintiffâsclaim rests entirely upon the deed.  It is unnecessary to consider why the deed was executed if the plaintiff were content to claimsimply under the deed.  The only defence to that was that the plaintiff owned his interest given to him under the deed in trust forthe defendant.  That was rejected.  Thus the defence failed.  The plaintiff was therefore entitled to an order under the Ordinancefor sale of the property.  The proceeds will be divided, as between the plaintiff and the defendant, on the basis that the plaintiffis entitled to 1/5 of the proceeds and the defendant is entitled to 2/5.  If the other sons seek to join in the proceedings whetherat the instigation of the defendant or otherwise, they may well be entitled to make a claim against the plaintiff and the defendantfor part of the proceeds.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Mr Siu attempted to suggest that the judgeâs assessment of the defendantâs evidence was unsafe.  In my view nothing he saidcame anywhere near to suggesting that the judgeâs assessment of the defendantâs evidence was anything other than correct.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In respect of the claim for damages Mr Siu sought to argue that the plaintiff had not established that he had been deprived of accessto the property in the period after 31 December 1999.  In view of the way these proceedings have continued, the defendantâs actionin renting out the property and in defending the claim on the basis that he was the sole owner of the property, such an argumentis futile.  The defendant clearly kept the plaintiff out of the property and he continued to do so.  Having done so his subsequentactions were consistent in his continuing to do so.  It is not the law that once deprived of access to property to which one shouldbe entitled a plaintiff has to seek entry on a continuous or repetitive basis, if, in the circumstances, that would be to no avail.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In my view there was no merit in this appeal and it fell to be dismissed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Le Pichon JA:</b></p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Sakhrani J:</b></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  I also agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align: center">(Anthony Rogers)<br />            <span>Vice-President</span></td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align: center"><span>(Doreen Le Pichon)<br />            Justice of Appeal</span></td>            <td width="34%" valign="top" style="text-align: center"><span>(Arjan H Sakhrani)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance</span></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Kenneth YF Wong, instructed by Messrs Wong, Hui &amp; Co., for the Plaintiff/Respondent</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Stanley CK Siu, instructed by Messrs Christopher Li &amp; Co., for the Defendant/Appellant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p style="text-align: left"> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2006/386.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
