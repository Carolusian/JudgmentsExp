The Judge found that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was in breach of an agreement to sell the shares to the plaintiff and also in breach of the trust in favour of the plaintiffin respect of the shares when they were wrongfully disposed of by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was a nominee or conduit of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for the receipt and transfer of the proceeds of sale of the shares in FCL.  Based on the plaintiffâs election to proceedwith proprietary remedy, the Judge ordered, amongst other things, an account and tracing inquiry in respect of the shares and theirproceeds of sale.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The defendants now appeal against the judgment.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Facts</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The plaintiff is a company incorporated in Macau and is under the control of Mr. Ngan In Leng (é¡å»¶é½¡) (âMr. Nganâ).</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The defendants are companies incorporated in Hong Kong.  They are âwindow companiesâ of the Fujian Provincial Peopleâs Governmentof China.  This means in practical terms the Fujian Government controls the defendants.  The directors of the defendants are employeesof the Fujian Government and the shares of the defendants are held on trust for the Fujian Government.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In 1991, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant set up Castech-Phoenix as a joint venture with the Fujian Research Institute of Material Structures of the Academy of Science(âFRIMSâ) for the production of non-linear crystals.  Castech-Phoenix was a Mainland company.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Following disputes with FRIMS, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant bought out FRIMSâs shares in Castech-Phoenix and terminated the joint venture agreement in January 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Subsequent to this, Castech-Phoenix changed its name to FCL.

Mr. Ngan who had close contacts with the Fujian government was approached in 1996.  Mr.Ngan had business dealings with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant since 1990.  He was regarded by the Fujian government as a âpatriotic Chineseâ.  He was a member of the National Committeeof the Chinese Peopleâs Political Consultative Conference (ä¸­åäººæ°æ¿æ²»ååæè­°å¨åå§å¡æå§å¡) and a member ofthe Standing Committee of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peopleâs Political Consultative Conference (ç¦å»ºçäººæ°æ¿æ²»ååæè­°å¸¸åå§å¡æå§å¡).</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The agreements</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Eventually the parties entered into four agreements, namely,</p>	<blockquote>		<p>1) The Hang Wo Agreement</p>		<p>2) The COM Agreement</p>		<p>3) The First Laser Agreement</p>		<p>4) The COM/Casix/Kexin Agreement (the âFCOâ) Agreement.</p>	</blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  This is what the Judge found in respect of the four agreements :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â <i>The Hang Wo Agreement</i></p>        <p class="quote">25. The first agreement between the two camps was entered into between the 1<sup>st</sup>Defendant and Hang Wo [Hang Wo Properties Investment and Management Company Limited, a company controlled by Mr. Ngan] (âHang WoAgreementâ) dated 12 December 1996.  In the preamble, it was stated that the parties would make use of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs optronic technology (é«ç§æåé»å­ç¢æ¥­) and to jointly invest US$20 million in a Macanese company to be incorporatedand called COM [<i>Casix Optronic Manufacturing Limited</i> (å®æåé»ä¼æ¥­è£½é æéå¬å¸] for the purpose of producing crystals.  The parties agreed as follows :</p>        <p class="quote">(1) the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would transfer 100% shareholding in FCL and FCO to COM and the shares of COM would be held by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and Hang Wo in the ratio of 49:51 (clause 1);</p>        <p class="quote">(2) Hang Wo would purchase 51% of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs shareholding in FCL and FCO by cash (clause 2);</p>        <p class="quote">(3) Hang Wo would be solely responsible for contributing to the initial capital of COM in the amount of US$10 million (clause 3);and</p>        <p class="quote">(4) the parties understood that certain legal formalities were required for the transfer of the shares in FCL and FCO to COM, hence,in the meantime, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs shares in COM would be held by Jenwing, a British Virgin Islands incorporation, on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and would be transferred to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant when its shares in FCL and FCO were transferred to COM (clause 4).</p>        <p class="quote"><i>The COM Agreement</i></p>        <p class="quote">26. The two camps also entered into a second agreement of the same date (âCOM Agreementâ).  The parties to the agreement werethe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and COM.   The preamble stated that COM was to acquire the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs shareholding in FCL and FCO.  The parties agreed, <i>inter alia</i>, that :</p>        <p class="quote">(1) the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would sell all its shares in FCL and FCO to COM at the valuation of US$6.25 million (clause 1);</p>        <p class="quote">(2) COM would pay the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant US$3.125 million within one month of execution of the agreement and the balance within three months (clause 5); and</p>        <p class="quote">(3) the parties would immediately set up a working party to deal with the necessary procedures and instruct lawyers to handle theshare transfer in the PRC (clause 6).</p>        <p class="quote">The agreement expressly stated that it was executed on 12 December 1996 in Hong Kong.</p>        <p class="quote"><i>The First Laser Agreement</i></p>        <p class="quote">27. Then the two camps entered into yet a third agreement dated 28 December 1996 (âFirst Laser Agreementâ).  The parties to thisagreement were the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and the Plaintiff [a company controlled by Mr. Ngan].  This is the latest agreement in the series and the one relied onby the Plaintiff as the basis of this action.  The agreement was vague as to the subject matter.  As a result, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant raises a defence of uncertainty of the subject matter.  The preamble of the agreement states that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant agreed to sell to the Plaintiff 51% its investment in the optronic project in Fuzhou (ç¦å·ææè³çåé»å­é ç®ä¸­ç51%çè¡æ¬). The parties agreed, <i>inter alia</i>, that :</p>        <p class="quote">(1)    upon completion of the share transfer, the ratio of the shareholding of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and the Plaintiff would be 49:51 (clause 1);</p>        <p class="quote">(2)    the net asset value of the project to be sold was agreed to be US$6.25 million, hence, the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>Defendant would sell 51% of its shareholding to the Plaintiff for US$3.1875 million (equivalent to HK$24.64 million) (clause 2);</p>        <p class="quote">(3)    upon admission of the Plaintiff into the business, the boards of directors of FCO and FCL would be reorganized, the compositionof the new boards would be subject to consultation (clause 3);</p>        <p class="quote">(4)    the Plaintiff would pay the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant HK$10 million within ten days of execution of the agreement and the balance by two instalments within three months (clause7); and</p>        <p class="quote">(5)    both parties would form a working party as soon as possible for the purpose of liaison and handling the related matters andwould instruct lawyers in the PRC to handle matters relating to the change in ownership of the relevant companies (clause 8).</p>        <p class="quote">The agreement stated that it was executed on 28 December 1996 in Hong Kong.</p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">The COM/Casix/Kexin Agreement</p>        <p class="quote">30. In addition to the three agreements, COM and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs subsidiaries, namely Casix Limited and Fujian Kexin, also executed another agreement, i.e. the COM/Casix/Kexin Agreementdated 12 December 1996 solely in relation to the transfer or the sale and purchase of the shares in FCO.  There are three differentversions of this agreement, one produced by the Plaintiff and two produced by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâ¦â¦ In the Plaintiffâs version, Fujian Kexin and Casix Limited agreed to transfer their capital investment respectivelyin the sum of US$63,000 and US$1,447,000 in FCO to COM and COM agreed to accept the transfer of the investment in the total amountof US$1,510,000 and thereafter to assume all the rights and liabilities of Fujian Kexin and Casix Limited in respect of FCO.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Judge found that the First Laser Agreement superseded the two earlier agreements.  He further accepted the plaintiffâs versionof the COM/Casix/Kexin Agreement and found that the COM/Casix/Kexin Agreement did not represent the whole of the partiesâ agreementunder the joint venture but was a document generated solely for producing to the PRC authorities for the purpose of obtaining approvalfor the transfer of the FCO shares to COM pursuant to the First Laser Agreement.  He held that the COM/Casix/Kexin Agreement wasnot a genuine agreement supported by any underlying transaction.  It did not have the effect of replacing or superseding any of thethree agreements, particularly the First Laser Agreement which was executed subsequent to it.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Judge specifically rejected the defendantsâ case that there was no sale of FCL and the only agreement between the partieswas for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs subsidiary to sell FCO.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Payment of purchase price</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The Judge found that pursuant to the First Laser Agreement the plaintiff paid HK$20 million to the 1<sup>st</sup>defendant on 31 December 1996 and 30 April 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The Judge further found that according to a Memorandum dated 13 March 1998 (â1998 Memorandumâ) the plaintiff had pursuant tothe First Laser Agreement further paid another sum of HK$4.64 million by treating a capital investment in the sum of HK$4.64 millionmade by the plaintiff in COM as investment by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The Judge further found that the consideration for the full purchase price for 51% of the shares in FCL and FCO were fully paidby the plaintiff in accordance with the terms of the First Laser Agreement.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The shareholders of COM</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Hang Wo and Jenwing Holdings Limited (âJenwingâ) are the sole registered shareholders of COM.  Jenwing is a BVI company, theshares in Jenwing were held on trust by Mr. Nganâs camp for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Transfer of the shares in FCO</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  On 30 December 1996, i.e. one day prior to the payment of the first sum of HK$10 million to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant due under the First Laser Agreement, the board of directors of FCO passed a resolution consenting to the transfer of allthe shares in FCO to COM in accordance with the wishes of its shareholders, Casix Limited and Fujian Kenxin.

Apart from the absence of a board of directorsmeeting approving the transfer, it appears that the transfer was not carried out because governmental approval for the transfer wouldnot be granted as the share capital of FCL had not been fully paid up.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The 1998 Memorandum</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The Judge referred to the 1998 Memorandum which explained why the shares in FCL were not transferred to COM.  The documents acknowledged:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â (1) that for some historical reasons, such as the fact that US$2.5 million of the registered capital of US$7 million had not yetbeen injected into FCL and that there were some outstanding legal disputes relating to FCO, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was still temporarily wholly holding FCL while COM was still temporarily wholly holding FCO; when the above problems wereresolved, the Plaintiffâs and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs shareholding in COM and FCL would be regularised (çé è¡æ¬éä¿) in the ratio of 51:49 (paragraph 1);</p>        <p class="quote">(2) that prior to the said regularisation, COMâs and FCLâs investments and rights in respect of FCL, COM and FCO shall be governedby the agreements of 1996 (paragraph 2); and</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  that as the Plaintiff incurred significant costs in setting up COM and as the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would hold 49% of the shares in COM upon the said regularisation, the outstanding payment in the amount of HK$4.64 milliondue from the Plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant under the First Laser Agreement was treated as having been paid by the plaintiff and representing the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs capital contribution to COM (paragraph 3).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Management of FCO and FCL</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  On 10 May 1997, the Mainland State Administration of Industry and Commerce issued a business licence to FCO with Mr. Ngan as thechairman of its board of directors and Wang Hongrui (çæ´ªç) as its general manager.

This meeting was stated to bethe first board of directors meeting of COM and not of FCL. On 20 January 1997, COM issued a notice appointing Mr. Ngan, Miss Nganand Wang Hongrui as directors of FCL.  The appointments were invalid.  However, the meeting was attended by Mr. Kong Fanli (å­å¡ç«)and Wang Hongrui on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and Mr. Ngan, Miss Ngan and Mr. Huang Xiaodong (é»ææ±) on behalf of Mr. Nganâs camp.  It, nevertheless, shows recognitionby those who had control of FCL that Mr. Nganâs camp had beneficial interest in the shares in FCL. </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The Judge found that since 31 December 1996 when the first sum of HK$10 million was paid, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, FCL and FCO treated Mr. Nganâs camp as a shareholder of FCL and FCO and Mr. Ngan and Miss Ngan participated in the managementof FCL and FCO as de facto directors.  Decisions regarding the operation of FCL and FCO were referred to Mr. Ngan and Mr. Kong forapproval.  Financial statements of FCL and FCO, requests for increase in staff remuneration of FCL and FCO requests for purchaseof staff quarters for FCO and FCL, reports on construction of a building complex for FCL, requests for payment of construction costsof the complex, requests for funds for setting up a branch office of FCL and recommendation of a bonus share scheme for the staffof FCL were referred to both Mr. Kong and Mr. Ngan for consideration and approval.  There was participation by Mr. Ngan in the managementand important decision making of FCL and FCO.  In a report to the Fujian Provincial Peopleâs Government dated 5 June 1997, the1<sup>st</sup> defendant acknowledged that Mr. Ngan had 51% interest in the joint venture.</p>        <p class="heading"><b><u>Investment of Mr. Ngan</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  FCL has a subsidiary called Casix Inc in the USA which required funds to produce a special optical fiber instrument (âthe projectâ).

The second issue arises because of the foreign elements in this case and the Hong Kong Court needs to findout what is the applicable law to resolve the dispute.  This is by way of application of the rules in private international law orwhat is commonly known as conflict of laws rules.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The Supreme Peopleâs Court relied on Article 145Sections 1 and 2 of ã<i>ä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååæ°æ³éå</i>ã(â<i>Peopleâs Republic of China Minfatongze</i>â), which is a statute on the general principles of civil law.  The sections provide that the parties to a contract involving foreigninterests can choose the law applicable to the contract disputes, unless prescribed by the law; if the parties have not chosen theapplicable law, then the applicable law is that of the country which has the closest connection to the contract.  The Supreme PeopleâsCourt also referred to the principle of closest connection in private international law.  It held that Mainland law was the applicablelaw to resolve the contractual dispute.  It held that the three relevant contracts were invalid by reason of the absence of approvalbeing given by the relevant authority. </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The defendants argued that the Supreme Peopleâs Court had decided on the following two issues and based on the principle of issueestoppel, the decision of these two issues are binding on the Hong Kong Court : first, the applicable law governing the dispute ofthe parties was Mainland law, and, second, the contracts were invalid.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The Judge rejected the defendantsâ argument.</p>        <p class="heading"><b><u>Binding effect of a foreign judgment</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The binding effect of a foreign judgment is stated by <i>Dicey</i>, <i>Morris &amp; Collins</i>, <i>The Conflict of Laws</i>(â<i>Dicey</i>â) (14<sup>th</sup> Ed) at Rule 41 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA foreign judgment which is final and conclusive on the merits and not impeachable under any of rules 42 to 45 is conclusive asto any matter thereby adjudicated upon, and cannot be impeached for any error either of fact or of law.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  <i>Dicey</i>, (14<sup>th</sup> Ed) at page 618 further stated</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âClosely parallel to this rule is the rule that the party must take all available defences in the foreign court, and that if hedoes not do so, he cannot be allowed to rely on them subsequently in the domestic court.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Rationale of the rule</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The rationale of the rule is two-fold, first, public policy : it is in the interest of the public that there should be an end oflitigation and second, hardship on the individual in that he should not be vexed twice for the same cause (<i>Lockyer v.

The judgment of the Supreme Peopleâs Courtwas clear as to the two issues that it had decided and clearly the action before the Supreme Peopleâs Court was not a trivial case. The judgment addressed the core issues between the parties, namely, the validity of the agreements and the applicable law.</p>    <p>44.2)        Notwithstanding the majority decision of this Court (Cheung, Yuen JJA and Chung J) in<i>æç¥æ¦®èæçç¾¤</i>(<i>Lee Yau Wing v. Lee Shui Kwan</i>)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%202%20HKLRD%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 2 HKLRD 749</a> that because of the âtrial supervision systemâ under Mainland law (which entitles the Supreme Peopleâs Procuratorate to applyto the Mainland Courts for a re-trial of an action), the judgment of the Mainland Courts may not be âfinal and conclusiveâ, theplaintiff in the present case did not challenge the final and conclusive nature of the judgment of the Supreme Peopleâs Court.</p>    <p>44.3)        Before the Supreme Peopleâs Court, the plaintiff accepted that the applicable law was Mainland law.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The Judgeâs reasons</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The Judge held that the Supreme Peopleâs Courtâs judgment did not result in issue estoppel being applied in the present casebecause the issues decided in the two sets of actions were different.  He agreed with the plaintiffâs argument that the issuesbefore the Supreme Peopleâs Court were the transfer of shares in a legal person in the Mainland, the validity of the three agreementsand the 1998 Memorandum under the laws of the Mainland and the remedy that was sought was a declaration that the three agreementsand the 1998 Memorandum were of no effect; whereas the issues in the present case are the validity of the three agreements, breachof contract and breach of trust under Hong Kong law.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  In this Court, the plaintiff further argued that issue estoppel is not engaged because the Mainland judgment on the applicable lawwas a decision on procedure and not substance.  This argument proceeded on the decision by the Judge that ascertaining the applicablelaw (<i>lex causae</i>) is a matter of procedure for the Court which tries the case and is to be ascertained according to the domestic law of the forum(<i>lex fori</i>).</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>My view on issue estoppel</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  In my view the Judge was incorrect in holding that issue estoppel does not apply.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> 1) I accept that on the contract issue, the Supreme Peopleâs Court was concerned solely with the question of invalidity of theagreements and not with the consequence of them being invalid.  However, the issue of invalidity of the agreements must clearly bea common issue in both proceedings.  The issue of applicable law is a common issue as well. </p>    <p>48.2) Further it is not permissible to avoid the consequence of issue estoppel by re-characterizing the issue as one which is soughtto be litigated in accordance with the law of a different jurisdiction : see <i>The Sennar (No. 2)</i>(Court of Appeal) [1984] 2 Lloydâs Rep 142 at 149 per Kerr LJ :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â I do not think that it is open to GfG to say simply, in effect: âWhat we seek to litigate here are issues under English law,and it does not matter that we litigated precisely the same issues under other systems of law in Holland.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>48.3) See also <i>Armacel Property Limited v.

Looking at the matter negatively a decision on procedure alone is not a decisionon the merits. Looking at the matter positively a decision on the merits is a decision which establishes certain facts as provedor not in dispute; states what are the relevant principles of law applicable to such facts; and expresses a conclusion with regardto the effect of applying those principles to the factual situation concerned.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>48.6) The Supreme Peopleâs Courtâs decision that Mainland law was the applicable law was a decision on the merits which clearlyaffected the substantive rights of the parties.</p>    <p>48.7) In any event even according to the case of <i>Desert Sun Loan Corp v Hill</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20All%20ER%20847" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2 All ER 847</a> cited by counsel for the plaintiff, Mr. Chan Chi Hung SC and Mr. Jeremy Chan, where the Court recognized the issue estoppel rule(which is defined in terms of a final judgment on the merits) cannot apply when there is no more than âan interlocutory decisionon a procedural and non substantive issueâ, it had also at the same time decided that issue estoppel applies to an interlocutoryjudgment on procedure when there is an express submission to the procedural or jurisdictional issue to the foreign court.  EvansLJ at 858 stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â          On balance, and regarding the question entirely as one of principle, I would be prepared to hold that an issue estoppelcould arise from an interlocutory judgment of a foreign court on a procedural, ie non-substantive, issue, where the following conditionswere fulfilled: (1) <b><u>there was express submission of the procedural or jurisdictional issue to the foreign court</u></b>; (2) the specific issue of fact was raised before and decided by the court; and (3) the need for âcautionâ recognised by LordReid in <i>Carl-Zeiss</i> is carefully borne in mind.â  (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>48.8) In the present case, as pointed out earlier, the plaintiff had also expressly accepted before the Supreme Peopleâs Court thatthe applicable law was Mainland law.  In other words there was an express submission by the plaintiff of the procedural or jurisdictionalissue to the Supreme Peopleâs Court.  Issue etoppel is therefore engaged.</p>    <p>48.9) The case of <i>Baker and others v. Ian McCall International Limited</i> (Toulson J 22/9/99) which followed <i>Desert Sun</i> does not advance the matter further. Likewise for the case of <i>Charles M Willie &amp; Company (Shipping) Ltd v Ocean Laser Shipping Ltd; G Roussos Sons SA and another v Charles M Willie &amp; Company(Shipping) Ltd (The âSmaroâ)</i> 29 October 1998.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>(II)</b>  <b><u>If there is no issue estoppel, what is the applicable law?</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  This action involves foreign elements and it is necessary to decide what system of law is to be applied.  The Judge having rejectedthe defence of issue estoppel, went on to hold that the applicable law is Hong Kong law.  It is common ground that the applicableprinciples are the three stage approach stated by Staughton LJ in <i>Macmillan Inc v. Bishopgate Trust</i> (No. 3)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20WLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 WLR 387</a> at 391 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â First, it is necessary to characterise the issue that is before the court.

Thus theformal validity of a marriage is to be determined, for the most part, by the law of the place where it is celebrated; intestate successionto moveables, by the law of the place where the deceased was domiciled when he died; and the interpretation of a contract, by whatis described as its proper law.</p>        <p>Thirdly, it is necessary to identify the system of law which is tied by the connecting factor found in stage two to the issue characterisedin stage one.

Thepresent dispute is not on the form of the contract or formal validity but on its material validity which is to be governed by theproper law of the contract.  </p>    	<p>2)   In considering the issue of the proper law of the contract, European countries have adopted a uniform conflict rules known asthe <i>EEC Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations</i> (âthe <i>Rome Convention</i>â).  The <i>Rome Convention</i> contained presumptions in ascertaining the proper law of the contract such as the presumption of characteristic performance and thepresumption that the contract is most closely connected with the principal place of business of the party who is to effect the characteristicperformance.  These presumptions are not available under common law.  In considering the English textbooks on this topic, one mustbear in mind that England has incorporated the <i>Rome Convention</i> as part of its domestic law (subject to two reservations) in 1990.  The new law applies to contracts made after 1 April 1991 (see<i>Dicey</i>, (14<sup>th</sup> Ed) (537)).

He attempts to ascertain not the (non-existent) âintentionâ of the parties themselves, but âhow a just and reasonable personwould have regarded the problemâ, what intention âordinary, reasonable and sensible businessmen would have been likely to havehad if their minds had been directed to the questionâ, and to the contingencies of which the judge is, but the parties may nothave been, aware : <i>Dicey</i>, (11<sup>th</sup> Ed) page 1191-1192.</p>    <p>58.4) The line between the search for the inferred intention and the search for the system of law with which the contract has itsclosest and most real connection is a fine one which is frequently blurred.  In theory, in the absence of an express choice as thefirst test, the court should consider as a second test whether there are any other indications of the partiesâ intention, and onlyif there is no such indication to go on to consider the third stage, namely with what system of law the contract has its closestand most real connection.  But in practice the same result can be reached by the application of the second or third tests, and frequentlythe courts move straight from the first stage to the third stage.  This is largely because the tests of inferred intention and closeconnection merged into each other, and because before the objective close connection test became fully established the test of inferredintention was in truth an objective test designed not to elicit actual intention but to impute an intention which had not been formed: <i>Dicey</i>, (11<sup>th</sup> Ed) page 1162-1163.</p>    <p>58.5) In ascertaining the proper law of contract, the Court does not exercise a discretion but makes a finding of fact from the relevantcircumstances about the intention of the parties or the system where the contract has it closest and most real connection.

Ngan is a Macanese. The Plaintiff, COM and Hang Wo are companies incorporated in Macau. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is a window company of the PRC. It was incorporated in Hong Kong and has its principal place of business and central administrationin Hong Kong. Against this background, the fact that the three agreements, in particular the First Laser Agreement, were all enteredinto in Hong Kong points to a Hong Kong connection.</p>        <p class="quote">77. The Plaintiffâs obligation was to pay for the shares and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs obligation was to transfer 51% of the shares in FCL and FCO to Nganâs camp.  Payment of money is not the characteristicperformance of the agreement and not indicative of any connection to any jurisdiction.  However, the price was stated in US dollarsbut paid in Hong Kong currency.  Two significant sums of HK$10 million were received and acknowledged by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in Hong Kong.  The balance of the purchase price of HK$4.64 million was acknowledged as having been received by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant under the 1998 Memorandum issued from its Hong Kong office.  Those facts are mildly indicative of a Hong Kong connectionand are more consistent with a Hong Kong connection than with a PRC connection.</p>                <p class="quote">78. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs obligation was to transfer the shares in FCO and FCL to Nganâs camp.  This was the consideration moving from the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to the Plaintiff under the three agreements and for which the Plaintiffs payment of HK$24.64 million was due.  This wasthe essence of the transaction if not the characteristic performance of the transaction.  This performance was to be effected inthe PRC.  Under the three agreements, the parties agreed that they would instruct PRC lawyers to handle the share transfer in thePRC.  Under common law, this points strongly to a PRC connection.</p>        <p class="quote">79. However, on the other hand, this essence of the transaction was to be performed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, which is a company incorporated in Hong Kong and having its registered office and central administration in Hong Kong. The directors and shareholders of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant are in Hong Kong and had Hong Kong addresses.  Not only that, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant conducts its business from its office in Shun Tak Centre in Hong Kong.  All the correspondences in relation to this jointventure or the three agreements were emanated from its office in Hong Kong.  Though the Plaintiff may not rely on the presumptionsunder the Rome Convention, these are facts on which an inference of Hong Kong connection can be drawn.  This inference offsets, ifnot outweighs, the inference to be drawn from the fact that performance of the First Laser Agreement was to be effected in the PRC.â</p>    </blockquote>        <p class="heading"><b><u>Misdirections</u></b></p>    <p>58.8) In my view there are misdirections in the decisions.</p>    <p>58.9) The Judge had correctly identified that the Mainland being the place of performance of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs obligation to transfer the shares in FCO and FCL to Mr. Nganâs camp pointed strongly to a Mainland connection.  Thisview is clearly supported by authorities such as <i>Benaim &amp; Co v. L. S.

If there was no single country where the partiesboth carried on business or if there was some good reason for thinking that the law of such a country was not impliedly intendedto be the proper law, <b><u>the law of any country where all, or a significant portion, of the obligations</u></b> <u><b>imposed by the contract, were to be performed had a claim to be the proper law.</b></u>â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>58.10) As explained by Lord Esher MR in <i>Chatenay v. Brazilian Submarine Telegraph Company</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281890%29%201%20QB%2079" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1890) 1 QB 79</a> at 83, the rationale of this factor is that if a contract is made in one country to be carried out between the parties in anothercountry, either in whole or in part, unless there appears something to the contrary, it is to be concluded that the parties musthave intended that it should be carried out according to the law of that other country.  Otherwise a very strange state of thingswould arise, for it is hardly conceivable that persons should enter into a contract to be carried out in a country contrary to thelaws of that country.  <i>Goode on Commercial Law</i>,page 925 thus stated :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Nevertheless, certain factors do tend to be given particular weight relative to others. <b><u>The place of intended performance of the contract (<i>lex loci solutionis</i>) is obviously of major importance, for the ability to perform a contract within a given State largely depends on the willingnessof the law of that State to accommodate such performance, so that the <i>lex loci solutionis</i> prima facie has a close connection with the contract</u></b>.â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>58.11) The Judge, however, then lessened or diluted the importance of this factor by saying that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who was to perform this essential part of the obligation in the Mainland was a resident of Hong Kong.  This is wrong fortwo reasons :</p>	<blockquote>		<p>(1) First, the Judge had already at the beginning of the analysis taken into account the fact that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was incorporated in Hong Kong and has its principal place of business and central administration in Hong Kong.  By referringto the residence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant again, it gives the impression that he was considering this factor twice.</p>    	<p>(2) Second, not only was he considering this factor twice, he had attached undue weight to this factor.  The Judge held that althoughthe plaintiff may not rely on the presumptions under the <i>Rome Convention</i>, he further said that these are facts on which an inference of Hong Kong connection can be drawn.  He said at paragraph 75 of thejudgment :</p>			<blockquote>	        <p class="quote">ââ¦it should be noted that under the Rome Convention there are certain presumptions, such as presumption of characteristic performanceand presumption that the contract is most closely connected with the principal place of business of the party who is to effect thecharacteristic performance. <b><u>While those presumptions are not available under the common law, inferences as to connection may nevertheless be drawn from thosefactors. It is just a question of weight.</u></b>â (emphasis added)</p>	    </blockquote>	</blockquote>        <p>58.12) The relevant presumption is Article 4 of the <i>Rome Convention</i> which <i>Dicey</i> (14<sup>th</sup> Ed) dealt with in Rule 204(3) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â (3) It will be presumed that the contract is most closely connected with the country where the party who is to effect the performancewhich is characteristic of the contract has, at the time of conclusion of the contract, his habitual residence, or, in the case ofa body corporate or unincorporate, its central administration. If the contract is entered into in the course of the trade or professionof the party who is to effect the performance which is characteristic of the contract, the country with which the contract will bepresumed to be most closely connected will be the country in which the principal place of business of that party is situated, orwhere, under the terms of the contract the performance is to be effected through a place of business other than the principal placeof business, the country in which that other place of business is situated.â</p>    </blockquote>    	<p>58.13) <i>Dicey</i>, (14<sup>th</sup> Ed) observed at paragraph 32â113 that</p>	    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The innovative aspect of Art.4 is the use of <b><u>a presumption based on the place of residence or business of the person effecting the performance which is characteristic of the contract</u></b>. It is important to note that the presumption leads not to the <i>place</i> of characteristic performance, but to the residence, or central administration, or principal place of business, or other place ofbusiness (as the case may be) of the <i>party</i> who is to effect the characteristic performance.â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>58.14) This presumption, however, proceeds on the basis that the place of performance of the obligation is also the same as the placeof residence of the performer.  As explained by <i>Dicey</i> (14<sup>th</sup> Ed) at paragraph 32â118 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â <b><u>In practice the place of performance and the place of residence or business will often (but not necessarily) be the same, becausemost contracts are performed in the country of the partyâs place of business</u></b>. The contract is presumed to be most closely connected with the country of the residence of the individual, or (in the case of acompany or partnership) the country of its central administration.â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>58.15) However, Article 4(5) also provides that, among other things, this presumption can be disregarded if it appears from the circumstancesas a whole that the contract is more closely connected with another country.  This is stated in Rule 204(4) of <i>Dicey</i> (14<sup>th</sup> Ed) which provides that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â (4) the presumptions in clause (3) will not apply if the characteristic performance cannot be determined, and will be disregardedif it appears from the circumstances as a whole that the contract is more closely connected with another country.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>58.16) It is clear that one situation where this presumption is to be discarded is where the place of performance differs from theplace of business or place of residence of the party whose performance is characteristic of the contract.  Hence <i>Dicey</i>, (14<sup>th</sup> Ed) at paragraph 32â127 stated that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Inevitably the solution of individual cases will depend on the facts, but in principle it is submitted that <b><u>the presumption may most easily be rebutted in those cases where the place of performance differs from the place of business of theparty whose performance is characteristic of the contract</u></b>. It has already been seen that the presumption is designed to lead to the country of the residence or place of business of the partywhose performance is characteristic, and that usually that country will coincide with the place of performance, because normallycontracts are performed in the country of that partyâs place of business. <b><u>The situations in which they are performed elsewhere may (but by no means inevitably) provide material to rebut the presumption.</u></b>â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>58.17) Footnote 23 to the first passage of paragraph 32â127, stated that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â This passage was approved in <i>Bank of Baroda v Vysya Bank Ltd</i> [1994] 2 Lloydâs Rep. 87, 93.

(Comm.) 325.â</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p>58.18) When the Judge said that instead of relying on the presumption, he could draw inference from the facts which underlines thepresumption, he must have attached importance to such facts.  In my view, before he was able to do so the Judge also ought to haverecognized the situation where the presumption is to be disregarded.  Such a recognition is particularly important in this case becausethe place of business or residence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant which was Hong Kong, was different from the place of performance of the characteristic obligation i.e. the transfer ofthe FCL shares which was to be performed in the Mainland.  This difference will cause the presumption to be replaced.  What the Judgehad done was to draw inference from facts, which, in the absence of the presumption, do not lay claim to the proper law of the contract. In so doing he must have attached wrong or undue weight to the place of residence of the 1<sup>st </sup>defendant i.e. Hong Kong.  This is because, as said earlier, where the parties to the contract had their place of business in thesame country this can be regarded as a strong factor, the same cannot be said when they reside in different places.  In such a situation,under common law,<b>the law of a country, where all, or a significant portion, of the obligations imposed by the contract,</b> <b>are to be performed has</b> <b>a claim to be the proper law</b>.  In the present case such law is the Mainland law.  The strength of this connection is not answered by the plaintiffâs contentionthat there are also authorities which attached importance to the place of residence of the parties.</p>    <p>58.19) The Judgeâs reference to the correspondence being issued from Hong Kong infringes the rule that conduct subsequent to theentering of the contract cannot be taken into account. </p>    <p>58.20) The place of performance of the agreement was the transfer of shares of a Mainland company; the shares were âstate assetsâbelonging to the window company of a Mainland provincial government; the transfer of which would require approval of the Mainlandauthority; Mr. Ngan was aware of such circumstances; and the parties expressly agreed to engage Mainland lawyers to handle the transfer. They all pointed towards Mainland law to be the proper law of the contract which should not be lessened by the other factors referredto by the Judge.</p>    <p>58.21) The signing of the contract in Hong Kong, while being a factor to be taken into account, does not support the finding thatHong Kong law is the proper law. It is indeed fortuitous that the agreements were signed in Hong Kongas submitted by Mr. BenjaminYu S.C. (who appeared with Mr. Paul Shieh S.C. and Mr. Law Man Chung as counsel for the defendants).</p>    <p>58.22) The Judge also referred to the background of the case where internal correspondence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the Fujian government (Report dated 5 June 1997) showed that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant desired to relocate part of the operation of FCL in the Mainland to Macau in order to avoid problems over intellectualproperty rights with FRIMS.  The report stated that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â According to the Sino British Joint Declaration, the Sino Portuguese Joint Declaration, the Hong Kong Basic Law and Macau BasicLaw, after the return of their sovereignty to the PRC, Hong Kong and Macau have independent judicial status.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>58.23) The Judge held that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs intention to rely on the separate judicial and legal system in Macau and Hong Kong was clear. So too was its intentionthat the three agreements shall operate outside the PRC. The parties were clearly distancing themselves from the PRC. This also pointsvery strongly to a Hong Kong connection than a PRC connection.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>58.24) In my view the Judge had not properly recognized that the subject matter of the contract was the sale of the shares and notthe operation of FCL.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs desire to resort to judicial systems outside the Mainland was to address the dispute with FRIMS and not an indicationof its or the partiesâ wish to distance themselves from the Mainland in respect of the present transaction.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Title to the shares</u></b></p>    <p>58.25) Further the plaintiff is not merely seeking damages under contract but is also asserting a proprietary claim to the sharesas well.  This is reflected in the order made by the Judge where he held 51% of the shares in FCL belonged beneficially to the plaintiff. It has not been seriously disputed that the issue of beneficial interest in shares is determined by the law where the shares aresituated (<i>lex situs</i>).  This is reaffirmed by the Court of Final Appeal in <i>Tripole Trading Ltd &amp; Ohters v. Prosperfield Ventures Ltd &amp; Another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20HKLRD%20200" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 HKLRD 200</a> at paragraph 86.  The FCL shares are situated in the Mainland.  In the circumstances under this limb the applicable law is also Mainlandlaw.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Mainland law applies</u></b></p>    <p>58.26) To conclude on this part, the proper law under both characterization is Mainland law rather than Hong Kong law.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>(III)</b> <b><u>Consequence if proper law is Mainland law</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Because of the Judgeâs decision that the proper law of the contract was Hong Kong law, he dealt with the consequence arising therefromonly in the context of Hong Kong law.  As a result this Court is handicapped in addressing fully the consequence in the context ofMainland law because of the absence of findings on this issue.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Contract invalid</u><u>and the result</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  If Mainland law was the proper law of the contract, then the expert evidence clearly showed that the contract was invalid.  Thecontract was invalid by reason of FCL not having obtained approval to dispose of its shares.  Under Mainland law, the innocent partyis entitled to two remedies :</p>	<blockquote>		<p>(1) Restitution : the parties will be restored (è¿é) to their pre-contract position.</p>    	<p>(2) Compensation : the party at fault (éé¯) is liable to pay compensation to the other party</p>	</blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Restitution</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  In respect of restitution the defendants have indicated both in the Court below and in this Court that they are prepared to makerestitution.  In this Court, the defendants openly stated that it will return HK$20 million being the amount paid by the plaintiffto the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant with interest and will forego the return of FCO shares and dividends declared or paid by FCO.  The plaintiff has not respondedto the open offer.  If this offer is accepted, then there will be a judgment on such terms for the plaintiff.  If not, the issueof restitution must be remitted to the Court of First Instance for determination under Mainland Law.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Compensation</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  The Judge, on the basis that the proper law was Hong Kong law, found that under the Mainland statutory provisions the obligationto procure the necessary approval for transfer of the FCL shares was on FCL and not the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  However, he went on to hold that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was at fault (again on the basis of Hong Kong law) in not causing FCL to obtain approval.  He decided this issuein theplaintiffâs favour and held that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was liable to pay compensation to the plaintiff in the amount of US$30 million. </p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Basis of decision</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The Judge found the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was at fault because there was an implied term of the contract that since âthe 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is the sole shareholder who had control and management of FCL, it goes without saying that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant will procure the approvalâ.  The Judge further held that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThere is no evidence from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant that it has discharged or attempted to discharge or otherwise frustrated from discharging the burden of procuring the approvalsuch that it may be excused from transferring the shares in FCL.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Proceeding on that basis the Judge held that, under Hong Kong law, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was in breach of the contract.  He went on to hold that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â 111. â¦.when the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant entered into agreement to sell its shares in FCL to JDS, it evinced an intention no longer to be bound by the First LaserAgreement. The Plaintiff is entitled to accept that breach and to treat the date of sale to JDS under that agreement as the dateof the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs breach of the First Laser Agreementâ¦.. The Plaintiffâs loss and damage was to be assessed as at that date. â¦â¦thatthe price of sale is the best evidence of the market price of the share at the time of breach. The purchase price having been fullypaid by the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff is entitled to 51% of the total consideration of the sale to JDS, i.e. US$30.6 million.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  It should be noted that the parties in the Court below had not argued the case of implied term at all.  The Judge took up this issuehimself.  Since the Judge made this award under Hong Kong law which I find to be wrong, this award would have to be set aside.  Inany event the plaintiff in the Court below elected to proceed by way of proprietary remedies instead of damages.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Is the plaintiff entitled to compensation under Mainland law?</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  In this Court, the plaintiff, by way of an amendment to the respondentâs notice, argued that the Judge ought to have held alsothat the plaintiff is entitled to compensation under Mainland law as well. Specifically the plaintiff argued that the fault of the1<sup>st</sup> defendant lay in disposing of the FCL shares to JDS thereby preventing approval for the transfer of the FCL shares to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  This Court allowed this issue to be argued because as pointed out in the Ruling of this Court dated 8 July 2010 both parties hadargued this issue before the Judge on the basis that under Mainland law, the plaintiff was entitled to compensation although theJudge made no decision on this issue specifically under Mainland law.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Absence of finding of fault</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  In my view, this Court is not in a position to make a determination on this topic.  First, because the Judge had not made a findingon this issue under Mainland law.  Second, to deal with this issue will require the Court to examine not only the reports of theMainland law experts but also their oral evidence concerning the responsibility of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant which controlled FCL. Third, there are fundamental factual issues to be resolved first, for example, who were actuallyin control of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant; did the parties form a committee to deal with the transfer; would the authority approve of the transfer since it had alreadyapproved the FCO transfer?  This Court is not in a position at this stage to address this issue properly.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Should compensation be remitted?</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  However, even if, for the purpose of argument, under Mainland law the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was at fault, I still do not see the need to remit the issue of compensation to the Court below for determination.  Theonly compensation which the plaintiff has sought to recover is based on constructive trust, namely, the disgorgement of profit receivedby the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant on the disposal of FCK shares.  As will appear in the following discussion I have found that the plaintiff is not entitledto such profit.  This being the case, it is futile to remit the issue of compensation to the court below.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Constructive trust</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  As pointed out at the beginning of the judgment, the Judge granted equitable relief to the plaintiff.  This was done on the basisthat Hong Kong law is the applicable law. The plaintiff had accepted that it is not its case that if the Mainland law was the applicablelaw and the agreement was invalid under such law, a constructive trust can still arise.  But it also contends in this Court thatit is entitled in any event to equitable remedies such as taking of account and tracing by reason of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant being a constructive trustee.  Although the applicable law is Mainland law, the trust arises not under Mainland law butby virtue of the remedies available under Hong Kong law by reference to the principles stated in the line of cases represented by<i>Kuwait Oil Tanker</i> <i>Co SAK and another</i> <i>v.

This can be found at paragraph 191 of the judgment</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â191.

On that footing the judge followed the decision of Chadwick J in <i>Arab Monetary Fund v Hashim</i> (15 June 1994, unreported), which has since itself been followed by Mance J in <i>Grupo Torras SA v Sheikh Fahad Mohammed Al Sabah, Fouad Khaled Jaffar v Grupo Torras SA</i> (24 June 1999, unreported), and held that the restitutionary obligation under Kuwaiti law could be characterised as fiduciary incharacter by English law and thus capable of supporting the equitable remedies in personam which would be available to the claimantsin an English court.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Applying <i>KOT</i> to the present case</u></b></p>    <p>71.6) In the present case, the plaintiff, in order to succeed on this topic, must demonstrate that the Mainland law (which is theproper law of the contract or the proper law of the obligation) requires the defendants to disgorge the benefit it received fromthe disposal of the FCL shares. </p>    <p>71.7) Although Mr. Bai (the defendantâs expert) in his report of 7 July 2005 stated that under Mainland law the plaintiff and the1<sup>st</sup> defendant did not have any trust legal relationship, Professor Wang (the plaintiffâs expert) in his report dated 12 January 2006stated that Mr. Baiâs statement could easily have caused confusion in Hong Kong which applied the common law; the legal term âtrustâhas a great difference in the different context of Mainland law and common law; although under Mainland law, the act of infringingthe property given by another person is not directly labeled as breach of the duty of trust, the carrying out of such an act is nonethelessrequired to assume civil liability, for example, to assume the responsibility of compensation. </p>    <p>71.8) There is no finding by the Judge on this issue raised in the expert evidence.  However, there are further hurdles for the  plaintiffto overcome.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Institutional and Remedial Constructive Trust</u></b></p>    <p>71.9) <i>Snellâs Equity</i>, 31<sup>st</sup> Ed, paragraph 24â09 discussed the difference between institutional constructive trust and remedial constructive trust :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â In England, the constructive trust has in general been regarded as a substantive institution rather than a remedy. The distinctionbetween these two explanations of the trust is uncertain, owing to a lack of clear definition of the terms used. The commonly accepteddistinction is that an institutional constructive trust arises independently of any court order, once the facts on which the creationof the trust depends have occurred. The function of the court is merely to declare its prior existence. A constructive trust wouldbe remedial if it depended on an order of the court for its creation. It might lie in the discretion of the court to determine itsexistence and the extent to which the equitable interest of the claimant under the trust should take priority over the interestsof third parties.</p>        <p class="quote">At one time it was thought that a constructive trust might be used as a remedy and be âimposed by law whenever justice and goodconscience require itâ. â¦.. More recent authorities, however, make it unlikely that this approach will be followed.  The courtshave affirmed that general formulae such as inequitability and the prevention of unconscionable conduct may not be used as testsfor the imposition of a trust.  For the present at least, this appears to preclude the recognition of the remedial constructive trustin English law.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>71.10) The defendants argued that the trusteeship arising from existence of a specifically enforceable contract is an institutionaltrust as distinguished from a remedial constructive trust.  The existence of such a trust must be founded on a valid and enforceablecontract â which is absent here.  They argued that as a result, remedial constructive trust is not available to the plaintiff asa matter of law.</p>    <p>71.11) While I tend to accept the defendantâs submission on this point, in my view, in the absence of argument of how the differenceof these two concepts may impact on <i>KOT</i>, I am not prepared to hold on this ground alone that the plaintiffâs claim for equitable remedy is precluded.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Requirement of specific performance</u></b></p>    <p>71.12) However, a more fundamental problem on the availability of equitable remedy under the <i>KOT</i> approach is the absence of a specifically enforceable contract.  These two topics must be viewed together since they are an integralpart of the equitable remedy.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> In this Court it is submitted by the defendants that if the applicable law on the plaintiffâs proprietary claim could only subsistif it were Hong Kong law, the Judge erred in holding that the plaintiff had acquired a beneficial interest in the FCL shares.  Itdid not acquire such an interest because specific performance of the First Laser Agreement (insofar as the transfer of the FCL sharesare concerned) could not have been decreed due to the lack of required approval under the statutory provisions of the Mainland. The defendants relied on <i>Howard v.

The short point I wish to make is that the Agreement is not capable of specific performance because the Agreement requires thedefendant to fulfill its obligations of application to the SFC and the HKFE in the first place and the Scheme expressly providedfor the deadline for the transfer to be approved.  The deadline had long gone.  This case illustrates most vividly the operationof the qualification to the <i>Lysaght v Edwards</i> principle in terms of the requirement for specific performance.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The plaintiffâs position : equity in personam</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The plaintiffâs case on constructive trust is by reason of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant being the vendor of the FCL shares.

The claimant did not disclose this to the relevantdepartment which paid income support supplement to the claimant.  The department sought the return of overpayment.  Dispute aroseon what was the proper law to determine the existence of the putative implied trust.  Mummery LJ held that :</p>		    <blockquote>	        <p class="quote">â 29. First, the common law principles. The Commissioner rightly rejected Mr Croallyâs [counsel for the claimant] reliance on<i>Webb and Lightning</i> as determining the applicable law issue. Those cases are clear authority binding on this court for the proposition that, at commonlaw, even if the subject matter is foreign immovable property, English law may be the law applicable to the question whether thereis an implied trust of that property. However, on the particular facts of those cases, it was plain that English law was the lawapplicable to the relationship between the people concerned and their property arrangements. Thus in <i>Lightning</i>, in which English law and the law of implied trusts were held to apply to the purchase of land in Scotland, the facts were that,apart from the provision of money for the purchase of property in Scotland, there was nothing to connect Scottish law with the partiesconcerned, their relationship or their arrangements. English law was obviously the law with which the putative trust was most closelyconnected. Similarly in <i>Webb</i> the only connecting factor with French law was the situs of the property purchased.â</p>	    </blockquote>	</blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b><u>My view</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> 1) It is inevitable that one must pay regard to the important requirement that the validity or enforceability (to use a neutral term)of the contract depends on a fulfilment of a condition, namely, approval being given by the relevant authority.  The non fulfilmentof this condition will render the contract âof no effectâ, invalid or unenforceable and specific performance will not be decreed.</p>    <p>76.2) As apparent from the cases, even when Courts exercised the equity jurisdiction in personam, it does not mean they would ignorethe fact where the equitable relationship no longer existed.  The statements by Luxmoore J in <i>In re The Anchor Line</i> that â<i>a valid equitable security</i> according to English lawâ and Judge Baker that âthe order will not be made if the carrying out of it is illegal or impossibleaccording to the <i>lex situs</i>â in <i>Webb</i> underlined the requirement of a relationship which gives rise to equity.</p>    <p>76.3) Where the equity has been destroyed, the claimant is no longer able to invoke the personam jurisdiction which is based on thatequity.  Peter Gibson LJ observed in <i>Lightning</i>,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â 23. â¦ it seems to me implicit that the English court not unnaturally regarded English law as applicable to the relationshipbetween the parties before it <b>in the absence of any event governed by the lex situs destructive of the equitable interest being asserted</b>.</p>        <p class="quote">24. As is pointed by Millett LJ when sitting at first instance at <i>Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Trust</i> (No 3)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20WLR%20978" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 WLR 978</a> at page 989 (commenting on <i>Norris v Chambres</i>(1891) 29 Beavan, 246, affirmed 3 De Gex Fisher and Jones 583), where a plaintiff invokes the in personam jurisdiction of the Englishcourt against a defendant amenable to the jurisdiction and there is an equity between the parties which the court can enforce, theEnglish court will accept jurisdiction and apply English law as the applicable law, even though the suit relates to foreign land. <b><u>In contrast if the equity which is asserted does not exist between the parties to the English litigation, for example where therehas been a transfer of the property to a third party with notice of an equity but by the lex situs governing the transfer, the transferextinguished the plaintiffâs equity, the English court could not then give relief against the third party even though he is withinthe jurisdiction.</u></b>â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>76.4) In the present case, since the contract was âof no effectâ, invalid or unenforceable because the condition has not beenfulfilled, this means that the equity has been destroyed or does not exist between the parties and as a result Hong Kong Court couldnot give relief to it.</p>    <p>76.5) Insofar as the plaintiff relied on cases based on a trusteeship or lien arising from payment of the purchase price (<i>In Whitbread</i> and <i>Chattey</i>) it is important to distinguish them from a trusteeship which arises from the existence of a specifically enforceable contract betweenvendor and purchaser.  Megarry and Wade on <i>The Law of Real Property</i> 7<sup>th</sup> Ed at 15â054 stated that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â 3. <b>Nature of trusteeship.</b> It is necessary to distinguish the trusteeship that arises from the existence of a specifically enforceable contract between vendorand purchaser and the trust or lien that arises from a payment of some or all of the purchase price by the purchaser: â<b>A purchaser who enters into a specifically enforceable contract for the sale of land acquires an equitable interest in the land andretains that interest for as long as the contract remains enforceable</b>â¦â¦â â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>76.6) In respect of the trust from a specifically enforceable contract, the authorities clearly established that it must be unconditional.As Nourse LJ observed in <i>J Sainsbury Plc. v. OâConnor</i> (Inspector of Taxes)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20WLR%20963" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 WLR 963</a> at 979</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Then take the previous example, but <b><u>suppose that the contract is subject to a condition precedent. Until the condition is satisfied the equitable interest in the shareswill not pass to company C. It will remain in company A</u></b>. What ground is there for thinking that the beneficial ownership of the shares will not also remain in company A? In order to answerthat question we must look to <i>Wood Preservation Ltd. v. Prior</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%201%20WLR%201077" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 1 W.L.R. 1077.</a> That is a difficult decision. Goff J. at first instance did not distinguish between the beneficial ownership of the shares and theequitable interest in them. In my view he was right not to make that distinction. However, he thought that, because the purchasercould obtain specific performance of the contract by waiving the condition precedent at any time, âthe beneficial interest hadsufficiently passed to the purchaser.â I respectfully think that that was an error on the part of the judge. <b><u>Unless and until the condition was either waived or satisfied there could be no right to specific performance and no passing of theequitable interest.</u></b>â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>76.7) In fact the principle that the conditionality of a contract precludes specific performance is expressly recognized after <i>J Sainbury plc</i> in cases such as <i>Michaels</i> and <i>Chattey.  Lewin on Trust</i> 18<sup>th</sup> Ed at paragraph 10â05 accepted this principle :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe trusteeship depends on the availability of specific performance, a remedy to which the buyer will ordinarily be entitled toenforce a contract for the sale of land. <b>If, however, the contract is conditional and the condition has not yet been fulfilled,</b> <b>specific performance is not available and the beneficial ownership has not passed to the purchaser</b>. (But a contract is not conditional in the relevant sense if fulfilment of the supposed condition is within the control of a contractingparty.)â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>76.8) <i>Michaels</i> recognized (as in <i>Lewin</i>) that there is a distinction between a true condition precedent which it is not within a contracting partyâs power to bring about,even though he may undertake to use his best endeavours to bring it about, and a promissory condition which the party does have powerto fulfil or to cause to be fulfilled.  However this will not assist the plaintiff in the present case because even if, for the purposeof argument, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant controlled FCL and could have applied for approval on its behalf, the ultimate decision whether to grant approval or notdid not rest with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant but with the relevant approving authority.  The argument that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant controls FCL will not assist the plaintiff.</p>    <p>76.9) The difficulty is not answered by the contention that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had by reason of the disposal of the FCL shares to JDS prevented the condition being fulfilled because the fact remainsthat at the time of the disposal upon which the plaintiffâs right was crystallised, there was no approval given by the relevantauthority : the plaintiff did not have a specifically enforceable contract then. This would preclude the plaintiff from seeking theequitable relief.</p>    <p>76.10) In my view, the defendants have sufficiently established the problem of specific performance even without relying on the argumentthat Mr. Bai (the defendantsâ expert) had further said that approval would not be given for the agreement because it was inconsistentwith the FCO agreement for which it had given approval.</p>    <p>76.11) In the course of arguments Mr. Yu, SC, had referred to academic work on the topic that title to land is not governed by the<i>lex situs</i> : <i>Dicey</i> (14<sup>th</sup> Ed) Paragraph 29â064; <i>The Common Law Choice of Law Rules for Resulting and Constructive Trust by Chong</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282005%29%2054%20International%20and%20Comparative%20Law%20Quarterly%20855" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2005) 54 ICLQ 855</a>; <i>Yeo, Choice of Law for Equitable Doctrines</i>; <i>Birks and Rose, Restitution and Equity</i> (Chapter 8 on <i>Resulting Trusts in the Conflicts of Law by Stevens</i>).  No opinion is expressed on these works.</p>    <p>76.12) The compensation sought by the plaintiff is based on the availability of equitable remedy to the plaintiff.  Mr. Chan, apartfrom a reference to the expertâs view on interest arising from a subject matter, was unable to advance any other alternative basisof compensation if the disgorgement of profit is not available to the plaintiff.  Certainly if there is another basis it has notbeen properly formulated at the conclusion of the appeal.  This being the case it is not necessary to remit the issue of disgorgementof profit to the court below.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>(IV)</b>  <b><u>Estoppel by Convention</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  This Court also allowed the plaintiff to amend its respondentâs notice to address the issue of estoppel by convention even ifMainland law is the proper law of the contract.  This issue was specifically raised below.  The Judge did not make a specific decisionon whether estoppel by convention was available to the plaintiff, although he did address one specific defence, namely, public policy,to the issue of estoppel by convention.  This specific defence was also relied upon by the defendant as a defence to the plaintiffâsclaim on breach of contract. </p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Whether the evidence supports a case of estoppel by convention is not something that can be fully dealt with by this Court.

The plaintiff relied ontwo bases to advance this argument.  First, estoppel by convention is to be classified as âproceduralâ in nature, so that thelaw of the forum (<i>lex fori</i>) i.e. Hong Kong law, rather than law of the cause (<i>lex causae)</i> i.e. Mainland law, is the applicable law.  Second, even if estoppel by convention is a substantive issue, by applying the approachof Staughton LJ in <i>The Amazonia</i> [1990] 1 Lloydâs Rep 236, the proper law of âestoppel by conventionâ is Hong Kong law.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  The starting point of the inquiry is Rule 17 of <i>Dicey</i> which states that all matters of procedure are governed by the domestic law of the country to which the court wherein any legal proceedingsare taken belongs (<i>lex fori</i>).</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  The plaintiff then relied on the statement in cases that estoppel by convention is a matter of evidence in order to bring this topicinto the âproceduralâ fold.

But even under the traditional classification, it is clear that the Court is not constrained by the view thatthis concept is simply a matter of evidence only.  This is made abundantly clear by the Court of Final Appeal in <i>Unruh v.

If the estoppel relates to the existence of a contract between the parties, the legalrelationship between the parties is ascertained by reference to the terms of the contract which has been assumed to exist. If, inthe assumed state of affairs, the contract confers a cause of action on the party raising the estoppel, the cause of action may beenforced. The source of legal obligation in that event is the assumed contract; the estoppel is not a source of legal obligationexcept in the sense that the estoppel compels the party bound to adhere to the assumption that the contract exists.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  My understanding of this analysis is that this concept is not merely a matter of evidence but rather a matter of substance whichis in line with the view of Lord Wright in <i>Canada and Dominion Sugar Co Ltd v.

Its choice of law characterization alsodepends on the context in which it arises. Estoppel by record raises an issue of procedure or public policy. An important equitablecontribution closely related to estoppel, that it is an abuse of process to raise issues which should have been but were not raisedin earlier foreign proceedings, is no doubt procedural. <b>In many cases, estoppel principles represent substantive policies of domestic law that shape the liabilities of the parties</b>. Civil law systems may use the doctrine of good faith in situations where estoppel would be invoked in the common law. These issuesshould be seen as substantive for choice of law purposes. <b>The following types of estoppel have been assumed (correctly, it is suggested) to be substantive for choice of law purposes: estoppelby convention</b>, estoppel on the issue of title; and estoppel in the context of ostensible authority of an agent to bind a principal. Estoppel arisingin the context of a claim in contract is arguably substantive. Waiver operates like estoppel, and may be substantive for the samereasons.

Whether, for the purpose of thisRule, it should be regarded as a rule of substance or as a rule of procedure is an entirely open question, the answer to which maywell vary with the type of estoppel under consideration. Thus the question whether a principal is estopped from denying his agentâsauthority to deal with a third party probably depends on the <i>lex causae</i>. On the other hand, the question precisely when an estoppel by record arises probably depends on the <i>lex fori</i>, although, of course that law may distinguish for this purpose between the effect of foreign and domestic judgments.â</p>	</blockquote>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  On the other hand, Johnston in â<i>The Conflict of Laws in Hong Kong</i>â at paragraph 2.010 was of the view that estoppel by convention is a matter of substance :</p>	<blockquote>		<p class="quote">â Issue estoppels based on foreign judgments are matters principally for the <i>lex fori</i> discussed in Chapter 9.

In <i>The Amazonia</i>, the proper law of the contract was Australian law.  Questions arose as to whether there was, first, an ad hoc contract between theparties and, second, an estoppel by convention on the appointment of an arbitrator both of which would be governed by English law.In respect of the issue of estoppel, Staughton LJ at 247 stated that,</p>	<blockquote>		<p class="quote">â The convention was that there was a valid arbitration agreement between the parties. <b>In a case of estoppel by convention where a foreign element is involved, one has in my judgment to look for something which can convenientlybe called the proper law of the estoppel.

Sucha âfloatingâ choice of law was axiomatically precluded, on the footing that a contract must be a source of obligation from itsinception, and in the absence of a governing law it would contain no mechanism to impose any obligations.  But there appeared tobe no obstacle to prevent the parties changing the proper law: if it was open to them to vary the contract, it must also have beenopen to vary this provision as well.  <b>As a matter of logic, if not clear authority, however, the alteration to the proper law would need to comply with, or be licensedby, the original proper law as well as being permitted by English law: the contract would be and remain a source of obligations governedby its original proper law unless and until this proper law recognized the validity and effectiveness of a change</b>.â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  The case cited by Briggs in support of the common law position is <i>The Amar</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20All%20ER%20498" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 All ER 498</a> where Megaw LJ at 505 stated that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe governing law cannot fall to be decided, retrospectively, by reference to an event which was an uncertain event in the futureat the time when obligations under the contract had already been undertaken, had fallen to be performed and had been performed.

Assuming Staughton LJdid put forward the idea of the proper law of estoppel by convention, I would not adopt his approach which is not binding on thisCourt as his approach had not been fully analyzed.</p>	<blockquote>		<p>(1)   <i>The Amar</i> was not cited in <i>The Amazonia</i>.  Even if subsequent conduct may be relevant to the issue of estoppels (<i>James Miller &amp; Partners Ltd</i> at 614), the estoppel by convention that arises is still, as discussed in <i>Unruh</i>, based on the contract between the parties of which the proper law is Mainland law.  Although subsequent events may give rise tothe estoppel, it does not mean that somehow the proper law of the contract can also be changed to Hong Kong law.  Estoppel by conventionis an issue that arises out of the contract, just like other issues such as waiver or variation of contractual terms which are plainlygoverned by the proper law of the contract.  I see no reason why it should be otherwise for estoppel by convention.</p>    	<p>(2)   Further it has been recognized that ascertaining the proper law of the contract is also a matter of ascertaining the intentionof the parties.  Having ascertained their intention that the proper law of the contract is to be one set of law i.e. Mainland lawas I have so found, in order to put forward another set of proper law i.e. Hong Kong law, that applies to estoppel by convention,it is necessary, as a matter of logic and principle, that the Court must first find that the parties had also intended that the properlaw they had agreed upon may change by subsequent events.  Likewise there must also be evidence showing that Mainland law allowsa subsequent change of the proper law.  In other words the ascertainment of the proper law of the estoppel by convention cannot bedone in isolation solely by reference to the âcommuningsâ of the parties in relation to their subsequent conduct.  There mustalso be evidence on the partiesâ intention and also on the proper law of the contract that permit a subsequent change of the contractualproper law before a foray into a different regime of proper law can be made.</p>	</blockquote>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  This is precisely the difficulties that the plaintiff faces in this case : the parties having agreed Mainland law to be the properlaw of the contract (as I have so found), the plaintiff is required to adduce evidence that nonetheless they also intended and Mainlandlaw also permits such proper law may be changed by subsequent events.  This evidence must be specifically put forward at the trialand it is not permissible for the plaintiff to say that the issue of communings should be remitted to the Court below without firstidentifying the necessary evidence on the preconditions.  For the reasons I have given, I rule that the plaintiff is not entitledto avail itself of the Hong Kong law concept of estoppel by convention.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>(V)  Consequence if proper law is Hong Kong law</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  As my decision is that Mainland law and not Hong Kong law is the proper law of the contract and the plaintiff is not entitled toavail itself of the Hong Kong law concept of estoppel by convention, I will refrain from expressing any view on the question of lossand damages if the proper law is Hong Kong law (other than the non-availability of equitable remedy which, although discussed underthe <i>KOT</i> approach under Mainland law, applies equally to the situation where Hong Kong law is the applicable law).</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  The appeal is accordingly allowed.  The judgment below is set aside.  The issue of restitution under Mainland law as discussed abovewill be remitted to To J for determination.
