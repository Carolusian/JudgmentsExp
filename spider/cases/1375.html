The said Tenancy Agreement dated the 1st May 1946 and the said letter dated the 13th July 1972 were produced by consent asExhibit A and Exhibit B. The parties have confirmed before me that the 2nd Opponent is the surviving son of the deceased Cheng Cheong.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The procedural difficulty which would immediately leap to one's mind is the apparently erroneous joinder of the said deceased's soleproprietorship firm as the 1st Opponent herein: it would appear that the proper party should be the executor de son tort or the OfficialAdministrator of the estate of the said deceased. No point was taken on this matter before the learned President of the Tenancy Tribunalor is now being taken before me on appeal, and in view of the conclusions I have arrived at, it would be futile to postpone theseproceedings for bringing before the Court the proper party representing the estate of the said deceased.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> In substance, the Appellant's case is: the contractual monthly business tenancy granted to the said deceased under the said TenancyAgreement was a personal interest which immediately merged with and was superseded by the deceased's statutory tenancy of the samepremises; upon his death, the deceased's statutory tenancy came to an end; as there was no subsisting contractual tenancy interestwhich had been entirely devoured by the statutory tenancy, the estate of the said deceased was entitled to no interest in or of thesuit premises; as it was impossible to have a transmission of the statutory business tenancy to the widow of a deceased tenant whoresided elsewhere from the business premises or any transmission of statutory business tenancy at all, the 3rd Opponent has acquiredno interest whatsoever in or of the suit premises, and consequently the opponents are all trespassers. Alternatively, the Appellantsseek to set up a case of unlawful assignment, transfer, subletting or parting with possession of the suit premises by the 1st Opponentto the other Opponents.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Counsel for the Appellants submitted (A) that as Cheng Cheong Kee was not a legal entity, the tenancy under the said Tenancy Agreement(Exhibit A) was created in favour of its sole proprietor, the said Cheng Cheong, deceased, personally and alone; thus, in the circumstancesof this case, not being a party to the said Tenancy Agreement, none of the 2nd and 3rd Opponents could derive any contractual tenancyinterest therefrom, (B) that the ratio decidendi of <u>Law Yuk Chuen v. Ah Yin</u> (1) excludes the principle of transmission from the case of the widow of a deceased business tenant who did not reside in the businesspremises, and (C) that as the contractual tenancy under the said Tenancy Agreement merged with and was superseded by the statutorytenancy of the same premises, upon the incidental termination of the deceased's statutory tenancy at the time of his death, therewas no tenancy interest of any kind subsisting, and the landlord being entitled to immediate possession may eject the occupiers foundin the suit premises without having to serve any or any contractual notice to quit on the estate of the deceased tenant. On thislast submission, Counsel for the Appellants developes his contention thus: our local definition of "tenant" differs from that ofthe England Rent Acts in that it does not include a person deriving title under the original contractual tenant, and the reason forsuch omission in Hong Kong is that we have no contractual tenancy to devolve upon the death of the tenant as such contractual tenancyhas merged with the statutory tenancy and lost its identity from the very inception; further as all tenancies of pre-war buildingsare, subject to certain exemptions, protected, if counsel's contention were erroneous (i.e. a contractual tenancy might survive),a person who derives title under such original contractual tenant would enjoy statutory protection as a tenant within the meaningof the definition of "tenant" in our local Ordinance; such state of affairs, counsel submits, would do violence to the language inour definition of "tenant" which has, for this specific purpose, deliberately omitted the words "any person deriving title underthe original tenant".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> I will consider these submissions in the reverse order. Under s.12(1)(f) of the Act of 1920, the expression "tenant" included anyperson deriving title under the original tenant. In England, a tenant who is in possession under a contract of tenancy but at thesame time looks forward to enjoy the protection of the Rent Acts is generally known as a protected tenant, and the "status of irremovability"which comes into existence on the termination of such a contract of tenancy is known as a statutory tenancy. See p.p. 1553-4 Woodfallon Landlord &amp; Tenant 27th Ed. Volume 2, p.882 Hill and Redman's Law of Landlord &amp; Tenant 15th Ed., and p.18 Megarry on TheRent Acts Volume 1 10th Ed. In England, as the tenant will become, if personally resident in the premises, a statutory tenant upontermination of his contractual tenancy, the person who derives title under the original tenant and is for the time being a contractualtenant, if himself personally resident in the premises, may also enjoy statutory protection at the termination of his acquired contractualtenancy. It is the passing of the contractual right before the commencement of the statutory tenancy, and it is not to be confusedby the fact that under the English Rent Acts the right to statutory protection cannot be passed without the prior consent of thelandlord. See para. 2636 in Volume 2 Woodfall on Landlord &amp; Tenant 27th Ed. Therefore, by including a person deriving title underthe original contractual tenant, the definition section 12 of the Act of 1920 merely anticipated the transfer of the contractualinterest before the crystallization of the statutory tenancy, and in no way did it enable the voluntary passing of the right to statutoryprotection. In other words, even under the Rent Acts the passing, voluntary or by devolution, of contractual interest can be effectedonly before the coming into being of a statutory tenancy in favour of the original tenant, and the statutory tenancy which ariseson the termination of the contractual tenancy cannot be freely conveyed without the landlord's consent. Obviously, the inclusionof the person deriving title under the original tenant in the definition of "tenant" in the Act of 1920 would not undermine the personalnature of the right to a statutory tenancy. Thus, the definition s.12(1)(f) in no way made the right to statutory protection unders.15 of the Act of 1920 transferrable or less personal. Similarly, the definition of "tenant" in s.113 of the Rent Act, 1968 (whichincludes even a statutory tenant, a sub-tenant in addition to any person deriving title under the original tenant or sub-tenant)has not made the right to statutory protection under s.3 thereof transferrable or any the less personal. See p.p. 891 &amp; 1052Hill &amp; Redman's Law of Landlord &amp; Tenant 15th Ed. In Part I of our Landlord &amp; Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7">Cap.7</a>,the position is somewhat different. Whilst the English Rent Acts afford protection against ejectment only to statutory tenants afterthe termination of their preceding contractual tenancies, our Part I protects both contractual and statutory tenancies. If "tenant"in our s.2 were to include a person deriving title under the original tenant, by reason of the dual application of our Part I toboth contractual and statutory tenancies our s.17 would put such a person in the position of a statutory tenant with the benefitof statutory protection and would in effect allow an unfettered passing, voluntary or by devolution, of the purely personal rightto statutory protection; further, the image of a personal right to statutory protection would then be completely shattered by thepossibility of free alienation of statutory protection by one contractual "tenant" to another, and the safeguard against unlawfulassignment, transfer, subletting or parting with possession afforded by s.36 of Part I of our Landlord &amp; Tenant (Consolidation)Ordinance <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7">Cap.7</a> would be somewhat affected, particularly in the devolution of contractual interest. Therefore, it stands to reason why our definition of "tenant" shouldomit the reference to a person deriving title under the original tenant. I cannot accept Counsel's submission that the subsistenceof a contractual tenancy would confer statutory protection on all persons deriving title under the original contractual tenant. Anunlawful transfer of such an original contractual tenancy in breach of the provisions of the Ordinance or otherwise will not turnthe unlawful transferee into a tenant of the landlord or a "tenant" for the purpose of our Ordinance, but a lawful transfer withthe consent of the landlord will. A person deriving title under the original contractual tenant by devolution upon his death (e.g.the Official Administrator or his personal representative) will have such contractual right suspended, if he should happen not tobe the very person to whom the statutory tenancy has been transmitted. In my judgment, the omission of the phrase "any person derivingtitle under the original tenant" from the definition of "tenant" in our Ordinance could not be for the reason advanced by counselfor the Appellants. It would seem that these words had to be omitted on account of the dual application of Part I of our Ordinanceto as well contractual as statutory tenancies. But whatever the real motivation behind such omission was, I am convinced by a wealthof local authorities that a contractual tenancy may prevail in pre war protected premises. In <u>the Wing On Company Limited v. Sheun Hai Yue</u> (2), Reece, J. decided at p.215 thereof that the a new contractual tenancy created after the expiration of an earlier exempted contractualtenancy was within the provisions of the then Landlord &amp; Tenant Ordinance. Gould, J. sitting on appeal from a decision of theTenancy Tribunal, observed that the definition of "tenant" in the Landlord &amp; Tenat Ordinance was wide enough to include bothcontractual and statutory tenants. See <u>Far East Aviation Co. Ltd. &amp; Another v. F.M. Soares &amp; Others</u> (3) In <u>Ng Kam Chuen v. The World Motor Repairing Works</u> (4), Judge Huggins, as he then was, felt constrained to recognize the possible subsistence of a contractual tenancy in pre-war protectedpremises. The Full Court in <u>Wong</u> <u>Choi Hai v. Wong Nui</u> (5) also accepted the existence of a contractual tenancy in protected premises. The proviso to s.17 of the Landlord &amp; Tenant(Consolidation) Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7">Cap.7</a> expressly dispensed with the service of a notice to quit, "notwithstanding any-thing in the contractof tenancy", by "a landlord who obtains an order for possession", and that is indicative, in the Ordinance itself, of the settledprinciple that a contractual tenancy interest may exist in premises controlled by the provisions of our rent restriction legislation.The concept of a subsisting contractual tenancy under our rent restriction Ordinance has so deeply implanted into our law that itwould be almost reckless now to endeavour to uproot it. In my judgment, the contractual tenancy, unless expires by effluxion of timeor otherwise terminate, will enjoy like protection as that enjoyed by a statutory tenancy and does not lose its own identity by amerger. Therefore, unless it is otherwise expressly dispensed with, e.g. in the proviso to s.17 of the Landlord &amp; Tenant (Consolidation)Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7">Cap. 7</a>, a notice to quit is necessary to terminate such an existent contractual tenancy.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> I turn next to consider Mr. Tang's second submission. In 1958, Judge Huggins, as he then was, held that a non-occupying tenant wasentitled to statutory protection in Hong Kong. Vide <u>Ng Kam Chuen v. The World Motor Repairing Works.</u> ibid. (4) The learned judge acknowledged the dual application of the Landlord &amp; Tenant Ordinance to domestic and business tenanciesalike and equated an occupying business tenant as one who was "actually carrying on a business in the premises". With usual admirableclarity, the learned judge left it in no uncertain terms that "personal residence" was irrelevant to statutory protection for a businesstenancy under the Landlord &amp; Tenant Ordinance. In 1960, Judge Macfee held in <u>Law Yuk Chuen &amp; Another v. Ah Yin</u> (1) that there could be no transmission of business premises or domestic premises at which the deceased tenant did not personallyreside at the time of his death. It would seem that Judge Macfee was not prepared to sweep aside the right to statutory protectionof non-occupying tenants in its entirety, but he restricted the transmission of statutory protection on death to premises actuallyoccupied by the deceased statutory tenant as his residence. The learned judge derived support for his conclusions from the definitionof "tenant" and the English case of <u>Collier v. Stoneman</u> (6). No attention seemed to have been drawn to the very crucial facts that the English Rent Acts were confined to dwellings in domesticpremises and that in England under the principle of <u>Skinner v. Geary</u> (7), personal occupation was a pre-requisite to statutory protection. On the force of Collier's case, the learned judge must be takento have read into the definition the words similar to those inserted within the brackets below: "tenant ....... includes .......(for the purposes of premises occupied by the original tenant as his own residence) the widow of a tenant, residing with the tenant(at such premises) at the time of his death". Apart from the fact that had the legislature so intended, it could have expressly enactedin precisely that language, such construction was unwarranted and is not consistent with the general tenor of our rent restrictionlegislation. In 1962, Judge Pickering, as he then was, seemed to have accepted the decision in Ng Kam Chuen's case (4) as establishingthe principle and held that in Hong Kong the widow of a tenant who did not reside in the shop-front was entitled to have statutoryprotection by way of transmission. See <u>Ho Yin Sham v. Chong Chi Yan</u> (8). The Full Court in dealing with tenancy by estoppel in <u>Chan Sang v. Choy Yuk</u> (9), made no adverse comments on the transmission of a statutory tenancy to the widow of a non-occupying tenant during the courseof its observation on the question of non-suspension of the contractual tenancy right in the case of a non-occupying widow. In anothercase in 1963, the Full Court accepted as settled law that a non-occupying tenant is entitled to statutory protection. See <u>Wong Choi Ha v. Wong Nui</u> ibid (5). The consenus seems to be at variance with the decision of Judge Macfee in the 1960 Law Yuk Chuen's case. The decisionsof Judge Huggins and Judge Pickering, as they then were, are, in my judgment, obviously unchallengeable. In fact, Judge Pickering,in his adoption of the principle laid down by Judge Huggins, decided on the very point of transmission in favour of the widow ofa non-occupying tenant of protected business premises. The decision in <u>Law Yuk Chuen &amp; Another v. Ah Yin</u> (1) is, in my view, erroneous. In the result, I do not accept Counsel's second submission.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> I can find no flaw with the remaining submission of Mr. Tang, counsel for the Appellants. It requires no authority for the fundamentalconcept that a letting in the name of a sole proprietorship firm is tantamount to a letting to its sole proprietor.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> I hold in favour of the Appellants on the first submission but against them on the second and third submissions. It follows thatthe 3rd Opponent, being the surviving widow, has acquired a statutory tenancy by transmission as at the death of her late husbandand that the contractual tenancy, though suspended during the subsistence of the transmitted statutory tenancy, is vested in theOfficial Administrator or the personal representative of the estate of her said late husband. Neither the transmitted statutory tenancynor the contractual tenancy has been duly terminated, and the appeal must therefore fail. I ought to mention, en passant, that thereis not one iota of evidence of the alleged unlawful assignment, transfer, subletting or parting with possession, and that the 3rdOpponent's transmitted statutory tenancy as held by this Court has virtually defeated the Appellants' alternative contention. I,therefore, dismiss this appeal with costs on Scale V with certificate for counsel.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="50%"></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">(B.
