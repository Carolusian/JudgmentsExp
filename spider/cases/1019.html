In its pleading, the defendant admits publication but denies malice and declines to admit falsity. The defendant moreoverpleads that the letter was written on an occasion of qualified privilege.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The plea of qualified privilege seeks to furnish the lawful excuse for publication without which malice is presumed. The plaintiffhas not pleaded express malice and the issues are therefore twofold; -are the words used defamatory, and if so was their publicationprivileged.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> It is of course the plaintiff's burden to establish the defamation and the defendant's burden to prove qualified privilege if theplaintiff's initial burden is discharged. The defendant's pleaded denial of malice is therefore otiose, for unless the defendantproves lawful excuse for the publication, malice is conclusively presumed once the defamation is proved. Counsel for the plaintiffmoreover conceeds that the falsity of the statements is no longer disputed.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The facts are relatively simple and none of the documents relied upon in the parties' bundles are disputed. The plaintiff manufacturesfor export to the United Kingdom electrical accessories under the trade mark PMS. These accessories include 2-way and 3-way adaptors,switches,and extension sockets. According to its Managing Director, Mr. Ip Tai Hoi, it has an average U.K. turnover of some H.K.$90-100 millionannually and counts as its customers such well-known names as Hoover and Boots.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Mr. Ip said that during the past year the plaintiff has been supplying electric plug components in the form of brass plug pins toa local company by the name of Micromark H.K. This company is the buying agent for a U.K. company pleaded as BDC London, whose fullname is Bridisco Ltd and for whom Micromark H.K. has been purchasing the plaintiff's components BDC London in turn delivers thesecomponents to its associate company in Ireland, referred to in the pleadings as BDC Ireland.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The defendant manufactures similar metal accessories, but without the PMS trademark, and has also been selling its products to BDCLondon through Micromark H.K. These goods are likewise delivered by BDC London to BDC Ireland for assembly.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Relevant to the dispute is a press release from the London Borough of Barnet in the United Kingdom. This document appears in thebundles of both parties and neither its provenance nor its truth are disputed. It reads:</p>    <p style="text-align:right">4 June 1991</p>    <blockquote>        <p>DANGEROUS ADAPTORS THE SEARCH WIDENS</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>Barnet Council's Trading Standards Officers have widened their investigation into a "potentially lethal" multi-socket adaptor.</p>            <p>A warning was issued last week to cover the East Barnet area. Council staff have now discovered that the white, four-socket adaptorswere made up by a shop in East Finchley, but may have been available throughout the borough.</p>            <p>The adaptor carries the number PMS 8798. It is connected by about three yards of thick flex to a plug marked PMS 8191. The appliancewas wired up locally from otherwise safe components so that the live wire was connected to the earth terminal.</p>            <p>Anyone who has bought a similar appliance should not use it and contact Barnet Council Trading Standards service on 081 202 8282 ext.2064 immediately, so it can be tested.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>ends</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>Marketing and Public Relations Contact, John Harrison.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The plaintiff does not dispute that the two electrical products mentioned as carrying its PMS trademark were its own products. Howeverit relies on the clear implication that the PMS accessories were not faulted. This conclusion is derived from the indications thatthe end-products were</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"made up locally by a shop in East Finchley",</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and were</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"wired up locally from otherwise safe components so that the live wire was connected to the earth terminal."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Although the defendant in pre-trial correspondence relied on this press-release as the source material for its plea of qualified privilege,it later emerged in evidence that reliance was placed elsewhere.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The letter of which the plaintiff complains was dated the same day as the press release and was written by the defendant to BDC London,with copies to BDC Ireland and to Mr. Ravin Melwani of Micromark H.K. Ltd. Its full text reads</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"We had been informed by one of our customer in the U.K. that the Trading Standards officers in Salford had recently seized some ofthe "PMS" brand electrical products fitted with unapproved 13 Amps fuselinks and this was published in the newspapers. Also the TradingStandards Office had issued a directive that all "PMS" electrical accessories that are fitted with such fuselinks to be withdrawnfrom the market. We wonder whether you had heard (or read) anything with regard to this matter. If you have any information relatingto this matter, we would be much appreciated if you could forward to us your comments."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>The statements in the letter said to be defamatory are particularised at subparagraphs 3(a) (b) (c) and (d) of the Statement of claim.</p>    <p>    comparing the letter with the press-release, the plaintiff adduces significant discrepancies between them. The press-release doesnot mention the seizure of PMS products with unapproved 13 amp fuselinks. Moreover it does not indicate that the Trading StandardsOffice had directed the withdrawal of all PMS electrical accessories fitted with such fuselinks.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> At paragraph 4 of its re-amended Statement of claim, the plaintiff pleads the defamation in these terms -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"4. Apart form the natural and ordinary meaning of the above, the Defendant further implied that:-</p>            <p align="justify" class="quote">(a) the Plaintiff knowingly manufactures, sells and exports unapproved 13 Amps fuselinks;</p>            <p class="quote">(b) the Plaintiff dishonestly manufactures, sells and exports the unapproved products with the intent of deceiving its customers andto reap a dishonour profit;</p>            <p class="quote">(c) the Plaintiff dishonestly manufactures, sells and exports the unapproved products as manufacturers, sellers and exportersor otherwisefor more than one occasion;</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(d)there was lack of skill, capacity, judgment and competence on the part of the Plaintiff in the conduct of its trade and businessactivities as a manufacturer of electrical appliances of the trade mark "PMS";</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(e) the Plaintiff is such kind of manufacturer or distributor whose activities were that of the distribution or manufacture of sub-standardand dangerous electrical appliances; and</p>            <p class="quote">(f) the Plaintiff was responsible for the manufacture or distribution of dangerous and sub-standard electrical appliances.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>The amended sub-paragraph (d) was added late in the course of the trial and gave rise to an adjournment. The re-amended sub-paragraphs(e) and (f) were added on the resumption of the hearing after that adjournment.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Despite the opening words of paragraph 4 of its statement of claim, the plaintiff does not appear to be pleading the meanings insubparagraphs (a) to (f) as "true" innuendoes.A true innuendo, as discussed in <u>Lewis v. The Daily telegraph</u> [1963] 1 Q.B at 364, creates a separate cause of action and arises where the words bear a particular defamatory meaning from extrinsicfacts known to the reader. It is also known as a "legal innuendo", and as a pleading requires particulars pursuant to 0.82 r.3(1)RSC.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In contradistinction, an "ordinary" or popular innuendo carries a meaning which is not clear or explicit from the words used butis nonetheless inherent within the ordinary meaning of those words. Such an innuendo should also be pleaded, but the pleading shouldexpressly state that the meaning alleged is part of the natural and ordinary meaning of the matter complained of. Moreover, the pleadingof this meaning does not require particulars pursuant to 0.82 r.3(1) RSC.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The plaintiff's introductory words to paragraph 4, as read with the following subparagraphs, confuse these two distinct forms ofinnuendo. The plaintiff seems to rely on the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, whilst expressly excluding this in the introductorysentence. Particulars have not been pleaded, but would not be necessary in the absence of reliance on extrinsic facts in the knowledgeof the recipients.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> This is not a matter of mere pedantry, as the failure to plead particulars would be fatal to the plaintiff if, as its own pleadinginitially implies, true innuendoes were intended.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The point has not however' been taken by the defendant, and the wording of the various meanings pleaded does not indicate dependenceon extrinsic facts known to the recipients. The pleadings are adducing specific inherent meanings rather than pursuing special situationsof innuendo based on,particular knowledge in the publishees. I accept the meanings pleaded in the subparagraphs of paragraph 4 ashaving that intention despite the anomalous introductory words. Particulars under 0.82 r.3(1) RSC are therefore unnecessary.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The first substantive issue for decision is whether or not the words used were defamatory of the plaintiff. Miss Lau for the defendanthas contrasted libel with the tort of malicious falsehood as to goods, and argues that the words, if anything, amount to no morethan that. Unlike libel, malicious falsehood requires proof of special damage, which is not pleaded.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The defence points out that the plaintiff is not named in the letter of 4th June. There are references to PMS brand products andaccessories, but nothing more. From this it is argued firstly that the plaintiff is not identified, and secondly that the referenceonly to the products confines any disparagement to the plaintiff's goods and does not include its reputation.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The second of these points requires careful consideration and is fundamental to the issue of the defamatory nature of the words.I am however satisfied that the argument on identification has no substance. This argument is founded in the plaintiff's evidencethat it did not actually manufacture the products discussed in the letter, 13 amp fuselinks, and that this was known to the recipients.From this it is argued that the recipients must have known that the plaintiff was not the manufacturer of the goods discussed andthat the plaintiff could not therefore be defamed.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> It is not disputed that mention of the PMS brand name identifies the plaintiff in the understanding of the letter's recipients. Giventhat identification, the fact that the plaintiff does not manufacture 13 amp fuselinks does not exclude the possibility suggestedin the defendant's letter. The PMS products are said to be "fitted with unapproved 13 amp fuselinks", which could be achieved whetheror not the fuselinks were manufactured by the plaintiff. It is in particular possible because the plaintiff does in fact manufacture13 amp plugs. It does not therefore follow that the recipients of the letter would not understand the letter to refer to the plaintiff.On the contrary I find it probable that they did.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The defence argument that any disparagement related only to the plaintiff's goods supposes that the plaintiff's reputation couldnot be defamed by the words used. The evidence of Mr. Melwani of Micromark Hong Kong, the buying agent for BDC London, has establishedthat the plaintiff enjoys a reputation in the United Kingdom market through its PMS trademark. As manager of his company and a recipientof the offending letter, Mr. Melwani also said he regarded the plaintiff as a reliable supplier of the electrical goods he purchases.This is the reputation which the plaintiff claims to be defamed.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> It is part of the defamation pleaded that the fuselinks mentioned in the letter were said to be "unapproved". The precise meaningof this word has been canvassed and I have the relevant U.K. statutory instrument, entitled The Plugs and sochets etc (safely) Regulations1987. It is produced by the defence without despuite as to its current validity. The word "approved" does not appear in the interpretationsection, but Schedule 2 enpowers three organisations to give approval to "kinds of electrical devices".</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> These regulations are adduced by the defence to show that an "unapproved" fuselink is not to be confused with an illegal or prohibitedproduct. The contention is that the word "unapproved" is innocuous and cannot be defamatory of the plaintiff. Pursuing this argument,the defendant's Sales Manager, Miss Rose Yau, testified that an electrical product could not be sold in U.K. if not upto BritishStandard. She added however that lack of approval under the Regulations may not necessarily mean that a product were in fact belowBritish Standard. From this premise the defence argues that "unapproved" in this context is incapable of either defamation of theplaintiff or even disparagement of its goods.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> I do not accept this argument. The word "unapproved", in particular considered with the supposed directive for withdrawal of theplaintiff's products, has implications beyond the mere formal approval contemplated by the Regulations. Moreover, the regulationsthemselves are presented to the court in isolation from their legislative context and without expert evidence as to their applicability.They may not be exhaustive, and parallel regulations may exist dealing with approval of fuselinks. I am unable on the basis of thisdocument to confine the meaning of the word "unapproved" to whatever may be derived from these Regulations.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> I do not however have to leave it there. Miss Yau in cross-examination agreed that the defendant had not used unapproved fuses sincethe commencement of what she described as "the British System". She also agreed that unapproved fuses were a little cheaper thanapproved ones. More importantly, in explaining why her company would not fit unapproved fuses into its products, she said -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"If an approved fuse is to be fitted in our electrical products, then our buyer would have more confidence in our products."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>It is clear from this that in Miss Yau's own mind, an unapproved fuse in a product makes the product itself less acceptable to thecustomer. It is relevant that Miss Yau was the author of the June 4th letter and is presumed to have used the word "unapproved" thereinin the sense explained in her evidence - namely, as inspiring less confidence in the product in which it was fitted. It is probablethat the recipients of the letter, who are in the same trade, understood it in the same sense.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> I am therefore satisfied that the offending terms of the June 4th letter are disparaging at least of the plaintiff's goods and arefar from innocuous. I turn to the issue of whether or not they are disparaging also ofthe plaintiff's reputation and hence defamatory.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The cases cited by the defence in distinguishing defamation from malicious falsehood substantially concern the denigration of a productin the context of business rivalry. The recurring theme is that a man may disparage his rival's product in the course of promotinghis own and that if he does so falsely it is only actionable, if at all, as a malicious falsehood. For the disparagement to takethe issue into the area of defamation requires that the publication should be seen to attack the credit or reputation of the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The plaintiff is a manufacturer and seller of electrical products. In this context I am guided by the words of Lord Pearson in definingdefamatory material in <u>Drummond - Jackson v. British Medical Association</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%201%20All%20ER%201094" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 1 All ER 1094.</a> At page 1104 his' Lordship said -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"words may be defamatory of a trader or businessman or professional man, though they do not impute any moral fault or defect of personalcharacter. They can be defamatory of him if they impute lack of qualification, knowledge, skill, capacity, judgment or efficiencyin the conduct of his trade or business or professional activity."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> From the time of "hatred, ridicule and contempt" formulated by Parke B. in 1840, the nature of defamatory material has defied precisedefinition. Its scope has however been developed in modern times to cover modern situations, and I respectfully find Lord Pearson'sanalysis appropriate to the present case. It was probably with this in mind that the plaintiff alleged the meaning in subparagraph4(d) of its statement of claim that -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"there was lack of skill, capacity, judgment and competence on the part of the plaintiff in the conduct of its trade and businessactivities as a manufacture of electrical appliances of the trademark "PMS"."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> The offending words in the June 4th letter indicate the seizure by Trading Standards Officers of PMS brand electrical products fittedwith unapproved fuselinks. They continue that this was published in the newspapers and that the Trading Standards Office had directedthe withdrawal from the market of all PMS electrical products so fitted.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Mr. Melwani is the manager of Micromark Hong Kong, one of the recipients of the publication, and the buying agent for purchasingthe plaintiff's products for BDC London. In his re-examination the following exchange occurred -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Q. Assuming you are now purchasing plugs (not pins) and they are fitted with unapproved fuses, given your experience would you considerthis as something affecting the plugs' safety.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">A. Yes, definitely.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">Q. Would you expect a reputable plug manufacturer to have put into their products unapproved fuses?</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">A No.</p>            <p class="quote">Q. Would you call this a triviality or a defect of the gravest kind?</p>            <p class="quote">A. It would be a very serious defect.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">Q.Does a manufacturer committing this sort of error, reflecting on the safety of the devices, be still considered by you as a reputablemanufacturer?</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">A. No."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> So Mr. Melwani, who is in an unusually good position to comment, regards the use of unapproved fuses as something a reputable manufacturerwould not do. He would no longer in fact regard such a manufacturer as reputable. This evidence is moreover confined to the use ofunapproved fuses. It does not comprehend the other offending contents of the defendant's letter concerning seizure of the productsand the directive for their withdrawal from the market.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> The necessary inference from the words used is that it is the fitting of the unapproved fuselinks which has caused the seizure andthe directive for withdrawal. Given the undesirable consequences described in the letter, this fitting of the fuselinks could onlyhave been understood to be deliberate or negligent. An innocent fitting of the fuselinks would at best be an improbable inferenceto be drawn from the words.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> On this analysis, the disparagement contained in the defendant's letter goes well beyond merely that of the plaintiff's goods. Itis a clear disparagement of the plaintiff's conduct and reputation in its trade and business of manufacturing electrical productsand could not have been read otherwise by the recipients. I therefore find the words complained of to be defamatory of the plaintiff,in particular in the sense pleaded at subparagraph 4(d) of its statement of claim.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The meaning pleaded at subparagraph 4(a) cannot be substantiated as it turns on.the manufacturing, selling and exporting of 13 ampfuselinks.. The relevant words are used conjunctively in the pleading and do not represent a reasonable inference to be drawn fromthe letter.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Similarly, subparagraphs 4(b) and (c) must fail as they depend on a pleaded inference of dishonesty which cannot be drawn from thedefendant's letter.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The meanings pleaded<sub>.</sub>in subparagraphs 4(e) and (f) can be related to the inference from the supposed directive for withdrawal from the market. In regardto electrical goods a withdrawal ordered by the Trading Standards Office carries implications of lack of safety. This is supportedby Mr. Melwani's own evidence of his reaction to the use of unapproved fuses. In its context, the word "unapproved" also has connotationssimilar to "sub-standard". I therefore find that the offending words are also defamatory in the meanings pleaded at subparagraphs4(e) and (f).</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Relating these findings to the earlier discussion of pleaded innuendoes, I find the meanings pleaded in subparagraphs (e) and (f)to be at least partially within the ordinary meaning of the defamatory words. This is particularly so with the use of the word "unapproved",which in the context of electrical goods carries obvious implications of "unsafe" and "substandard". To that extent, these meaningswould not therefor strictly require pleading, although such is desirable to inform the court and the defendant of the precise natureof the plaintiff's case.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> The publication of the defamation is the plaintiff's cause of action and it imports presumptions of both malice and falsity. Thedefendant does not allege the truth of the offending words and relies on the lawful excuse provided by the defence of qualified privilege.Without a plea of express malice, the defendant will succeed if it proves the occasion capable of the privilege and the communicationto be made in the honest belief in its truth.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Lack of honest belief in the truth of the communication should be distinguished from express malice. Honest belief in the truth is,in all but a very few instances, a pre-requisite to the establishment of the defence and its burden of proof lies on the defendant.The exceptional situations outside this principle do not comprehend the present case. Express malice on the other hand is for theplaintiff to prove in destroying the qualified privilege which, but for its existence, would have been a good defence. Express malicehas not of course been pleaded.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The defendant pleads an ongoing business relationship with the three recipients of the June 4th letter. It goes on to assert an impliedcontractual duty as well as a moral duty to advise the recipients of what it had been informed and believed to be true. A lack ofmalice is then averred, and "a common and corresponding interest in the subject matter and the publication of the said letter."</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> The "common and corresponding interest" pleaded relates to the reciprocity of interest which must exist between communicant and recipientbefore the defence may avail. There are several accepted categories of relationship which can give rise to an occasion of qualifiedprivilege. It is apparent from the defendant's pleading that the category into which it seeks to place itself is that defined byLord Atkinson in <u>Adam v. Ward</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1917%5d%20AC%20309" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1917] AC 309</a> at page 334 in these terms</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"It was not disputed in this case on either side, that a privileged occasion is, in reference to qualified privilege, an occasionwhere the person who makes the communication has an interest or a duty, legal social or moral, to make it to the person to whom itis made, and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it. This reciprocity is essential."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>Adopting a shorter definition by Scrutton L.J. in <u>Watt v. Longsdon</u> [1930]1 KB 130 at page 147, both counsel have agreed that the defence should succeed if the defendant proves -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"A duty to communicate information believed to be true to a person who has a material interest in receiving that information,"</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>namely the three recipients of the letter.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Applying these tests, which are different formulations of the same concept, I accept it to be the case, that the recipients eachhad a material interest in receiving the information. As purchasers of the plaintiff's products, their interest in the plaintiff'sstatus as the manufacturer of those products is clearly perceived. It is however the defendants duty or interest in communicatingthe information which requires closer examination.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> In cross-examination, Mr. Melwani agreed he would expect someone with whom he had an ongoing business relationship to advise himof things heard about the products of another supplier. He denied however that he would regard this as a duty.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> What then is the precise nature of the duty'or interest which the defendant claims in communicating the information. It is clearlynot a legal duty and to that extent the defendant's pleading of "an implied contractual duty" must fail. Moral or social duties orinterests are less easily defined and Miss Yau herself had some difficulty in describing the nature of the duty she claimed to pursue.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> In cross-examination, the plaintiff's counsel pointed out that in the last two sentences of the letter Miss Yau seemed to be seekingconfirmation rather than conveying information. Asked how this could concern her or her company, she replied -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">"Because I was trading with BDC London. BDC London is a U.K. importer; I thought I had a duty to inform them."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>However, pressed as to why she wanted the information confirmed she then replied -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Yes, I can say it is nothing to do with me, no matter if it is true or not."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> The information was imparted by the defendant in the capacity of a volunteer. In other words, Miss Yau was not responding to an enquirybut was using her own initiative to make the communication. Whilst this does not create any separate category of defamation, theauthors of Clerk and Lindsell, at paragraph 21-100,suggest that the officiousness of the intervention is one factor to consider .IfI may presume to interpret,, I take this to mean that of a voluntary communication is clearly made in pursuance of a duty or interest,then its voluntary nature is irrelevant. However,in determining whether or not a communication is in fact made in pursuance of aduty or interest, its voluntary nature may be a factor.   In other words a man may more readily be permitted the protection of theprivilege in responding to an enquiry than in initiating the process with gratuitous information.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> I have no hesitation in agreeing with Mr. Melwani that the defendant did not have any duty, legal, social or moral, to dischargein publishing the June 4th letter. If the defendant , in the person of Miss Yau, had refrained from writing that letter, no one couldreasonably contemplate this omission as a breach of amy form of duty The question remains however had the defendant an interest inwriting the letter.  It certainly had the interest of a competitor in informing the recipients of the plaintiff's apparet fall fromgrace in the very field of their rivalry That is mot however the interest which the privilege protects. The privilege is for thelegitimate protection of the defendant own interest. It is not to be used for the disparagement of a competitor interest when theinterest of the defendant is not threatened by the subject matter communicated.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Interest is a milder concept than duty. A duty is usually clearly perceived, but an interest less so. This was evidently recognisedby Miss Yau when she conceded that the confirmation she sought had nothing to do with her. The word "interest", as relating to theinformant, was in fact omitted.by Scrutton L.J. from the very words in <u>Watt V. Lonasdon</u> relied on by both counsel as defining the issue. Lord Atkinson's, definition however includes the "interest" of the informant butconfines it to a duty or interest in making the communication rather than merely an interest in the subject matter.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> The only interest which I consider the defendant may arguably advance is that of assisting its commercial partners by giving marketinformation of products in which those partners are interested. This would assume that the recipients of the information relied onsuppliers such as the defendant to give them any such information coming to hand. It would extend the simple relationship of buyer/sellerto one in which the seller had the additional duty or interest of an informant in the trade vis a vis the buyer. It would assumethat the seller's relationship with the buyer could be adversely affected by its failure to pass such information to the seller incircumstances such as those arising here. This interest would be very close to a duty insofar as it would necessarily follow thata failure to impart this information would be poorly regarded by the commercial partner. Mr. Melwani has denied that he regardedthe defendant as having a duty and equally I cannot find that the defendant had a legitimate interest to further in passing thisinformation to its buyers. The interest the defendant was pursuing was essentially derogatory of the plaintiff rather than protectiveof itself. This must be at the defendant's peril in the event the information be false.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> The test suggested by Lindley L.J. in <u>Stuart v. Bell</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1891%5d%202%20QB%20341" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1891] 2 Q.B. 341</a>, approved and often quoted thereafter, is -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"would the great mass of right-minded men in the position of the defendant have considered it their duty under the circumstances tomake the communication?"</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>Adding the word "interest" to that question, but confining its meaning to exclude the commercial interest in disparaging a businessrival, I find the answer to be "no". The occasion was not a privileged one and the defendant is not therefore protected in its defamationof the plaintiff perpetrated through Miss Yau.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> In reaching this conclusion, I do not rely on the voluntary nature of the communication. Even in response to a query from one ofthe addressees, I would find the communication unprivileged. I do however find that the gratuitous provision of this informationemphasises the lack of duty or interest and is relevant in assessing damages.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> I have considered the issue of qualified privilege on the assumption that the defendant establishes a probability of honest beliefin the truth of what was communicated. Such belief is however a fundamental issue in itself and a failure to establish it would deprivethe defendant of the privilege even had my recent finding been in its favour. As an essential element of qualified privilege theissue of honest belief should therefore be considered on its own.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> The law in this regard was summarised by Lord Diplock in <u>Horrocks v. Lowe</u> [1975] A.C. at page 150 in these words -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Apart from those exceptional cases, what is required on the part of the defamer to entitle him to the protection of the- privilegeis positive belief in the truth of what he published or, as it is generally though tautologously termed, "honest belief""</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>His Lordship goes on to say that publication without caring about the truth is to be equated with publication with knowledge of falsity.However "carelessness, impulsiveness or irrationality" in reaching a positive belief will not on its own remove the protection affordedby the belief. In other it is the genuineness of the belief which is in issue and not the means by which it was reached.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> Miss Yau has testified that she believed in the truth of the contents of the June 4th letter. The basis of her belief she said wasa letter she received about the end of May 1991 from a company selling fuses in U.K. She went on to say -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"This told me that some unapproved fuses had been used in some electrical appliances."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>This letter was not included in the defendant's bundle of documents and Miss Yau said in cross-examination that she did not know thereason. She did not seek to produce it to the court and it was not included in the defendant's discovery. Moveover, apart from sayingthat her informant was a national retailer in the U.K., Miss Yau has not sought to identify her source.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> Miss Yau's difficulties increased when she was faced with the press release from Barnet Borough Council as incorporated in the defendant'ssolicitors' letter of 19th July 1991. This letter appears at item 8 of the plaintiff's bundle and was written in response to theplaintiff's solicitors' letter at item 3, and after the commencement of proceedings. The letter from the defendant's solicitors reliessolely on the Barnet press release in refuting the plaintiff's claim, but does not explain the nature of the defence. Nowhere inthis letter is mentioned the information Miss Yau said she received from the anonymous U.K. retailer.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> In cross-examination it was pointed out to Miss Yau that her solicitors were relying on the Barnet press release as showing the truthof her letter of 4th June 1991. Her reply confused the issue even further -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"At the time I sent out the 4th June 1991 letter, I did not have the news of the release of Barnet Borough."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>Despite this assertion, she confirmed in her next answer that the solicitors' letter of 19th July 1991 was sent with her approval.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> Miss Yau had to be aware of the serious discrepancies between the Barnet press release and the defamatory contents of her own letter.If she were relying on the press release to establish her belief in the truth of what she wrote, these discrepancies presented anobvious difficulty. Miss Yau must therefore rely on a source other than the press release to support her evidence of her honest beliefin the truth of the defamation. The anonymous U.K. retailer is the source on which she relies.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> The source of Miss Yau's information is however unidentified even in oral testimony, and the defendant has failed to discover orproduce the letter in question. Moreover, the defendant's solicitors as late as 19th July 1991 were relying solely on the press release,with Miss Yau's approval. Given all these factors, I do not find it proved that this letter existed and I find it likely to be nomore than a convenient fabrication. I found Miss Yau to be evasive and unconvincing on this point and reach the reluctant conclusionthat she was lying about the letter from the U.K. retailer.</p>    <p>    she has said in evidence that she believed in the truth of the defamation and this assertion must still be evaluated. Howeverwithout the supposed letter from the U.K. retailer, Miss Yau's evidence lacks documentary support, for she said her own letter waswritten before she knew of the press release. Even if she had relied on the press release, its wording is far removed from the defamation.Finally the defamatory letter strangely concludes with a request for information on its contents.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> I do not know where Miss Yau obtained the information for her belief, if indeed she did at all. Apart from the improbable letterfrom the anonymous U.K. retailer she has not told us, and we are left to rely for her belief on her own oral testimony. In all thecircumstances, not least her discredited evidence of the letter from the retailer, I find it improbable that she had a genuine beliefin the truth of the defamation.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> For this reason also the defendant would fail to establish the protection of qualified privilege, had I not already found the occasionitself to be unprivileged.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> There remains the issue of damages which I can deal with shortly as little help is derived from the inevitably different facts ofother cases.Mr. Leong for the plaintiff has argued for an award of $50,000 and has pointed out that it was a libel by a competitorto potential customers in the trade It also occurred at a time calculated to harm the plaintiff namely when it was negotiating asupply agreement with the recipients of the letter.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Miss. Lau for the defendant argues that it was a minimal defamation It carried no apparent credence for the recipients as the plaintiffcommenced supplying its products to them shortly thereafter. Miss Lau argues for a low or even nominal award.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> General damages, even in circumstances of aggravation, are compensatory in nature. In the absence of likely pecuniary loss they willcomprehend the plaintiff's anxiety at possible damage to its business reputation and fear of commercial repercussions with its purchasers.In this context I cannot accept that the libel was trivial, meriting only a minimal award. It was a serious libel in a situationof business rivalry which fortunately had consequences less serious than they might have been.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> Considering all these factors I find that $50,000 is in line with the authorities insofar as comparisons assist. I also find it asuitable figure to compensate the plaintiff for the injury it has suffered and make the award accordingly. An injunction is grantedin the terms prayed and interest will run on the award at the judgment rate from date of writ to payment.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> I will hear the parties on costs as the late adjournment and amendments may call for argument.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="492" valign="top"></td>            <td width="493" valign="top" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">(N.L.R.
