BACKGROUND</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  On 16 September 2006, the Plaintiff was riding a motorcycle (âMotorcycleâ) and slowing down for a red light.  Before he cameto a complete stop, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs car hit the Motorcycle from the rear, and he fell down and sustained injuries (âAccidentâ).  The Plaintiff claimedthe Accident was caused by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs negligent driving, and on 30 July 2008 commenced legal action against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant for damages for personal injuries and other loss and damages.  According to the Statement of Damages (âSODâ), the Plaintiffpitched his claim for damages at HK$2,866,634.85 with interest.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  On 20 November 2008, interlocutory judgment on liability was entered in favour of the Plaintiff against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  On 10 September 2008, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant joined as party to the present proceedings.  The Plaintiffâs witness statement was dated 30 December 2008 (âStatementâ). On 31 August 2009, the Plaintiff filed his Answer to Interrogatories (âAnswerâ) raised by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Pursuant to the order of Master Roy Yu dated 3 September 2009, the joint orthopaedic expert report by Dr Johnson Lam (âDr Lamâ)for the Plaintiff and Dr David Cheng (âDr Chengâ) for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant dated 2 April 2009 (âOrtho Reportâ) and the joint psychiatric expert report by Dr Peter Ho (âDr Hoâ) for the Plaintiffand Dr Benjamin Lai (âDr Laiâ) for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant dated 5 August 2009 (âPsy Reportâ) were to be adduced at trial without oral evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  On 30 September 2009, the Plaintiff filed his Revised Statement of Damages (âRSODâ) claiming for damages in the sum of HK$2,944,056.00with interest.

On 14 November 2009, the present proceedings were concluded with the Plaintiff filing and servingNotice of Acceptance of Sanctioned Payment for the total sum of HK$650,000.00.  The Plaintiff was entitled to costs of the action,but there was dispute as to whether he had any reasonable prospect of putting forward a claim in excess of HK$1,000,000.00.  The2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant proposed that the Plaintiffâs costs of the action be taxed on District Court scale.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  On 10 December 2009, the Plaintiff issued an <i>inter partes</i> summons (âSummonsâ) for an order that costs of the action and of the application be paid by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants on High Court scale.  In his supporting affirmation, the Plaintiff claimed that with (a) his physical/ psychiatric injuriesand disabilities and (b) his continued need to attend follow up treatments, there was reasonable prospect for him to recover damagesin excess of HK$1,000,000.00.  He claimed to have accepted the sanctioned payments in order to eliminate further strain on him andhis family as a result of prolonged litigation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">II.  LEGAL PRINCIPLES</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Plaintiff in issuing the Summons clearly followed the procedure prescribed by Seagroatt J in <i>Lai Ki v B+B</i> <i>Construction Company Limited &amp; others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%203%20HKLRD%20192" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 3 HKLRD 192</a>, 200.  In that case, the learned judge confirmed and adopted the test as stated by Glyn-Jones J in <i>Hopkins v Rees &amp; Kirby Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1959%5d%201%20WLR%20740" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1959] 1 WLR 740</a>, 742 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âPutting myself as far as I can, in the position of the plaintiff at the time when he issued that writ, am I satisfied that it wasthen obvious that this was a county court action, or was it an action which, when tried by one judge rather than another, might haveresulted in an award exceeding [the jurisdiction limit] excluding any reduction for contributory negligence?â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Seagroatt J further observed at p.197 that â[the] acid test therefore has been, ignoring all questions of contributory negligence,has the plaintiff a reasonable prospect of recovering a sum of money in excess of the [District] Court jurisdiction?â  (see also<i>Wong Wai Man v Yi Wo Yuen Aged Sanatorium Centre Limited</i> HCPI 77/2007, Suffiad J (unreported, 9 September 2008) at para.14).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In <i>Wong Chi Ho Jacky v Poon Yuk Shan</i> HCPI 910/2002 (unreported, 7 May 2004), Deputy High Court Judge Jat SC held that the test was an objective one, ie whether it wouldbe obvious to a reasonable plaintiff or his legal adviser that the case was a District Court rather than High Court case.  The subjectiveintent of the plaintiff and his legal adviser would not normally be relevant.  The learned judge recognised that one must not justlook at what was claimed in the statement of damages, and one should not look at the eventual settlement amount.  After all, therelevant time for consideration was the time when the writ was issued, and there might be all kinds of reasons why a plaintiff mightwish to accept a sum lower than what his claim might be considered worth in order to settle the claim (see also <i>Wong Choi Fung v Fung Kai Public</i> <i>School operating as Fung Kai Care and Attention Home for the Elderly</i> HCPI 534/2004, Suffiad J (unreported, 14 February 2006) paras.15 and 40-42).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">III.  INJURIES AND TREATMENT</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In the Statement, the Plaintiff claimed that at the time of the Accident he was thrown by the impact of the collision and brieflylost consciousness.  Mr Kwong, solicitor for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, submitted there was no evidence to support any head injury, which allegation he described as âunfoundedâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Drs Lai and Ho recognised there were different versions in the medical reports/records as to whether the Plaintiff suffered headinjury and/or loss of consciousness.  Dr Ho believed that the Plaintiff might not have reported a comparatively minor head injuryin the acute stages when he was suffering from pain and trauma of multiple injuries. But subsequently the treating neurosurgeonsand psychiatrists were satisfied with the diagnosis of <i>post</i>-concussional syndrome (âPCSâ) which rested on the presence of head injury.  In light of the above, it could not be said thatthe Plaintiffâs allegations of head injury and loss of consciousness were obviously untenable as at 30 July 2008 when the Writof Summons (âWritâ) was issued.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Plaintiff was taken to Tsueng Kwan O Hospital (âTKOHâ) and was admitted to the orthopaedic ward.  He sustained multipleinjuries: (a) fracture of fibular head, left knee, (b) fracture base of the first metacarpal of the left thumb, (c) fracture navicular,a tarsal bone of the left foot, and (d) multiple abrasions.  The fracture left thumb was treated by open reduction and K-wire fixationfollowed by a splint.  The left knee and foot fractures were treated conservatively with short leg plaster applied to the left foot. Follow up x-rays showed healing.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Upon discharge the Plaintiff was followed up by TKOHâs orthopaedic clinic (âOrtho Clinicâ) until August 2007.  K-wire wasremoved on 13 November 2006.  The Plaintiff walked with a stick for more than a year. According to the Statement, he received physiotherapyat United Christian Hospital (âUCHâ) from November 2006 until February 2007, weekly occupational therapy at UCH from Januaryto May 2007, and weekly neurosurgical rehabilitation treatment at UCH from January 2007 to about July 2008.  But the medical recordsshowed he received outpatient occupational therapy at UCH since May 2007 until 10 June 2008.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  At the work evaluation on 7 June 2007, the Plaintiff complained of significant decrease in left ankle range of motion and strength,difficulty in weight bearing on left ankle, limited sitting, standing and walking tolerance, and left ankle pain that affected steppingon pedals.  âHis work capacity did not match job demands but has potential to return to previous job as taxi-driver with furthertraining.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On 27 August 2007, the Plaintiff was referred for cognitive training. He started to default training on 29 January 2008.  Between30 May 2007 and 10 June 2008 he defaulted scheduled appointments 5 times and took leave 4 times.  Altogether the Plaintiff attended17 sessions from 30 May 2007 to 10 June 2008 when he refused further cognitive training.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In January 2008, the Plaintiff attended driving assessment. According to the Driver Assessment Report dated 11 February 2008 (âDAReportâ), the Plaintiff demonstrated competence and consistence in his driving performance.  There appeared to be no visual, perceptualand cognitive deficits that would interfere with driving performance.  The range of movement, muscle strength, tone and coordinationof his upper limbs and right lower limb were normal, but the Plaintiff had stiffness in his left ankle with mild muscle weaknessin his left knee and left ankle muscles.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  When tested for driving a private car with automatic transmission, the Plaintiff was able to perform shoulder check prior to lanechange and to turn his head to observe the traffic at intersections effectively.  He reported neck stiffness upon turning aroundto observe the traffic and reversing the car with right turning stiffer than left turning.  He did not complain of increased neckdiscomfort/stiffness after the assessment.  When tested for driving a light goods vehicle with manual transmission, he was able tooperate the clutch pedal effectively despite complaint of pain at the fracture site of the left lower limb.  It was concluded thatthe Plaintiff should be able to drive private car, light goods vehicle and taxi with automatic or manual transmission.  The DA Reportwas submitted to the Transport Department, and after further driving evaluation the department terminated the Plaintiffâs licencefor driving motorcycle, bus and minibus, but granted him licence for driving private car and taxi.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In the course of recovery, the Plaintiff developed symptoms of headache and lack of concentration, and was referred to the neurosurgicalclinic (âNeuro Clinicâ) of Queen Elizabeth Hospital (âQEHâ).  He was seen at such clinic on 7 November 2006 and 21 February2007. Examination was unremarkable and CT scan was normal.  According to the Statement, the Plaintiff attended follow up at the NeuroClinic once every half a year.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The Plaintiff was later referred to UCHâs psychiatric unit for symptoms of insomnia and bad temper, and was seen at UCHâs YungFung Shee Psychiatric Centre (âPsy Centreâ) since 14 June 2007.  He developed on-and-off headache, dizziness, poor concentration,forgetfulness, insomnia, and depressive/irritable mood after the Accident, and his on-and-off irritability affected the quality ofrelationship with his daughter.  He was clinically diagnosed to have PCS.  Antidepressants were prescribed and supportive psychotherapywas offered.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The Plaintiff had exacerbation in mood symptoms in April 2009 (ie after issue of the Writ) due to concurrent psychosocial stressors,including marital and financial issues, and his medications were adjusted accordingly.  According to the Psy Centreâs report dated11 June 2009, the Plaintiff continued to receive antidepressants and support psychotherapy, and he needed to continue regular followup at the Psy Centre.  So far he attended 13 sessions at the Psy Centre.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The Plaintiffâs follow up at the Ortho Clinic had ceased, but he was still followed up at the Psy Centre and Neuro Clinic, andhe received antidepressants and supportive psychotherapy.  He was granted sick leave from 16 September 2006 to 27 September 2007(ie 12.4 months) by the Ortho Clinic but none by the Psy Centre.  The Neuro Clinic granted sick leave on 4 February 2008 for headacheand on 4 August 2008 for PCS.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">IV.  SURVEILLANCE RECORDING</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  According to the surveillance report dated 31 July 2009, recordings were made of the Plaintiffâs activities on 27-29 July 2009(âRecordingâ), ie after issue of the Writ.  But such Recording could not be completely ignored as it might well lend weight toor expose the Plaintiffâs allegations as to his residual symptoms and disabilities.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The Recording showed that at about 1pm on 27 July 2009 the Plaintiff left home to take a bus to Metro City where he bought severalbags of groceries from the market.  He took a minibus to return to Hong Sing Garden.  After alighting from the minibus, he walkedup some stairs to return home.  The investigator noted the Plaintiff could move his left thumb normally, and could use the fingers/thumbof the left hand to carry bags of groceries and to grip his wallet.  He was also observed to have no difficulty in boarding minibusor negotiating stairs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The Recording showed that in the morning of 28 July 2009 the Plaintiff left home to go to a hardware shop and another shop in theshopping arcade before returning home.  He was then observed to adjust/fix the window of his home by using both hands and fingers. In the morning of 29 July 2009, the Plaintiff left home and was seen running towards Tsui Lam Estate.  He walked up the uphill ramproad and started to run in a normal manner along Tsui Lam Road before running back to Hong Sing Garden. No abnormality of the leftleg/knee was observed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">V.  EXPERT MEDICAL EVDIENCE</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Again, the Neuro and Psy Reports were prepared after issue of the Writ.  I caution myself that the fullness of the medical opinionexpressed in these reports was not available when the Writ was issued, but nonetheless I do not think the Neuro and Psy Reports shouldbe ignored altogether.  These reports canvassed the Plaintiffâs medical history, his treatment medical reports/records, and hisphysical and psychiatric conditions before/at the time of issue of the Writ.  Indeed, some of the medical opinion in such reportswas premised on such facts and matters.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(a)  Ortho Report</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The Plaintiff claimed he suffered residual pain and discomfort of the left knee/foot especially after prolonged walking, weaknessand reduced agility of the left thumb/hand, discomfort and dull aches over the left hand at times, and stretching discomfort overhis chest.  But the fractures had healed up satisfactorily.  The effect of the orthopaedic injuries was mild to moderate and prognosiswas good.  There was no need for any further orthopaedic treatment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Drs Lam and Cheng agreed that orthopaedic-wise the Plaintiff was fully recovered with little abnormality or residual pathology. Dr Cheng opined there was little permanent physical impairment, but Dr Lam noted the Plaintiff still complained there was pain onprolonged walking and some tenderness of the foot fracture, and the left thumb basal joint (ie 1<sup>st</sup> CMC joint) was stiffish.  Dr Lam opined that some decrease in dexterity of the left thumb/hand was expected since (a) the thumb wasusually considered to account for 40-50% of hand function and (b) the CMC joint of the thumb was the most mobile joint of the hand.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Drs Lam and Cheng agreed that sick leave of about a year as granted by the treating orthopaedists was reasonable, and the Plaintiffâshould be fully capable to resume the [<i>pre</i>-Accident] job, which [he] has actually done so.  His social and other activities should not be affected in a significant wayâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(b)  Psy Report</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The psychiatric symptoms reported by the Plaintiff included insomnia, headache, poor temper, hearing the voice of his deceased mother,nightmares, being forgetful, unhappy mood, dizziness, crying, suicidal idea, fear of driving, heavy breathing, palpitation, and thoughtof the Accident when passing by the site of the Accident and when facing a traffic light.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Drs Lai and Ho agreed that such symptoms satisfied the criteria for the diagnostic labels of PCS (if the Plaintiff had a head injury)and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  Dr Lai opined that in making a diagnosis of PCS and not adjustmentdisorder the treating psychiatrists might be indicating that the degree of severity of anxiety and depressed mood was not such thatthey had to make a separate and additional diagnosis of adjustment disorder.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  I disagree with Mr Kwongâs suggestion that the Plaintiffâs claim for psychiatric injury was âunfoundedâ.  First, the Plaintiffâsallegation of loss of consciousness and hence head injury was not obviously untenable at the time of issue of the Writ (see paragraph10 above).  Secondly, the existence or otherwise of any head injury only went to the issue of presence or absence of PCS and notthat of adjustment disorder.  Dr Lai opined that the adjustment disorder was a reaction to various stressors, including physicaldisabilities after the Accident, inability to return to work, financial issue, relationship problem with daughter/wife as well ascompensation issue.  So assuming there was no relationship problem with the family members prior to the Accident (and none was suggested),Drs Lai and Ho agreed it was compatible that the adjustment disorder was the result of the Accident and its aftermath.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  As regards the Plaintiffâs psychiatric condition, Dr Lai noted that clinically the Plaintiff was mildly depressed, but he hadnormal cognitive functioning with appropriate degree of concentration and memory and absence of irritable mood.  Dr Lai pointed outthat when the Plaintiff first attended the Psy Centre in July 2007 only mild degree of symptoms was recorded until he complainedof exacerbation of symptoms at the follow up on 22 April 2009 (including poorer sleep, lots of worries about finance, lots of headache,hearing voice of his deceased mother for the last few months, fleeting suicidal idea, subjective irritability, poor memory, anxiety,constant need to watch the rear mirror, and generally low mood because of marital problems), which the treating psychiatrists saidwas due to concurrent psychosocial stressors, including marital and financial issues.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Dr Lai took the view that the above developments appeared to be inconsistent with the normal course of PCS and adjustment disorder,which was gradual improvement over time although further substantial improvement was not expected after 2 years.  Dr Lai said althoughit could be argued that the Plaintiffâs depressed mood accounted for or contributed to the increased headache and dizziness, heshould not have been affected by the stressor of inability to return to work (since orthopaedic follow up had ceased and Drs Lamand Cheng agreed he should be fully capable of resuming work as a taxi-driver), and if he returned to work as a taxi-driver it waslikely his financial stress would be decreased.  Dr Lai further noted that even though it appeared that the Plaintiffâs relationshipwith his wife was partially related to his increased irritability after the Accident, his marital relationship appeared not to berelated to his irritability at the time of the interview for the Psy Report.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  On the other hand, Dr Ho noted that the Plaintiff suffered multiple injuries, and the treating neurosurgeons and psychiatrists weresatisfied he had PCS of which headache and poor concentration were typical features.  Dr Ho opined there might be a difference betweenbeing assessed as capable of returning to a job and being able to perform a job satisfactorily and maintaining the previous incomein real life situations.  Even mild pain or mild impairment of concentration could affect driving performance especially when onehad to drive continuously for long distances.  There was also a safety concern.  Dr Ho was of the view that the Plaintiffâs residualsymptoms would have some effect on his occupational functioning and income as a taxi-driver, and it could be a significant stressorfor those who had to support their family and who were not well off financially.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Drs Lai and Ho agreed that points of inconsistencies might raise a note of caution in assessing the nature and degree of the Plaintiffâspsychiatric condition, but Dr Ho pointed out it was not uncommon to detect some degree of apparent âinconsistenciesâ in mostpatientsâ accounts over different time frames, and in the Plaintiffâs case the inconsistencies were not that gross/unreasonableand overall the symptoms he complained of could be considered as reasonably consistent.  In this respect, Dr Ho believed that financialstress and marital disharmony could be contributory factors affecting the course of the Plaintiffâs psychiatric condition.  Apartfrom his irritability, his financial and sexual problem might also be factors that could affect his relationship with his wife. Further, the Plaintiff suffered serious physical injuries but had not reported serious residual symptoms. Rather he reported significantimprovement of his orthopaedic symptoms, and did not show strong tendency to impress the psychiatric experts with severe symptomsor give inexplicably absurd answers during the cognitive tests to impress that he had markedly impaired cognitive functions.  Overall,Dr Ho thought the chance that the Plaintiff exaggerated his mental symptoms was low.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Drs Lai and Ho agreed that the symptoms of PCS could be regarded as permanent, but as his headaches and dizziness might be relatedto his depressed mood, such complaints would be better when his mood was better.  Since the prognosis of adjustment disorder generallydepended on development of the stressors, if the Plaintiff could return to work, had less financial problem and had better relationshipwith his wife, he would be expected to be better in his mood.  Based on his normal previous personality, the absence of vulnerabilityfactor to development of psychiatric illness, the absence of persisting physical disabilities impeding him from returning to work,Drs Lai and Ho thought it likely that the Plaintiff would only suffer from residual symptoms or residual effects of his adjustmentdisorder after completion of further psychiatric treatment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Drs Lai and Ho opined that from a psychiatric perspective the permanent disabilities would be in the mild range and the Plaintiffâslevels of impairment were likely to be compatible with most useful functioning.  He had no problem in self care, had motivation toreturn to work, could travel around and had trips away from Hong Kong, but he might be affected by his residual psychiatric symptoms.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Assuming the Plaintiff suffered from head injury (and I have found that such contention was not obviously untenable at the timeof issue of the Writ), Dr Lai opined that appropriate sick leave for PCS and adjustment disorder was about 1 year after the Accident,but Dr Ho considered about 1Â½ years would be appropriate from a psychiatric perspective.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">V.  PAIN, SUFFERING AND LOSS AMENITIES (âPSLAâ)</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The Plaintiff was 45 years old at the time of the Accident.  He claimed that before the Accident he enjoyed playing badminton andswimming, but had to give up such sports as a result of the injuries and disabilities after the Accident.  In my view, there is somedoubt as to whether he had to give up swimming.  In fact, on 8 and 22 April 2008 the occupational therapists encouraged the Plaintiffto increase his exercise regime by swimming. But I need not come to any firm view since this issue had insignificant impact on theaward for PSLA.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Ms Fung, solicitor for the Plaintiff, submitted that the Plaintiffâs injuries and disabilities fell within the âseriousâ category,and damages for PSLA in the sum of HK$350,000.00 as pleaded in the SOD were probably an underestimate with the likely award to bein the region of HK$400,000.00.  Mr Kwong conceded that an award of damages for PSLA would be in the region of HK$300,000.00 to HK$350,000.00. Having considered the authorities cited by Ms Fung [1] and Mr Kwong [2], there was reasonable prospect for the Plaintiff to makeout a claim for <u>HK$350,000.00</u> for PSLA at the time of issue of the Writ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">VI<i>I.  PRE-ACCIDENT WORK</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The Plaintiff claimed he previously worked as a salesman.  In November 2005 (ie about 10 months before the Accident), he was laidoff by his employer, so he purchased a taxi and started full-time taxi-driving.  But he was not new to taxi-driving:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) according to the Initial Work Assessment Form of UCHâs occupational therapy department dated 30 May 2007, it was stated thatthe Plaintiffâs premorbid occupation was âTaxi driver x 1.5 yearsâ;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) according to the DA Report dated 11 February 2008, it was recorded that â[the Plaintiff] reported that he had driven for over20 years as a taxi driverâ;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) according to the Psy Report, the Plaintiff had been a part-time taxi-driver for 8-10 years before he was laid off, and he purchaseda taxi around 2001 or 2002 and sold it in 2003;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d) according to the Answer, the Plaintiff confirmed he had been working as a taxi-driver since about 1990 on a part-time basis, iebetween 1990 and 1995 he usually worked on weekends (ie about 8 days <i>per</i> month) and between 1996 and November 2005 he worked about 10 days a year.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  It was obvious from the different versions of the Plaintiffâs <i>pre</i>-November 2005 experience as a taxi-driver (all of which emanated from him and none of which he retracted) that he was not new todriving/leasing taxis and that he had much more recent experience in leasing taxis than what Ms Fung tried to portray.  Ms Fung suggestedthat the Plaintiff had limited recent experience in leasing taxis because he only drove a taxi for 10 days a year for the 9 yearsprior to November 2005.  But such submission ignored the fact that the Plaintiff was owner of a taxi from 2001-2002 until 2003. If, as he claimed, he were a part-time taxi-driver for only 10 days a year, the common sense conclusion must be that he leased outhis taxi to others and thereby earned rental income over a period of 2 to 3 years.  It is inherently illogical to contemplate thathe would buy a taxi and pay for its upkeep but let it stand idle for over 350 days a year.  In my view, even at the time of issueof the Writ there was no reasonable prospect for the Plaintiff in establishing that he only had minimal useful experience/contactto draw upon for leasing out his taxi in the <i>post</i>-Accident period.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  According to SOD, the Plaintiff worked 26 days a month (ie 1 rest day each week) and earned daily and monthly gross income of aboutHK$1,600.00 and HK$41,600.00 (ie HK$1,600.00 x 26 days) respectively.  In the 5.53 months he worked as a full-time taxi-driver duringthe 2006/2007 tax year (ie from 1 April to 16 September 2006), the annual and monthly expenses were HK$208,664.83 and HK$17,388.74(ie HK$208,664.83 Ã· 12 months) respectively.  Fuel expenses were HK$150.00-HK$180.00 <i>per</i> day or HK$2,800.00-HK$3,000.00 <i>per</i> month. So the total monthly expenses for operating the Plaintiffâs taxi were about HK$20,200.00, and his <i>pre</i>-Accident monthly net income was HK$21,400.00 (ie HK$41,600.00 â HK$20,200.000). </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  On the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of the hearing, Mr Kwong conceded it was appropriate to adopt the above calculations as the Plaintiffâs <i>pre</i>-Accident monthly net income. On such common ground, there was no room for any suggestion that in the 5.53 months prior to the Accident(see the above paragraph) the Plaintiff leased out his taxi to others on his rest days to earn rental income.  Had it been otherwise,his <i>pre</i>-Accident monthly gross and net income would have exceeded HK$41,600.00 and HK$21,400.00 respectively, which would have contradictedthe partiesâ common ground and hence would have been unfair to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">VII<i>I.  PLAINTIFFâS WORK-RELATED COMPLAINTS</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Even in December 2009, according to the Statement and the Answer, the Plaintiff still claimed that his left knee/ankle would becomepainful after walking for more than 15 minutes, and his left thumb/fingers were weak and less agile.  I am not persuaded he wouldhave been able to establish such assertions since half a year earlier in July 2009 the Recording already showed dexterity and weight-bearingby his left hand/thumb and ability to run normally for half an hour.  The Plaintiff tried to explain this away in the Answer by sayingthat he jogged ânear my residence about Â½ hour once a week to twice a monthâ because he was medically advised to do more exercise. In my view, this still did not explain his ability to run (which necessarily put greater pressure on the knee/ankle than walking)for Â½ hour when he claimed to be painful after walking for 15 minutes.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  I remind myself that I should not view the matter with hindsight. But at the same time, I should not accept the Plaintiffâs claimin the SOD at face value.  Broadly speaking, the above analysis served to highlight that the Plaintiff must have been overly uninhibitedin his claims as to his residual physical symptoms and disabilities as his recovery progressed.  In the circumstances, although Iaccept it was recorded in the outpatient progress sheets of UCHâs occupational therapy department (âProgress Sheetsâ) thatin mid-2007 (see paragraph 13 above) the Plaintiff still complained of pain and difficulty in weight-bearing on left foot that effectedstanding, walking and stepping on pedals, by January 2008 the residual effect was mild enough for him to get through the drivingassessment (see paragraphs 15-16 above) and there was record of steady progress in physical tolerance in the Progress Sheets in thefirst half of 2008.  In any event, the Plaintiff told Drs Lai and Ho he was able to drive his taxi because it used automatic gearand he did not need to use his left foot.  The above was in line with the opinion of Drs Lam and Cheng that orthopaedic-wise thePlaintiff could resume his <i>pre</i>-Accident job.  I am of the view that there was reasonable prospect in establishing that although his physical injuries and disabilitiesmight have prevented him from returning to full-time taxi-driving during his sick leave period and perhaps shortly thereafter, theywould not have caused him any work-related difficulty by the time of issue of the Writ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  But the picture was different from the psychiatric perspective. The Plaintiff told Drs Lai and Ho that he drove slowly (which causedhis customers to complain) and had fear of driving and of being unable to react or stop the car quickly.  He had thoughts of theAccident when passing the site of the Accident (accompanied by heavy breathing and palpitation) and when facing a traffic light.Accordingto the Statement and the records in the Progress Sheets, the Plaintiff still had headaches and dizziness despite taking medicationsprescribed by the neurosurgeons and psychiatrists.  He had insomnia and difficulty in falling asleep so the treatment psychiatristsreminded him to take medications before going to sleep at night.  But he would not take medications with warning labels that statedâæ­¤è¥å¯ä½¿äººæç¡æ â¦â¦â and/or âå¦åè¥ç©å½±é¿ï¼å¿é§é§æææ§æ©æ¢°â if he had to drive his taxi. Withhis insomnia and the psychiatric medications, the Plaintiff felt he could not concentrate during the day.  The Psy Report noted thePlaintiff claimed he had difficulty in thinking about the route, and might forget to turn a corner.  He also complained he couldnot stop his taxi if he wanted to have a rest.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Dr Lai was of the view that the Plaintiff could be considered mentally capable of returning to work as a taxi-driver, but he mightbe mildly affected in his work tolerance/efficiency as a result of the residual effect and residual symptoms of his psychiatric condition. Assuming that the Plaintiff had head injury (and I have found that such contention was not obviously untenable) but not severe headinjury at the time of the Accident, Dr Lai opined that the Plaintiff suffered from mild degree of PCS with impaired concentrationand/or memory, but it should not affect his ability in taxi-driving to any significant degree.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Dr Lai opined that any anxiety in driving should more likely be associated with driving a motorbike rather than a taxi.  The exacerbationof symptoms in April 2009 (ie 2Â½ years after the Accident) would be regarded as related to stressors including marital issue, financialissue and current litigation, and should respond favourably to treatment particularly when such stressors were reduced or resolved. The Plaintiff was not expected to have persisting suicidal idea, hearing voices, anxiety during driving and depressed mood, andwas likely to have improvement and further progress of his stressors.  Dr Lai opined that long term psychiatric treatment/medicationwould not be required.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  On the other hand, Dr Ho said that from a psychiatric perspective the Plaintiff might still be considered as capable of returningto work as a taxi-driver, but his work tolerance, efficiency and adaptive ability might be significantly affected by his psychiatricsymptoms.  His symptoms of occasional anxiety and fleeting suicidal ideas were causes for concern if he drove on the road, and themarkedly impaired concentration ability he displayed on simple testing was also a factor that had to be taken into considerationsince high concentration ability would be needed for driving on the road over a long period and for recalling different routes withouterror.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Dr Ho opined it was not unreasonable that people who had had a serious road accident would have some fear of having another roadaccident, and such anxiety would not necessarily be limited to situations that were exact replica of the circumstances at the timeof the accident.  He said it was well known for patients who encountered significant stressor to get distressed when exposed to circumstancesresembling the stressor.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  In my view, taking in account the medical history of the Plaintiff and his psychiatric condition(as evident from the medical reportsfrom the Psy Centre and the Progress Sheets), and the fact that he was still on neurosurgical and psychiatric follow up and stilltaking psychiatric medications at the time of issue of the Writ, he had reasonable prospect in establishing that he could returnto taxi-driving on a part-time but not full-time basis due to his headaches, dizziness, anxiety/fear, PCS and psychiatric medications. I caution myself that the expert opinion expressed in the Psy Report was only available after the issue of the Writ, but in comingto the above conclusion on the pre-Writ materials I draw comfort from Dr Laiâs acknowledgment that the Plaintiffâs psychiatriccondition would affect his work tolerance and efficiency, Dr Hoâs view that the Plaintiffâs work tolerance, efficiency and adaptiveability in respect of taxi-driving might be significantly affected by his psychiatric symptoms, and their belief that the symptomsof PCS were permanent and that the Plaintiff would still suffer from residual symptoms or residual effect of his adjustment disordereven after completion of further psychiatric treatment (see paragraph 35 above).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">IX.  PRE-TRIAL LOSS OF EARNINGS</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Under the SOD, the claim for <i>pre</i>-trial loss of earnings covered a period from 16 September 2006 to 18 March 2009 (ie the notional date of trial).  Hence, by the timeof issue of the Writ on 30 July 2008, most of the <i>pre</i>-trial loss of earnings had been incurred, and the Plaintiff would have known of the factual basis for such claim.  So in determiningwhether he had reasonable prospect of establishing his claim for <i>pre</i>-trial loss of earnings, I should consider the available documents and the Plaintiffâs averments in the Statement and the RSOD andnot just limit myself to the pleaded assertions in the SOD.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  For the purpose of framing the claim for <i>pre</i>-trial loss of earnings in the SOD, the Plaintiff adopted various distinct time periods which did not exactly match the time periodsadopted in the RSOD and the Statement.  I adopt the time periods set out below as they best lend themselves to analysis.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(a)  16 September 2006 to 31 March 2007</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  I am satisfied the Plaintiff had reasonable prospect of establishing he could not work at all during his sick leave period from16 September 2006 to 27 September 2007.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  But I note the Plaintiff gave several versions of his claim for loss of earnings for the period from 16 September 2006 to 31 March2007:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(a) In the SOD, the Plaintiff claimed he leased out his taxi to friends for about HK$4,450.00 <i>per</i> month, so taking into account the monthly maintenance expenses for the taxi (âExpensesâ) in the sum of HK$15,510.00, his monthlyand total loss of earnings for the relevant period were respectively HK$32,470.00 (ie HK$21,400.00 â HK$4,450.00 + HK$15,520.00)and HK$211,055.00 (ie HK$32,470.00 x 6.5 months).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(b) In the RSOD, the Plaintiff claimed he leased out his taxi to friends for HK$4,938.00 <i>per</i> month, so taking into account the monthly Expenses in the sum of HK$12,600.00, his monthly and total loss of earnings for the relevantperiod were respectively HK$29,062.00 (ie HK$21,400.00 â HK$4,938.00 + HK$12,600.00) and HK$188,903.00 (ie HK$29,062.00 x 6.5 months).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(c) In the Statement, the Plaintiff claimed he leased out his taxi to earn rental income in the sum of HK$32,100.00 for the wholeof the 2006/2007 tax year or HK$2,675.00 <i>per</i> month (ie HK$32,100.00 Ã· 12 months). Thus, the Plaintiffâs total rental income for the relevant period was HK$17,387.50 (ie HK$2,675.00x 6.5 months).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The Plaintiff did not explain why he put forward 3 different sums of HK$4,450.00, HK$4,938.00 and HK$2,675.00 as his monthly rentalincome from leasing out his taxi for the relevant period, so one inevitably views his claim with a degree of skepticism.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  I now turn to the documents. The starting point was the Plaintiffâs profit and loss account (âAccountâ) for the 2006/2007tax year submitted tothe Inland Revenue Department (âIRDâ).  It appeared that the IRD in adopting the net profit of HK$53,895.17shown in the Account as the Plaintiffâs taxable profit income actually accepted such Account.  Such Account gave the Plaintiffâstotal income from driving and leasing out his taxi for the whole tax year in the sum of HK$300,900.00 without any breakdown betweenthe 2 sources of income.  But a schedule that was alleged to be subsequently submitted by the Plaintiff to the IRD (âScheduleâ)in relation to his income for the 2006/2007 tax year gave a breakdown of HK$268,800.00 (said to be derived from HK$1,600.00 x 165days) being income from his own taxi-driving and HK$31,200.00 (ie HK$300.00 x 107 âdaysâ) being income from leasing out his taxi. Nevertheless, other than such Schedule, there were no primary documents which showed that (a) the Plaintiff drove his taxi for 165days, (b) he leased out his taxi for 107 âdaysâ, and (c) the rental income <i>per</i> âdayâ during that period was HK$300.00. There was also no suggestion that the IRD approved the relevant Schedule.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  I pause to make 2 observations. First, although the Schedule stated that the taxi rental income of HK$31,200.00 was calculated onthe basis of 107 âdaysâ, it was plain that the Plaintiff in referring to HK$300.00 and not HK$600.00 or HK$550.00 was in factreferring to 107 day or night shifts and not 107 full days that comprised 2 shifts a day (see paragraphs 83and 87(a) below).  Secondly,the calculations in the relevant Schedule in respect of the Plaintiffâs income from his own taxi-driving contained an arithmeticalerror.  On the basis of average daily earnings of HK$1,600.00, the total sum of HK$268,800.00 amounted to 168 and not 165 days oftaxi-driving by the Plaintiff (ie HK$268,800.00 Ã· HK$1,600.00).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  But even on the Plaintiffâs own case, his bare assertions as to the breakdown in the relevant Schedule could not be accepted. As shown in paragraphs 42-43 and 54 above, in the first 5.53 months of the 2006/2007 tax year the Plaintiff was engaged in full-timetaxi-driving without leasing out his taxi, and in the latter 6.47 months of such tax year he only leased out his taxi without engagingin any taxi-driving himself.  Against such background and on the basis of the breakdown in the relevant Schedule, the Plaintiff wouldhave engaged in taxi-driving for an average of 30.4 days (ie 168 days Ã· 5.53 months) each month, which contradicted his own casethat on average he only engaged in his own taxi-driving for 26 days <i>per</i> month with 1 rest day a week (see paragraph 42 above).  Had the Plaintiff driven his taxi every day without any rest day (as suggestedby the allegation of taxi-driving for 30.4 days each month), his <i>pre</i>-Accident gross and net monthly income would have exceeded HK$41,600.00 and HK$21,400.00 respectively, and that would have been outsidethe partiesâ common ground as to the Plaintiffâs <i>pre</i>-Accident earnings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Thus, even on the Plaintiffâs own case, he would not have been able to show that in the first 5.53 months of the 2006/2007 taxyear his earnings from his own taxi-driving would be as high as HK$268,800.00.  Even on his own case, the Plaintiffâs total grossincome from his own taxi-driving could only have been HK$230,048.00 (ie HK$1,600.00 x 26 days x 5.53 months) and his total grossincome from leasing out the taxi should have been HK$70,852.00 (ie HK$300,900.00 â HK$230,048.00).  In such circumstances, themonthly income from leasing out the taxi during the 2006/2007 tax year should be HK$10,950.85 (ie HK$70,852.00 Ã· 6.47 months). Since the Plaintiffâs sole source of income during the period from 16 September 2006 to 31 March 2007 was from leasing out histaxi, his total loss of earnings for the relevant period should have been <u>HK$149,128.00</u> (ie (HK$21,400.00 â HK$10,950.85 + HK$12,600.00) x 6.47 months). Since the Plaintiff conceded in the RSOD that the monthly Expensesonly cost HK$12,600.00 for the relevant period, I see no reason to adopt the higher figure of HK$15,520.00 as pleaded in the SOD.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  In my view, the Plaintiff had no reasonable prospect of establishing loss of earnings for the period from 16 September 2006 to 31March 2007 in excess of HK$149,128.00.  But it is significant to note that since the Plaintiffâs average monthly income from leasingout his taxi during such period was HK$10,950.85 (see the above paragraph), at HK$300.00 <i>per</i> shift (see paragraph 58 above) he must have leased out the taxi for 36.5 shifts (ie HK$10,950.85 Ã· HK$300.00) <i>per</i> month.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(b)  1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  For the sick leave period from 1 April 2006 to 27 September 2007, I am satisfied that the Plaintiff had reasonable prospect of establishingthat he could not work at all during such period.  For the period from 28 September 2007 to 31 March 2008, the Plaintiff claimedhe was unable to resume full-time taxi-driving due to his injuries and the effect of his psychiatric mediations and could only returnto part-time taxi-driving, but he also leased out the taxi to earn rental income.  As explained in paragraph 51 above, I am satisfiedthe Plaintiff had reasonable prospect of establishing his proposition.  After all, the records in the Progress Sheets showed thatduring the relevant period the Plaintiff returned to part-time taxi-driving on trial basis (see paragraph 67 below).  In my view,it was the calculation of loss of earnings for the relevant period that gave rise to concern.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Again, the Plaintiff gave several versions of his claim for loss of earnings for the 2007/2008 tax year:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(a) In the SOD, the Plaintiff claimed that the monthly loss of earnings from 1 April to 27 September 2007 were HK$32,470.00 (see similarcalculations in paragraph 55(a) above) and from 28 September 2007 to 31 March 2008 were HK$32,745.00 (ie HK$21,400.00 â HK$5,175.00(average monthly income) + HK$16,520.00 (average monthly Expenses)).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(b) In the RSOD and the Statement, the Plaintiff claimed he earned HK$46,500.00 during the 2007/2008 tax year which made up of HK$30,000.00from his own part-time taxi-driving after expiry of the sick leave period and HK$16,500.00 (ie HK$300.00 x 55 days) for leasing outthe taxi to friends.  Thus, his average gross monthly income was HK$3,875.00 (ie HK$46,500.00 Ã· 12 months).  After taking into accountthe monthly Expenses of HK$12,600.00, his monthly and total loss of earnings for the relevant period were respectively HK$30,125.00(ie HK$21,400.00 â HK$3,875.00 + HK$12,600.00) and HK$361,500.00 (ie HK$30,125.00 x 12 months).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  I find it strange that (a) for the sick leave period from 1 April to 27 September 2007 the Plaintiff claimed he earned average monthlyrental income for leasing out his taxi variously at HK$4,450.00 in the SOD (see paragraph 55(a) above) and  HK$1,375.00 (ie HK$16,500.00Ã· 12 months) in the RSOD, and (b) for the <i>post</i>-sick leave period from 28 September 2007 to 31 March 2008 the Plaintiff claimed he earned average gross monthly income variouslyat HK$5,175.00 in the SOD and HK$3,875.00 in the RSOD.  All of the above assertions emanated from the Plaintiff who gave no explanationfor the discrepancies.  In my view, this suggested that the Plaintiffâs case on loss of earnings must be approached with caution.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The Plaintiffâs Account for the 2007/2008 tax year stated that his gross total income from his own taxi-driving and from leasingout the taxi was HK$46,500.00 and the total Expenses were HK$178,429.22 thereby resulting in a loss of HK$129,929.22.  However, onthe basis of total Expenses of HK$178,429.22 as stated in the relevant Account (with itemised breakdown), the loss should have beenHK$131,929.22 (ie HK$178,429.22 â HK$46,500.00) and not HK$129,929.22 given in the Account.  With the detailed breakdown for theExpenses in the relevant Account, this gave rise to concern that the Plaintiff might have earned more than HK$46,500.00 in orderto arrive at a loss of HK$129,929.22.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Nevertheless, the Schedule in relation to the Plaintiffâs income for the 2007/2008 tax year gave a breakdown of HK$30,000.00 beingincome from his own taxi-driving and HK$16,500.00 (ie HK$300.00 x 55 days) being income from leasing out his taxi. But such breakdowndid not state the number of shifts/days in which the Plaintiff drove the taxi during the tax year.  Further, there were no primarydocuments that showed the number of days/shifts the Plaintiff drove the taxi to allegedly earn a sum of HK$30,000.00, the numberof shifts for which he leased out his taxi, and the rental income <i>per</i> shift during the relevant period. There was also no suggestion that the IRD approved the relevant Schedule.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  I now turn to the documents in relation to the Plaintiffâs part-time taxi-driving.

In my view, thissat well with the Plaintiffâs claim that he earned HK$30,000.00 from his own part-time taxi-driving during the 2007/2008 tax year. The total income of HK$30,000.00 for the Plaintiffâs own part-time taxi-driving for the <i>post</i>-sick leave period from 28 September 2007 to 31 March 2008 (ie 6.1 months) meant that his weekly income on average would be HK$1,229.51(ie HK$30,000.00 Ã· 6.1 months Ã· 4 weeks).  Compared with his <i>pre</i>-Accident average income of HK$1,600.00 for each full day of taxi-driving, his <i>post</i>-Accident daily earnings of HK$1,229.51 corresponded to a few hours of taxi-driving <i>per</i> week.  On the above analysis, I find that at the time of issue of the Writ the Plaintiff had reasonable prospect in establishinghe could only earn HK$30,000.00 from his own part-time taxi-driving from 28 September 2007 to 31 March 2008.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Mr Kwong argued there was no evidence from the treating hospitals that the Plaintiff could not resume full-time taxi-driving afterexpiry of his sick leave, which he submitted was supported by the medical opinion of Drs Lam, Cheng and Lai and the DA Report.  Hesubmitted that at best the Plaintiff could return to full-time taxi-driving after 1Â½ years as suggested by Dr Ho or at worst upondischarge from occupational therapy on 10 June 2008 (ie 18 or 20.8 months from the date of the Accident).  On the basis of such submissions,the Plaintiff was merely capable of part-time taxi-driving up to mid-March or mid-June 2007, which was in line with the analysisin the above paragraph.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The more vexing question is whether at the time of issue of the Writ the Plaintiff had any reasonable prospect in establishing hisclaim for loss of earnings on the basis that he leased out his taxi for only 55 days during the whole 2007/2008 tax year, ie allowingthe taxi to incur Expenses but to stand idle for more than 360 days in the year.  In my view, it is obvious that the Plaintiff hadno such reasonable prospect, and the only reasonable view was that the Plaintiff could and/or should have leased out the taxi formore shifts than averred in the SOD or the RSOD.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  First, the Plaintiff claimed in the Statement that he only leased out the taxi for brief periods because he was not prepared tolease out to any driver âå çºææéä¸ç§è¦æåæ­¡åéçå¸æ©é§é§æç¼çæå¤ï¼ä»¤è³æäº¦æè²¬ä»»â.  Butas shown in paragraph 41 above such contention had been exploded â the Plaintiff must have had more experience and contacts forleasing out taxi than he would let the court believe.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Secondly, even on the Plaintiffâs own case, the Plaintiff was able to lease out his taxi for 107 shifts during the 6.47 monthsfrom 16 September 2006 to 31 March 2007 which was almost double the 55 shifts leased out during the 12 months from 1 April 2007 to31 March 2008.  There was no reasonable explanation for the sharp drop in leasing out the taxi.  If the Plaintiffâs explanationin the Statement (see the above paragraph) were correct, then there was no reason for the Plaintiff to be able to lease out the taxifor 107 shifts in the more acute stages of his rehabilitation.  Even worse, as shown in paragraph 61 above, the Plaintiff shouldhave leased out the taxi for an average of 36.5 shifts <i>per</i> month for the period from 16 September 2006 to 31 March 2007.  This reflected an even sharper drop in leasing out the taxi in the2007/2008 tax year which was wholly unexplained.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Thirdly, according to the SOD, the Plaintiffâs gross income for the period from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008 was HK$57,822.50(ie (HK$4,450.00 x 5.9 months) + (HK$5,175.00 x 6.1 months)), which was more than the total gross income in the sum of HK$46,500.00shown in the RSOD and the Statement.  On the basis that the Plaintiff earned HK$30,000.00 from his own part-time taxi-driving duringthe 2007/2008 tax year, there was real likelihood that even on the Plaintiffâs own case he actually leased out his taxi for morethan 55 shifts and thereby earned more than HK$16,500.00 in taxi rental income during the relevant period.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Even if the Plaintiff did not, there is still a strong case for contending that such failure could not be blamed on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  After all, damages were meant to compensate the Plaintiff for loss caused by and not being too remote a consequence ofthe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs negligence.  The Plaintiff was therefore under a duty to mitigate his loss, and failure to discharge such duty wouldentail a reduction in the damages that might be awarded.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  The classic statement on mitigation of loss could be found in <i>McGregor on Damages</i> 18<sup>th</sup> ed para.7-004 at p.236: ââ¦â¦ the claimant must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss to him consequent upon the defendantâswrong and cannot recover damages for any such loss which he could thus have avoided but has failed, through unreasonable action orinaction, to avoid. Put shortly, the claimant cannot recover for avoidable lossâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  In <i>Chua Ming Yuen v Hentron Investments Limited &amp; anor</i> CACV50/2005 (unreported, 30 November 2005), a case not cited by the parties, Yeung JA in giving the judgment of the court said asfollows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â71.  The duty to mitigate loss imposes upon the plaintiff a duty to act reasonably to reduce the extent of the damages as ââ¦theplaintiffâ¦cannot recover for a loss avoidable by reasonable action on his own part, because, if he could reasonably have avoidedit, it would not be regarded as caused by the wrongdoerâ (per Robert Goff J in <i>Koch Marine Inc v DâAmica Societa di Navigatione, The Elena dâAmico</i> [1980] 1 Lloydâs Rep. 75).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">72.          âThe criterion for reasonableness, stated concisely in the words of James L.J. in <i>Dunkirk Colliery Co v Lever</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281878%29%209%20Ch%20D%2020" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1878) 9 Ch D 20</a>, which were cited with approval by Viscount Haldane in <i>British Westinghouse Co v Underground Ry</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1912%5d%20AC%20673" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1912] AC 673</a>, is that the claimant is not âunder any obligation to do anything other than in the ordinary course of businessâ. This terminology,with its reference to business, is geared more to contract than to tort, and, although most of the cases are contract cases, it isbetter, in order to include tort, to speak simply of the ordinary course or of the ordinary course of events.â (<i>McGregor on Damages</i> para. 7-067)â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  In my view, obviously it could not be said to be reasonable in the ordinary course of events for the Plaintiff (a) to lease outhis taxi for only 55 shifts to earn HK$16,500.00 as suggested in the Schedule or (b) to engage in his own part-time taxi-drivingand to lease out the taxi merely to earn HK$57,822.50 (see paragraph 73 above) as suggested in the SOD for the whole 2007/2008 taxyear, and to leave the taxi to stand idle but to incur Expenses for the rest of the tax year. Any loss of earnings arising from unreasonableconduct by the Plaintiff would plainly be avoidable loss.  The Plaintiffâs subjective concerns (which had been exploded by theanalysis in paragraph 41 above) were irrelevant and could not satisfy the criterion of reasonableness in respect of the duty to mitigateloss.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  The next question concerned the number of shifts/days the Plaintiff would have leased out his taxi for proper mitigation of loss. Mr Kwong submitted that on a best case scenario the Plaintiff would have been able to lease out the taxi for 2 shifts <i>per</i> day at HK$320.00 <i>per</i> shift for 30 days each month immediately after expiry of the Plaintiffâs sick leave period.  I find such contention overly optimistic. Any driver who leased the Plaintiffâs taxi would sensibly have required some rest and/or leave days, and the Plaintiff might notnecessarily have been able to drive on those days.  I also bear in mind that the Plaintiff drove the taxi himself for a day or soeach week for a few hours at a time on a trial basis and the occupational therapists recommended gradual increase of taxi-drivinghours as part of his rehabilitation.  This might have impact on the number of shifts that the Plaintiff could lease out for his taxi.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  However, to err on the side of caution in favour of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, I assess loss of earnings for the 2007/2008 tax year on the basis that the Plaintiff could have earned HK$30,000.00 fromhis own part-time taxi-driving and that he would have leased out the taxi for 26 days (ie 52 shifts) <i>per</i> month at HK$600.00 <i>per</i> day (ie HK$320.00 + HK$280.00 as shown in paragraph 87(a) above).  There was no evidence before me that the day and night shiftswould both attract rental income of HK$320.00 (see paragraph 83 below).  This is even more favourable to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant than the average 36.5 shifts <i>per</i> month for the period from 16 September to 31 March 2007 (see paragraph 61above).  Such assessment envisaged that drivers who leasedthe Plaintiffâs taxi would have rest/leave days of, say, 1 day <i>per</i> week, and the Plaintiff could take up part-time taxi-driving on those days.  I am prepared to assume there was reasonable prospectfor the Plaintiff in establishing that he would have earned <u>HK$</u><u>190,800.00</u> (ie [HK$21,400.00 â (HK$30,000.00 Ã· 12) â (HK$600.00 x 26 days) + HK$12,600.00] x 12 months) for the 2007/2008 tax year.  Sincethe Plaintiff conceded in the RSOD that the monthly Expenses for the taxi cost HK$12,600.00 for the relevant period, I see no reasonto adopt the higher figure of HK$15,520.00 or HK$16,520.00 as pleaded in the SOD.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(c)  1 April 2008 to 31 May 2008</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  During the period from 1 April 2008 to May 2008, the Plaintiff claimed he continued to drive his taxi on a part-time basis and healso leased it out to earn rental income.  For the reasons given in paragraphs 51 and 62 above, I am satisfied that the Plaintiffhad reasonable prospect in establishing such contention at the time of issue of the Writ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  But the Plaintiff again gave different versions as to his income during such period:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(a) In the SOD, the Plaintiff claimed his gross monthly income during this period was HK$5,175.00 and the monthly Expenses were HK$16,520.00,thus the monthly loss of earnings were HK$32,745.00 (ie HK$21,400.00 â HK$5,175.00 + HK$16,520.00).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(b) In the RSOD, the Plaintiff claimed his gross monthly income was HK$3,875.00 and the monthly Expenses were HK$12,600.00, thus themonthly loss of earnings was HK$30,125.00 (ie HK$21,400.00 â HK$3,875.00 + HK$12,600.00).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  The IRD adopted the net profit of HK$2,400.13 shown in Plaintiffâs 2008/2009 Account as his taxable profit (ie HK$2,400.00) inthe tax assessment for the 2008/2009 tax year.  According to such Account, the Plaintiffâs annual and monthly gross income derivedfrom his own taxi-driving and from leasing out the taxi were respectively HK$124,400.00 and HK$10,366.67 (ie HK$124,400.00 Ã· 12months), and his annual and monthly Expenses were respectively HK$121,999.87 and HK$10,166.66 (ie HK$121,999.87 Ã· 12 months).  Itwas obvious from the relevant Account that the Plaintiff earned substantially more (HK$10,366.66) <i>per</i> month than the amounts pleaded in the SOD (HK$5,175.00) or even the RSOD (HK$3,875.00).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  However, the Schedule in relation to the Plaintiffâs income for the 2008/2009 tax year gave a breakdown of HK$21,600.00 beingincome from his own taxi-driving and HK$102,800.00 (ie HK$320.00 x 120 shifts and HK$230.00 x 280 shifts) being income from leasingout his taxi.  The breakdown in the Schedule suggested that the Plaintiff on average earned HK$1,800.00 (ie HK$21,600.00 Ã· 12 months)from his own taxi-driving and HK$8,566.67 (ie HK$102,800.00 Ã· 12 months) from leasing out his taxi <i>per</i> month, thus making total average monthly earnings of HK$10,366.67 (ie HK$1,800.00 + HK$8,566.67).  The Schedule also showed thaton average the taxi was leased out for 33.3 shifts <i>per</i> month (ie (120 shifts Ã· 12 months) + (280 shifts Ã· 12 months)) or 16.65 days at 2 shifts <i>per</i> day (ie 33.3 shifts Ã· 2 shifts).  So even according to the Schedule, the Plaintiff earned much more <i>per</i> month (ie HK$10,366.67) than the monthly income of HK$5,175.00 or HK$3,875.00 shown in the SOD or the RSOD.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  But the Schedule did not give any breakdown as to how much time (shifts/days) the Plaintiff spent in his own taxi-driving each monthfor the relevant period. Further, there were no primary documents which showed the number of shifts/days the Plaintiff spent in drivinghis own taxi, the number of shifts for which he leased out the taxi, and the rental income <i>per</i> shift during that period.  There was also no suggestion that the IRD approved the relevant Schedule.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  In light of the above analysis, it is obvious that the Plaintiffâs contention in the SOD that he only earned HK$5,175.00 <i>per</i> month from 1 April to 31 May 2008 would be untenable even at the time of issue of the Writ.  I see no reason why he would not havebeen able to make the same average notional monthly earnings as for the 2007/2008 tax year in section (b) above. In the circumstancesand erring on the side of caution in favour of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, at the time of issue of the Writ the Plaintiff would have reasonable prospect in establishing average loss of earningsfor the period from 1 April to 31 May 2008 in the sum of <u>HK$</u><u>31,800.00</u> (ie [HK$21,400.00 â (HK$30,000.00 Ã· 12) â (HK$600.00 x 26 days) + HK$12,600.00] x 2 months).  Since the Plaintiff conceded inthe RSOD that the monthly Expenses for the taxi cost HK$12,600.00 for the relevant period, I see no reason to adopt the higher figureof HK$16,520.00 as pleaded in the SOD.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(d)  1 June 2008 to 7 September 2008</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  During the period from 1 June to 7 September 2008, the Plaintiff claimed he continued to drive his taxi on part-time basis and tolease it out to earn rental income.  For the reasons given in paragraphs 51 and 62 above, I am satisfied that the Plaintiff had reasonableprospect in establishing such contention at the time of issue of the Writ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Again, the Plaintiff gave different versions as to his earnings over the relevant period:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(a) In the SOD, the Plaintiff claimed he decided to shift his job nature and to take up other sedentary job earning HK$6,000.00 <i>per</i> month starting from 1 June 2008, so his notional loss of earnings for the relevant period would be HK$49,280.00 (ie (HK$21,400.00â HK$6,000.00) x 3.2 months).  Although the Plaintiff did not expressly say so in the SOD, such calculation assumed that the taxiwould be sold (ie there would be no gross income or Expenses in respect of the taxi).  But this must be wrong because according to2 taxi rental agreements dated 2 and 4 June 2008 the Plaintiff leased out his taxi to 2 drivers respectively for day and night shiftsfor HK$320.00 and HK$280.00 <i>per</i> shift.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(b) In the RSOD, the Plaintiff claimed that from 1 June to 7 September 2008 he leased out the taxi for day and night shifts respectivelyat HK$320.00 and HK$280.00 <i>per</i> shift and earned rental income in the sum of HK$10,367.67 <i>per</i> month (see also paragraph 83 above).  He only drove his taxi on days when the other drivers were on leave, so he earned about HK$1,385.00<i>per</i> month.  Taking into account the monthly Expenses of HK$12,600.00, the Plaintiffâs monthly loss of earnings were HK$22,247.33 (ieHK$21,400.00 â HK$10,367.67 â HK$1,385.00 + HK$12,600.00) and his loss of earnings over the relevant period was HK$71,191.46(ie HK$22,247.33 x 3.2 months).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  The RSOD and the Statement revealed that between 11 and 29 August 2008 the Plaintiff took âæ³¥æ°´è£ä¿®å©çè¨ç·´èª²ç¨â organisedby the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions Occupational Retraining Centre, that he was registered with the Labour Department tolook for work, and that he attended interviews for various jobs including restaurant kitchen assistant for HK$4,000.00 to HK$6,000.00<i>per</i> month to no avail.  But I need not be concerned with these efforts which took place after the issue of the Writ.  As indicated inthe SOD and RSOD, the relevant consideration was whether the Plaintiff reasonably hoped to secure other work at a monthly incomeof HK$6,000.00. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Viewing the matter as at the time of issue of the Writ, I have no reason to doubt the Plaintiffâs belief that he would have beenable to secure alternative employment earning HK$6,000.00 <i>per</i> month.  But the question remained whether he could have increased his taxi-driving hours/shifts <i>per</i> month to earn even better income.  As at the time of issue of the Writ, the Plaintiff would not have been aware of the exacerbationof his symptoms in April 2009 and might not have fully comprehended his physical capabilities as shown in the Recording in mid-2009. But he would have been aware of (a) steady progress of his physical condition with encouragement by the occupational therapiststo resume increased part-time taxi-driving and (b) lingering effects of his psychiatric condition/medication that, according to DrHo, still significantly affected his taxi-driving.  Dr Hoâs comments summarised in paragraphs 33-34 above were pertinent. It waspossibly unlikely for the Plaintiff to resume half of his <i>pre</i>-Accident taxi-driving, but I shall assume in favour of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant that the Plaintiff was capable of doing so and thereby notionally could have earned HK$20,800.00 (ie 13 full days <i>per</i> month at HK$1,600.00).  Further, since the Plaintiff actually entered into the taxi rental agreements in early June 2008, there wasno reason to ignore rental income from such agreements.  Assuming that the Plaintiff could have leased out the taxi for the restof the month (ie 17 days), the notional monthly loss of earnings would have been HK$3,000.00 (ie HK$21,400.00 â HK$20,800.00 â(HK$600.00 x 17 days) + HK$12,600.00) and the loss of earnings for the relevant period would be <u>HK$9,600.00</u> (ie HK$3,000.00 x 3.2 months).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(e)  8 September 2008 to <i>18 March 2009</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  In the RSOD and the Answer, the Plaintiff averred that he found work as a renovation assistant earning HK$4,000.00 <i>per</i> month with working hours from 9 am to 6 pm.  His duties included delivery of bricks and rendering and plastering work, but he couldnot manage due to dizziness, weakness of his left hand and diminished standing tolerance of his left leg such that he left the companyon 14 November 2008.  In the meantime, he continued to drive his taxi a day each week or 4 days <i>per</i> month when the drivers who leased the taxi were on leave (but he would not drive if he did not feel well) and earned about HK$1,000.00(ie HK$250.00 x 4 days) <i>per</i> month.  The Plaintiff also leased out his taxi and earned about HK$10,367.67 <i>per</i> month (see paragraphs 83 and 87(b) above) at HK$600.00 (ie HK$320.00 + HK$280.00) <i>per</i> day.  So the Plaintiffâs monthly loss of earnings during this period was HK$18,632.33 (ie HK$21,400.00 â HK$4,000.00 â HK$1,000.00â HK$10,367.67 + HK$12,600.00).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  In the RSOD, the Plaintiff claimed that from 14 November 2008 to 31 August 2009 he attempted to look for other work to no avail.To maintain his living, he drove his taxi when those who leased the same were on leave.  During this period, he earned about HK$15,200.00<i>per</i> month, namely, HK$13,200.00 (ie HK$600.00 x 22 days) <i>per</i> month from leasing out the taxi, and HK$2,000.00 (ie HK$250.00 x 8 days) <i>per</i> month from driving it himself.  After taking into account the monthly Expenses of HK$12,600.00, his monthly loss of earnings forthe relevant period was HK$18,800.00 (ie (HK$21,400.00 â HK$15,200.00 + HK$12,600.00).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  It could be seen from the above that even on the Plaintiffâs own case there was a gradual improvement in resumption of taxi-drivingby the Plaintiff (ie from 4 days to 8 days <i>per</i> week at HK$250.00 <i>per</i> day) and in leasing out the taxi (ie from 16.65 days at HK$550.00 <i>per</i> day to 22 days at HK$600.00 <i>per</i> day).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  Other than the fact that such improving trend accorded with the information available at the time of issue of the Writ, I do nottake into account <i>post</i>-30 July 2008 matters.  Likewise I do not take into account the exacerbation of the Plaintiffâs symptoms in April 2009 and his improvedphysical abilities as shown in the Recording in July 2009 except as a general reflection on his improved physical condition at thetime of issue of the Writ.  In my view, the Plaintiff had reasonable prospect in establishing that at the time of issue of the Writthat he was still suffering from psychiatric condition and the effects of psychiatric medication, and he was still making trial effortsto resume increased taxi-driving.  I see no reason for disturbing the estimated monthly loss of earnings adopted for sections (c)and (d) above.  Thus, the Plaintiffâs notional monthly loss of earnings would be in the sum of HK$3,000.00 (see paragraphs 85 and89 above) and his notional loss of earnings from 8 September 2008 to 18 March 2009 would have been <u>HK$1</u><u>9,050</u><u>.00</u> (ie HK$3,000.00 x 6.35 months).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  Thus, the pre-trial loss of earnings on the basis of the above calculations would be about <u>HK$4</u><u>00,378</u><u>.00</u> (ie HK$149,128.00 + HK$190,800.00 + HK$31,800.00 + HK$9,600.00 + HK$19,050.00).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">X.  FUTURE LOSS OF EARNINGS</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  In the SOD, the Plaintiff claimed that due to his injuries and disabilities he would only be able to take up a job that did notrequire heavy physical demand.  He expected to be able to find a job earning a monthly income of HK$6,000.00.  He claimed that hisfuture loss of earnings would be (HK$21,400.00 â HK$6,000.00) x 12 months x 9 = HK$1,663,200.00.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  Ms Fung pointed out that the averments in the SOD were reasonable because the Plaintiff had no other qualification apart from cookeryand he could not work as a cook due to the weakness of his left hand.  On the other hand, Mr Kwong submitted that the Plaintiff waswell capable of returning to full-time taxi-driving as shown in the DA Report, the Ortho Report and the Recording.  He argued thatthe Plaintiff would not be entitled to any future loss of earnings.  But Mr Kwongâs arguments ignored the Plaintiffâs continuedneed for psychiatric follow up and medication, and Dr Hoâs opinion that the Plaintiffâs psychiatric condition would still haveeffect on his work efficiency, tolerance and adaptive ability as discussed above.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  In the RSOD, the Plaintiff claimed that as from 1 September 2009 he attempted to drive his taxi more regularly by resuming 1 shift<i>per</i> day and 3 days <i>per</i> week usually on Tuesdays from 8 am to 1 pm, Thursdays from 5pm to 11pm and Saturdays from 5 pm to 11 pm. He earned about HK$500.00<i>per</i> day or HK$6,000.00 <i>per</i> month. Further, he leased out his taxi for about 18 days at HK$600.00 <i>per</i> day earning rental income of HK$10,800.00 <i>per</i> month (ie HK$600.00 x 18 days) and 12 days <i>per</i> month at HK$300.00 <i>per</i> day earning rental income of HK$3,600.00 <i>per</i> month (ie HK$300.00 x 12 days).  Thus the Plaintiff claimed he earned total monthly rental income of HK$14,400.00 (ie HK$10,800.00+ HK$3,600.00).  The RSOD went on to aver that assuming the Plaintiff could drive the taxi for 12 days <i>per</i> month and lease it out for the days he did not drive the taxi, his average monthly earnings would be HK$20,400.00 (ie HK$6,000.00+ HK$14,400.00).  After taking into account the average monthly Expenses of HK$12,600.00, the Plaintiff claimed that his monthlynet loss of earnings would be HK$13,600.00 (ie HK$21,400.00 â HK$20,400.00 + HK$12,600.00).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  As explained above, there was no need for me to consider the averments in the RSOD and the Statement as to the Plaintiffâs actualincome during the period after 18 March 2009 since I was tasked to consider what the Plaintiff could have reasonably establishedat the time of issue of the Writ. Mr Kwong did not dispute the multiplier of 9 as proposed in the SOD.  Since I have been even morerobust in favour of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in assessing the notional loss of earnings than as suggested by the Plaintiff in the RSOD, I adopt the monthly notionalloss of HK$3,000.00 (see paragraphs 85, 89 and 93 above).  Thus, the future loss of earnings which the Plaintiff had reasonable prospectof establishing at the time of issue of the Writ would be <u>HK$324,000.00</u> (ie HK$3,000.00 x 12 months x 9).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">XI<i>.  LOSS OF EARNING CAPACITY</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Although loss of earning capacity was a head of claim in the RSOD, it was not featured in the SOD.  I need not consider the sameas it was not a head of recoverable loss contemplated by the Plaintiff at the time of issue of the Writ.</p>    <p class="heading">XII.  MEDICAL EXPENSES</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  In the RSOD, the Plaintiff claimed the sum of HK$6,240.00 for medical expenses for the treatment he received at TKOH, QEH, UCH andthe Psy Centre.  However, at the time of issue of the Writ, he only claimed the sum of <u>HK$3,500.00</u> and Mr Kwong did not dispute the same.</p>    <p class="heading">XIII.  FUTURE MEDICAL EXPENSES</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  In the RSOD, the Plaintiff claimed a lump sum of HK$45,000.00 (ie HK$2,500.00 x 12 months x 1Â½ years) for future medical expenseson the basis that Dr Ho and Dr Lai both opined that the Plaintiff would require further psychiatric treatment and the suggested durationof such treatment varied from about 1 year to at least 2 years at the cost of HK$2,000.00 to HK$3,000.00 <i>per</i> month in a private setting.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  However, at the time of issue of the Writ, the Plaintiff only claimed a lump sum of HK$5,000.00 for future medical expenses.  MrKwong argued there was no evidence to support any need for future medical treatment.  But at the time of issue of the Writ, althoughthe Plaintiff refused further cognitive training by 10 June 2008, he was still attending follow up at the Neuro Clinic and Psy Centre,and he was still taking psychiatric and other medications.  Plainly, the Plaintiff had a reasonable prospect of establishing a needfor future medical expenses, and I am not persuaded that a sum of <u>HK$5,000.00</u> was out of line.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">XIV<i>.  TRAVELLING EXPENSES</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  In the SOD the Plaintiff claimed a sum of HK$2,000.00 for incurred travelling expenses as he had to take taxi during the rehabilitationperiod shortly after the Accident due to leg injury, and he also claimed HK$500.00 for future travelling expenses.  Mr Kwong proposeda total sum of HK$2,000.00.  Whilst the Plaintiff reduced the claim to HK$1,988.00 in the RSOD, I cannot say that the Plaintiff hadno reasonable prospect of establishing a claim for <u>HK$2,500.00</u> for travelling expenses at the time of issue of the Writ.</p>    <p class="heading">XV.  TONIC FOOD</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  The Plaintiff claimed HK$5,000.00 for general Chinese nourishing and tonic food. Mr Kwong was prepared to concede a sum of HK$3,000.00. In the Statement, the Plaintiff claimed that his wife prepared nourishing soups that were helpful for tendon recovery, and in theAnswer, he stated he consumed gingseng and chicken soup as well as radix notoginseng and meat soup about twice a week for about 6months at HK$100.00 each time.  Again I cannot say that the Plaintiff had no reasonable prospect of establishing a claim for <u>HK$5,000.00</u> for tonic food expenses at the time of issue of the Writ.</p>    <p class="heading">XVI.

He claimed that as secondhand motorcycles did not require annual inspection their price was better guaranteed.  He said some internet websites showed thatmotorbikes of similar model to the Motorcycle were worth HK$12,000.00, so he estimated the value of the Motorcycle at the time ofthe Accident to be worth HK$15,000.00.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  The only webpages disclosed by the Plaintiff were printed in May 2008 and they referred to asking price (not sold or market value)of similar motobikes of HK$14,500.00 and HK$18,800.00 whichdid not support the Plaintiffâs allegations in the Statement.  However,according to the motor survey report dated 23 December 2006 by Cheuk Hwa Hong Surveyors &amp; Adjusters Co, the motor surveyor recommendedwriting off the Motorcycle on total loss basis as it was damaged beyond economical repair.  The report went on to say that the marketvalue of the Motorcycle was HK$11,000.00 and the scrap value was HK$500.00.  In the circumstances, at the time of issue of the Writ,it would have been obvious to the Plaintiff that he could not ask for more than HK$11,000.00 for loss of the Motorcycle.  Further,he had to give credit for the scrap value of the Motorcycle in the sum of HK$500.00 received from the towing company, thus resultingin a loss of <u>HK$10,500.00</u>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(b)  Watch</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  According to the SOD and the Statement, the watch the Plaintiff was wearing at the time of the Accident was damaged.  In the circumstances,I am unable to accept Mr Kwongâs submissions that the Plaintiff failed to describe whether the watch was damaged or destroyed asa result of the Accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  The heart of the dispute was whether the Plaintiff was entitled to claim a sum of HK$4,700.00 for the damaged watch.  Accordingto the Answer, the Plaintiff purchased the watch (âFortis 610.22.15Mâ) about 2 years prior to the Accident for about HK$4,000.00to HK$5,000.00.  He read from the webpage of Kowloon Watch Co on 9 November 2006 (which was disclosed) that the price of a watchof the same model and brand was HK$4,700.00.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  In my view, given the Plaintiffâs clear assertion of damage to his watch, I am unable to say that at the time of issue of Writthe Plaintiff had no reasonable prospect of establishing that he needed to replace the damaged watch for <u>HK$4,700.00</u>.  It is also at least arguable that no deduction should be made from the Plaintiffâs damages to offset any necessary bettermentas a result of such replacement (see <i>Harbuttâs Plasticine v Wayne Tank &amp; Pump Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%201%20All%20ER%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 1 All ER 225</a> and <i>Lagden v OâConnor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%201%20AC%201067" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 1 AC 1067).</a> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(c)  Motor survey fees</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  As regards motor survey fees, there was no justifiable reason why the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant should bear the costs of 2 motor survey reports.

CONCLUSION</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  In the above analysis, it has been shown that the Plaintiff in his pleadings and witness statement had not been forthright as tohis earnings and work capability in the <i>post</i>-Accident period.  I have taken this into account in my overall consideration. But there can be no denying the fact that as at thetime of issue of the Writ, the Plaintiff was still suffering the effects of his psychiatric condition/medication and such effectshad adverse impact on his work efficiency and tolerance.  Looking at this case as a whole as at the time of issue of the Writ, Icannot say that it would have been obvious to a reasonable man in the Plaintiffâs position that properly advised his claim wouldhave been within the District Court jurisdiction limit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  I am persuaded that at the time of issue of the Writ the Plaintiff had reasonable prospect in establishing that the present casewas within High Court jurisdiction:</p>    <blockquote>        <table width="80%" border="0">            <tr>                <td width="80%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">HK$</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="80%" valign="top">PSLA</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">350,000.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="80%" valign="top"><i>Pre</i>-trial loss of earnings</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">400,378.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="80%" valign="top"><i>Post</i>-trial loss of earnings</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">324,000.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="80%" valign="top">Future medical expenses</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">5,000.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="80%" valign="top">Loss of earning capacity</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">--</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="80%" valign="top">Medical expenses</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">3,500.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="80%" valign="top">Travelling expenses</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">2,500.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="80%" valign="top">Tonic food expenses</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">5,000.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="80%" valign="top">Other special damages</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">16,375.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="80%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"><u>1,106,753.00</u></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  I therefore order that the Plaintiffâs costs of the action be paid by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants on High Court scale.  There is no reason why costs should not follow event.  I therefore make a costs order <i>nisi</i> that costs of the Summons be paid by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants to the Plaintiff also on High Court scale. Since the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was absent and did not put up positive resistance to the application, I assess costs on a <i>nisi</i> basis in favour of the Plaintiff against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in the sum of HK$800.00.  As regards the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, I see no reason why the costs should not be summarily assessed.  I therefore also make the following consequential directions:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) unless an application is made to vary the above costs order <i>nisi</i> within 14 days from the date hereof, the Plaintiff do within 21 days from the date hereof lodge and serve statement of costs pursuantto Practice Direction 14.3, and the Plaintiffâs solicitors do fix a date with the Listing Clerk after 14 days and within 28 daysfrom today for a hearing before me in chambers (open to the public) for summary assessment of costs with Â½ hour reserved;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) if application is made to vary the costs order <i>nisi</i> within 14 days from the date hereof, both parties do lodge and serve their respective statement of costs pursuant to Practice Direction14.3 no later than 7 days before the hearing of the application to vary the costs order <i>nisi</i>.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  Last but not least, I thank both solicitors for their submissions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>     </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Marlene Ng)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td style="text-align:center">Master of the High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Representation:</p>        <!--sino section representation --><representation>            <p>Ms C Fung of Messrs Yip Tse &amp; Tang for the Plaintiff.</p>            <p>The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in person and being absent.</p>            <p>Mr R Kwong of Messrs Winnie Leung &amp; Co for 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p>        </representation><!--sino section text -->        <p style="text-align:justify">_________________________</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">[1]   <i>Lam Chor Mun, a minor by her next friend Lam Pik Kam v Ho Tin Wah &amp; anor</i> DCPI 1093/2005, Deputy District Judge R Cheung (unreported, 14 March 2007), <i>Leung Chung Ngar Christopher v Yeung Man Wai &amp; anor</i> HCPI 63/1999, Seagroatt J (unreported, 20 December 2000), <i>Tong Ying-wa v Cargo-Land (Warehouse) Development Limited</i> HCPI 441/2009, Master de Souza (unreported, 22 January 2001), <i>Cheung Chi Ming v Li Chau Wan &amp; anor</i> HCPI 1028/2000, Suffiad J (unreported, 8 July 2005), <i>Tam Wai Chun v Choi Sui Kwong</i> DCPI 2647/2007, Deputy District Judge Frederick Chan (unreported, 6 October 2008), <i>Wong Tai Yau v Transward Stevedore Limited &amp; third party</i> HCPI 1080/2006, Suffiad J (unreported, 9 October 2009), <i>Khan Sujad v Ho Ho Kwong</i> DCPI 339/2004, H H Judge H C Wong (unreported, 23 February 2005), <i>Leung Fun Hing v Extreme Good (Asia) Construction Company Limited &amp; anor</i> HCPI 57/2001, Burrell J (unreported, 24 September 2002), <i>Lai Kam Wah v Wing &amp; Kwong Company Limited</i> HCPI 1131/2002, Sakhrani J (unreported, 28 November 2003), <i>Lam Wai Chun v Tam Chi Wai &amp; anor</i> HCPI 1352/2000, Suffiad J (unreported, 6 October 2001), <i>Tong Chun Chung by his daughter and next friend Tong Ka v Pud Chi Keung</i> HCPI 183/2003, Suffiad J (unreported, 6 May 2005), <i>Wu Kin Leung v Incorporated Owners of Fu Tor Loy Sun Chuen Stage 1</i> HCPI 684/2002, Sakhrani J (unreported, 4 April 2005), and <i>Poon Yat Chiu v AES Scaffold Engineering Limited</i> DCPI 223/2005, H H Judge Chow (unreported, 21 March 2007)</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">[2]   <i>Pang Ping Sum v Enpack (Hong Kong) Limited &amp; ors</i> HCPI 290/2003, Suffiad J (unreported, 20 October 2005), and <i>Wong Hak Man v Harvest Engineering Development Limited &amp; anor</i> HCPI 869/2006, Master de Souza (unreported, 23 August 2008)</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p style="text-align: justify"> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2010/331.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
