class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  In September 2004, Ms Tam, a certified public accountant, was elected in a contested election to be the legislative councillor representingthe accountancy functional constituency in the Legislative Council, (LegCo), of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  After her election Ms Tam followed the practice of earlier LegCo representatives for the constituency in preparing an occasionalnewsletter.  This newsletter was distributed to her constituents through the membership database of the Hong Kong Institute of CertifiedPublic Accountants, (the Institute).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  On 19 September 2006, the Council of the Institute resolved that the Institute should stop distributing Ms Tamâs newsletter toits members.  On 9 October 2006, the Institute issued a letter to all its members notifying them of the decision.  The letter setout details enabling members to contact Ms Tam directly if they wished to receive her newsletter.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  At a Council meeting on 24 October 2006, the Institute affirmed its earlier decision.  The decision was further reaffirmed on 13December 2006, and again on 23 January 2007.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Subsequently, Ms Tam was granted leave to bring judicial review proceedings challenging the decision of the Institute to cease distributionof her newsletters and other materials to its members.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The application for judicial review:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Ms Tam now seeks judicial review of the decision of the Council, first made on 19 September 2006, and subsequently reaffirmed on24 October 2006, 15 December 2006, and 23 January 2007.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Her case is that the decision to refuse to distribute the newsletter prevents her, as the Legislative Councillor representing theaccountancy functional constituency, from properly communicating with the members of her constituency.  Ms Tam says that the decisionis in breach of public law principles.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Mr Dykes, for Ms Tam, advances five grounds upon which he says that the decision of the Council was unlawful.  They are:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">in reaching its decision the Council took into account irrelevant and extraneous considerations;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">in reaching its decision the Council failed to take relevant considerations into account;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">in reaching its decision the Council violated principles of equality and consistency;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(d)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">in reaching its decision the Council took an erroneous view of the Personal Data (Protection) Ordinance, (PDPO);</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(e)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the decision of the Council was irrational.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The case for the Institute, advanced by Mr Pannick, is twofold.

The argument is that the decision was not a final decision to refuse to distribute newsletters. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Second, it is argued that the Institute has not breached any principle of public law.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The Institute:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Institute is a statutory body established under s 3 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/50" class="autolink_findacts">Professional Accountants Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/50">Cap 50</a>, (PAO).

Second, he says that the Institute is ready and willing to considerwhether particular information from Ms Tam is such that the professional interests of members require the information to be disseminatedto the membership.  In such circumstances the Institute would disseminate the information.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The decision of the Institute was clear and unequivocal, and on its terms did not admit to any exceptions.

The letter was distributedby the Institute, on behalf of the LegCo member, using the database of membership, created by the register held by the Institute.

These are all matters which will directly involve a chartered public accountant,should a GST be imposed.  This may be seen from the emphasis placed by the President of the Institute in his statement in the newsletterto members on the adoption by the Government of suggestions from the Institute as to the design of the GST system.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  But, chartered public accountants are simply that: they are accountants, they are not economists nor are they politicians. Whilechartered public accountants will inevitably be involved in the mechanics of the collection of any form of taxation that might beimposed by the Government, their interest in the particular form of taxation to be imposed is no greater than that of any other memberof the public.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  In my view, a chartered public accountant is in no better position than any general member of the public to comment on the appropriatenessof GST as a method to broaden the tax base.

In that area a chartered public accountant has a special expertise.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  The views expressed on GST in Ms Tamâs newsletter were primarily views related to the philosophical or political question as towhether a GST ought to be introduced.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The power of the Institute, and its discretion:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  There can be no doubt that the Institute has the power, and a broad discretion, under s 18(1)(a) and (n) PAO, whether or not todistribute material to its members.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  The Council of the Institute, having a discretion whether or not to publish materials, must also have the discretion to refuse,at any time, to distribute materials. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  The affidavit of the Chief Executive of the Institute asserted that the Institute:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">retained an overriding discretion to refuse to distribute materialsâ,</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">when making its decision that it would distribute newsletters for LegCo members representing the functional constituency.

By so doing he is likely to reach, effectively,virtually every eligible elector.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  But a functional constituency representative is in a quite different position. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  An examination of the relevant provisions of the LCO, establishing the functional constituencies, (ss 20 and 20A-ZB), demonstratesthat in respect of each of the functional constituencies, those entitled to be registered as an elector must, as a pre-requisite,hold some form of qualification, or be a member of some particular group, that may be identified by way of a register or some similarrecord of qualifications.  Inevitably, that register or record is held by someone other than the Electoral Registration Officer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  Consequently, if a LegCo representative for a functional constituency wishes to circulate his views to electors, he can only doso, (other than generally in press), if he has some form of access to the register or record in which those who hold the pre-requisitequalifications for registration as elector will be recorded.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  In para 95 above, I described the functional constituencies as being unique.  They are unique in two respects.  They are uniquebecause they are peculiar to Hong Kong.  I am unaware of, and counsel did not suggest, any other country in which seats in its legislativeCouncil, whatever form that may take, are elected in this manner.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  The functional constituencies are unique also in their dependence upon membership of some other Institute, body or organisation,which, quite separately from Government electoral officials, keeps a register or roll of membership.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  The consequence of this latter factor is that any consideration of the functional constituencies requires the relevant provisionsof the LCO to be read together with whatever other legislation or arrangement establishes the register or roll of membership, fromwhich electors for the particular functional constituencies may be drawn.  In the present case it is accordingly necessary to readthe LCO and PAO together.  To this extent they are interlinked, although not specifically or directly, in either piece of legislation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">No duty on the Institute to assist a Legislative Councillor:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  Mr Pannick draws my attention to the fact that no statutory duty is imposed upon the holder of the register or records of membershipwhich provides the basis for the determination of eligibility for a functional constituency, to facilitate communication betweena legislative councillor and those eligible to vote.  That is the case whether it be under the PAO, or any other form of registeror record upon which a functional constituency is based.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  It is correct that it is not the function of the Court in these proceedings to remedy any failure on the part of the legislatureto include in either the PAO, or the LCO, provisions which Ms Tam might think appropriate, to enable her to communicate with herelectors.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  Ms Tam cannot, in these proceedings, claim a right to have her newsletter distributed by the Institute using its register of members. What she is entitled to, however, is to demand that any decision made by the Institute to use, or not to use, its register for thatpurpose, is a decision made in accordance with law.  As a statutory body, any decision the Institute makes will be amenable to judicialreview.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Limitations on the use of the electoral register:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  To date, the legislature has enabled only very limited use of the electoral register to distribute information to electors.  Itdoes so by  permitting, in s 41 LCO, two letters to be addressed by a candidate for an election, at the time of an election, to eachelector in either a geographical or a functional constituency. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  I am satisfied however that this section should not be read as a statement by the legislature on the scope to which the electoralregister may be used, but rather as making provision for letters to be addressed by candidates in an election, to electors, withthe cost to be borne by Government.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  The importance of the provision is its revenue aspect, rather than as a limitation on communication with electors.  The provisionis designed to provide for payment of the posting of letters.  It is merely an incidental consequence that it may have the effectof limiting a legislative councillorsâ access to the electoral register.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  Regulations 41 of the extraordinarily named âElectoral Affairs Commission (Registration) (Electors for Legislative Council FunctionalConstituencies) (Voters for Election Committee Subsectors) (Members of Election Committee) Regulationâ, (sic), <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/541">Cap 541</a> Sub LegB, (the Electoral Regulations) restricts general access to the electoral register to purposes related to an election and only tosuch persons as the Electoral Registration Officer considers appropriate.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  Regulation 42 of the Electoral Regulations creates offences in relation to unauthorised use of the electoral register.  Thus, neitherMs Tam, nor any other functional constituency member, nor even a geographical constituency member may use the electoral registeras a means of gaining access to information in order to communicate with electors.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  Mr Dykes correctly submitted that whether or not the effect of these regulations, to create a ban on access to the electoral registeroutside election times, was lawful, was not an issue in these proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  However, Mr Pannick must be right in his submission that these restrictions on the use of the electoral register are a factor whichI must take into account in determining the lawfulness of the course followed by the Council of the Institute.  Together with thatmust go the restrictions upon general access to the register of certified public accountants, (see para 17 above). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  I shall consider this matter in the course of considering the matters upon which the Council relied in reaching its decision.  AsMr Dykes submitted, the Council must have known of the effect of these regulations, and made its decision not to distribute Ms Tamâsmaterials, notwithstanding that effect.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Other means of communication open to Ms Tam:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  It is right that there are other means by which Ms Tam may communicate with eligible voters. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  The Institute has advised its members through its newsletters that those who wish to receive Ms Tamâs newsletters may contacther and add their names to her database.  The Institute has established a service by which members who wish to receive the newsletters,but do not wish to release their personal data to Ms Tam, can receive the materials via the Institute. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  It is true too, that it may reasonably be assumed that all members of the Institute, all of whom are professional people, may haveaccess to computers and may be able to read any of Ms Tamâs material on her website if they wish.  A reference to Ms Tamâs websiteis contained in the Instituteâs website.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  In my view these matters do not provide an answer to Ms Tamâs complaint that the Council acted unlawfully in reaching its decision. They are, however, factors that are relevant in the course of making the decision by the Council, and accordingly factors to betaken into account by the Council, albeit factors which will not need to be accorded great weight.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Irrelevant and extraneous considerations:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  Mr Dykes contends that in reaching its decision to cease distribution of the newsletters the Council took into consideration itsdifference of opinion with Ms Tam on the matters of constitutional reform and the GST.  He argues that these were irrelevant considerations. He further says that the fact that Ms Tam adopted a political stance on various issues was also an irrelevant consideration.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The differences between Ms Tam and the Council:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  Mr Dykes does not hide from the submission that the Council decided to stop distributing Ms Tamâs newsletters, effectively asa form of punishment to her, because of her open disagreement with them and her public criticism of the Council.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  Mr Pannick has taken me carefully through the chronology to support a submission that the differences of opinion were not a considerationin making the decision.  He says that the Council were perfectly entitled to take into account the content of the materials Ms Tamsought to send to members.  They were, he argues, entitled to adopt the approach that if the materials expressed partisan politicalviews on issues which were not confined to âa matter affecting the professional interests of the accountancy professionâ.  Inthat circumstance, Mr Pannick says, the Council was right to decline to distribute the materials.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  There were two main areas in which Ms Tam and the Council held diametrically opposed views.  They were the matters of constitutionalreform, and GST. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  It is right, as Mr Pannick has pointed out, that the issue of constitutional reform, and the differences between Ms Tam and theCouncil occurred at the end of 2005, and the beginning of 2006.  Although there was a temporary cessation of distribution at thistime, limited to one newsletter only, distribution was resumed. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  The final decision to cease distribution of the newsletters did not take place until September 2006, eight months later.  Mr Pannicksays that consequently it cannot be said that the differences over constitutional reform, and the public exchanges that arose therefrom,had any impact at all on the decision of the Council.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  The decision to cease distribution of the newsletters followed immediately after the public dispute between Ms Tam and the Councilover the GST survey.  The strength of the views held by at least two Council members on this matter may be seen in the words usedby Mr Chow, see para 72 above.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  It cannot be argued that the public dispute over GST was a matter not taken into account by the Council in making its decision on19 September 2006.  That it was taken into account appears plainly from the minutes of the Council meeting on that day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  I have listened carefully to Mr Pannickâs review of the chronology.  It is clear,  however, from the terms of the letter of 9October 2006, in which the Council informed its members of the decision to cease distributing the newsletters, that the Council hashad regard to the earlier disputes as well.  In that letter, the following expressions appear:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">After much thought and deliberations <i>over the course of two years</i>....</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">Ms Tam has adopted an <i>increasingly political stance on many issues,...</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">This decision, .... comes after <i>the LegCo representativeâs ongoing public attacks and criticisms</i> against the Institute in her newspaper columns, letters to members and the media.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">The expressions which I have emphasised are expressions which do not refer to a particular event immediately preceding the decision,but instead, events that have taken place, progressively, over a period of time.  From this it can plainly be seen that the Councilhas had regard to the whole of the course of their relationship with Ms Tam in reaching their decision.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  I am accordingly satisfied that in reaching its decision to cease distributing the newsletters, the Council had regard to the factof its disputes with Ms Tam and the disagreements, between them on the various issues involved, going back prior to December 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Ms Tamâs âovert political stanceâ:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  Further, it cannot be argued that the Council did not take into account the fact that Ms Tamâs materials contained political comment. Indeed the position of the Council is that they were entitled to reject the newsletters because they contained political comment,the Council saying that the newsletters should be confined to matters affecting the professional interests of the accountancy profession.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  A legislative councillor for a functional constituency is elected, not to represent the members of the constituency only in relationto matters affecting the particular common interest that they share, which entitles them to be members of that functional constituency. I accept Mr Dykesâ submission that the fact that Ms Tam represents a functional constituency does not limit or qualify her functionsunder Article 73 of the Basic Law.  Mr Dykes correctly put it this way:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">(The representative) is a LegCo member first with duties to that body which makes laws for all of the people in Hong Kong.  The dutyowed to the constituents is a duty of judgment, particularly in the deliberative processes of LegCo.  The representative is not amouthpiece for vested interests.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">That means a LegCo member, if personal convictions dictate, not following the opinion of a section of his constituency, even a majority,although it means listening to constituents views conscientiously.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  That is undoubtedly right.  It is foolish to suppose that a lawmaker, even one from a functional constituency, can be apolitical. It is inevitable that the proper communications of a legislative councillor to his constituents, whether geographical or functional,will be of a political nature.  That is so because the business of lawmaking necessarily involves the discussion of political principlesand the expression of views of a political nature.  For the legislative councillor in the accountancy functional constituency, therole is not confined to one that deals solely with matters of direct professional relevance to chartered public accountants.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  When the role of a legislative councillor is seen in its proper light, it is difficult to see how a councillor can in any way becriticised for expressing an âovert political messageâ, or taking âa political stance on issuesâ, whether the stance wasâincreasingly soâ or not.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">How should the Council deal with criticism:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  The Council is a statutory body and exercises regulatory functions.  As such it will from time to time be faced with public criticism.There will be times when the Council may consider that criticism made of it is unfair, or unreasonable, or even not based on fact.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  There are three courses open to the Council when it is the subject of criticism. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  The usual course, and the best course, will be to answer the criticism with fact, logic and reasoned argument.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  Second, it will be open to the Council, or individual members, to take defamation proceedings in appropriate circumstances.  Ifthey do so  they will need to bear in mind the right of those making the criticism to be able to make fair comment on matters ofpublic interest, (see paras 88-94 above).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  Third, if the criticism comes from a member of the Institute, and is totally unfounded, the criticism may constitute professionalmisconduct.  In those circumstances it is open to the Council to seek appropriate disciplinary sanctions against the criticiser,following the procedures contained in the PAO.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  But in none of these three circumstances is it open to the Council to punish the critic by some other sanction, such as the refusalin the present case to distribute the newsletters</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  It is right that the Council expressed the view that it would respect Ms Tamâs right to voice her own political and personal opinions. It did so both in the minutes of the Council meeting, on 19 September 2006, and in the letter to members on 9 October 2006.  Itrepeated this view on 15 December 2006, when advising Ms Tam of the decision following her request for a further review.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  But when the whole of the circumstances are looked at in context those expressions of respect may be seen to be mere window dressing. The Council, taking grave exception to the positions and statements from Ms Tam, has acted to punish her for those expressing thosepolitical and personal opinions by declining to further distribute her newsletters.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  The fact that the Council had disagreements with Ms Tam over the views that she was expressing, and the manner and the forums inwhich she expressed them, has no bearing whatsoever on the issue as to whether or not the Council should continue to distribute MsTamâs newsletters.  Equally, Ms Tam was perfectly entitled to express political views in her newsletter, and to increase her politicalstance on a particular issue.  It was her duty to do so.  In so doing she was properly discharging her role as a legislative councillor.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  I accordingly conclude that in taking into consideration the fact of the disputes that had taken place between Ms Tam and the Council,and the content of the newsletters, with which the Council disagreed, the Council in reaching its decision, had regard to an irrelevantconsideration. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a>  In assessing whether or not it ought to continue to distribute Ms Tamâs newsletters, the Council should have disregarded thesematters.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Failure to take into account relevant considerations;</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a>  Two matters arise here.  First is the fact that the register held by the Institute provides the only available link for the legislativeCouncil representative, to the members of the electorate.  Second is the question of the effect of the disclaimer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The register as a link:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a>  In paragraphs 88-111 above I have considered the role of freedom of speech and the unique situation of the functional constituencies. I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to read the LCO and the PAO together when considering functional constituencies.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a>  While I accept that Ms Tam has no right to demand the distribution of the newsletters, an important factor to be taken into accountby the Council in determining whether or not to distribute the newsletters, is the fact that the Institute holds the only completelist, other than the electoral register, of constituents and potential constituents in the functional constituency. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a>  A functional constituency representative cannot easily communicate with constituents in the same way that a geographical representativecan; that is by a simple mail distribution throughout his geographical area.  Thus, the ability to distribute a newsletter to constituentsthrough the use of the Institute register, without offending PDPO principles, is an important factor.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  I accept that the Council has recognised, to an extent, the importance of this fact.  This is demonstrated by the Council takingsteps to enable members to give their details to Ms Tam, or to facilitate the distribution of the newsletters to those who did notwish to disclose their details.  The maintenance of a link to Ms Tamâs website on the Instituteâs website also assists in thisrespect.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  But the link provided by the register to the members of a functional constituency demands a greater recognition than was accordedby the Council.  Having regard to the importance of the role of a functional constituency legislator, the number of functional constituenciesin LegCo, and the importance of them in the political life of Hong Kong, the link provided by the register will be a very importantfactor upon which a significant weight would need to be attached.  The steps taken by the Council, described above in para 156, failedto give appropriate recognition to the importance of this factor.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  Very strong reasons would be required to deny a functional constituency legislative councillor the type of access to the registerthat is sought by Ms Tam.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  I should add that it is no answer for the Institute to say, in respect of its obligation to have regard to this factor, that themembers of the Institute are not the same as the electorate.  The members of the electorate comprise 80% of the members of the Institute,and the remaining 20% are potential members of the electorate.  It is perfectly reasonable for a legislative councillor for a functionalconstituency to wish to communicate, not only with the members of the electorate, but also with those who may in the future becomeelectors.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Segregation of views and the disclaimer:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  The concern of the Council, made clear in the minutes of the meeting of 19 September 2006, and the letter to members on 9 October2006, was that there was a need to segregate the views of Ms Tam from those of the Institute.  The Council was perfectly entitledto ensure that such a segregation took place.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a>  But there is nothing in the evidence, or the minutes of meetings, or the letters, to indicate that in dealing with this issue theCouncil had any regard at all to its own requirement for, or the effect of, the disclaimer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a>  The disclaimer is in clear terms, and was prominently displayed on the outside of the newsletter.  It was in a position where itwould be seen by the recipient, before the recipient saw the contents of the newsletter.  The font size required by the Council,(and with which Ms Tam disagreed), ensured that the disclaimer was prominent.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a>  The presence of the disclaimer was perfectly adequate to ensure that the recipient of the newsletter was properly aware that theviews expressed by Ms Tam in the newsletter did not necessarily represent the views of the Council.  The appropriate segregationof the Council from Ms Tamâs views was accordingly achieved.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a>  I am satisfied that in reaching its decision the Council has fallen into error in failing to have proper regard to the effect ofthe disclaimer in ensuring that the views of Ms Tam are segregated from those of the Council.  The plain effect of the disclaimerin segregating the views of the Council and Institute from those of Ms Tam means that considerable weight must be given to the consequencesof the disclaimer in achieving the purpose sought by the Council.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Violation of principles of equality and consistency;</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a>  It is well established that a power exercised inconsistently or unequally is a power which may be improperly exercised.

He argues that in the absence of proper reasons for stoppingthe distribution the Council has treated Ms Tam unequally from other representatives for the constituency.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  It is clear from the evidence that, at the very least, Ms Tamâs immediate predecessor expressed political comment in the newsletterhe circulated.  It may be reasonably assumed that previous representatives, in the newsletter circulated, did not confine themselvesto matters strictly within the purview of the interests of certified public accountants and their professional activities.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a>  The Council purports to justify its distinction between Ms Tam and previous representatives by asserting that her newsletters containedâovert political messagesâ, and that she took an âincreasingly political stanceâ.  These are subjective tests, which maybe seen to represent the collective political view of the current Council.  They are a view which may well change should there bea change in the composition of the Council.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a>  The test adopted by the Council has been inconsistently applied.  While asserting that Ms Tam ought not express overt politicalmessages, or take a political stance in her newsletters, the Council itself has given consideration to both of the political issuesof constitutional reform and GST, on which it sought to segregate Ms Tamâs views.  The Council did not confine itself to mattersrelated to the professional interests of chartered public accountants.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a>  It is no answer to the complaint of inequality of application of standards for the Institute to say that it reserved to itself thediscretion not to distribute the material.  As I have demonstrated, it did not actually make that reservation; the reservation arisesfrom the mere existence of the discretion.  Mr Dykes does not suggest that it would have been proper for the Council to fetter itsdiscretion in such a way that it could not reconsider, upon proper grounds, the termination of the service of distribution of thenewsletters.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a>  What is plain is that the Council did not consider the past practice of distributing newsletters when making its decision.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a>  There is nothing in the evidence, nor in the minutes of meetings, nor the letters advising either Ms Tam or members of the Instituteof the decision, to indicate that the Council has paid any attention at all to the fact that it has distributed newsletters for previousLegCo representatives without complaint for nearly 20 years.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a>  The principle of equality, as applied in this particular circumstance, would require the Council to take the fact of 20 years ofdistribution as its starting point in its consideration as to whether or not there are any justifiable reasons to depart from thepractice.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a>  Having regard to the long duration of the practice, very strong reasons would be required to justify to departure the practice ofdistribution.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Personal Data (Protection) Ordinance concerns:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a>  There is no doubt that the Institute is a data user, as defined by s 2 PDPO, and that accordingly the Data Protection Principlesenshrined in PDPO apply.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a>  The Council made no reference at all to PDPO issues when it reached its decision on 19 September 2006.  It did not refer to PDPOissues when, in the circular letter of 9 October 2006, prepared specifically for the purpose, it informed its members of the decisionto cease distributing Ms Tamâs newsletters.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a>  The first reference to PDPO came on 24 October 2006, at the first review of the decision, when the Institute determined that asa matter of policy it would only use the personal data of its members for âthe purpose for which those data were collectedâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a>  I am satisfied that while the Council subsequently relied upon PDPO to justify its decision, PDPO issues were not at all consideredrelevant to, or even considered by, the Council when it made its original decision.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a>  The extent to which Mr Pannick was able to argue that there has been a breach of a Data Protection Principal is limited to a suggestionthat Data Protection Principle 3 should be invoked.  That Principle provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">Personal Data shall not, without the prescribed consent of the data subject, be used for any purpose other than â</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(a)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">the purpose for which the data were to be used at the time of the collection of data; or</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(b)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">a purpose directly related to the purpose referred to in paragraph (a).â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">There is no suggestion that any application form to be completed on the part of a certified public accountant wishing to be placedupon the Register of certified public accountants, states that one of the purposes for which the data in the application is collectedis to enable the distribution of information from the Legislative Councillor for the accountancy functional constituency, to electorsof that constituency.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p181" class="para" id="p181">181.</a>  It is here again, that the link between the PAO and the LCO becomes important.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a>  As I have set out above, the basis of the electoral register for all of the functional constituencies is a form of professionalregister, or other collection or record, all in a central place, of persons who may be or become eligible to be electors in the functionalconstituency.  Thus, an application for registration as a certified public accountant under the PAO is, as well as serving its primaryand obvious purpose, the first step towards application to join the electoral register for the Accountancy functional constituency.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a>  The inevitable interrelationship that arises between the LCO and the PAO, means that it may properly be said that an additionalpurpose in supplying data for registration on the register of certified public accountants is to enable the establishment of theprimary qualification to become an elector in the accountancy functional constituency.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a>   I am satisfied, for the reasons set out in paragraphs 88-111 above, that freedom of speech, the role of a legislator, the importanceof the ability of a legislator to communicate with electors, and the unique situation of the functional constituencies in Hong Kong,means there is a further purpose of the register when the LCO and PAO are read together.  That is that the register may be used toenable elected representatives of the accountancy functional constituency to communicate with electors and potential electors.  Ofcourse it might only be used in such a way as will not offend other Data Protection Principles.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a>  I have accordingly satisfied that there has been no breach of Data Protection Principle 3 of the PDPO.  That is so because in usingthe data in the register to distribute newsletters, the data is being used for one of the purposes for which it was intended, atthe time of the collection of the data, it would be used.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The effect of no personal access to the database by Ms Tam and the disclaimer:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a>  If I am wrong in that conclusion, I am in any event satisfied that any PDPO concerns are met by the fact that Ms Tam does not seekpersonal access to the relevant database, and the terms of the disclaimer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a>  Ms Tam makes it clear that she does not wish to have supplied to her the database held by the Institute.  She is not entitled toit.  She only wishes the practice of distribution of her materials by the Institute, as was undertaken in the past, to continue. In that way the data is kept secure.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a>  Data Protection Principle 3, the particular Principle relied upon by Mr Pannick, allows a person to âopt outâ of personal datause by a third party.  It does so by the use of the expression; âwithout the prescribed consent of the data subjectâ. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p189" class="para" id="p189">189.</a>  The terms of the disclaimer are clear.  In specific terms, recipients of the newsletter are invited to inform the Institute if theydo not wish to receive future issues.  That statement, included with the disclaimer, properly and adequately meets the requirementsof Data Protection Principal 3.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p190" class="para" id="p190">190.</a>  Finally, in so far as PDPO principles are concerned, it is worthy of note that the PDPO was enacted in 1996.  The Data protectionPrinciples do not seem to have concerned the Council in respect of the distribution of newsletters on behalf of functional constituencyrepresentatives prior to Ms Tam.  Mr Dykes was entitled to say that if distribution is not unlawful, Ms Tam should have the samedistribution privileges as her immediate predecessor.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a>  It being the case that the use of the register to distribute newsletters did not offend the PDPO, the Council took into accountan irrelevant matter in relying upon the PDPO as a justification for terminating distribution.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The decision of the Council was irrational:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a>  The argument based upon irrationality reflects a combination of the consideration of the foregoing factors.  If proper considerationsto the exercise of the power can be shown to have been considered and balanced and weighed by the decision-making body, the courtswill be reluctant to interfere.  But if manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate weight has been accorded to relevant considerations,or irrelevant matters taken into the balance, or relevant matters ignored, the decision made in consequence may be found to be irrational.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p193" class="para" id="p193">193.</a>  I have found that the Council has had regard to irrelevant and extraneous considerations, namely the matters of political substancewith which it disagreed with Ms Tam, and the public positions taken by Ms Tam in relation to those matters.  In having regard tothe plainly, but properly, political nature of the content of the newsletters the Council has had regard to an irrelevant consideration.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p194" class="para" id="p194">194.</a>  In reaching its decision to terminate the distribution of the newsletters the Council has failed to give proper weight to the importanceof the register as a link between members of the electorate and a functional constituency legislator.  It has further failed to giveproper weight to the consequences of its requirement that there should be a disclaimer attached to each newsletter, thus making itclear that the Councilâs views are not necessarily the same as Ms Tamâs views.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p195" class="para" id="p195">195.</a>  The Council has failed to have proper regard to the principle of equality, and to take into account the fact that it has distributednewsletters for the functional constituency representatives, without complaint, for nearly 20 years.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p196" class="para" id="p196">196.</a>  The Council has wrongly relied upon the provisions of PDPO to conclude that the distribution of the newsletter offended Data ProtectionPrinciples.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p197" class="para" id="p197">197.</a>  Further, having regard to the fact that Ms Tam does not seek direct access to the database, the fact that the database, the register,constitutes a link between the LCO and the PAO, and the effect of the opt out provision in the disclaimer, no PDPO issues arise,and the Council was not entitled to rely upon PDPO as a justification to terminate distribution.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p198" class="para" id="p198">198.</a>  Against these matters, I have regard to the qualified willingness of the Council to distribute newsletters in the future, so longas they are confined to matters affecting the professional interests of the accountancy profession.  I must have regard to othermethods by which Ms Tam may make their views known. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p199" class="para" id="p199">199.</a>  I have regard also to the steps taken by the Council to inform members as to how they make contact Ms Tam.  I have regard to therestrictions on the use of the electoral register, and that Ms Tam may communicate with the eligible voters through other means.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The extent of any obligation to distribute:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p200" class="para" id="p200">200.</a>  Mr Pannick says that the court should be slow to interfere in the decision because if a right to distribution is found, difficultquestions as to the determination of the scope of the right and of fairness would arise.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p201" class="para" id="p201">201.</a>  The submission may be answered in two ways.  First, as I have made clear, it is not open to Ms Tam to demand, in these proceedings,a right to distribution, but only a right to have a decision of the Council as to distribution made in accordance with law.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a>  Second, any question of fairness, as between Ms Tam and those who wish to stand against her in the next election, or the numberof newsletters which might be distributed, are matters which ought to be able to be safely left to the discretion of the Council.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p203" class="para" id="p203">203.</a>  Mr Pannick said that in the absence of any legislative provision, the Court had no criteria by which to define the scope of anyobligation on the part of the Institute.  Could they be required, he asked, to send her materials to members every month, or everyweek, or every day, or even every hour.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p204" class="para" id="p204">204.</a>  With respect to Mr Pannick, the argument amounts to nothing more than saying that if a discretion is difficult to exercise it oughtnot to be exercised.  That is plainly wrong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p205" class="para" id="p205">205.</a>  The simple answer is that the Court may expect that the Council will act sensibly and apply proper criteria in determining any requestfor distribution Ms Tam may make.  Plainly, a request for distribution on an hourly basis would be unreasonable.  Equally plainly,a request for distribution monthly would appear to be reasonable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p206" class="para" id="p206">206.</a>  What falls between may vary depending upon the particular stage of the electoral cycle at which the request is made.  In the periodclose to an election the Council may well consider a weekly newsletter to be considered reasonable.  Outside the election period,and when LegCo is in recess, it may well be reasonable to refuse to distribute a weekly newsletter.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p207" class="para" id="p207">207.</a>  It will be for the Council to determine, from time to time, in the light of circumstances existing at the relevant time, whetheror not it considers a particular request for distribution made by Ms Tam to be excessive.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Costs of distribution of the newsletter:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p208" class="para" id="p208">208.</a>  Although no particular argument was made on the point, it is clear that there has been an issue between the parties in the pastas to who should bear the cost of distributing the newsletters.  I have no doubt at all that if the Institute is put to any additionalexpense, over and above its own newsletter or e-circular distribution costs, in distributing Ms Tamâs newsletter, it is only rightthat she should bear that cost.  I understand that she now accepts that position.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Conclusion:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p209" class="para" id="p209">209.</a>  It is a first principle of judicial review that the remedies are discretionary.  A claimant may succeed in establishing the groundsupon which he relies, but may be refused a remedy, in the exercise of the court's discretion.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p210" class="para" id="p210">210.</a>  In the present case it is necessary for me to weigh, in the Councilâs favour the matters which it has properly taken into account,those which I have set out in paras 198-199 above.  Against those I must have regard to the errors made by the Council, summarisedin paras 192-197 above.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p211" class="para" id="p211">211.</a>  I have had careful regard to all of these factors.  I am satisfied that the matters in favour of the Council are not sufficientto outweigh the errors made by the Council in reaching its decision.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p212" class="para" id="p212">212.</a>  I accordingly find that the decision of the Council to terminate the distribution of Ms Tamâs newsletters was made in consequenceof errors of law, and is accordingly irrational.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p213" class="para" id="p213">213.</a>  The decision of the Council, made on 19 September 2006, and subsequently reaffirmed on three occasions, must be set aside.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The consequence of the decision:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p214" class="para" id="p214">214.</a>  Until such time as the Council makes a decision, based upon a lawful consideration of the relevant criteria, to terminate the distributionof the newsletters, Ms Tam is entitled to have the status quo restored, and her newsletters must be distributed by the Institute.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p215" class="para" id="p215">215.</a>  However, it is open to the Council of the Institute to consider the matter again, having regard to the terms of this judgment, andthe matters that it must take into account and the proper weight that is to be attributed to those matters, as indicated by thisjudgment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Costs and Orders:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p216" class="para" id="p216">216.</a>  There will be an order <i>nisi</i> that the Institute must pay the costs of the proceedings to be taxed on a party and party basis.
