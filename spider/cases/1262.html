The machine hired were generatorsand air compressors for use at construction sites. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The Defendant does not dispute the Plaintiffâs claim of unpaid rental charges except for the sum of $13,866.46.  At the trial,the Plaintiff agreed to waive the said sum of $13,866.46 and accepted Defendantâs undisputed sum of $302,888.14 to be the outstandingrental. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The Defendant counterclaims against the Plaintiff for loss and damages suffered by the Defendant to the Defendantâs propertiescaused by a fire that took place on board of the Defendantâs flattop barge (âthe bargeâ) at Wong Shek Pier on 21 November 2005. It is the Defendantâs claim that the fire was caused by the defect in one of the Plaintiffâs air compressors, no. 4868, hiredby the Defendant (âthe said air compressorâ).  The Defendant counterclaims against the Plaintiff for damages done to its plant,machineries and equipment, repairing costs to the damaged barge, loss and damage to the piling, loss due to delay of completion ofconstruction work undertaken and costs of the investigation report on the cause of fire in the total sum of $1,245,448.98.  Due tothe limit of jurisdiction in the District Court, the Defendant waived any amount over and above $1 million in the recovery of itsloss and damages against the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The Defendantâs Counterclaim</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Defendant claims that the Plaintiff was in breach of the implied terms of the contract of hire by its failure to supply theDefendant with a machine of merchantable quality and free form defects. And that in further breach of the contract of hire, the Plaintifffailed to carry out proper maintenance of the said air compressor. The Defendant further relies on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.  The Defendantâs counsel admitted that the burden of proof is on the Defendant to show the Plaintiffâs said air compressor hadcaused the fire resulting in damages to its properties. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Plaintiff denies liability and claims exemption under Clause 12 of the quotation and protection under Clause 3 of the rentalcontract requiring the Defendant to be responsible for insuring itsâ own loss.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Further, the Plaintiff claims the Defendant was negligent and had contributed to his own loss by the delay in reporting the fireand seeking immediate help from the Fire Services Department after the fire started.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The Defence Case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Defendant relied on the report compiled by Mr. Tam Chi Yung Tayor, Registered Professional Engineer in Marine and Navel Architectureof Win Well Engineering &amp; Surveyors Limited, appointed by the Defendant shortly after the fire on the Defendantâs barge atWong Shek Pier.  Mr. Tam had interviewed Mr. Lau and recorded a statement from him on 25 November 2005. It is attached as AppendixA of Win Well Engineering &amp; Surveyors Limited report (p. 410 of the Bundle). </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Mr. Tam conducted an inspection of the barge and the remains of the machines and plant on the barge after the fire.  He also interviewedMr. Lau Yau Tak (âMr. Lauâ) who was present at the construction site at the start of the fire.  Mr. Tam further checked the maintenancerecords of the air compressor (Appendix B of the report at p. 412 to 414 of the Bundle) before he compiled the report.  He concludedthe explosion of the air compressor was caused by human error because the Plaintiffâs mechanic in the process of repair had adjustedand increased the preset value of high temperature lock to 110ÂºC.  But he failed to make sure the automatic safety device was functioningwell after the high temperature lock was adjusted up to 110ÂºC.  He believed this had caused the air compressor to overheat thusleading to the explosion (p. 407 of the Bundle). </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Based on Mr. Tamâs conclusions, the Defendant claims the Plaintiff was in breach of the implied terms of the hiring contract andthat the air compressor was not of merchantable quality or free from defect.  And/or that the repair and maintenance of the saidair compressor was negligently done in breach of its duty as the owner of the air compressor and the terms of the hire contract.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The Plaintiffâs Defence </u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Plaintiff does not dispute that a fire broke out on board the Defendantâs flat top barge (âthe bargeâ) at Wong Shek Pieron 21 November 2005 (âthe fireâ) and that the two air compressors hired by the Defendant used on the barge at the material time,machine nos. 4868 and 4859 (âthe air compressorâ), were destroyed at the fire together with a generator, a piling machine andother plant and equipments on the barge. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Plaintiff put the Defendant to straight proof that the said air compressor was the cause of the fire and that the Plaintiffwas liable under the contract of hire and was negligence in the maintenance of the said air compressor. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In August 2007, the Plaintiff instructed Great East Asia Surveyors &amp; Consultants Co. Ltd. (âGEASâ) to carry out a desk studyof the documents and to give an expert opinion of the fire incident on 21 November 2005 on the barge moored at Wong Shek Public Pierin Sai Kung.  The Plaintiffâs expert report from Great East Asia Surveyors &amp; Consultants Co. Ltd. was prepared and compiledby Mr. Chung Cham Man, mechanical engineer and fire engineer Mr. Cheung Wai Ming on 28 August 2007 (p. 308 to 400 of the Bundle).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The 2 GEAS experts stated they did a desk study of the documentary information, photographs and other relevant details suppliedby the Plaintiff, these were annexed to the report. They further consulted the air compressor instruction manual and obtained additionalinformation from the air compressor dealer.  They gave their opinions and findings on the air compressorâs operation based on themanual, then proceeded with the fire engineer report commenting on (a) the Defendantâs investigation report of 30 November 2005from Win Well Engineering &amp; Surveyors Limited and; (b) the incident report from the Fire Services Department and other informationrelevant supplied by the Plaintiff.  The GEAS report was done without any site inspection, test or examination of the two air compressorsand the generator. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mr. Cheung, the fire engineer, made the following observations and findings:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  the fire was reported to the FSD at 1619 hours while Mr. Lau Yau Tak claimed he noticed the fire broke out at 1600 hours.  Therewas a close to 20 minutes delay before the FSD was called. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  according to Mr. Lauâs statement, from the time the fire first broke out to the time the fire spread to the bore pile machine,it took 22 minutes.  The 22 minutes taken seemed to be uncommon for an open fire.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)  there was an unoccupied area between the bore pile machine and the generator intended for storage of piles, but no spare pileswere visible from the photographs.  This area was considered a buffer zone where the fire would have stopped spreading. </p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)  all the wheels of the two air compressors were severely damaged by fire, it suggests that highly combustible materials were placedon the floor level resulting in the fast spread of fire from one end of the barge to the other.  The fast spread of fire could bedue to either:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(a)   the floor of the barge was covered with combustibles or a layer of grease deposited over a period of time; or</p>            <p style="text-align:justify">(b)  the presence of drums of accelerants (diesel or petrol) on the barge which had caused the fire to spread.</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(5)  The bore pile machine was heavy and would have weighed down the barge. When the fire started at the stern end of the barge, withthe presence of accelerants, the fire spread to the bore pile end (bow) of the barge.  If there was excessive storage of fuel, the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/295" class="autolink_findacts">Dangerous Goods Ordinance</a> may have been violated.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(6)  No evidence of noticeable combustibles could be seen at the foot of the air compressor from photo 5513.  The fire would havebeen very severe and the heat so strong to cause an explosion of the gas cylinder at the foot of the air compressor. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">He concluded that:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(7)  The fire did not start at the said air compressor but at the spot where the intensity of fire would be the greatest marked âxxxâon the sketch.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(8)  The metal platform erected in front of the generator having collapsed on one side suggests the high degree of heat intensity. It would have taken a large quantity of combustibles placed at the area for the fire to burn for a long time and to reach such heatintensity as to melt down one side of the metal structure. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(9)  Photo 5515 showed exposed electric wirings at the generator, these were probably connected to the welding machine at the timeof fire.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(10)  The fire damage on the floor level was more severe on the left hand side (as seen from photo 5516). The right hand side beingcloser to the generator, the burn marks on the floor suggests the fire had spread at the floor level.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(11)  Photo 5522 showed the wheel of the air compressor no. 4859 totally consumed by fire, it further suggests the intensity of thefire was high at a lower level.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(12)  Photo 5547 showed the body of the air compressor was in a better shape than the wheel beneath.  The wheel being totally damagedalso suggests the fire had spread at the floor level.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(13)  The wind had contributed to the spread of the fire. </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Based on the aforesaid findings the Plaintiffâs experts held a different view on the possible origin of fire to the Defendantâsexpert.  Their reasons being:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  Mr. Lau claimed he saw white smoke came from the radiator area of the right air compressor (No. 4859).  There was an explosionbefore fire broke out and spread to the neighbouring area.  However, the water tank next to the air compressor was not affected becausethe external part of the water tank was in good shape and articles deposited into the tank were apparently not affected by the fire.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  The area marked with âxxxâ should be the origin of the fire and the radiator of the air compressor may not be the fire originbut became involved in the fire at a later stage.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)  According to photo 5539, the part below the radiator was not completely damaged.  If the fire had started from the radiator,the lower part of the radiator shown in the photograph would have been totally consumed by fire. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)  Photo 5521 showed the extent of the damage inside the air compressor no. 4859 while photo 5538 showed the extent of damage insidethe air compressor no. 4868.  The damage done to the two air compressors were similar.  It suggests the fire may not have startedfrom the radiator of air compressor no. 4859; otherwise the damage done to the two machines would have been different. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(5)  Under normal circumstances, open fire could not have spread within 22 minutes from the point of origin to the bore pile machineplaced at the other end of the barge, a distance of more than 15m.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  They concluded that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  The fire had started at the spot marked âxxx:â and spread to the neighbouring air compressor no. 4859 from a low level. Within a short space of time, the generator was totally involved in the fire.  The fire then spread to the area near the two aircompressors.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  The fire having taken place at a low level generated heat that had accumulated inside the air compressor which damaged the upperportion of the inside of the machine.  Naked flame then escaped to the air compressor via the open door or through the air gulliesat the side.   </p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)  Though no conclusion could be drawn.  There are two possible causes for the fire:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(i)     electrical fault â the fire might have started due to faulty wirings leading from the generator to electrical appliancesin the area marked âxxxâ.</p>            <p style="text-align:justify">(ii)   disposal of cigarette ends â these could have been consumed in the fire or washed away by fire fighting jets.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The GEAS report admitted âsome of the information is personal speculations (not factual) in view that on-site investigation/interviewingof witnesses will not be carried outâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Apart from denying the cause of fire was the explosion of the said air compressor and putting the Defendant to straight proof, thePlaintiff further claimed that the terms contained in the rental contract are binding on the Defendant (p. 568 of the Bundle) togetherwith the terms on the quotation document (p. 516 of the Bundle).  The Plaintiff therefore claimed there was no breach of duty onthe part of the Plaintiff because the Plaintiffâs liability was exempted by virtue of the insurance clause (clause 3) in the rentalcontract.  Clause 3 of the rental contract stated:-</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">   â3.  ç§åºä¹æ©æ¢°ææä¿éªç±å°ç¤è² è²¬ãâ</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Furthermore, the Plaintiff claimed clause 12 of the quotation of 11 March 2005 (p. 516 of the Bundle) exempted the Plaintiff fromliability.  Clause 12 of the quotation stated:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIf the rented machine does not work on site, either damage or other reasons, the owner does not bear any cost, concerning any claimrelated with hirerâ project, such as damage of hirerâs plant, or delay of project etc.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The Plaintiff further claimed that the fire was caused or contributed by the Defendantâs own fault or negligence and that theloss and damage claimed by the Defendant are either too remote or not foreseeable or not within reasonable contemplation of the parties.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Issues to be determined</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  A.

The 31 November 2005WW report gave the cause of fire as the explosion of the said air compressor due to the over-heating of the said air compressor. Upon the oil hoses being destroyed in the explosion, oil from the hoses that turned into oil mist escaped into the atmosphere appearinglike white smoke or cloud around the air compressor. When the oil mist came into contact with the hot surface of the diesel engine,fire broke out.  Because there was a leakage of fuel, the fire spread over the vessel vigorously (p. 404 of the Bundle).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Mr. Tam claimed he found only a pile of irregular shaped aluminium metal on the deck of the barge after the fire, but he could notfind the fuel oil tank in the said air compressor.  He therefore suspected the pile of aluminium metal on the deck was the meltedfuel tank.  He believed the source of the fire was the radiator because this part of the machine had been burnt to the ground.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  As to the possible cause for the said air compressor exploding, in Mr. Tamâs opinion, it was due to the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  The automatic emergency shut down device of the air compressor was not functioning well when the machine lacked lubrication,the oil and air pressure became very high and the machine over-heated due to over running.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  The alarm sensors were not adjusted in accordance with the manufacturerâs recommendation.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)  The machine was overloaded.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)  The components were badly installed after the repair.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(5)  Unsuitable components were fixed onto the machine.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(6)  Malfunction of safety valves of the machine.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  He therefore concluded the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âWe are of the opinion that the explosion of air compressor was caused by human error.  Based on the information supplied (shownin Appendix B), the exploded air compressor was repaired by the owner, Messrs. Yau Hing Machinery Limited, several times before thefire incident happened on 21 November 2005.  On 16 November 2005, the mechanic of the owner had checked the electrical circuit andincreased the revolution of engine without any reason stated in the Maintenance Report.  On 18<sup>th</sup> November 2005, the air compressor shut down ten times on a day.  On 19<sup>th</sup> November 2005, the ownerâs mechanic came at 10:50 to repair the air compressor and left at 12:30.  He checked the electrical systemand increased the pre-set value of high temperature lock to 110ÂºC.  After such adjustment, he turned on the machine in no load andfound that the air compressor was operated without stop.  Apparently, he neglected that the temperature of the air compressor wouldbe increased gradually to its limited value when it is turned on and operated in full load for a period of time, and he also hadnot check and make sure that the automatic safety device to shut down the engine is functionally worked when detecting overheat. The air compressor was not use until 21<sup>st</sup> November 2005.  On 21<sup>st</sup> November, the air compressor had continuously run for about four hours in full load and then exploded.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mr. Tam relied on the eye witness account of one of the Defendantâs staff, Mr. Lau, whom he personally interviewed.  He interpretedwhat Mr. Lau told him at the interview and formed his conclusions.  The statement appeared on p. 410 of the bundle.  In the thirdline of the witness statement Mr. Lau was recorded to have said the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">  âæ¬äººç´å¨ä¸å4æç¼è¦ºâSP-1âå³è·é¢¨å£æ©ï¼ç·¨èï¼4859ï¼æ°´ç®±ä½ç½®åç½çï¼é¨å³è½å°éç¶å·¨å®ï¼è·èçè¦æ©èº«èµ·ç«ãâ    </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Mr. Tam did not agree with the Plaintiffâs expert Mr. Chung Cham Man, the mechanical engineer.  He also disagreed with the Plaintiffâswitness Mr. Mak Wing Chun, the mechanic,  that it was adequate to test the machine for 90 minutes after adjusting the air compressortemperature to 110ÂºC without waiting for the machine to shut down. In Mr. Tamâs opinion, there may be something wrong with thediesel engine or the compressor that led to the emergency shut-down of the air compressor.  He believed Mr. Mak had failed to followthe manufacturerâs instructions for the maintenance of the said air compressor. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In Mr. Tamâs opinion, the fire spread depended on the force and direction of the wind, the amount of oil spreading on the bargeand the gradient of the deck.  Even if there was a buffer zone on deck it would not have stopped the spread of the fire.  And becausethe fuel oil tank had melted, he believed large amount of fuel oil had leaked onto the deck of the barge which ignited and fuelledthe serious fire under the air compressor that had wholly destroyed the lower part of the air compressor.  The fire, which startedfrom the air compressor, then spread to the diesel generator aided by the wind blowing from stern to bow of the barge and fuelledby the oil from the oil tank that had melted down.  This in turn caused the steel angle bars supporting the steel platform to collapseunder high temperature.  In his opinion, it is not unusual for a fire to spread a distance of over 15 metres in 22 minutes understrong wind.  He disagreed that the origin of fire was at âxxxâ as suggested by Mr. Cheung. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Mr. Tam did not agree the fire was started by electrical fault because it would have been arrested and protected by the MCCB safetydevice installed in the generator (the electrical cables were connected to the diesel generator through a main switch board fittedwith MCCB safety device to protect short circuit).  Neither did Mr. Tam agree the fire was started by a discarded cigarette butt. In his experience, the deck of the barge is usually filled with water and mud rather than oil, which made it difficult for cigarette,ends to ignite and harder still to cause an explosion.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The Defendant produced a report from the Fire Services Department dated 18 March 2006 in response to the Defendantâs enquiry asto the investigation done by the Fire Services Department after the fire (p. 690 to 691 of the Bundle).  In the Fire Services Departmentreport, the FSD ruled out the fire was started by a deliberate act because it did not find any peculiar smell or traces of flammableliquid or accelerant or suspicious features.  As to whether the fire was caused by electrical fault, the FSD reported that workerson the barge claimed the air compressors and the piling plant were in operation during the outbreak of fire.  It further reportedthe following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âAt the material time, they noted some smoke emitting from one of the air compressors and later a fire came out from the aforesaidair compressor.  The fire then spread to nearby combustible material.  The electrical fittings and the internal parts of the twoair compressors and the piling plant were thoroughly examined after the fire.  As the air compressor and the piling plant were severelydamaged by fire, no sign of electrical fault could be detected.  The fire caused by electrical fault of the affected air compressorcould not be ascertained due to the severity of the fire damage to the air compressor.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The FSD also found no evidence of disposal of lighted smoking material that had caused the fire because cigarette ends had not beendetected on the barge after the fire and the workers claimed nobody was smoking at the barge at the time of the outbreak of fire.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The FSD found that welding works on the barge was carried out about 4 hours prior to the outbreak of fire at a location far awayfrom the believed point of fire origin.  It therefore ruled out the cause of fire by flying embers.  It further concluded:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âAfter careful deliberation into the above possible causes, the fire might possibly have been caused by electrical fault.  However,due to the severity of the fire damaged and lack of more substantial evidence and eye-witness, the cause of this fire is thereforereturned as âUnknownâ.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Findings</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Mr. Tam had attributed the cause of fire to the poor maintenance of the air compressor by the Plaintiffâs mechanic, Mr. Mak, foradjusting the safety automatic device to 110ÂºC from 105ÂºC.  He blamed Mr. Mak for failing to test the air compressorâs automaticshut-down device at 110ÂºC.  He believed there must have been another cause for the machineâs sudden cut off or shut down a fewdays prior to 16<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> November when Mr. Mak went to inspect and repair the air compressor at Wong Shek Pier. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  According to the instruction manual of the air compressor, the machineâs compression high temperature pressure element air out-letis adjustable up to 130ÂºC.  Consequently, Mr. Mak cannot be regarded as negligent when he adjusted the automatic shut-off deviceto 110ÂºC.  It was within the manufacturerâs safety limit.  Whether the machine had shut down because of other reasons is unknownbecause after the fire, the air compressor was badly damaged.  There was no inspection and examination of the machines or the bargedone by the manufacturer or by the two experts who prepared the report for the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The Fire Services Department report did not satisfactorily explain the cause of fire because it concluded the cause of fire wasâunknownâ.  Even though the FSD gave a number of possible causes of the fire and including the possible cause of electrical failure,this, however, cannot be positively ascertained because the electrical wiring and cables had been completely destroyed in the fire.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The experts could not agree where the fire started.  The Plaintiffâs expert Mr. Cheung reckoned the fire had possibly startedat the generator where he had marked âxxxâ on the sketch.  While Mr. Tam, the Defendantâs expert relied on the eye witnessaccount that claimed white smoke was seen coming out from the air compressor before an explosion occurred.  Thus, Mr. Tam believed,the fire must have started at the air compressor.  Even if the fire did start at where the eye witness claimed, and white smoke hadcame from the air compressor, it is not possible to conclude the outbreak of fire was due to the negligence or poor maintenance ofthe Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Mr. Tamâs theory of oil mist can only be one of a number of possible causes of the fire.  Failing further evidence in support,his theory remained only a theory based on the eye witnessâs account of white smoke and the air compressor overloaded and overheated. This theory is contradicted by the Plaintiffâs experts and is contrary to the specifications in the manufacturerâs manual.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>B</b>. (1)<u>Whether the Plaintiff is liable to the Defendantâs loss due to fire damages ?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The Defendant produced a site diary recorded on the day of the fire by the Defendantâs site representative. The diary was countersignedby the site engineer.  It recorded the fire/explosion had started at the air compressor during the piling operation and the firehad spread to the other part of the barge.  That fire engines had arrived at around 16.30 hours and the fire was put out at about17.45 hours (p. 736-1 of the Bundle No. 2).  It is not known who recorded this site diary, the record keeper was not called to giveevidence nor was the site representative from the Defendant, or indeed Mr. Lau, the eye witness interviewed by Mr. Tam.  In the letterfrom the FSD of 18 March 2006, references were made to workers on the barge claiming they saw smoke emitting from one of the aircompressors before the fire broke out from the said air compressor (p. 691 of the Bundle No. 2).  The workers who were interviewedby the Fire Services Department were not named.  The site diary report and the Fire Services Department report both referred to whatthey were told on the day of the incident.  These and the statement from Mr. Lau are all hearsay evidence as none of the makers werecalled to give evidence at the trial.   It must be noted that the FSD had recorded a verdict of âunknownâ cause of fire due tothe âseverity of the fire damage, lack of substantial evidence and eye witnessâ (p. 323 of Bundle).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The workers on the barge, the site representative and Mr. Lau were all employees of the Defendant or the Defendantâs sub-contractor. The Defendant could easily have identified them and adduce viva voce evidence from them at the trial.  At the hearing, I remindedthe Defendantâs Counsel the hearsay nature of the statement of Mr. Lau, which appeared in the annex to the WW report.  There wasno attempt from the Defendant to adduce evidence from Mr. Lau or the site engineer. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  On the other hand, the Plaintiffâs expert had suggested different causes of fire and a different location of the origin of thefire.  Unfortunately, their report remained speculative because they did not examined the air compressors, the generator or the pilingmachine after the fire.  They were asked only to give their opinions based on the documents shown to them.  Their suggestion of anexamination of the air compressor was apparently not taken up.  The Fire Services Departmentâs investigation concluded the causeof fire to be âunknownâ. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Miss Ng, counsel for the Defendant, referred to para. 5-78 of Charlesworth &amp; Percy on Negligence  (11<sup>th</sup> ed.) at p.396 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â<b>When cause of accident is unknown</b>. As already stated, it is not necessary for the claimant to give direct evidence of negligence. A case may be proved partly by directand partly by indirect evidence of negligence. In some cases the facts of an accident are unknown and, in order to succeed, the claimantmust then prove facts, from which an inference of negligence on the part of the defendant may be drawn. âIt is a mistake to thinkthat because an event is unseen its cause cannot be reasonably inferred.â The facts, however, must be such as to put the matterbeyond a mere surmise or conjecture and they must lead to a inference, which is a reasonable deduction from the facts actually observedand proved.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> While I am aware that where the evidence permits, a judge should come to a definite conclusion which partyâs negligence had causedthe accident (see para. 5-81 of Charlesworth and Percy on Negligence at p.397).  It is obviously so in a claim under tort involvinge.g. a road traffic accident or industrial accident.  In the present case, the Defendant based its claim on the Plaintiffâs breachof duty of the implied terms of a hiring contract.   Even though the Defendantâs counterclaim alleged the negligence of repairand maintenance of the machine hired to the Defendant by the Plaintiff, and a plea of res ipsa loquitur, it is incumbent on the Defendantto establish the Plaintiffâs liability by showing poor maintenance of the air compressor was the cause of fire.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43</a>,   The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur stems from the judgement of Erle in Scott v. London and St. Katherine Docks. Para. 8-151 ofCharlesworth &amp; Percy on Negligence, p. 497 stated that it :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âapplies where (1) the occurrence is such that it would not have happened without negligence and (2) the thing that inflicted thedamages was under the sole management and control of the defendant, or of someone for whom he was responsible or whom he has a rightto control. If these two conditions are satisfied it follows, on a balance of probability, that the defendant or the person for whomhe is responsible, must have been negligent. There is, however, a further negative condition: (3) there must be no evidence as towhy or how the occurrence took place. If there is, then appeal to res ipsa loquitur is inappropriate for the question of the defendantâsnegligence must be determined on that evidence. â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>   The doctrine does not require the Plaintiff in the present case to prove on a balance of probabilities that his explanation isthe correct one. If it is equally plausible as that of the Defendantâs, the Defendant will fail as it has the burden of proof.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>    Based on the evidence adduced, I am unable to reach a conclusion that the fire was caused by the lack of proper maintenance ofthe said air compressor or that the Plaintiff had failed to supply a machine of merchantable quality or it was in breach of the impliedterm of the contract of hire.  The Defendant has failed to discharge the burden of proof on a balance of probabilities that the firewas caused by the Plaintiffâs negligence in the maintenance of the air compressor.  Even if the fire did start at the air compressor,there are also a number of possible causes for the outbreak of fire suggested by the Plaintiffâs witnesses, such as the use ofpolluted diesel, the mishandling of the said air compressor causing it to over-heat and the accumulations of fuel and combustiblematerials close to the machines that caused the fire to spread quickly. The Defendant has failed to show that the intensity of thefire was due solely to the melt down of the oil tank of the air compressor rather than the presence of fuel close to the air compressorsand generator and other combustible materials on the deck of the barge. Furthermore, the Defendant had been operating the said aircompressor for 8 months prior to the fire.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(2<u>) Whether</u> <u>the Plaintiff</u> <u>is</u> <u>exempted by clause 3 of the rental contract and clause 12 of the quotation?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>   It is not disputed that prior to the hiring of the air compressor on 11 March 2005, the Plaintiff sent to the Defendant a fax copyof the quotation (p. 516 of the Bundle).  The quotation specified the model of the two air compressor machines requested by the Defendant,the terms of the hiring, the model numbers, monthly and daily rental and delivery charges.  Further, there were 12 terms and conditionsset out in the same document.  This document was signed by both parties with Mr. Ho representing the Plaintiff and a signature fromsomeone on behalf of the Defendant together with the Defendantâs chop.  The date of signature was 14 March 2005.  Clause 12 ofthis document stated:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIf the rented machine does not work on site, either damage or other reasons, the owner does not bear any cost, concerning any claimrelated with hirerâ project, such as damage of hirerâs plant, or delay of project etc.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>   It is not disputed that the Plaintiff would deliver the machine together with a rental contract.  This was done in the case ofthe two air compressors and the receipt of the two air compressors were signed by the Defendantâs site representative.  The Plaintiffrelied on the rental document dated 1 April 2005; it was signed by a Mr. Hung (ç§ä¸æ´ª) who represented the Defendant at the site(p. 568 of the Bundle).  This document bore the Plaintiffâs chop.  Clause 3 of the said rental contract stated that âthe insuranceof the rented machine is the responsibility for the site contractorâ.  Clause 11 further stated that âupon the signing of receiptof the rented machine at the construction site, this contract becomes immediately effectiveâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  It is Mr. Hoâs evidence that he had negotiated the terms of hire of the air compressors with a Mr. Michael Cheung of the Defendant. After forwarding the quotation to the Defendant, Mr. Ho telephoned Mr. Cheung to discuss the terms of the quotation and he had furtherinformed Mr. Cheung that he would require the Defendant to sign a rental contract with the Plaintiff.  The Plaintiff also reliedon previous hiring arrangements with the Defendant prior to the accident.  Mr. Ho accepted that there had been previous occasionsthat rental contracts and the corresponding purchase orders issued by the Defendant were relied on without any quotation issued.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Clearly the terms of the Plaintiffâs agreement with the Defendant of the said air compressor were based on both the quotationand the rental contract.  They are binding on the parties upon being signed by the Defendant or its representative.  It follows thatthe terms set out in both documents must be binding on both parties as the terms of hire.  On the aforesaid basis, I hold clause3 of the rental contract is binding on the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Base on my findings above that the Defendant had failed to establish the Plaintiffâs liability by a breach of duty under an impliedterms of the contract of hire and had supplied a defective air compressor to the Defendant and/or was negligent in the maintenanceof the said machine which caused the fire, I do not think it is necessary for me to go further into whether clause 3 of the rentalcontract and clause 12 of the quotation exempted the Plaintiff from liability or whether two clauses are unenforceable and void dueto ambiguity or vagueness or unfairness.     Suffice it for me to say, no one can disclaim liability by inserting an exemption clausein the contract if he failed to supply a safe machine or goods of merchantable quality (see <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/71" class="autolink_findacts">Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance</a>).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>   For the same reason, it is not necessary for me to go into whether the Defendant contributed to the negligence by the 20 minutesdelay in seeking assistance from the Fire Services Department or whether there were combustible materials on board the barge in breachof Fire Services Regulations thus contributing to the negligence to the cause or the size of the fire.  Or who should be responsibleto take out an insurance of the chattels on the barge or used in the construction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  For the aforesaid reasons, I give judgment to the Plaintiff in the sum of $302,888.14.
