Limited, appeals against an Order of Deputy District Judge A.Chow made on 16 November 2006 whereby the learned judge dismissed an appeal against the Order of Master Tracy Chan dated 13 June2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The learned Master had dismissed the defendantâs application for specific discovery, pursuant to its summons filed on 25 April2006, which Order dismissing the application was upheld on appeal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> This, then, is the defendantâs further appeal, pursuant to leave granted by Deputy Judge Chow on 23 March 2007, whereby the defendantseeks to set aside the earlier orders, and to obtain the specific discovery it initially had sought well over two years ago.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The nature of the case</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> No discovery application can be viewed in isolation, and thus it may assist to say a few words about the nature and broad shape ofthis case, which on any basis is hardly complex.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The defendant is a stockbroker in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The plaintiffs â for immediate purposes I put to one side which of the two plaintiffs in fact was the contracting client â dealtwith the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The essence of the case is that on 3 November 2000 the plaintiffs placed an order with the defendant to sell 3,000 shares of a companyknown as Gemstar-TV Guide International (âGemstarâ) on the NASDAQ exchange at a price of âUS$75 or betterâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> It is said that on that day sufficient buyers existed in the NASDAQ market to buy all 3,000 such shares at the stipulated price,but that for some reason the defendant only executed the order in terms of the sale of 1,000 shares at US$75.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> By letter dated 1 December 2000 the plaintiffs complained at the omission to sell the entire lot of Gemstar scrip as had been instructed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> By letter dated 4 December 2000 the defendant confirmed the existence of the sell order at âUS$75 or betterâ, but alleged theexistence of a âmarketâ or âstandard practiceâ to the effect that the broker would not fill the entire order at the minimumprice but would try and obtain a better price until the order was filled or the client had changed the instructions.  The defendantwent on to say that 1,000 shares were sold at the stipulated price, but that since that date the Gemstar share price had never reachedUS$75, and that âaccordinglyâ the balance of the order had not been completed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The plaintiffsâ case thus is that they are entitled to damages to reflect the failure to sell at the stipulated price.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> In fact, in mitigation of their alleged loss, on 14 December 2000 the plaintiffs had instructed the defendant to sell the remaining2,000 shares at US$40.5625 per share, thus realizing the sum of US$81,025 â hence the damages claimed is the sum of <b>US$68,875</b>, which amount represents the difference between the sum of US$149,900 (2,000 shares at US$75) and US$81,025, as ultimately was achievedupon the sale of the balance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> In light of the sum at stake, the action was commenced in the District Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Progress of the proceedings</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The writ in this action was issued on 2 November 2002, with a Statement of Claim endorsed thereon.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The Defence was filed on 3 December 2002.  There is no Reply.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Discovery and inspection followed thereafter, the defendant filing its List on 10 February 2003, a Supplemental List on 26 November2003, and a Second Supplemental List on 25 March 2004, with the plaintiffs filing their own List on 20 June 2003, and a SupplementalLists on 15 April 2005.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The Order 24, rule 7 summons issued by the defendant, which is the focus of this appeal, is dated 25 April 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> This summons is backed by an Affidavit of Eleanor Lam Sin Chee sworn on 27 April 2006, and is opposed by the Second Affidavit ofJeremy David Levy, sworn on 12 May 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> As indicated at the outset, this summons already has undergone two hearings, before Master Chan and Deputy District Judge Chow respectively,before culminating in this court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> If I may be permitted to say so, satellite litigation of this sort achieves little, save for obvious and unpalatable delay and whollyunnecessary wasted costs, and for my part I am unable to understand why this case, and in particular this aspect of the case, hasbeen permitted to develop in the way that it has.  It strikes me that a liberal dose of good sense would and should have preventeda minor and easily resolvable discovery disagreement from escalating into a major argument requiring resolution at Court of Appeallevel: either documents of the type sought by the defendant exist, in which case they should have been produced, or if they do not,or if there are no documents to be further discovered in addition to those already particularized within the plaintiffâs Lists,then a simple and straightforward Order 24, rule 7 affidavit to that effect would have been conclusive. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Moreover, in the broader context it is also worth making the point that on the face of the pleadings this dispute is eminently straightforward,and it is surprising that a simple (and, if I may say so, relatively small) commercial claim, wherein, at least on the face of thepleaded issues, the only issue of substance is the meaning/implication to be attributed to the phrase âor betterâ â as to which,in the âpure market contextâ at least the answer strikes me as entirely clear â should have been permitted to drag its proceduralfeet to the extent that a decision on the merits is unlikely now to be forthcoming until some 8 years after the events giving riseto the cause of action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Be that as it may.  That which now, regrettably, is required to occupy the attention of this court is the appeal upon the specificdiscovery issue, and it is to the detail of this that I now turn.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The specific discovery summons</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The defendantâs specific discovery summons, initially issued on 25 April 2006, was subsequently amended before the hearing belowto add an additional general ground (at (iii) below).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> As thus amended, this summons seeks the following categories of documents:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(i)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">documentation relating to the opening and operating of the securities trading account with the defendant on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff by the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(ii)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">documentation relating to the trading of shares listed with the Australian Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Exchange by the defendanton the instructions of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, including but not limited to trading in shares in âGemstarâ, Climax Mining, Woolworths Limited, Aeroflex Inc., MisonixInc. and Citric Systems Inc.;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iii)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">alternatively, there be a further and better List served by the plaintiffs in their possession, custody and power relating to âanymatter in question in this actionâ.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Applicable principle</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Applicable legal principle is, as one would expect, not in dispute.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The learned Deputy Judge correctly summarized the legal principles relating to specific discovery at paragraph 7 of his judgmentbelow: see <i>Berkeley Administration Inc v.

he maintained that the agency for a disclosed principal was obvious from the documents disclosed relating to the disputedshare trade.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> On behalf of the defendant, Mr Beresford submitted that it is the defendantâs case that communications between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd </sup>plaintiffs will tend to show, directly or by inference, whether in dealing with the defendant the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff was acting <i>qua</i> principal or <i>qua</i> agent, and in turn, therefore, whether the defendant owed a duty of care in tort to the 1<sup>st </sup>or 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs, and if so, whether it was discharged. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> The further implication of this, he said â and it is <i>this</i> element of the case which is the important point in this context â was whether the practical âin houseâ meaning to be attributedto the phrase âor betterâ, as contended for by the defendant, had been brought to the attention of the 1<sup>st </sup>plaintiff and/or to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, the defendant having pleaded (at para 7(3) of its Defence) that the standard practice of the defendant broker with regardto âor betterâ instructions specifically had been made known to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff through conversations between a Ms Man of the latter and Ms Cheung of the defendant prior to 3 November 2000, and fromthe previous course of dealing between the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff and the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> In my view there is something in this argument, and I am far from sure that the learned judge below fully recognized its discoveryimplications. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> I accept, of course, as Mr Westbrook submitted, that for all practical purposes it makes no difference whether it is the 1<sup>st</sup> or the 2<sup>nd </sup>plaintiff which recovers against the defendant, nor whether it is the 1<sup>st </sup>or 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff which is the contracting party, but this is nothing to the immediate point, which, from the standpoint of the defendantâscase, is to affix the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff principal and/or the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff agent with the knowledge that the term âor betterâ has the particular meaning/implication attributed to it by the defendant,thereby enabling the defendant to establish that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, <i>qua</i> contracting party, was in possession of such knowledge pursuant to communication with its agent, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, and further to verify the specifically pleaded factual allegation (see paragraph 7(2) of the Defence) that the defendantindeed had informed the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff of such meaning.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Such communication(s) between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs may or may not establish that which the defendant now seeks to establish as part of its case, but it seems clear thatthis category of documents simply cannot be dismissed as irrelevant, and <i>may</i> have the effect of proving or disproving this salient issue; in <i>Peruvian</i> <i>Guano</i> terms, therefore, that such discovery may promote a relevant line(s) of inquiry and have the effect of buttressing the defendantâscase or of undermining that of the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> In what turned out to be his main argument upon this appeal, Mr Westbrook has forcefully submitted before us that the learned judgebelow, and for that matter the learned Master before him, had been entirely correct in concluding that there was no evidence of theexistence of inter-plaintiff communications which would establish any case relating to the plaintiffâs understanding of the particularmeaning to be attributed to the term âor betterâ, and that this was no more than a âfishingâ expedition, the more so sincein their Lists of Documents as filed the plaintiffs had put into discovery everything that was considered of relevance to the pleadedissues, and that what was now occurring was that the defendant in effect was seeking to verify the ambit of such discovery.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Mr Beresford met this argument â which was mounted generally with regard to the two specific categories of documents the subjectof this specific discovery application â by submitting that this was certainly not âfishingâ, and that in light of the pleadedissues his client was entitled to such documentation as had passed between the plaintiffs, suggesting that the circumstantial probabilitywas that relevant documents existed from which at the least inferences could be drawn as to the requisite knowledge on the part ofthe plaintiffs of the âhouse meaningâ of the rubric âor betterâ. In the course of this submission Mr Beresford drew the courtâsattention to a Lexis transcript of the English Court of Appeal decision in <i>Conopco Inc v. Ernst and Young</i> dated 1 September 1993 in which Evans LJ rejected like arguments of âfishingâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> I accept that this exercise is not âfishingâ in the accepted sense, given the probability of existence of this class of documents,and in the circumstances of this case I have concluded that this element of the specific discovery application should have been allowed,and that the learned judge below was in error in not recognizing the force of the specific discovery submission made on behalf ofthe defendant, and thus in dismissing this category of documents as irrelevant and non-discoverable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> However, I have also taken the view that it is unsatisfactory that in its present form the request is temporally unlimited, and accordinglyI would qualify the specific discovery sought under the 1<sup>st</sup> category so that it is restricted to documentation passing between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs from the date of the opening of the securities trading account with the defendant by the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff up to and including the date of the âGemstarâ transaction, namely 3 November 2000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Category (ii)</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> The second category essentially reflects the other side of the same specific discovery coin, the affidavit of Ms Lam in support ofthe application suggesting that documentation referable to the Gemstar trade and other trades in Australian shares would containinformation on how the defendant would and did execute an âor betterâ order âsuch that the 1<sup>st </sup>plaintiff would understand the potential consequence of itâ in instructing the 2<sup>nd </sup>plaintiff to place a trading order on this basis.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> In the court below the learned judge once more agreed with the conclusions of the Master who, <i>inter alia</i>, indicated that she was not satisfied that such documents as existed would contain information indicating whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff had explained the nature and consequences of the different types of order, and in particular the defendantâs view ofthe meaning/implication of the âor betterâ rubric.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Before us, Mr Westbrook SC repeated the submission that in this regard both the Master and the Deputy Judge were entirely correctin the conclusion to which they came, noting that the pleaded issue related only to what passed between representatives of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff and the defendant, and that the courts below were right in failing to be satisfied that such documents existed, at leastin the sense of containing the explanations as to the meaning to be attributed to the rubric âor betterâ in which the defendantnow was interested.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> To the contrary, Mr Beresfordâs approach mirrored the argument as had been utilized in regard to the first category of specificallydiscoverable documents; as he put it: âthe communications between the plaintiffs can reasonably be expected to show or allow inferencesto be drawn as to whether the practice had been incorporated into the contract and discovery ought therefore to have been ordered.â Once again, therefore, in terms of the existence of such documents from the defendantâs standpoint the doctrine of circumstantialprobability ruled the day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> There clearly is substantial overlap between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd </sup>categories of documents, albeit having decided that the 1<sup>st</sup> category should be discovered in my view it did not inevitably follow that there should be similar success in terms of this secondcategory.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> For my part I was concerned that, whilst for these purposes I was prepared to assume the probability of existence of relevant documents,it struck me with some force that the second category of documents as sought on the face of the application was unnecessarily wideand unlimited, and for this reason potentially oppressive, and as such likely to be subject to discretionary refusal on this basisalone.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> It was in this context that during this appeal the court expressed its misgivings in this regard to Mr Beresford, and the hearingwas briefly stood down in order for counsel to consider some form of limitation to this second category, although it was clear onthe face of the pleading that there was some justification for the width of the request given that the defendant was alleging a courseof dealing between the parties (see paragraph 7(3) of the Defence) wherein it was averred that in addition to the alleged conversationson the point between Ms Man and Ms Cheung prior to 3 November 2000, that the âhouse practiceâ of the defendant with regard tothe âor betterâ instruction could be divined âfrom the previous course of dealing between the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff and the defendantâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> In the event having considered the courtâs concern that the application within the 2<sup>nd</sup> category was unnecessarily wide, Mr Beresford drew our attention to a âSchedule of the Trading History between Asiacorp Nomineesand CLSA Limitedâ, which was exhibited as âJDL-3â to the affidavit of Mr Levy in opposition to the application.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> From this schedule in transpired that out of the initial 73 share dealing transactions as recorded between the defendant broker andthe 2<sup>nd </sup>plaintiff up to and including the âGemstarâ trade, in 26 of these transactions (which covered the period 15 June 1998 to 3 November2000) the client name was listed as âMan Cheungâ, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff herein, and thus the concern that this was a bottomless specific discovery pit was to a large extent assuaged.  Added tothis, Mr Beresford made it clear that he would be content to obtain discovery of such documentation relating to the discovery ofdocumentation referable to trading in these shares when, and only when, such trades themselves had been conducted on an â$X orbetterâ basis.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> I am satisfied, albeit with these twin limitations engrafted thereon, that the specific discovery application also should be grantedin terms of this 2<sup>nd</sup> category, and that, in part at least, the conclusion of the learned judge below was in error.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Category (iii)</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> The learned judge below does not appear to have considered the amendment to the summons before him, and if I may say so this wasunderstandable in light of the broad terms of such amendment at 1A of the summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> In this regard Mr Beresford did attempt to justify and explain the rationale for the introduction of this final category, but I regretthat I was wholly unable to grasp the point.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> It seems to me that either a case for specific discovery is made out in all the circumstances, or it is not, and for my part I failto perceive the relevance of an amendment to a specific discovery application which makes reference, in terms, to the obligationof general discovery.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> It is also fair to observe, Mr Levyâs affidavit demonstrates, that the plaintiffs and their solicitors are well aware of theirgeneral duty as to discovery under Order 24, rule 8.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Order</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para"
