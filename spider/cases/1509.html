As the Plaintiff claimed that he did not understand thearguments of the two defendants to strike out his claim, I directed that the Defendants should within 28 days lodge with the courtand serve on the Plaintiff written submissions in both English and Chinese.  I adjourned all the applications to 27 April 2007 at11:30 a.m. for hearing.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> When the applications came before me again, the Plaintiff insisted that I should enter judgment against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as he had failed to file and serve any defence.  I refuse the application.  I agree that the law provides that judgmentcan be entered if no defence is filed within the prescribed period.  The court is rather reluctant to do so without considering themerits of the case.  Usually time for filing the defence is extended in a situation like the present one where the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant has applied to strike out the statement of claim.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> As to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs application, the Plaintiff insisted that a translation of all proceedings filed and served by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant be supplied to him first.  He claimed that he did not understand their contents.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> I find that it is a waste of time and effort to do the translation.  The crux of the Defendantsâ applications is that the plaintiffhas no reasonable cause of action and the claim is frivolous and vexatious.  On 28 March 2007 I had ordered the Defendants to setout their arguments both in English and Chinese to facilitate the Plaintiff to understand the applications.  The Defendants havecomplied with my directions.  The Plaintiff should have understood what the arguments are.

In the Plaintiffâs words, a total sum of $50,000 was raised to that $60,000.  The Plaintiffalleged that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had not asked the Principal Magistrate for explanation and did not advise him to appeal.  For the purpose of this strikingout application, I assume that the Plaintiffâs allegation is true.  I do not find any loss that the Plaintiff has suffered becauseof such default.  In fact, it needs no advice on appeal if one is not satisfied with a magistrateâs decision.  It makes no differencewhether the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant asked the Principal Magistrate to give reasons.  For such minor variation of bail term, I doubt very much any applicationto the High Court would likely be successful.  It is a waste of costs and effort; it is a course which no sensible lawyer would advisehis client to take.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Consolidation of the different cases</u></p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The Plaintiff said that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not properly advise him about the consequence of the consolidation.

It has been a long established rule that barristersenjoy immunity from claim on negligence in performing his duty as an advocate in civil or criminal matters.  There must be a goodpublic policy reason behind.  This immunity has been reviewed and examined in the case of <i>Arthur Hall v. Simons</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20AC%20615" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 AC 615.</a>  In effect, the immunity has been abolished in England.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> In Hong Kong, the Chief Justice in the case of <i>HKSAR v.

Judges have the responsibility and indeed the duty to develop the common law to respond to changing needs.  Thus, when the Houseof Lords developed the tort of negligence on the neighbour principle in the seminal case of <i>Donoghue v.</i> <i>Stevenson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1932%5d%20AC%20562" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1932] AC 562</a>, it did not mean that this has been the position under the common law since time immemorial.  Similarly when the House of Lords decidedin <i>Arthur J S Hall &amp; Co v Simons</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20AC%20615" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 AC 615</a> not to follow its previous decision in <i>Rondel v.

Worsley</i> was wrongly decided.  Rather, the question was reconsidered over three decades later in the light of changes in the law of negligence,the functioning of the legal profession, the administration of justice and public perceptions.  Where the common law has developedin this way, it is usually unnecessary to decide on the precise point of time when the change occurred.  Conceivably, such an issuemay arise in a particular case.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, it should be added that no view is expressed on the questionwhether the common law in Hong Kong on the question of advocateâs immunity should be developed along the same lines as in England.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The Chief Justice confirms the following position:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)      That the common law should evolve to meet the changing needs of the society.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)     There have been changes in the law of negligence, the function of the legal profession, the administration of justice andpublic perceptions.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)      Such an issue may arise in a particular case.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d)     He expresses no view whether the common law in Hong Kong on the question of advocateâs immunity should be developed alongthe same lines as in England.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Without the assistance of counsel on the subject whether common law should be changed on the advocateâs immunity I leave the matteras it is.

In the Notice of Appeal he did not give any ground at all.  He hadplenty of time to consider the specific ground.  At no time, he provided the court any ground at all.  Neither did he ever put forwardthe allegation that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had been negligent.  After more than half a year, when the appeal was about to be heard, he abandoned the appeal.  Thisshows that he himself had come to the conclusion the appeal was not sustainable.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> I agree with Mr. Bulletâs written submission that âto allow this action in negligence to go forward would involve relitigatingin a civil court a matter to which a full trial in a competent court had been devotedâ.  We should not allow litigation to go onand on without a finality.  He has had the chance of putting forward his case in the appeal but has chosen not to do so.
