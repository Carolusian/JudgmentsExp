The application arises in the following way.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="36"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p2" name="p2">2.</a> Some years ago this <brs_term brs_term_id="15" brs_term_type="9">applicant</brs_term>, Mr Fok Siu Wing, was arrested by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (&quot;the ICAC&quot;) on suspicion of corruptionoffences. Two charges were brought against him. One was of soliciting an advantage. The other was of accepting an advantage. He wastried before a Magistrate. The Magistrate acquitted Mr Fok on the soliciting charge, but convicted him on the accepting charge. MrFok then appealed to the High Court against that <brs_term brs_term_id="16" brs_term_type="9">conviction</brs_term>. And his appeal succeeded. The <brs_term brs_term_id="17" brs_term_type="9">conviction</brs_term> was <brs_term brs_term_id="52" brs_term_type="9">quash</brs_term>ed: with the judge hearing the appeal saying that he had &quot;a <brs_term brs_term_id="0" brs_term_type="2">lurking doubt</brs_term>&quot;. That was in late 1995.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="37"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p3" name="p3">3.</a> On 21 August 1997 Mr Fok started a civil action in the High Court against the ICAC. Throughout such civil <brs_term brs_term_id="18" brs_term_type="9">litigation</brs_term> he has acted in person. He now acts in person before us.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="38"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p4" name="p4">4.</a> His <brs_term brs_term_id="19" brs_term_type="9">Statement of Claim</brs_term> reads as follows:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="39"><p class="quote">&quot;(1) There had been falsification of charge(s) and making of <brs_term brs_term_id="1" brs_term_type="3">unfounded accusations</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>        <brs_paragraph id="40"><p class="quote">(2) I had been kept in custody without any proof of crime, had been inflicted with ferocity on my neck an injury that might kill andhad been forced to own up to the <brs_term brs_term_id="2" brs_term_type="3">falsified charge</brs_term>(s).</p></brs_paragraph>        <brs_paragraph id="41"><p class="quote">(3) There had been outraging of human rights, using of violence strictly prohibited in law and taking by force of me one photographwhich depicts an insult to my personality.</p></brs_paragraph>        <brs_paragraph id="42"><p class="quote">(4) The Independent Commission Against Corruption had made use of <brs_term brs_term_id="3" brs_term_type="3">unwarranted charge</brs_term>(s) to harm me and my whole family. As a result, I have been out of work for almost three years; I might even become unemployed forthe rest of my life. A serious wound had been caused to such an exceptionally unfortunate family and all members of the family henceare mentally hurt to the extreme. The court is therefore requested to order an award of exemplary <brs_term brs_term_id="20" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> against the Independent Commission Against Corruption in the sum of two million Hong Kong dollars.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="43"><p>That amounts to a pleading of two <brs_term brs_term_id="21" brs_term_type="9">causes of action</brs_term>: <brs_term brs_term_id="4" brs_term_type="3">malicious prosecution</brs_term> and assault.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="44"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p5" name="p5">5.</a> The ICAC applied for the <brs_term brs_term_id="25" brs_term_type="9">striking out</brs_term> of Mr Fok's <brs_term brs_term_id="22" brs_term_type="9">Statement of Claim</brs_term> and the dismissal of his action. They contended that his</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="45"><p><brs_term brs_term_id="49" brs_term_type="9">Statement of Claim</brs_term> disclosed no reasonable <brs_term brs_term_id="23" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term>. And they contended that his action was <brs_term brs_term_id="5" brs_term_type="3">frivolous</brs_term>, <brs_term brs_term_id="6" brs_term_type="3">vexatious</brs_term> and an <brs_term brs_term_id="26" brs_term_type="9">abuse</brs_term> of process.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="46"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p6" name="p6">6.</a> Their application succeeded before a <brs_term brs_term_id="27" brs_term_type="9">Master</brs_term>. The <brs_term brs_term_id="28" brs_term_type="9">Master</brs_term>'s <brs_term brs_term_id="29" brs_term_type="9">decision</brs_term> was upheld on appeal to a Judge in Chambers.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="47"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p7" name="p7">7.</a> Mr Fok wanted to appeal to the Court of Appeal. But he found himself out of time for doing so. Subject to an extension of time grantedby a single judge of the Court of Appeal or the Court of Appeal itself, he had to serve his <brs_term brs_term_id="50" brs_term_type="9">notice of appeal</brs_term> not later than 14 days after the Judge in Chambers <brs_term brs_term_id="30" brs_term_type="9">dismissed</brs_term> his appeal from the Master.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="48"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p8" name="p8">8.</a> The Judge in Chambers did that on 25 November 1997. About three months later, on 24 February 1998, Mr Fok took out an applicationfor an extension of time for appealing to the Court of Appeal against the dismissal by the Judge in Chambers of his appeal againstthe <brs_term brs_term_id="31" brs_term_type="9">Master</brs_term>'s decision.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="49"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p9" name="p9">9.</a> On 11 March 1998 that application for an extension came before a single judge of the Court of Appeal. He dismissed it.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="50"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p10" name="p10">10.</a> Mr Fok then renewed such application before the Court of Appeal itself on 30 April 1998. On that day the Court of Appeal grantedan extension of time for appealing against the striking out of the <brs_term brs_term_id="32" brs_term_type="9">Statement of Claim</brs_term> only in respect of the assault claim, but not in respect of the <brs_term brs_term_id="33" brs_term_type="9">malicious prosecution</brs_term> claim. The Court of Appeal handed down its reasons on 29 May 1998.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="51"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p11" name="p11">11.</a> Shortly stated, the Court of Appeal thought along these lines. There was no point in granting an extension in respect of the <brs_term brs_term_id="37" brs_term_type="9">malicious prosecution</brs_term> claim. Why? Because there were no reasonable <brs_term brs_term_id="35" brs_term_type="9">grounds of appeal</brs_term> against the striking out of that claim. Why? Because the <brs_term brs_term_id="34" brs_term_type="9">Statement of Claim</brs_term> did not begin to plead the element of malice i.e. <brs_term brs_term_id="7" brs_term_type="3">improper motive</brs_term>, which is one of the essential ingredients of the <brs_term brs_term_id="36" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> of <brs_term brs_term_id="46" brs_term_type="9">malicious prosecution</brs_term>. As far as the claim in assault is concerned, however, there was room for reasonable argument to the following effect. The Judgein Chambers had mistakenly taken the pleaded allegation of assault as confined to the time when ICAC personnel had photographed MrFok following his arrest. In fact that allegation encompasses other incidents. And whether or not it is viable was a reasonable questionto raise in the Court of Appeal.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="52"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p12" name="p12">12.</a> Mr Fok now seeks <brs_term brs_term_id="39" brs_term_type="9">leave to appeal</brs_term> to the <brs_term brs_term_id="38" brs_term_type="9">Court of Final Appeal</brs_term> against the Court of Appeal's decision to refuse an extension in respect of the <brs_term brs_term_id="40" brs_term_type="9">malicious prosecution</brs_term> claim.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="53"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p13" name="p13">13.</a> We have considered Mr Fok's points.
