The plaintiffs, who are numerous and come exclusivelyfrom jurisdictions other than Hong Kong, fall conveniently into three groups. The first comprises three parties to a joint ventureformed for the construction of the academic area of a new university in Riyadh in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ("the Contractors").The second group form a consortium ("the Precast Construction Group") which supplied the precast prime building units required forthe project. The remaining 10 plaintiffs were the architectural and engineering consultants and form a consortium known, for somereason, as "the HOK + 4 Consortium".</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The plaintiffs' claim is based on an All Risks insurance policy taken out in 1981 with the defendants, the Red Sea Insurance CompanyLtd, a company incorporated in Hong Kong although they are said to have their head office in Saudi Arabia.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The statement of claim alleges that during the currency of the policy structural damage occurred to the property insured, being mademanifest over the period May 1983 to May 1984. The damage was made good by the plaintiffs at a cost of a little under US$6 million,but the defendants refuse to indemnify.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The defence in general is that the costs incurred by the plaintiffs were for correcting bad design or workmanship, risks specificallyexcluded from the policy. A particular defence against the Precast Construction Group is that those plaintiffs were not covered bythe policy, or alternatively, by refusing to pay the premium, they are estopped from relying on the policy. The pleader then refersto various other matters, such as the failure of the Precast Construction Group to notify the defendants of the damage or to cooperatewith them and the need of the other plaintiffs to give credit for monies received and so on. He finally adds a counterclaim. Thisis directed only against the Precast Construction Group, alleging breach of a duty of care owed by that group to the other plaintiffsin the design and manufacture of the particular elements of the building, which breaches caused the damage complained of and forwhich the defendants are entitled to recover "by way of subrogation" of the other plaintiffs' rights. The prayer is for an orderthat the defendants recover from the Precast Construction Group whatever they may be found liable to pay to the other plaintiffs,or a declaration to similar effect.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> On the 18th April last year the Precast Construction Group took out a summons to strike out the counterclaim as disclosing no reasonablecause of action; on the 28th October the defendants sought leave to amend the counterclaim by adding a new paragraph:</p>    <p class="quote">    "24. The Defendant will contend in  relation to the Counterclaim herein:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a) that the law governing:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i) relations between the Precast Construction Group and the Contractors and/or the HOK + 4 Consortium; and</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(ii)the claim by the Defendant herein against the Precast Construction Group is the law of and applied in Saudi Arabia;</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(b)that by the law of and applied in Saudi Arabia, the Defendant is entitled to and does stand in the shoes of the Contractors and/orthe HOK + 4 Consortium insofar as, which is denied, there is any liability by the Defendant to make payments under the claim hereinto the Contractors and/or the HOK + 4 Consortium or any of them."</p>            <p>(We have interpolated the names we are using.)</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The two summonses were heard together before Jones, J. In a reasoned judgment handed down on the 21st November he struck out thecounterclaim and dismissed the application to amend. By this appeal this court is asked to rule that the learned judge should havemade no order on the application to strike out and have given leave to amend in the terms we have just set out, albeit there is pendingbelow a more recent application to amend by way of a completely re-drafted counterclaim. It is conceded that the pleading, as itstood before Jones, J, was defective and liable to be struck out. But it is contended that it could have been cured by amendmentand that therefore that course ought not to have been taken.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The new pleading, if we understand the submissions correctly, will put the counterclaim in two ways, both relying on a foundationin Saudi Arabian law. The first, referred to by Mr Tong for the defendants as "a direct cause of action", will rely on what is saidto be in that law a right in negligence vested directly in the defendants themselves as insurers. The second, "the indirect causeof action", relies upon a right given by that law to the defendants to enforce for themselves the similar rights of the other plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The classic exposition of the law relating to torts committed beyond the jurisdiction is to be found in the judgment of Willes, J,in <u>Phillips v Eyre</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281870%29%20LR%206%20QB%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1870) LR 6 QB 1.</a> It was considered in depth by the House of Lords in <u>Boys v Chaplin</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] AC 356.</a> In consequence, the learned editor of the ninth edition of Dicey &amp; Morris on the Conflict of Laws re-formulated what was thenrule 172, now rule 205, in these words:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">"Rule 205. - (1) As a general rule, an act done in a foreign country is a tort and actionable as such in England, only if it is both</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(a) actionable as a tort according to English law, or in other words is an act which, if done in England, would be a tort; and</p>                <p class="quote">(b) actionable according to the law of the foreign country where it was done.</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="quote">    (2) But a particular issue between the parties may be governed by the law of the country which, with respect to that issue, hasthe most significant relationship with the occurrence and the parties."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Sub-rule (2) is derived from the speech of Lord Wilberforce, supported by that of Lord Hodson and possibly that of Lord Pearson.Lord Donovan was contrary minded and Lord Guest, with respect, abstained.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The position in Hong Kong was considered by another division of this court in <u>The Adhiguna Meranti</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20HKLR%20904" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] HKLR 904.</a> That appeal arose from the grounding in Taiwan of an Indonesian owned vessel and was concerned with an application to stay proceedingshere in favour of Jakarta. Hunter, JA, delivering the judgment of the court, said at 914:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"     The defendant's alternative formulation is based upon the new sub-rule (2) to Dicey's rule 172. Dicey's hopes here have notyet been fulfilled. The formulation still has the support only of Lord Wilberforce and has not been adopted since in England. InAustralia it was rejected in <u>Kolksy v. Mayne Nickless</u> for reasons which carry conviction with us. We do not think that it can yet be regarded as part of the law of Hong Kong."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The court took note of their lordships' concern that a strict application of the basic rule might encourage forum-shopping, but wasnevertheless satisfied that such conduct could be sufficiently controlled by the discretion to stay proceedings:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">" ... we think that the proper exercise of the jurisdiction does provide a more convenient answer to forum-shopping than some uncertainrelaxation of the substantive law."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> We take these passages to be a firm exclusion of the sub-rule from the law of Hong Kong. Whether today, being addressed with differentarguments, we would come to the same conclusion is a question not open for consideration. This court has long considered itself boundby its own decisions, subject to the usual exceptions: <u>Ng Yuen Sui v AG</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20HKLR%20352" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] HKLR 352.</a> We accept the caveat in the court's opinion, introduced by the inclusion of the word "yet", but all that has happened in the lastfive years is that the Court of Appeal of Ontario and the majority of the High Court of Australia have spoken of the desirabilityof permitting, in appropriate circumstances, some relaxation of the basic rule. In our view that would not be sufficient to justifythis court's departing from its earlier decision.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> We are likewise not persuaded that the decision was given per incuriam, as that phrase is properly understood: see per Lord Evershed,MR, in <u>Morelle v Wakeling</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%201All%20ER%20708" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] 1All ER 708</a> at 718.

Nor are we persuaded that the decision was obiter. Itwas a necessary decision en route to the overall question as to whether, should the action continue in Hong Kong, a foreign law oflimitation of liability should apply in preference to that of Hong Kong. Finally we do not think the earlier decision can be distinguishedon the facts, the suggestions being that there was in that case a choice between two possible laws (as opposed to simply one in thepresent); that neither of those foreign laws provided a complete defence; and that the present proceedings are brought by way ofcounterclaim. These factors seem to us to have no bearing upon the principle behind the decision. It is conceded, we think, thatthe proposed direct cause of action is unsustainable without the benefit of Dicey's sub-rule (2). In our view that inevitably followsfrom the decision of this court in the <u>The Adniguna Meranti.</u></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> We turn then to the "indirect cause of action", i.e. the defendants' claim to pursue in their own name rights which they say theContractors and the HOK + 4 Consortium will have against the Precast Construction Group. It is clear that they cannot do so by HongKong law, partly because they would be obliged to sue in the name of the Contractors and the Consortium, and partly because no actionwould lie until they themselves had paid up. But if they may be able, in due course, to establish by Saudi Arabian law, which isaccepted as the proper law of the contract of insurance upon which the plaintiffs sue, a contractual right to such a claim, we seeno reason why they should be deprived of the opportunity of doing so, subject to the limitation point to which we now turn.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Before doing so it may be convenient to dispose of the suggestion that the counterclaim should be struck out because of the principlethat no claim is sustainable for damages arising from negligence in building works where such damage consists only of economic loss.With respect, this is not an argument relevant at this stage. The true nature of the loss in question, and if only economic, whetherthere is nevertheless sufficient proximity for its recovery, are questions which in our view can only properly be dealt with at atrial.</p>    <p><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 35(1)</a> to (6) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap 347</a>, provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"     (1) For the purposes of this Ordinance, any new claim made in the course of any action shall be deemed to be a separate actionand to have been commenced -</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(a) in the case of a new claim made in or by way of third party proceedings, on the date on which those proceedings were commenced;and</p>            </blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(b) in the case of any other new claim, on the same date as the original action.</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="quote">    (2) In this section a new claim means any claim by way of set-off or counterclaim, and any claim involving either-</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(a) the addition or substitution of a new cause of action;

or to put it in another way, the defendants have squandered the one and only opportunity given to them by the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> We find ourselves unable to accept that argument.We express no opinion as to the effect of the subsections once a counterclaim hasin fact been struck out, but until that has been done it seems to us that, whether it is viable or not, it remains a counterclaimand may be amended with leave provided the amendment complies, in the present instance, with order 20 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5(5)</a>, i.e. if the effect is to add a new cause of action, that the new cause arises out of the same or substantially the same facts alreadypleaded.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> In <u>Robinson v Unicos Proprietary Corporation Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%201%20WLR%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] 1 WLR 520</a> at 525 Holroyd Pearce, LJ, explained "new cause of action" in this context as "a claim made on a certain basis". Adopting that approachhere it seems to us that, however inelegantly it may have been drafted, the claim in the original counterclaim was clearly made onthe basis that the defendants were entitled to enforce for themselves whatever rights the Contractors and the HOK + 4 Consortiummight have by reason of what is said to be the negligence of the Precast Construction Group. That is the same claim as is made, sowe are told, in the proposed amendment. The only difference is that the amendment will contain an express, and we assume properlypleaded, reference to Saudi Arabian law. That is technically a question of fact, but as Holroyd Pearce, LJ, observed in the samecase, the rules do not necessarily exclude the amendment of a material <sub>.</sub>averment after the period of limitation. This difference is insufficient, in our view, to cast the mantle of "newness" upon what issubstantially the same claim as originally made. The defendants are therefore in a position to take advantage of Order 20 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5(5).</a></p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> It is, we think, well established that the court will in general not strike out as defective a pleading which is capable of beingcured by amendment. The amendment proposed below was by no means sufficient to achieve that purpose. Whether that now proposed willbe more successful is a matter for whichever judge hears the application stayed pending the outcome of this appeal. But we wouldhold it unjust, if that indeed would be the consequence of striking out the counterclaim, to deprive the defendants of the opportunityto make the application at all.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> For these reasons we allow the appeal to the extent of setting aside the order dismissing the counterclaim, but no more. We are pleasedto be able to come to that conclusion, for it seems to us eminently sensible that all the disputes between the various parties shouldbe disposed of at one and the same time.
