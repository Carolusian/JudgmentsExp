By that judgment, the Judge refusedto grant the plaintiff leave to appeal from the decision of the Registrar of 13 November 2006 out of time, dismissed the plaintiffâsappeal from the decision of the Registrar of 29 December 2006 and ordered the plaintiff to pay the costs of the defendant accordingly.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The plaintiff was a judgment debtor in Small Claims Tribunal Claim No SCTC 8507 of 2006.  The judgment debt was in the sum of $48,250. As she did not satisfy the judgment, the judgment creditor, Sante Fe Transport International Limited, proceeded to levy executionof the judgment by a writ of fieri facias, which was issued on 25 May 2006.  On 14 June 2006, pursuant to the writ of fieri facias,the bailiff seized the plaintiffâs goods that were stored at Sante Feâs warehouse in Shatin.  On the following day, a lettertogether with the inventory of the goods seized, which were appraised with a total value of $5,678, was sent by the Chief Bailiff(Operations) to the plaintiff.  The plaintiff was told that if no payment be received, the goods would be auctioned on 21 June 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  After unsuccessful attempts by the plaintiff to obtain a stay of execution in the Small Claims Tribunal and the High Court respectively,the goods were sold at the auction on 21 June 2006 for a total sum of $25,000, even though the auctioneer had estimated their valueat $6,000 only.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The plaintiff contends that her goods, which comprised, amongst other things, various furniture items and clothing, were all expensiveitems, which were worth much more than $25,000.  In particular, the furniture items were her lifetime collection.  She thereforeclaims, in the present action, damages of $3 million, which she says is the estimated value of the goods seized, as loss and damagesuffered by her as a result of the wrongful manner in which her goods were seized and the wrongful sale of the goods seized at agross undervalue.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In the action, she names âThe Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Bailiff [Operation Section]â as the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Department of Justice, acting for the defendant, duly made an application by summons dated 22 August 2006 to strike out theplaintiffâs claim.  The application was heard by the then Registrar (Mr Registrar C Chan) on 20 October 2006.  In a judgment handeddown on 13 November 2006, the Registrar struck out the plaintiffâs claim and dismissed her action.  After noting that the plaintiffâsallegations regarding whether the bailiff had done her duty properly were factual issues which could not be decided on a striking-outapplication, the Registrar explained that his decision to strike out was based on one ground only, namely that the plaintiffâsclaim against the Government was absolutely barred by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(5)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Proceedings Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300">Cap 300</a>) â see below<i>.</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Further, on 29 December 2006, the Registrar assessed the costs of the action at $30,000, which he ordered the plaintiff to pay.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The plaintiff filed notices of appeal against these decisions on 3 and 8 January 2007 respectively.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  They were heard by Lam J on 22 January 2007.  The Judge duly noted that the first appeal against the Registrarâs decision of 13November 2006 was lodged out of time by about one month, given that Order 58, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 1(3)</a> of the Rules of the High Court (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A">Cap 4A</a>) provides that an appeal against a decision of a master to a judge must be issued within 14days after the decision appealed against was made.  The plaintiff therefore required the leave of the court to appeal out of time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Judge also found the description of the defendant in the title of the action ambiguous.  He was not sure whether the plaintiffintended to sue the Government or the bailiff, and if it was the latter, which bailiff she intended to sue.  At the hearing heldon 11 January 2007, the plaintiff told the Judge that she did not intend to sue any bailiff personally.  Rather, she wanted to suethe Bailiff Office because she considered that the office as a whole should be responsible for the âdefects in the system in theexecution processâ.  The hearing, however, was adjourned for 14 days to enable the plaintiff to obtain legal advice and confirmwhether she wanted to sue the Government as well, in addition to the Bailiff Office.  Directions were given for the filing of writtensubmissions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In her written submission filed, the plaintiff confirmed that she wanted to sue both the Government as well as the Bailiff Office.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In his judgment handed down on 5 February 2007, the Judge refused to grant the plaintiff leave to appeal from the Registrarâsfirst decision out of time.  He also dismissed the second appeal on costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  As regards the first appeal, the Judge mentioned four matters that should be taken into account in the exercise of the discretionto extend time for appeal, namely (1) the prospect of injustice (the prospect of success); (2) the length of the delay; (3) the reasonfor the delay and (4) the degree of prejudice to the other party (paras 6 and 7 of the judgment).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The Judge took the view that the delay involved was substantial in the context of an appeal from a master to a judge, the plaintiffdid not offer much explanation for the delay and the defendant suffered prejudice in that the plaintiffâs delay in filing the noticeof appeal had at least deprived the defendant of the chance of asking for an adjournment of the hearing of 29 December.  However,the Judge noted that the prejudice could be compensated by an appropriate order as to costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The Judge considered, rightly in my view, that the most important factor in the circumstances of the case was the merits of theplaintiffâs proposed appeal, which turned on the question of whether the plaintiff had sued the right defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  On this issue, the Judge took the view that the plaintiffâs claim against the Government was absolutely barred by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(5)</a> of the Ordinance.  As regards the plaintiffâs claim against the Bailiff Office, the Judge considered that the Bailiff Office isnot a legal entity and it was procedurally incorrect to name it as a defendant.  Furthermore, there was no question of the ChiefBailiff (Operations) being held vicariously liable for the acts of other bailiffs.  The Judge observed that as far as corporate orvicarious liability was concerned, the proper defendant should be the Secretary for Justice, but <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(5)</a> bars such a claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In my view, the Judge was absolutely right.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4(5)</a> of the Ordinance reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">(5)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="80%" valign="top" class="quote">No proceedings shall lie against the [Government] by virtue of this section in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by anyperson while discharging or purporting to discharge any responsibilities of a judicial nature vested in him, or any responsibilitieswhich he has in connexion with the execution of judicial process.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The sub-section applies directly to any acts or omissions of any person while discharging or purporting to discharge any responsibilitieswhich he has in connection with âthe execution of judicial processâ.  It covers directly the execution of a judgment by a writof fieri facias.  The sub-section provides an absolute bar to any claim against the Government in respect of any acts or omissionsof any person while discharging or purporting to discharge any responsibilities which he has in connection with the execution ofa judgment by a writ of fieri facias.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  As regards the claim against the Bailiff Office, the Judge was correct in saying that the Bailiff Office does not exist as a legalentity and it is therefore procedurally incorrect to name it as a defendant.  Insofar as one should treat the reference to the BailiffOffice as a reference to the Government (or the Secretary for Justice), the claim is covered by the absolute bar imposed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(5)</a> to any claims against the Government.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Insofar as one should read the reference to the Bailiff Office as a reference to the Chief Bailiff (Operations) and regard the plaintiffâsclaim against the Chief Bailiff (Operations) as based on vicarious liability, the claim is wholly unarguable because there is noquestion of the Chief Bailiff (Operations) being vicariously liable for the acts or omissions of other bailiffs.  The position hasbeen examined in detail by Suffiad J in <i>Fu Lok Man James v Chief Bailiff of the High Court</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20HKC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 HKC 1</a>, 5C to 12G.  The general principle is that âa superior Crown servant is not liable, whether vicariously or as a principal, forthe tort of a subordinateâ (p 11H/I) and for that reason, in a case where wrongful execution by a bailiff is concerned, the onlyproper defendant is the particular bailiff executing the writ.  A claim against the Chief Bailiff (Operations) is therefore misconceived.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  On appeal, this part of the judgeâs judgment was not challenged and indeed it was endorsed by the Court of Appeal:  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%203%20HKC%20742" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 3 HKC 742</a>, 747H to 748A.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  As the plaintiff has specifically informed the Judge at the hearing on 11 January 2007 that she is not pursuing any claim againstany individual bailiff involved in the execution process personally, it is not necessary to consider the plaintiffâs claim on thatbasis.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In those circumstances, the Judge was wholly correct in concluding that the plaintiffâs claim was unarguable.  That, in my view,was a conclusive factor against granting the plaintiff leave to appeal from the striking-out decision of the Registrar out of time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In other words, there is no ground whatsoever for this Court to interfere with the Judgeâs exercise of discretion to refuse leaveto appeal out of time, and indeed with respect, the Judgeâs conclusion was plainly correct.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  In the grounds of appeal set out in her notice of appeal and supplementary notice of appeal as well as her oral submission at thehearing, the plaintiff has directed her arguments to the manner in which the writ was executed, the value of the items seized andtheir sale at a gross undervalue (she maintains).  As the Registrar has recognised from the outset, these are matters which cannotbe disposed of summarily at a striking-out application.  However, they are quite irrelevant to the defendantâs application to strikeout, which turns on legal arguments only.  The plaintiff has not advanced any argument in relation to the legal issues raised bythe striking-out application, whether in her grounds of appeal or her oral submission before the Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In those circumstances, the plaintiffâs appeal against the Judgeâs refusal to grant her leave to appeal out of time must bedismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  As regards her appeal relating to costs, she has advanced no separate argument on liability nor any argument against the quantumassessed by the Registrar.  It is trite law that an appellate court does not lightly disturb an order of costs made below: <i>Choy Yee Chun v Bond Star Development Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20HKLRD%201327" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] HKLRD 1327.</a>  Given the general principle that costs should follow the event, as the plaintiffâs claim is struck out and in the absence of specialcircumstances, she must pay for the costs of the action.  As far as quantum is concerned, the Judge considered that the Registrarâsassessment was reasonable and could not be faulted.  There is no basis whatsoever to disturb the Judgeâs decision.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In those circumstances, the appeal against costs must also be dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  As regards the costs of this appeal, they should follow the event.  The defendant should have the costs of this appeal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs to the defendant, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align: center">(Robert Tang)<br />            Vice-President</td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align: center">(Maria Yuen)<br />            Justice of Appeal</td>            <td width="34%" valign="top" style="text-align: center">(Andrew Cheung)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Plaintiff (appellant), acting in person, present</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Ms Michelle Soong, Government Counsel of the Department of Justice, for the defendant (respondent)</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2007/528.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
