On 22 September 2004, he suffered an injury to his right foot.  At the time, he was instructed to paint the pull armof a bulldozer, he was assisted by a machine mechanic Yip Pak Shing (âMr. Yipâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Intending to disconnect and transport the push arm with an attached drill head with Mr. Yip operating the bulldozer, the Plaintiffwas standing next to the push arm trying to keep it from swinging side to side, the push arm (âbobcatâ) suddenly dropped ontothe ground injuring the Plaintiffâs foot.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Liability</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The Plaintiffâs Case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Plaintiff (âMr. Chengâ) claimed it was necessary and a regular practice for him to stand close to the push arm to keep itfrom swinging from side to side.  He further claimed that the accident happened because Mr. Yip had made a mistake in operating thebulldozer by releasing the bobcat (push arm) causing it to drop onto the ground hitting the Plaintiff on his right foot.  The Plaintifffurther claimed Mr. Yip was a fellow employee of the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The Defendantâs Case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Defendant denied Mr. Yip was its employee.  Mr. Chan Kin Keung, the sole proprietor of the Defendant, claimed Mr. Yip was anindependent contractor for the maintenance work of the Defendant.  Mr. Yip would attend the Defendantâs workshop daily and Mr.Chan would give him work instruction each day.  On the morning of the accident, Mr. Chan had instructed both Mr. Yip and the Plaintiffto paint the push arm of the bulldozer.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Defendant further claimed the Plaintiff was standing too close to the push arm and failing to prevent the accident thereforehad contributed to it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Mr. Chan did not see the accident as he was working inside the workshop container office.  He claimed he did not know Mr. Yip wasoperating the bulldozer until after the accident.  He claimed Mr. Yip was a contractor and was paid a daily fee of $600.  Under cross-examinationand confronted with a letter from the Defendantâs solicitor dated 28 February 2008 (p.108 of bundle), Mr. Chan accepted the Defendantdid admit Mr. Yip to be its employee but he claimed that in the Defendantâs tax returns Mr. Yip was reported as the Defendantâscontractor.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Issues</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  I     Was Mr. Yip an employee of the Defendant and was the Defendant vicariously liable to the Plaintiff ?</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">II     Did the Defendant owe the Plaintiff a duty of care to provide a safe system of work and proper supervision?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">III    Did the Plaintiff contributed to the accident?</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">I   <u>Was Mr. Yip an employee of the Defendant and was the Defendant vicariously liable to the Plaintiff ?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Mr. Chan claimed in court Mr. Yip was not an employee of the Defendant although there was an admission in writing from the Respondentâssolicitor that Mr. Yip was an employee.  Mr. Chan gave a description of the pattern of Mr. Yipâs daily work with the Defendant. He claimed Mr. Yip would attend the Defendantâs workshop every morning and Mr. Chan would instruct him to take up maintenancework on the Defendantâs machines.  He was paid a daily sum of $600.  However, he was not able to give a satisfactory answer whenhe was asked how much Mr. Yip would be paid if the work would only take half a day.  Mr. Chan admitted in Court he had instructedMr. Cheng and Mr. Yip to paint the push arm on the day of the accident.  Based on Mr. Chanâs description, it is obvious Mr. Yipwas employed to work on the maintenance of the Defendantâs machines just as the Plaintiff was.  As Mr. Yip was not called to giveevidence at the trial in spite of his being an eye witness to the accident, on the evidence before me, the Applicantâs evidenceon the accident and the Defendantâs solicitorâs admission by letter before the trial overwhelmingly showed Mr. Yip was the Defendantâsemployee at the time of the accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Court of Final Appeal in the case of Ming An Insurance Co. (HK) Ltd. v. Ritz-Carlton Ltd.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%20HKLRD%20844" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] HKLRD 844</a> held at pp.850-854 that the test for vicarious liability is âclose connectionâ. Bokhary PJ held in para. 14:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â  14.   For a long time, the English courts applied â and the Hong Kong courts following suit likewise applied â the test commonlycalled the <i>Salmond</i> test.  This is the test first formulated in <i>Salmond</i> on <i>Torts</i> (1<sup>st</sup> ed., 1907) at p.83 and still to be found in <i>Salmond &amp; Heuston</i> <i>on the Laws of Torts</i> (21<sup>st</sup> ed., 1996) at p.443.  The <i>Salmond</i> test operates thus.  Employers are liable for torts committed by their employees in the course of their employment.  And an employeeâstort is deemed to have been committed in the course of his employment if it is either (a) something authorised by his employer or(b) an unauthorised mode of doing something authorised by his employer.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">15.   The âunauthorised modeâ limb of the <i>Salmond</i> test can give rise to difficulty.  And in <i>Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd</i>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20AC%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 AC 215</a> the House of Lords adopted a new test.  Under this new test, the question is whether the employeeâs tort was so closely connectedwith his employment that it would be fair and just to hold his employer vicariously liable.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">   25.   For all the foregoing reasons, I regard close connection as the basic criterion for vicarious liability in regard to alltorts committed by an employee during an unauthorised course of conduct, whether international wrongdoing or mere inadventence isinvolved.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The pattern of Mr. Yipâs daily routine and the way he was paid confirmed he was working on Mr. Chanâs instructions daily andreceived a daily wage of $600.  Furthermore, with the earlier admission, I have no doubt that Mr. Yip was an employee of the Defendanthad caused the accident that injured the Plaintiff by operating the bulldozer negligently.  As it was in the course of his employmenteven though the Defendant might not have intended Mr. Yip to be the operator of the bulldozer, under the close connection test, theDefendant as his employer is vicariously liable to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">II     <u>Did the Defendant owe the Plaintiff its employee a duty of care by providing a safe system of work and proper supervision?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  It is the Plaintiffâs evidence that he had to stand close to the push arm to keep it steady with his hand.  This is obviouslynot a safe practice, but he admitted it is known to Mr. Chan and Mr. Yip.  Clearly, Mr. Chan had failed to devise a safe work practicefor the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  There was no evidence that the work was under anyoneâs supervision.  Mr. Chan made it clear that after he gave the instructionsto Mr. Yip and the Plaintiff, he had gone into his container office to work. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Mr. Chan said he had expected the Plaintiff to be operating the bulldozer because the Plaintiff possessed a licence.  At the trial,Mr. Cheng produced the documents showing he did not possess a valid licence at the time of the accident.  He claimed Mr. Yip didhave a valid licence at the time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In defining a âsafe system of workâ, Bokhary P.J. in the Court of Final Appeal case of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. v. Wong SauLai [2006] HKCU 810 referred to Lord Greenâs dictum in Speed v.

A systemmay be adequate for the whole course of the job or it may have to be modified or improved to meet circumstances which arise.

The Defendant is thereforeliable to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">III    <u>Did the Plaintiff Mr. Cheng contributed to the accident?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Mr. Chan agreed in his evidence in Court that Mr. Cheng would have to put his hand on the hanging load to steady it.  As that wasthe only procedure known to Mr. Cheng and Mr. Yip which Mr. Chan had accepted, then Mr. Cheng could not be guilty of contributorynegligence.  It was the Defendantâs duty to devise a safe system of work for its employees.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Quantum</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Mr. Cheng was employed by the Respondent on 15 August 2004, just over one month before the accident, to service the Respondentâsmachines hired out at various construction sites.  He claimed his daily wage was $500 and he worked 26 days a month therefore earninga monthly wage of $13,000.  Based on the Plaintiffâs employment record at the Defendant, the Plaintiff did work 26 days between16 August and 15 September.  Therefore, there is strong evidence to support the Plaintiffâs claim based on a monthly salary of$13,000.  This is further supported by the $55,731 payment from the Defendant in the 5.72 months of sick leave at - of the Plaintiffâspre-accident payment.  I accept the Plaintiffâs compensation should be based on a monthly salary of $13,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Pain, Suffering and Loss of Amenities</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The Plaintiff sustained a Lisfranc fracture on his right foot second metatarsal.  He was taken to the North District Hospital immediatelyafter the accident where he received an operation of open reduction and internal fixation.  His foot was put in a cast for 6 weeks. He was discharged from hospital on 2 October 2004 with a pair of crutches.  After the cast was removed, he was told not to put weighton his right foot.  On 29/1/05, he was admitted to hospital for removal of all the screws inserted.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  He complained to Dr. Kong Kam Fu, the orthopaedic expert, on the day of the interview of 3 May 2007 that he suffered from continuouspain in the right foot when he began walking or pushing the pedal with his foot; he could no longer run or squat down, he had difficultywalking up and downstairs.  He further suffered from right ankle stiffness.  (see p.49-50 of bundle).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Dr. Kong reported he had walked into the doctorâs clinic in a normal gait, he was able to walk on his heels but not on tiptoe,he could only stand on his left leg, and he could only do - of a normal squat.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Dr. Kong confirmed the Plaintiff suffered from a Lisfranc fracture of the 2<sup>nd</sup> metatarsal with residual pain and stiffness.  This is consistent with the findings of the Employeesâ Compensation Board of 4 April2007 which assessed the Plaintiffâs loss of earning capacity caused by the injury to be 8%.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Dr. Kong found the physiotherapy and occupational therapy treatments Mr. Cheng received to be appropriate.  Dr. Kong reported thatapart from complaining of residual pain and stiffness, Mr. Cheng complained also of limitation of movements of his right ankle. Dr. Kong confirmed Mr. Cheng suffered from a weakness on his right leg due to the accident.  Dr. Kong assessed Mr. Cheng sufferedfrom a 10% whole person impairment based on the AMA guide to evaluation of permanent impairment (5<sup>th</sup> ed.) and the same for his loss of earning capacity.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Mr. Cheng claimed that the injury and disabilities had prevented him from taking part in sports that he used to enjoy such as swimming,jogging, social dancing and mountaineering.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mr. Wong, counsel for Mr. Cheng asked for $350,000 under this head comparing to the awards in the case of Yau Sung Bik Yu v.

His sick leave was for 5.72 months during whichtime he was paid by the Defendant a total sum of $55,731, representing approximately 75% of Mr. Chengâs wages.  If not for theaccident, he would have earned $74,360.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  On 16 March 2005, Mr. Cheng returned to work with the Defendant until 28 May 2005 when he felt he could not carry out the strenuousduties at the Defendantâs workshop due to his disabilities after the accident.  He took up less demanding work on 16 June 2005working at recycling companies and also as a gardener.  Between 16 June 2005 and 16 September 2008, he earned a daily wage between$350 and $420.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Mr. Cheng claimed a loss of $100 daily wage for 28 days a month i.e. a loss of $2,600 per month.  The pre-trial loss from 15 June2005 to 16 September 2008 was 27 months which makes to a total of $(2,600 x 27) = $70,200.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The pre-trial loss is therefore:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">                   $(74,360 + 70,200) - $55,731 = $88,829.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Post-trial loss</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The parties agreed on the multiplicant of Mr. Cheng who is now 44.5 years old at 9.5.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  For reasons explained above, I do not agree that Mr. Cheng suffered no loss of income and that he was merely earning $5,880 p.m.before the accident.  If he was able to find casual work after the accident which paid $350 to 420 per day, his pre-accident wageshould have been higher.  I am satisfied that his future loss is $2,600 per month.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  His future loss is therefore:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">                   $2,600 x 12 x 9.5 = $296,400.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Loss of earning Capacity</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  This claim is intended to compensate Mr. Cheng for the disability he would suffer in the job market in future.  Mr. Wong submittedthat Mr. Cheng has suffered a disadvantage because he can no longer drive a bobcat due to his disabilities.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  On the basis that Mr. Cheng had been compensated for his future loss of earnings at $2,600 p.m. for a multiplier of 9.5 to coverthe rest of his working life, I do not think he should recover a further sum for the loss of earning capacity.  This is particularlyso when he has proven himself to be a resourceful person and was able to find work in different fields including working as a driver,a gardener and causal labourer in recycle companies.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Special damages</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The parties have agreed this item at $5,463.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Summary</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>   </p>    <blockquote>        <table border="1">            <tr>                <td width="308" valign="top">PSLA</td>                <td width="122" valign="top">      180,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="308" valign="top">Pre-trial loss of earnings</td>                <td width="122" valign="top">        88,829</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="308" height="24" valign="top">Post-trial loss of earnings</td>                <td width="122" valign="top">        296,400</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="308" height="24" valign="top"><u>special damages</u></td>                <td width="122" valign="top">        <u>5,463</u></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="308" valign="top">Total</td>                <td width="122" valign="top">    $570,692</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Interests</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  For damages under PSLA, interests at 2% p.a. from the date of writ to the date of judgment.
