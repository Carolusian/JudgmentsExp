down on 18 July 2008 ([2008]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=4%20HKLRD%20752" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">4 HKLRD 752)</a>, the Court of Appeal allowed the claims of the four applicants in these four sets of proceedings and declared that their detentionsduring the following periods under the authority of the Director of Immigration or the Secretary for Security were unlawful for violationof art 5(1) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights.  âAâ was detained from 14 June 2006 to 14 September 2006, ie a period of three months. âASâ was detained from 14 June 2005 to 29 March 2007, ie a period of 655 days.  âFâ was detained from 5 July 2005 to 29March 2007, a period of 634 days.  âYAâ was detained from 25 October 2006 to 29 March 2007, that is to say, for a period of 156days.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The Court is now tasked with the assessment of damages for their unlawful detentions.  Each of them claims basic or ordinary damages,aggravated damages and exemplary damages.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  All applicants were torture claimants under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment(CAT).  They were all detained by the authorities pending verification of their CAT claims pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115" class="autolink_findacts">Immigration Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115">Cap 115</a>).  The Court of Appeal held that the powers to detain under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32</a> pending such verification were lawful under domestic law.  However, they infringed art 5(1) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights whichrequires that detention must not be arbitrary and the grounds and procedure for detention must also be certain and accessible.  TheCourt of Appeal held that in the absence of a published policy as to the circumstances under which the powers to detain pending suchverification would be exercised, the powers of detention under s 32 were to that extent contrary to art 5(1) of the Bill of Rights.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The detentions in the instant cases were, in those circumstances, declared by the Court of Appeal to be unlawful.  The period ofunlawful detention, in each case, commenced from the date when the relevant CAT claim was made and ended on the day when the applicantwas granted bail or released on his own recognizance.  Periods of detention prior to the making of the CAT claims are not in issue.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  It is useful here to summarise the undisputed facts of each case. </p>    <p class="heading">Case of âAâ</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  âAâ is an Algerian.  He was born in Algeria on 7 February 1972 and is now 37 years old.  He claims that he will be torturedif returned to Algeria on account of dealings with an Islamic fundamentalist group.  He came to Hong Kong as a visitor on 6 November2003 and was given permission to remain until 20 November 2003.  On 18 November 2003, before his permission to remain expired, hemade an application to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for recognition of his refugee status under theHigh Commissionerâs mandate.  On the following day, he told the Director of Immigration about his application and asked for hisstay to be extended, which was refused.  He thus became an overstayer and went underground for a lengthy period of time, after theexpiration of his permission to stay.  In the meantime, he pursued his claim for refugee status with the UNHCR.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In February 2006, âAâ began to cohabit with a permanent Hong Kong resident in Sheung Wan.  On 23 May 2006, the two of them fileda ânotice of intended marriageâ with the Marriage Registry, giving notice of their intention to marry each other on 12 June 2006. Six days before they were due to get married, âAâ was arrested by the police for overstaying.  He was detained by the Directorof Immigration on the same day under s 26(a) of the Immigration Ordinance (power to detain for inquiry). </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Whilst being detained under s 32(2A) of the Ordinance (power to detain pending a decision whether to make a removal order), âAâmade a CAT claim on 16 June 2006, more than two years and seven months after he arrived Hong Kong.  On the following day, a removalorder was made against him and he was detained by the Director pending his removal pursuant to s 32(3A). </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  âAâ went on a hunger strike on 4 July 2006 to protest against his detention, possible return to Algeria and separation fromhis fiancÃ©e.  After receiving counselling, he resumed eating on 10 July 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  âAâ made requests for release on recognizance in June and July 2006.  They were refused on 6 August 2006 by the Director, regardhaving had to his adverse immigration record of having gone underground and overstayed for two years and seven months and the factthat the Director intended to remove him as soon as possible.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  On 7 September 2006, âAâ made an application for leave to apply for judicial review.  On 13 September 2006, leave was grantedand âAâ was granted bail by order of Hartmann J (as he then was).  On the following day, he was released from detention.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In total âAâ was detained for a relevant period of three months.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  âAâ has since married the woman whom he had planned to marry prior to arrest and detention.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On 12 September 2007, the CAT claim of âAâ was rejected by the Director of Immigration.  On 12 October 2007, âAâ petitionedthe Chief Executive under art 48(13) of the Basic Law against the Directorâs refusal of his CAT claim.  No decision on the petitionhas yet been reached. </p>    <p class="heading">Case of âASâ</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The facts pertaining to the case of âASâ are likewise uncontroversial.  âASâ is a Sri Lankan Tamil.  He was born on 29 March1975 and is now 33 years old.  His claimed fears are that he will be tortured and even killed by his business partners who have connectionswith the Government there if he ever returns to Sri Lanka.  Furthermore, by reason of his ethnicity and the fact that he has losthis Sri Lankan identity card, he fears that he will be tortured by the police if he is returned there.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  He first entered Hong Kong from Sri Lanka on 2 March 2003 using his own passport.  He departed on 8 March 2003 and returned on thefollowing day.  He was permitted to remain as a visitor until 14 March 2003.  On 12 March 2003, he approached the Immigration Departmentfor an extension of stay but the application was refused.  He did not depart upon the expiry of his permission to stay but went underground. His own passport was given to an agent and was used by another for leaving Hong Kong on 16 March 2003.  On 5 May 2003, âASâdeparted Hong Kong for the Mainland via Lo Wu using a Sri Lankan passport belonging to his cousin.  He was found out by the Mainlandauthority and returned to Hong Kong.  He was refused permission to land but was admitted to hospital for medical treatment.  On 9May 2003, âASâ absconded from custody during hospitalisation.  He claimed that he later obtained a passport bearing another identityand went back to Sri Lanka in July 2003.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Since 1 January 2004, âASâ travelled to Hong Kong on a number of occasions using his own passport.  He last arrived in HongKong on 20 September 2004.  On 25 September 2004, he was intercepted by the police when he went to stand surety for his friend andwas handed over to the Immigration Department for inquiries.  He was then charged with two counts of immigration offences (namely,âtransfer to another without reasonable excuse a travel documentâ and âmaking a false representation to an immigration assistantâ),and on his conviction, he was sentenced to 12 monthsâ imprisonment. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  On 23 May 2005, three days before he served out his term of imprisonment, the Secretary for Security made a deportation order againstâASâ.  He was detained under s 32(3) following his discharge from prison on 26 May 2005.  He was scheduled to be removed on 2June 2005, but that was withheld because he had made a legal aid application three days before to challenge the deportation order. He further made a CAT claim on 6 June 2005, that is to say, more than two years and three months after he first visited Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  âASâ requested for release on recognizance in 2005 and 2006.  Those requests were refused on the ground that in light of hisprevious history of being a repeated offender with a record of absconding while under detention in 2003, there existed a real riskof his absconding and re-offending. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On 25 January 2007, âASâ made an application for leave to apply for judicial review.  On 29 March 2007, five days before thesubstantive court hearing, âASâ was released on recognizance.  In total, the relevant period of detention was 655 days.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  To complete the story, on 25 May 2007, the Director of Immigration informed âASâ that his CAT claim was refused.  He petitionedthe Chief Executive against the refusal, but the petition was rejected on 3 October 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  âASâ complains about the effect of detention and not seeing daylight.  He also complains of the difficulties of getting evidenceto back his claim.</p>    <p class="heading">Case of âFâ</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The case of âFâ is also common ground.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  âFâ is a Sri Lankan Sinhalese.  He was born in Sri Lanka on 3 May 1977 and is now 31 years old.  His claimed fears are thathe will be tortured and possibly killed by the family of his deceased girlfriend who are Tamil and are connected with influentialpolitical figures and authorities.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  On 18 April 2005, he was arrested by the police for the offence of failing to carry an identity card and suspicion of overstaying. He claimed to have entered Hong Kong on 13 October 2002 with his passport which he had lost on 15 October 2002.  He admitted tohaving overstayed since 21 October 2002.  According to immigration records, there was a departure record using a passport in thename of âFâ on 19 October 2002 but he denied any knowledge of such departure.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  âFâ was subsequently prosecuted for breach of his condition of stay by overstaying since 21 October 2002.

For present purposes, very useful guidelines can be found in the English Court of Appeal case of<i>Thompson v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20QB%20498" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] QB 498.</a>  The earlier decision of Patrick Chan J (as he then was) in the Vietnamese refugee case of <i>Pham Van Ngo v Attorney General</i>, HCA 4895/1990 (30 July 1993) also contains valuable discussion on the relevant principles. </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  In <i>Thompson</i>, which comprised two actions, the plaintiff in the first action suffered from false imprisonment and malicious prosecution in thehands of police officers.  She claimed damages, including aggravated damages and exemplary damages.  The plaintiff in the secondaction claimed damages against a number of police officers for wrongful arrest, false imprisonment and assault.  Both actions weretried before a judge sitting with a jury.  On appeal from the awards made, the Court of Appeal took the opportunity to give detailedguidelines on the additional directions that should be given in a summing up on the issue of damages for the benefit of the jury.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Lord Woolf MR (as he then was) began by explaining the basics and by suggesting some standard figures (pages 514 to 516):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1)  ... Save in exceptional situations such damages are only awarded as compensation and are intended to compensate the plaintifffor any injury or damage which he has suffered. They are not intended to punish the defendant.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  As the law stands at present compensatory damages are of two types.  (a) Ordinary damages which we would suggest should be describedas basic, and (b) aggravated damages. Aggravated damages can only be awarded where they are claimed by the plaintiff and where thereare aggravating features about the defendantâs conduct which justify the award of aggravated damages.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  The jury should be told that the basic damages will depend on the circumstances and the degree of harm suffered by the plaintiff.But they should be provided with an appropriate bracket to use as a starting point. ...</p>        <p class="quote">...</p>        <p class="quote">(5)  In a straightforward case of wrongful arrest and imprisonment the starting point is likely to be about Â£500 for the first hourduring which the plaintiff has been deprived of his or her liberty. After the first hour an additional sum is to be awarded, butthat sum should be on a reducing scale so as to keep the damages proportionate with those payable in personal injury cases and becausethe plaintiff is entitled to have a higher rate of compensation for the initial shock of being arrested. As a guideline we consider,for example, that a plaintiff who has been wrongly kept in custody for 24 hours should for this alone normally be regarded as entitledto an award of about Â£3,000. For subsequent days the daily rate will be on a progressively reducing scale. ...</p>        <p class="quote">...</p>        <p class="quote">(7)  The figures which we have identified so far are provided to assist the Judge in determining the bracket within which the juryshould be invited to place their award. We appreciate, however, that circumstances can very dramatically from case to case and thatthese and the subsequent figures which we provide are not intended to be applied in a mechanistic manner.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  His Lordship then explained the possible award of aggravated damages (at page 516):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(8)  If the case is one in which aggravated damages are claimed and could be appropriately awarded, the nature of aggravated damagesshould be explained to the jury. Such damages can be awarded where there are aggravating features about the case which would resultin the plaintiff not receiving sufficient compensation for the injury suffered if the award were restricted to a basic award. Aggravatingfeatures can include humiliating circumstances at the time of arrest or any conduct of those responsible for the arrest or the prosecutionwhich shows that they had behaved in a high handed, insulting, malicious or oppressive manner either in relation to the arrest orimprisonment or in conducting the prosecution.. Aggravating features can also include the way the litigation and trial are conducted....</p>        <p class="quote">(9)  The jury should then be told that if they consider the case is one for the award of damages other than basic damages then theyshould usually make a separate award for each category.  (This is contrary to the present practice but in our view will result ingreater transparency as to the make up of the award.)</p>        <p class="quote">(10)  We consider that where it is appropriate to award aggravated damages the figure is unlikely to be less than a Â£1,000. We donot think it is possible to indicate a precise arithmetical relationship between basic damages and aggravated damages because thecircumstances will vary from case to case. In the ordinary way, however, we would not expect the aggravated damages to be as muchas twice the basic damages except perhaps where, on the particular facts, the basic damages are modest.</p>        <p class="quote">(11)  It should be strongly emphasised to the jury that the total figure for basic and aggravated damages should not exceed what theyconsider is fair compensation for the injury which the plaintiff has suffered. It should also be explained that if aggravated damagesare awarded such damages, though compensatory are not intended as a punishment, will in fact contain a penal element as far as thedefendant is concerned.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Finally, Lord Woolf turned to exemplary damages (at pages 516 to 517):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(12)  Finally the jury should be told in a case where exemplary damages are claimed and the Judge considers that there is evidenceto support such a claim, that though it is not normally possible to award damages with the object of punishing the defendant, exceptionallythis is possible where there has been conduct, including oppressive or arbitrary behaviour, by police officers which deserves theexceptional remedy of exemplary damages.  It should be explained to the jury: (a) that if the jury are awarding aggravated damagesthese damages will have already provided compensation for the injury suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the oppressive andinsulting behaviour of the police officer and, inevitably, a measure of punishment from the defendant's point of view; (b) that exemplarydamages should be awarded if, but only if, they consider that the compensation awarded by way of basic and aggravated damages isin the circumstances an inadequate punishment for the defendants; (c) that an award of exemplary damages is in effect a windfallfor the plaintiff and, where damages will be payable out of police funds, the sum awarded may not be available to be expended bythe police in a way which would benefit the public (This guidance would not be appropriate if the claim were to be met by insurers);(d) that the sum awarded by way of exemplary damages should be sufficient to mark the jury's disapproval of the oppressive or arbitrarybehaviour but should be no more than is required for this purpose.</p>        <p class="quote">(13)  Where exemplary damages are appropriate they are unlikely to be less than Â£5,000. Otherwise the case is probably not one whichjustifies an award of exemplary damages at all. In this class of action the conduct must be particularly deserving of condemnationfor an award of as much as Â£25,000 to be justified and the figure of Â£50,000 should be regarded as the absolute maximum, involvingdirectly officers of at least the rank of superintendent.</p>        <p class="quote">(14)  In an appropriate case the jury should also be told that even though the plaintiff succeeds on liability any improper conductof which they find him guilty can reduce or even eliminate any award of aggravated or exemplary damages if the jury consider thatthis conduct caused or contributed to the behaviour complained of.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The earlier local case of <i>Pham Van Ngo</i> concerned four Vietnamese boat people (amongst a group of 113) who arrived in Hong Kong waters from Vietnam by a vessel, which wasbadly in want of repair.  The majority of the boat people were intending to travel to Japan where they hoped to become refugees eitherpermanently or for resettlement elsewhere.  They accepted the offer from the Government for food and water and repair of their vessel. It was in those circumstances that they were taken to a reception centre where they disembarked and were processed by officers ofthe Immigration Department.  They were subsequently moved to a detention centre and they were detained until 12 November 1990 whena writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> was granted by a judge.  In the meantime, the vessel was destroyed by the Government, which took the view that it was economicallyunviable to repair the vessel.  In those circumstances, the refugees were, as it were, stuck in Hong Kong, their original hope oftravelling to Japan having been dashed by the destruction of their vessel.  It was held by the Court that their detention was unlawfulfor a technical reason.  In fact, there existed alternative statutory provisions by which the refugees could have been lawfully detainedin Hong Kong.  The judgment of Patrick Chan J dealt with, amongst other things, their claim for damages for false imprisonment. At pages 302 to 303 of the lengthy judgment, the learned judge started with a birdâs eye view of the position in relation to falseimprisonment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFalse imprisonment is of course actionable per se without proof of damage.  A plaintiff is, however, always entitled to recoverdamages.  The general principles regarding such damages are clearly set out in <u>Halsburyâs Laws of England</u>, 4<sup>th</sup> Edition, Volume 45, paragraph 1337:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIn an action for false imprisonment the plaintiff is entitled to recover general damages for the imprisonment.  He may also recover,by way of special damages, compensation for any loss which he has incurred, although it is possible that to be recoverable such lossmust be reasonably foreseeable.  He may rely in aggravation of the general damages on the circumstances attending the imprisonmentand on any facts in the conduct of the defendant at the time of or before or after the imprisonment which show malice.â</p>            <p class="quote">In addition, âexemplary damages may be awarded in certain circumstancesâ.  (See Note 4 in paragraph 1337)â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">There are thus three types or heads of damages which are recoverable: first, ordinary damages which in a normal case consist of generaldamages and special damages; second, aggravated damages; and third, exemplary damages.  Like special damages, aggravated damagesand exemplary damages must be expressly pleaded.  However, while special damages are almost invariably awarded as a separate item,in most cases, the court usually gives a single award of damages which is sometimes said to include an element of aggravated damagesand/or exemplary damages.</p>        <p class="quote">Both ordinary damages and aggravated damages are compensatory in nature while exemplary damages are punitive.  As Lord Reid put itin <u>Brown v Cassell &amp; Company</u>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%202%20WLR%20645" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 2 WLR 645</a> at 685G, for compensatory damages, the court must consider how much the plaintiff ought to receive whereas in assessing punitivedamages, it must consider how much the defendant ought to pay.  They are not necessarily the same.  The factors relevant to an awardof ordinary damages, aggravated damages and exemplary damages are somewhat different.  For ordinary damages, the court looks at whatdamage has been done to the plaintiff because of the false imprisonment.  For aggravated damages, the court takes into account theconduct of the defendant.  As to exemplary damages, the court is to decide whether it is necessary to punish and deter the defendant. In that case the defendantâs conduct is also to be looked at.  Hence confusion may arise and has indeed arisen between aggravatedand exemplary damages in previous cases, both prior to as well as after 1964 when the case of <u>Rookes v Barnard</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 1129</a> was decided by the House of Lords.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  The learned judge then dealt with compensatory damages first (at pp 304-305):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFor ordinary damages, the relevant factors which the court would consider are set out in <u>McGregor on Damages</u>, 15<sup>th</sup> edition, paragraphs 1619 and 1620:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â... generally it is not a pecuniary loss but a loss of dignity and the like, and is left much to the juryâs discretion. The principalheads of damages would appear to be injury to liberty i.e. the loss of time considered primarily from a non-pecuniary viewpoint,and the injury to feelings, i.e. the indignity, mental suffering, disgrace and humiliation, with any attendant loss of social status. This will all be included in the general damages which are usually awarded in these cases: no breakdown appears in the cases.â</p>            <p class="quote">âIn addition there may be recovery for any resultant physical injury, illness or discomfort, as where the imprisonment has a deleteriouseffect on the plaintiffâs health. ... Also damages may be given for any injury to reputation, for, as Lawrence L.J. said in <u>Walter v Alltools</u>, âa false imprisonment does not merely affect a manâs liberty; it also affects his reputation.ââ</p>            <p class="quote">âAny pecuniary loss which is not too remote is recoverable.  Pecuniary losses fall into two categories in the cases.  In the firstplace, that any loss of general business or employment is recoverable would seem to follow from <u>Childs v Lewis</u>, ... In the second place, a few 19<sup>th</sup>-century cases showed that the plaintiffâs costs incurred in procuring his discharge from the imprisonment may be recoverable asdamages.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">Apart from these considerations, other factors such as the manner of the false imprisonment and the conduct of the defendants arealso relevant as they may lead to aggravation or mitigation of the damage.  Aggravating factors may call for a bigger award whileon the other hand, mitigating factors may result in a reduction of the award.  As for aggravated damages, the relevant considerationsare as follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â... the court may take into account the defendantâs motives, conduct and manner of commiting the tort and, where these have aggravatedthe plaintiffâs damage by injuring his proper feelings or dignity and pride, aggravated damages may be awarded.  The defendantmay have acted with malevolence or spite or behaved in a high-handed, malicious, insulting or aggressive manner.  The court may considerthe defendantâs conduct up to the conclusion of the trial, including what he or his counsel may have said at the time.â  (<u>Halsburyâs Laws of England</u>, 4<sup>th</sup> Edition, paragraph 1189)</p>            <p class="quote">âThat case (<u>Walter v Alltools</u> [1944] 61 T.L.R.39), and the earlier one of <u>Warwick v Foulkes</u> as interpreted therein, establish that, where the false imprisonment has been brought about by the defendant preferring a chargeagainst the plaintiff, any evidence tending to show that the defendant is preserving in the charge is evidence which may be givenfor the purpose of aggravating the damages.  By implication, they establish the converse proposition that the defendant is entitledto give evidence in mitigation of damages tending to show that he has withdrawn the charge or has apologise for having made it.â (McGregor on Damages, 15<sup>th</sup> Edition, paragraph 1623)</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">As the conduct of the defendant must be taken into account, the fact that the defendant has a reasonable and probable cause to dowhat he did is clearly a mitigating factor (see <u>Warwick v Foulkes</u>, supra).  So is the defendantâs bona fide relevant in assessing damages (see <u>Rowcliffe v Murray, Larkin, and Petty</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281842%29%20CAR%20%26%20M%20513" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1842) CAR &amp; M 513).â</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  His Lordship then turned to punitive damages (ie exemplary damages) at pp 305-308:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe main object of exemplary damages is to punish and deter the defendant.  As a result of the House of Lordâs decision in <u>Rookes v Barnard</u>, supra, exemplary damages can only be awarded in three category of cases.  The one which is relevant to the present case consistsof cases where there has been âoppressive, arbitrary or [unconstitutional] action by the servants of the governmentâ.  The rationalebehind this is, as Lord Devlin put it (at p.1226), that âthe servants of the government are also the servants of the people andthe use of their power must always be subordinate to their duty of serviceâ.  Not every case which falls within this category necessarilycalls for an award of exemplary damages.  The court has a discretion in dealing with such award.  Because of the nature of exemplarydamages, such an award:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âcomes into play whenever the defendantâs conduct is sufficiently outrageous to merit punishment, as where it discloses malice,fraud, cruelty, insolence or the like.â  (<u>McGregor on Damages</u>, 15<sup>th</sup> Edition, paragraph 406)</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">As Lord Devlin in <u>Rookes v Barnard</u>, supra, at p.1228, said, it is only when the sum awarded as compensation (which may include ordinary as well as aggravated damages)is âinadequate to punish (the defendant) for his outrageous conduct, to mark (the juryâs or the courtâs) disapproval of suchconduct and to deter him from repeating itâ that it would be appropriate to award exemplary damages.  As to the sort of conductwhich may justify an award of exemplary damages, different cases have used different descriptions; âarbitrary and outrageousâ,in <u>Rookes v Barnard</u>, supra, p.1223; âdeliberately or recklessly or with maliceâ, in <u>Kelly v Faulkner</u>, [1973] Northern Ireland Law Report 31, at 43, âwicked and callousâ, in <u>Mansion v Associated Newspapers Limited</u>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%201%20WLR%201038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] 1 WLR 1038</a>, at 1043; âmonstrousâ, in <u>Guppys (Bridport) Ltd v Brookling</u> [1984] 14 HLR 1, at 26; âdeliberate, calculated and wilfulâ, in <u>AB and Others v Southwest Water Services Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%204%20All%20ER%20574" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 4 All ER 574</a>, at 584.</p>        <p class="quote">As I said, aggravated and exemplary damages are easily confused.  However, it is important to bear in mind the different functionsof these two heads of damages: the former to compensate the plaintiff and the latter to punish and deter the defendant.  As the learnedauthors of <u>Salmond and Heuston on Tort</u>, 20<sup>th</sup> edition, at p.518, say, âaggravated damages are given for conduct which shocks the plaintiff; exemplary damages for conduct whichshocks the jury, and may serve the useful function of deterring others as well as punishing the defendant.â  In my view, therefore,it requires a fairly high degree of âculpabilityâ in the defendant to merit an award of exemplary damages.  Afterall, it is aimedat punishing him for such conduct as well as deterring him from repeating it.</p>        <p class="quote">In the cases where exemplary damages were awarded, the courts did not, usually, make separate awards.  A global figure was given whichwas said to include ordinary, aggravated and/or exemplary damages, if any.  There are a few exceptions such as <u>Broome v Cassell and Company</u>, supra, where a separate award for exemplary damages was made.  These were jury awards which were the results of directions givenby the trial judges pursuant to a remark made by Lord Devlin in <u>Rookes v Barnard</u>, that by doing so some costs might be saved upon a retrial.  I have some reservation as to this âpracticeâ, certainly in thecase of a trial without a jury.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Finally, the learned judge made useful observations on the âgoing rateâ approach advocated by counsel (at pp 308-309):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt was suggested to me in submission that in making an award for damages, I could use a âgoing rateâ for each day of falseimprisonment and work out the total award. ...</p>        <p class="quote">This submission sounds attractive but I do not think it can be sustained.  It is precisely because of the differences in circumstances,both general as well as specific, pertaining to the injured parties that require individual assessment by the court and merit differentawards to be made in each case.  The variations in these cases may be so large that it is not only futile but dangerous to set aso-called minimum award for loss of liberty.  I know of no precedent, in fact Counsel was unable to refer me to any case, in whichthis approach was adopted.  It would be almost impossible to arrive at such a rate or figure at any point in time in any given case.</p>        <p class="quote">The same reasons apply to the âgoing-rateâ approach.  The variants are so many and divergent that any rate would not only be unreliablebut may also work out to be most unfair.  I notice that this had been expressly disapproved of in <u>Kelly v Faulkner</u>, supra.  This approach was also discussed in the <u>Lunt</u> case, but was not accepted.  I do not propose to adopt such a course in the present case.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  It is also useful to mention <i>R v Governor of Brockhill Prison, Ex parte Evans</i> <i>(No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20QB%201403" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] QB 1403 (CA)</a>, which was affirmed on appeal:  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20AC%2019" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 AC 19.</a>  This case concerned a miscalculation by the prison governor of the release date of a prisoner, who as a result was released 59 daysafter she should have been.  The Court of Appeal raised the trial judgeâs basic award of Â£2,000 to Â£5,000 and the House of Lordsupheld the Court of Appealâs increase:  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20AC%2019" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 AC 19</a>, 39G to 40C.  Lord Woolf MR apparently accepted that in an award of damages for false imprisonment, leaving aside the question ofaggravated damages and exemplary damages, there are two elements: the first being compensation for loss of liberty and the secondbeing the damage to reputation, humiliation, shock, injury to feelings and so on which can result from the loss of liberty (p 1060Ato B).  What is interesting to note is that the judge went on to agree with the trial judge below that in the instant case, as aresult of the period the plaintiff was lawfully imprisoned, she would have already made the necessary adjustments to serving a prisonsentence.  Indeed she was someone who had been properly sentenced to a term of two yearsâ imprisonment for serious criminal offendingand she had no reason to think that she was not perfectly properly incarcerated.  That being the case, the judge held that the secondelement mentioned above, namely the damage to reputation, humiliation, shock, injury to feelings and so on, was absent in the case(p 1060B to E).</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Finally, Lord Woolf specifically approved the approach of the trial judge not to propose an amount for each extra day of imprisonmentbut rather to adopt a global approach.  The Master of the Rolls recognised it would be possible to work out a daily, weekly or monthlyfigure from the increased award of Â£5,000 for the extra 59 days of wrongful imprisonment but such an exercise was discouraged (p1060E-G).  The judge emphasised that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âNo two cases are the same.  The shorter the period the larger can be the pro rata rate.  The longer the period the lower the prorata rate.  The length of sentence lawfully imposed is clearly similarly significant.â  (p 1060G)</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Summary of position in present case</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Drawing the threads together, the position in the present case may be summarised as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  The present case concerns claims for ordinary (basic) damages, aggravated damages and exemplary damages.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  As regards ordinary damages, no pecuniary or special damages are claimed.  Only non-pecuniary damages are claimed.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  There are two elements to the claim for non-pecuniary damages, namely, first, compensation for loss of liberty; and secondly,damage to reputation, humiliation, shock, injury to feelings and so on which can result from the loss of liberty.</p>        <p class="quote">(4)  As regards the first element, unlike the position in <i>Pham Van Ngo</i>, where there was available to the Government at all times an alternative regime whereby the Vietnamese boat people could have beenlawfully detained, there was no alternative lawful procedure available to the Director or the Secretary to detain the four applicants,in the absence of a certain and accessible policy on the exercise of the powers to detain, which did not come into existence until18 October 2008.  The present case is therefore not a case of a technical breach and the assessment of damages must take into accounteach applicantâs loss of liberty as such.</p>        <p class="quote">(5)  The victimâs quality of life or liberty, during the period of unlawful detention, must be a relevant factor to bear in mind. If the quality of liberty is anything less than full, that fact must be reflected in the assessment.  Thus for the applicants, evenif they had been released on their own recognizance after making the CAT claims, they would still have been persons without any legalright to stay and live permanently, or even indefinitely in Hong Kong, save to the extent that pending the verification of theirCAT claims, they could not be returned to the places where, according to their claims, torture might take place.  In fact, therewas nothing to prevent the Government from removing them to another country or place where no apprehended torture would take place,even before the CAT claims could be verified.  But other than that, the applicants would have been entitled to stay and live as freepersons in Hong Kong pending the verification of their claims.  These are relevant considerations to bear in mind in consideringthe first element.</p>        <p class="quote">(6)  As regards the second element, namely, damage to reputation, humiliation, shock, injury to feelings and so on, both in the caseof âASâ and that of âFâ, their detentions followed immediately after their release from imprisonment for offences that theywere lawfully convicted of and sentenced to imprisonment for.  In the case of âASâ, he had been in lawful custody since the dateof his arrest (25 September 2004) until he was discharged from prison on 26 May 2005.  It was a lengthy period of lawful detention. So far as he is concerned, the second element for compensation is absent or almost absent, as per <i>Ex parte</i> <i>Evans (No 2)</i>.  As regards âFâ, he had been in lawful custody since the date of his arrest on 18 April 2005 until his discharge from prisonon 28 May 2005.  The period of lawful detention was relatively short and the offence involved minor.  I will not say that the secondelement is wholly absent in his case.  But, as compared with the other two applicants (âAâ and âYAâ), it is of reduced significance.</p>        <p class="quote">(7)  Regarding damage to reputation, humiliation, shock, injury to feelings and so on, this must, to a substantial extent, be subjectiveand dependent on individuals and their particular circumstances.  Thus very generally speaking, what the victimâs quality or conditionsof life had been prior to detention, what his expectation had been, how he perceived his detention (including its lawfulness or otherwise),how his condition of detention, as subjectively experienced by him, compared with life outside if he had not been wrongfully detainedand compared with life before detention, and so forth, should be relevant considerations.  But all this is not to say that thereis one law for the rich and famous, and another for those who are without.  Nor can there be one measure of damages for people whocame from an affluent and developed country, and another for those who arrived from a poor and under-developed place.  As generalpropositions, they must be wrong in principle.  But rejection of that does not, putting my point the other way round, prevent thecourt from taking the subjective and personal circumstances of the victim into account â in fact, the court should take them intoaccount.</p>        <p class="quote">(8)  All four applicants claim aggravated damages.  Aggravated damages may be awarded where there are aggravating features about thecase which result in the victim not receiving sufficient compensation for the injury suffered if the award were restricted to a basicaward.  Conduct pertaining to the Government should therefore be taken into account.  Factors such as the manner of the false imprisonmentand the conduct of the wrongdoer are relevant as they may lead to aggravation or mitigation of the damages â insofar as aggravateddamages (if any) is concerned.</p>        <p class="quote">(9)  Aggravated damages is essentially compensatory in nature, but nonetheless contains also a penal element as far as the wrongfulparty is concerned, which may affect the question of whether exemplary damages on top of aggravated damages should be awarded andif so, the quantum of that award: <i>Thompson</i>, at pages 516 to 517, points (11) and (12). </p>        <p class="quote">(10)  As regards exemplary damages, the law in Hong Kong, unlike some Commonwealth jurisdictions (including Australia, New Zealandand Canada), has always followed, without question, the landmark decision of <i>Rookes v Barnard</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 1129</a>, later approved in <i>Broome v Cassell</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%201027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 1027</a> (see also <i>Kuddus v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Constabulary</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20AC%20122" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 AC 122):</a> see for instance, <i>Wong Wai Hing v Hui Wei Lee</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%201%20HKLRD%20736" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 1 HKLRD 736</a>, 758H to I (CA); <i>éåæ¦®å°å»æ¿å¬ç½²</i> CACV 247/2002 (6 February 2003), paras 22 and 23.</p>        <p class="quote">(11)  The first category in Lord Devlinâs classification relates to âoppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional conduct by governmentservantsâ: at p 1226.  It has been said that the three epithets (oppressive, arbitrary, unconstitutional) fall to be read disjunctively:<i>Holden v Chief Constable of Lancashire</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20QB%20380" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] QB 380</a>, 388C-D.  However, it is doubtful whether conduct which is merely âunconstitutionalâ (as, strictly speaking, every unlawful arrestby a police officer would be) is in itself sufficient to bring the case within the first category: see the reservations of PurchasLJ (at pages 387H to 388B) and of Sir John Arnold P at pages 388H to 389A in <i>Holden</i>.  See also the Northern Ireland cases of <i>Clinton v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20NI%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NI 215</a> and <i>Davey v Chief Constable, Royal Ulster Constabulary</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20NI%20139" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] NI 139.</a></p>        <p class="quote">(12)  In any event, the doubt seems only to be relevant when a judge is sitting with a jury, where the question of whether a claimfor exemplary damages should be withdrawn from the jury for not falling within the first category at all (assuming it is the categoryin question) may arise.  Where the judge sits alone, such a question is likely to be academic because an award of exemplary damagesdoes not follow automatically in every case coming within a relevant category.  The Court will normally look for outrageous conduct,disclosing malice, fraud, insolence, cruelty and the like, to justify an award for exemplary damages.  <i>Holden</i> at page 389A to B/C (<i>per</i> Sir John Arnold P); <i>Pham Van Ngo, supra</i> at page 306; <i>McGregor on Damages</i> (17<sup>th</sup> ed) para 11-019.  In the New Zealand context, where <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> is not followed and the law on exemplary damages is much more liberal, the Privy Council has held, by a majority of three to two,that in exceptional and rare cases, inadvertently negligent conduct which is so outrageous as to call for condemnation and punishmentmay be sufficient to justify an award of exemplary damages based on the category of negligence â which is not a recognised categoryfor the award of exemplary damages under <i>Rookes v Barnard</i>: <i>A v Bottrill</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20AC%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 AC 449.</a>  The case, cited by Mr Dykes SC (Mr Hectar Pun with him) for the applicants, is of limited value in this jurisdiction for obviousreasons, but its emphasis on the rationale of the jurisdiction to award exemplary damages, namely the courtâs disapproval of outrageousconduct (per the majority at page 455, para 20) or the punishment of the defendant for his outrageous behaviour (per the minorityat page 466, para 77) is, nonetheless, instructive.</p>        <p class="quote">(13)  As regards actual figures, although starting figures and ceilings were suggested in <i>Thompson</i> amongst the guidelines given by the Master of the Rolls, those guidelines were meant for jury trials, and the figures mentioned wereintended for the benefit of juries (as much as for judges sitting alone, of course).  In the subsequent case of <i>Ex parte Evans (No 2), supra</i>, the Master of the Rolls specifically approved the trial judgeâs refusal to work on a daily rate but to adopt a global approach. Any simplistic approach to use the global award to work backwards to arrive at a daily, weekly or monthly rate is bound to be erroneousbecause the shorter the period of false imprisonment, the larger should be the pro rata rate, whereas the longer the period, thelower the pro rata rate (<i>per</i> Lord Woolf in <i>Ex parte Evans (No 2)</i> at page 1060G).  In any event, as the learned editors of <i>McGregor</i> have observed, after struggling with the various figures used by the courts in different cases, the Â£3,000 guideline for the firstday is likely to be utilised only where the false imprisonment is very short and the suggested progressively reducing scale overthe next few days should be âsteepâ (para 37-008).</p>        <p class="quote">(14)  Finally, it must be emphasised that the figures suggested or actually awarded in the English cases are not directly applicableor translatable in this jurisdiction due to differences in social and economic conditions.  This has been emphasised in personalinjury cases: <i>Lee Ting-lam v Leung Kam-ming</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20HKLR%20657" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] HKLR 657</a>, 659; <i>Chan Wai-tong v Li Ping-sum</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20HKLR%20176" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] HKLR 176</a>, 180; <i>Chan Pui-ki v Leung On</i> HKLR 401, 405-407.</p>        <p class="quote">(15)  Rather, local awards should be looked at.  However, it cannot be overemphasised that no two cases are the same.  Moreover, evenin comparable cases, one would still have to be satisfied that the previous award was appropriate and right.  It is wrong to usepast cases â even local ones â as if they contained figures set by statutes.  Nor do they act as any strict jacket.  Their realuse, particularly when considered collectively, is to provide the Court with a general âfeelâ of the appropriate amount of awardin the case at hand and to act as a cross-check against any significant departure, one way or the other, from the previous awards,or, where it can be observed, the prevailing trend of awards.  To a much lesser extent, general levels of awards made in personalinjury cases may also be looked at to serve as a very rough and general cross-check.  This has in fact been mentioned by Lord Woolfin <i>Thompson</i>, at page 515E, point (5).</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Observations on past Hong Kong cases</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Mr Anderson Chow SC for the Director has very helpfully prepared, together his junior, Ms Grace Chow, a summary, in the form ofa table, of relevant local cases on false imprisonment and malicious prosecution, for general comparison purposes.  It has been liberallyused by counsel on both sides as well as the Court during argument.  I have, gratefully, taken the liberty to reproduce the tableas an annex to this judgment.  I would, where appropriate, make observations on these past cases, bearing in mind what I have justsaid about the use of previous cases in the present assessment.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  <i>Faridha</i> (2007) is of very peculiar facts.  The Indonesian domestic helper was subjected to hitting, pinching, scratching and assault withobjects by her employer.  She was falsely imprisoned in her employerâs home, made to sleep on the kitchen floor and had to worklong hours for a prolonged period of four months.  The award of $60,000 included aggravated damages.  The facts in that case were,in short, appalling. </p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  <i>Godagan</i> (2004) has to be read with care.  The award of $200,000 was not primarily for false imprisonment â the plaintiff having spent 19days in prison, but rather for malicious prosecution which lasted almost a year, involving an initial conviction and the overturningof the conviction on appeal.  The judge acknowledged that there were no relevant comparables in Hong Kong, and after referring tothe benchmark figures in <i>Thompson</i>, came to the view that $200,000 was the appropriate figure (paras 89 to 91).</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  <i>é¦¬æ¡ç</i> <i>(Ma Kwai Chun)</i> (2003) involved unlawful detention for 12 hours.  The judge did not find the two cases, both concerning assault by police officers,cited by the parties to be useful (paras 19 to 21).  Apparently, the Court was affected by the award made by the Court of Appealin<i>éåæ¦®å°å»æ¿å¬ç½²</i><i>, supra</i>, which concerned the wrongful handcuffing and photographing of the plaintiff by the ICAC, where the Court of Appeal awarded damagesof $10,000 for loss of dignity (paras 22 and 23).  The judge felt that the plaintiff should get $50,000 for the 12 hours of wrongfuldetention that she had experienced in terms of her loss of dignity and injury to her feelings (para 25).  On top, the judge gave$30,000 for aggravated damages to account not only for the absence of any apology, but the way the police had maintained, quite withoutjustification, the lawfulness of the wrongful arrest of the plaintiff in the proceedings (para 28).  In my view, the awards madeby the judge were justified on the peculiar facts of that case.  It, perhaps, provides an illustration that for a very short periodof false imprisonment, the award can be, relatively speaking, substantial, whilst for any further period of unlawful detention, theprogressively reducing scale should be very steep.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  I do not find the awards made in <i>Pham Van Ngo</i> (1993) to be on the low side, as was suggested by Mr Hectar Pun, following Mr Dykes, in his submission on the local cases.  The Courtthere was dealing only with the second element of the award for ordinary damages, it having held that there were all along availablealternative provisions whereby the Government could have made use of to detain lawfully the boat people.  Furthermore, at the riskof repeating: it is not appropriate to simply compare the award in a case where the period of false imprisonment is very short witha case where the period goes to many months or years, by reason of the progressively reducing scale.  Put another way, the longerthe period of detention, the less significant the second element for the award of ordinary damages would become after the initialperiod of detention; and the sole or major factor determining the amount of award in such prolonged situation would be the firstelement, namely the loss of liberty.  <i>Pham Van Ngo</i>, involving a substantial period of false imprisonment of about 18 months, was wholly concerned with the second element.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Likewise, the case of <i>William Crawley</i> (1986), involving a very short period of unlawful detention (2.5 hours), should be understood in that light.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  <i>Yoo Soon-nam</i> (1976) contains <i>obiter</i> observations on the award of damages if liability had been established.  The figure suggested, inclusive of exemplary damages, of$40,000, back in 1976, for a technical breach (pages 718 to 719) involving under 56 hours of wrongful detention, would seem to beon the high side, even bearing in mind that one was concerned with a very short period of false imprisonment.  It was quite out ofline with the figures in other earlier cases summarised in the table.  In any event, I have reservations as to whether exemplarydamages should be awarded at all, given that apart from the conduct being âunconstitutionalâ, there seems to have been an absenceof any conduct which was outrageous or deserving of punishment.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Considering that <i>Chong Yee Shuen</i> was a case decided back in September 1974, the award of $3,000 for three days false imprisonment seems understandable enough.  Incomparison with <i>Yoo</i><i> </i><i>Soon-nam</i>, I very much prefer <i>Chong Yee Shuen</i>, which were decided within two years of each other.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Finally, <i>Chow Hau Yung</i> (1970) confirmed the general level of award as evidenced by <i>Chong Yee Shuen</i>.  $7,000 was awarded for five hours unlawful detention, following a wrongful arrest that was accompanied by assault and threats madeby police officers during detention.  Again the case, decided in February 1970, tends to confirm my view that the <i>obiter</i> figure suggested in <i>Yoo Soon-nam</i> was very much on the high side.</p>    <p class="heading">Six specific matters raised by the respondents</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Mr Chow has urged upon the Court a total of six factors which are said to be relevant to the award of ordinary damages, as wellas the question of whether aggravated or exemplary damages should be awarded on top.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  First, the applicantsâ own conduct in causing or substantially contributing to their detention.  Counselâs point is essentiallythat save for the case of âYAâ, the other three applicants all have committed criminal acts â overstaying, going underground,absconding, transferring to another a travel document, and making a false representation to an immigration officer.  They constitutedcircumstances pointing to there being high risks of absconding and/or re-offending, which were reasons for their detention by theDirector and Secretary.  Mr Chow has pointed out, by way of comparison, that in the majority of cases concerning CAT claimants, theywere released on recognizance.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  I accept that so far as the award for ordinary damages is concerned, the factor mentioned could be relevant to the second element. The more âmeritoriousâ, as it were, the detention â albeit unlawful for a procedural/institutional flaw, the less grievancethe victim may have felt towards his unlawful detention.  But there is a limit to how far this factor can affect the final figure.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  I also accept that this is a matter that can be and in fact should be taken into account in relation to aggravated damages as wellas exemplary damages.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  It has to be pointed out that although there was at the time no accessible policy on how the discretion to detain would be exercised,so that in terms of art 5(1) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, the detentions were âarbitraryâ, it does not necessarily followthat viewed in light of the individual merits of each case, the detention was capricious or âarbitraryâ in the general publiclaw sense.  On the evidence, there were materials and evidence which tend to justify the Directorâs or Secretaryâs decisions,at the level of individual merits, to detain the applicants. </p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  On the facts, I think the case of âASâ was plainly poor, whereas that of âAâ and âFâ were relatively better and indeedsimilar.  Both were overstayers, the only difference being that âFâ was actually prosecuted and convicted and sentenced to ashort term of imprisonment.  I do not accept Mr Chowâs argument in relation to âYAâ.  He came to Hong Kong using an air ticketand boarding pass bearing someone elseâs name and he failed to provide a travel document or other satisfactory documents.  Butbearing in mind that âYAâ was claiming to be a possible target of torture, those facts were by no means out of the ordinary. While I do not suggest that his detention must, even at the level of individual merits, be flawed, so far as the present discussionis concerned, I do not think the circumstances of his case would have much impact on the level of damages that should be awardedto him.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  With the exception of âYAâ, the three other applicants all made their CAT claims very late in the day.  That could, arguably,reflect on whether they really had a genuine claim.  That certainly contributed to the suspicion that the Secretary or Director hadregarding the merits of their claims even before their eventual rejection.  But so far as the question of ordinary damages and thesecond element are concerned, I think this is of very marginal relevance only.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Secondly, Mr Chow says that the Director or Secretary had reasonable and probable cause to detain the applicants and acted <i>bona fide</i>.  I have no doubt that they are matters relevant to a consideration of aggravated damages and exemplary damages.  So far as theyare mirror images of the first point already discussed, I accept they are relevant to ordinary damages as well.  Beyond that, I donot see how the Directorâs perception of the situation could be relevant to the quantification of the ordinary damages due to thewronged applicants.  It is not relevant to either of the two elements comprising the award for ordinary damages.  Moreover, as Ihave emphasised, so far as the second element is concerned, it is the subjective perception of the applicant which really matters(provided that this is kept within bounds).  The Directorâs or Secretaryâs own perception of his action is quite irrelevant.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Thirdly, Mr Chow points to the fact that all four applicants had already been held in detention prior to the commencement of theperiods of unlawful detention.  I have already discussed this factor earlier on.  It is based on <i>Ex parte Evans (No 2)</i>, which involved a victim who had served two yearsâ imprisonment for a serious crime.  Of the four applicants in the present case,the case of âASâ would be seriously affected by the principle under discussion.  To a much less extent, the case of âFâ wouldalso be affected.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Fourthly, Mr Chow has urged the Court to take into account the previous living conditions of the applicants.  I have already dealtwith this point and do not intend to repeat myself.  As I say, given the subjective element built into the second element comprisingthe award for ordinary damages, the personal circumstances of the applicants must be taken into account, including their previousliving conditions.  But as I have also stressed, there is a limit to it and these circumstances can only be of limited relevance.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Fifthly, Mr Chow says that the applicants had no legal rights to work in Hong Kong.  This is a quality-of-liberty argument.  Itis relevant, as a matter of principle, to the first element comprising the award for ordinary damages.  However, the right to work,as a matter of strict law and as a matter of what would actually have happened if there had been no unlawful detentions and the applicantshad been released on recognizance, is not a straightforward matter: see <i>Iqbal Shahid v Secretary for Justice</i>, HCAL 150/2008 &amp; 8/2009, 30 December 2008 (leave application) &amp; 2 March 2009 (substantive hearing), Wright J.  I place negligibleweight on this matter in the assessment. </p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Sixthly, Mr Chow relies on the conditions in which the applicants were detained.  He says, by reference to the evidence, that theapplicants were allowed to make telephone calls, subject to following certain procedures and subject to an undertaking to pay thenecessary charges for international calls.  Newspapers were provided to the detainees, as were reading materials.  They were providedwith adequate medical treatments where required.  There is no objective medical evidence that any of the applicants has sufferedany physical or (permanent) psychological injury as a result of the detention.  Nor is there any evidence that they were not welltreated.  I accept all this is relevant. </p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  On the other hand, I bear in mind that the applicants have been treated as remanded prisoners, and a relevant fact is that theirlife in prison lacked the structure and the direction of the regime that governs convicted prisoners that requires them to work andallows them to access vocational and educational opportunities to make them better adjusted to return to civil society.  This factassumes significance when the detention becomes prolonged.</p><i><br /></i>    <p class="heading">Several other matters</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  I move on to deal with several matters raised in general.  First, as regards aggravated damages, Mr Dykes submits that the applicantswere CAT claimants expecting protection and a fair procedure for determining their claims, and their detention caused them upsetsimply because it was arbitrary.  It would be frustrating in the extreme for a person to see a similarly circumstanced CAT claimantnot being detained.  Counsel stresses that it is different from the fact that the lack of a detention policy amounted to institutionalindifference, a factor which may engage the jurisdiction to award exemplary damages (see below).</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  The second point made by Mr Dykes in support of the claim for aggravated damages is the lack of any apology for the wrongful detention.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  As regards the first point, I take the view that as a matter of principle, it is a valid point.  However, as a matter of fact, Ido not think that in the cases of âAâ, âASâ and âFâ, they had good grounds for complaint, on the merits of their respectivecases.  This is particularly so in the case of âASâ, who had been convicted of offences and who had served a substantial periodof imprisonment.  Detaining him on the ground of risk of absconding or re-offending was understandable â although unlawful dueto the procedural/institutional flaw.  To a lesser extent, âAâ and âFâ could not complain, they having gone underground asoverstayers for very substantial periods of time.  The case of âYAâ was more marginal and I agree that he may have felt upsetat his detention.  He made his CAT claim shortly after arrival, and he was effectively detained since arrival until after proceedingswere commenced.  On the other hand, I bear in mind that his identity had not been verified.  That would go some way towards justifyingthe Directorâs detention of him.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  As regards the absence of an apology, I do not think in itself it is a sufficient ground for the award of aggravated damages.  Thishas been so held by Patrick Chan J in <i>Pham Van Ngo, supra,</i> at pages 322-323 (on the facts of that case) and the same point was made by Chung J in <i>é¦¬æ¡ç</i><i>, supra</i>, at para 28.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  But certainly, it is a matter that should be taken into account.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Secondly, as regards exemplary damages, Mr Dykes submits that the detentions were âoppressiveâ, taking into account the statusof the applicants as torture claimants.  He contends that detention is never necessary simply because someone is a CAT claimant and,in the absence of fast track procedures detention can impede the investigation and processing of a claim.  Mr Dykes concedes thatâASâ and âFâ stand in a different category because of their past convictions.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Mr Dykes also submits that the detentions were âarbitraryâ given the failure to comply with art 5(1) of the Hong Kong Bill ofRights.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Mr Dykes further submits that the detention in each case was âunconstitutionalâ because it contravened art 39 of the Basic Lawand art 5(1) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  Mr Dykes complains about the institutional neglect on the part of the authorities to put in place a published and accessible policyon detention.  This, it is said, justifies the award of exemplary damages.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Whilst conceding that no malice or bad faith was involved, Mr Dykes also makes the point that the absence of a policy or a publishedand accessible policy in the present case meant that the authorities were guilty of such âinadvertently negligent conductâ whichwas so outrageous as to call for condemnation and punishment, bearing in mind the background that back in <i>Secretary for Security v Sakthevel Prabakar</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282004%29%207%20HKCFAR%20187" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2004) 7 HKCFAR 187</a>, the Court of Final Appeal had already said that the Government had a duty to put in place fair and proper procedures to screen theclaims of torture claimants.  Counsel based his submission on the Privy Council case of <i>A v Bottrill, supra</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  For the reasons already explained, I do not think that in the cases of âAâ, âASâ and âFâ, anything oppressive had happened. At the level of individual merits, their respective detentions were all understandable, albeit wrong.  In the case of âYAâ,it was more marginal, but nonetheless, I would hesitate to apply the label âoppressiveâ to his case.  The fact that a detentionmay not even be justifiable under general public law (I am not suggesting that this must have been the case here) does not necessarilyturn it into one that is oppressive.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  The same comments apply to the submission based on arbitrariness, save that again, in the case of âYAâ, it is slightly morearguable (I put it no higher than that) that his detention was doubly arbitrary â for want of compliance with art 5(1) of the HongKong Bill of Rights and for lack of objectively justifiable grounds even under general public law. </p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  The detentions were no doubt unconstitutional, strictly speaking.  But I have already discussed this element in Lord Devlinâsfirst category above.  In my view, that, <i>per se</i>, is quite insufficient to trigger an <i>actual</i> award for exemplary damages (as opposed to leaving the question to the jury), in the absence of outrageous conduct, disclosing malice,fraud, insolence, cruelty and the like.  This brings one back to the other arguments raised.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  As regards the supposed disregard of the Court of Final Appealâs admonition that a fair and proper procedure to verify CAT claimsshould be put in place, I take the view that detention and screening of CAT claimants belong to two separate regimes, though thereis some intersection.  The power to detain may be exercised in a variety of circumstances, many of which may have nothing to do withtorture claimants.  I do not regard the failure of the Director or Secretary to have a published and accessible policy in itselfa wilful disregard of the view of the Court of Final Appeal in <i>Prabakar</i> expressed in relation to CAT claimants.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Finally, the marriage plan of âAâ was affected by his detention.  The loss should be covered by the award for ordinary damages:<i>R (Hall) v The Independent Assessor</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/$(division)/$(year)/$(decno).html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] EWHC 2758</a> (admin).</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  Having dealt with these specific matters, I now move on to quantify the damages payable to the individual applicants.</p>    <p class="heading">Assessment â âAâ</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  In the case of âAâ, the period of detention was three months.  I have firmly borne in mind the personal circumstances of âAâ,including the detentionâs effect on his intending marriage.  I have not forgotten his hunger strike whilst being detained.  Therewas also a suggestion that he suffered from some depression during imprisonment, for which he had received treatment.  I have borneall this in mind, which should be reflected in the award for ordinary damages. </p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  I have also taken into account all the matters discussed above, insofar as they are relevant to his case. </p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  For ordinary damages, I would award $80,000.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  I do not think a case for aggravated damages or exemplary damages has been made out. </p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  In particular, in relation to exemplary damages, I do not find any outrageous conduct, disclosing malice, fraud, insolence, crueltyand the like, in the present case.  I specifically reject Mr Dykesâ argument that inadvertently negligent conduct is sufficient,on the facts of the present case, particularly bearing in mind that <i>A v Bottrill</i> was an appeal from New Zealand, where the law is different.</p>    <p class="heading">Assessment - âASâ</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  In the case of âASâ, the period of wrongful detention was lengthy.  It comprised a period of 655 days, or some 21.5 months.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  I have also firmly borne in mind the personal circumstances peculiar to âASâ.  Everything I have said above, insofar as it appliesto âASâ, has been taken into account.  Two specific points are worth repeating in the case of âASâ.First, the period of wrongfuldetention was preceded by a substantial period of imprisonment for conviction of offences.  Secondly, so far as the individual âmeritâof his case was concerned, it was very poor and there were more than sufficient reasons to detain him (but for the procedural/institutionalflaw).  In other words, the second element for awarding ordinary damages plays a very minor if not negligible role in his case.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  For ordinary damages I would award $150,000.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  For similar reasons, I do not think a case for the award of aggravated or exemplary damages has been made out.</p>    <p class="heading">Assessment â âFâ</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  Turning to the case of âFâ, his personal circumstances have been firmly borne in mind.  Everything said above, insofar as itis applicable to his case, has been taken into account.  I have borne in mind his hunger strike.  His period of wrongful detentionwas likewise lengthy.  It comprised 634 days, or over 20.5 months.  The period of wrongful detention was preceded also by a periodof lawful imprisonment.  However, the offence involved was relatively minor and the sentence short.  As explained, the second elementfor the award of ordinary damages has a reduced, but nonetheless some, effect here.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  There were complaints regarding the conditions of âFâ during detention.  However, according to the available immigration record,âFâ did receive medical treatment for hypertension and it was medically confirmed that appropriate treatments had been renderedto him and his general health condition had been satisfactory during his detention.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  Taking everything into account, I think an award of $180,000 for ordinary damages is fair.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  Again, I do not think a case for aggravated damages or exemplary damages has been made out.</p>    <p class="heading">Assessment â âYAâ</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  Finally, as regards the case of âYAâ, his personal circumstances have been taken into account.  I have not forgotten his hungerstrike and the alleged difficulties of communicating with his family back home.  His detention involved a period of 156 days, orover five months.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  In my view, an appropriate award for ordinary damages is $100,000.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  I do feel there is a marginal case for the award of aggravated damages, for the reasons explained above.  However, such an additionalaward is only made if one finds that the award for basic damages is not sufficient to cover the matters that might otherwise justifythe making of an additional award.  The making of such an additional award is the exception, rather than the rule.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  In the present case, all things considered, I find the award of $100,000 to be quite sufficient as compensation for everything thatâYAâ has gone through, and I decline, therefore, to make an additional award of aggravated damages or exemplary damages.</p>    <p class="heading">Comparison and crosschecking</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  I wish to say specifically that in making the above awards, I have borne in mind the levels of awards in previous cases, insofaras they are useful and insofar as the Court agrees with the awards made in those cases.  But as I said, they do not provide any strictjacket. </p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  The Court has also borne in mind, very generally and roughly, the levels of awards made in personal injury cases, particularly theawards for pain, suffering and loss of amenities under the four categories of loss: <i>Lee Ting-lam v Leung Kam-ming</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20HKLR%20657" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] HKLR 657.</a>  For a case falling within the bottom end of the serious injury category, such as the loss of a limb replaced by a satisfactory artificialdevice (see p 659), the current level of award would be in the region of $460,000 to $500,000: see for example, <i>Chui Kam Sang v Tao Kee Eng Co Ltd</i> HCPI 986/2006, 21 July 2008 (Recorder J Fok SC), paras 53-60; <i>Wong Tsan Ming v Tse Chi Man</i> HCPI 73/2008, 25 August 2008 (Master Levy) paras 131-134.  As a further comparison, the statutory award for bereavement in a fatalaccident case is $150,000 (this has remained the figure since 1997): The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22">Cap 22</a>), <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(3).</a></p>    <p class="heading">Rejection of simple <i>arithmetical approach</i></p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  For the reasons explained, I reject Mr Punâs submission on the quantification of the applicantsâ claims which is essentiallybased on daily rates, proportions and straight-line computations.  As has been mentioned more than once, a global approach is tobe preferred to a rateable approach, and in any event, so far as daily, weekly or monthly rates are concerned, these pro rata ratesare on a progressively sliding scale.  Applying percentages of discount to the award for ordinary damages to arrive at figures foraggravated and exemplary damages is not justified by a careful reading of the authorities, and is in any event artificial.  Ignoringthese principles have resulted in counselâs figures being, with respect, wide off the marks.</p>    <p class="heading">Outcome</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  Damages payable to âAâ, âASâ, âFâ and âYAâ are assessed at $80,000, $150,000, $180,000 and $100,000 respectively.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  Unlike a personal injury claim, no pre-assessment interest is in question: <i>Holtham v The Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis</i> (CA) (unrep) 25 November 1987.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  Post-assessment interests will of course follow the judgment rate.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  As regard costs, I make a costs order <i>nisi</i> that the costs of the assessment be paid by the respondent to the applicant in each case, to be taxed if not agreed.
