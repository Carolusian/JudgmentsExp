But that is a defect which, if the Plaintiffâsclaim has substance, can be cured.  At this stage I just note that the Plaintiff has not even deposed to the truth of his allegations.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  After the writ had been issued, the matter came to the attention of this court.  In the light of the state of affairs (which I shallelaborate below) this court considered that there should be a hearing to consider whether the Plaintiffâs action should be struckout for being vexatious or abusive.  This is in accordance with the practice laid down by this court in the case of <i>Choy Bing Wing v Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR</i>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20HKC%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 HKC 225.</a></p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In that case this court struck out the claims of a plaintiff on its own motion.  The court found that the claims of the plaintiffin that action to be wholly and plainly devoid of merit and was vexatious and constituted an abuse of process.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  This court explained in that judgment at paragraph 28 onwards why it was appropriate in the circumstances of that case that thecourt should exercise the power of striking out on its own motion.  I need not repeat what I have already said in that judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Coming back to the present case, as explained, the Plaintiffâs claims is based on an alleged conspiracy against him by the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The requirements for pleading conspiracy can be found in the Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2011, at paragraph 18/12/8.  What is saidis this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhen pleading a tort of conspiracy the pleader must alleged at least one overt act which is the act of all the alleged conspiratorsor failing that a number of overt acts which include at least one act on the part of each co-conspirator.</p>        <p class="quote">The overt act or overt acts pleaded must be such as to show: (1) that the conspiratorial agreement alleged against the Defendant hadbeen entered into by each and every one of them; (2) that the agreement and not merely the intention of one person only was implemented;and (3) that such implementation caused the damage complained of.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>And the authority is the case of <i>Dansk v Wheelock Marden</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%202%20HKC%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 2 HKC 264</a> at page 282(B) to (C).</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  With these principles in mind I examined what is provided by the Plaintiff as regards the factual basis for his claim.  The Statementof Claim itself did not plead any facts.  The only thing that it pleaded is by reference to what had been set out in what the Plaintiffcalled a statement to the police.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Amongst the documents attached to the Statement of Claim there is a document with a title called, âWitness Statement Against CJ Justice Andrew Li and Othersâ in report No. CRN0901336.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  What was set out in that statement are some serious allegations against the current Chief Justice, Justice Ma.  The Plaintiff saidas follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI am the above informant. I am a solicitor no longer in practice since 2004 as a result of certain High Court actions. In the courseof these High Court actions I discovered in the courtâs library that for all the cases tried and heard before Mr Justice Ma andfor those cases represented by solicitors such as Herbert Smith and Johnson Stokes &amp; Masters and counsel from Temple Chambersthe successful rate is 100 per cent.</p>        <p class="quote">In any event, I brought this discovery to the attention of the Chief Justice, Mr Andrew Li by attending the Court of Final Appealin person and his clerk asked me to write down the factual events and a written reply is given in that he claimed judicial independenceand he would not comment further.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Pausing here, nothing in these paragraphs said anything about a conspiracy directed against the Plaintiff, not to mention a conspiracyto injure the reputation and his legal practice.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The Plaintiff does not disclose anywhere in the documents he presented to this court what are the cases he referred to in theseparagraphs.  For all I know the mere fact that Mr Justice Ma in his judgment came to a conclusion in favour of a particular teamof lawyers does not by itself show any conspiracy between the judge, the solicitors and counsel.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Take an example of a judge hearing 10 cases, even if it so happened that for 10 cases the judge concluded in favour of a particularcombination of lawyers it would not show any conspiracy.  This is particularly so when the combination involves chambers and solicitorfirms with many members.  The judge gave judgments and set out the reasons for his decisions in them.  If there are errors in thejudgment, the judgment is susceptible to appeal.  The results could not per se be evidence of any conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Moreover, there is nothing in that paragraph to suggest there was any kind of conspiratorial agreement between the Chief Justiceand the lawyers involved.  It is all the more problematic with his reference to counsel from the Temple Chambers and the two solicitorsâfirms because the plaintiff has not indicated what was the time frame of his research in terms of the cases that he had examined.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  I say this not only because of the desirability of precision but also a matter of substance.  The Plaintiff is suing barristerspractising at Temple Chambers without specifying the date of the alleged conspiracy.  Membership of chambers change from time totime and likewise membership of a solicitor firm.  Thus, it is not clear and it is unacceptably embarrassing for an allegation ofthis sort to be made without specifying the time frame.  For those in the Temple Chambers and those in these two solicitorsâ firms,the Plaintiff has not even gone into any particulars to give one any clue to find out whether one is allegedly involved.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The witness statement continued in the next paragraph referring to some time in 2008.  The Plaintiff said he discovered that thereis a court order banning him from access to courts issued by Deputy Judge Mayo at the direction of the head of High Court (at thattime Justice Ma) and he said that is in breach of his human rights and the Basic Law.  He complained to the press and legislativecouncillors and filed a written complaint to the Chief Justice concerning this gross abuse and unlawful act. He continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe Chief Justice, Mr Li, once again did nothing and instead he assigned this complaint to his clerk and must have entered intoan agreement with Mr Justice Ma to obstruct and pervert the proper administration of justice, namely, to carry out an investigationof this complaint and in a written letter dated 3 April 2009, signed by the judicial clerk, Madam Au Yeung, she stated that thereis nothing that Mr Justice Ma wished to add further on comments made by the Chief Justice Li and she signed on behalf of Mr JusticeMa.</p>        <p class="quote">Previously the purported replies from the so-called clerk to Chief Justice Li had not been signed and all pointed to one conclusion,namely, the matter if of judicial nature and there is nothing the Chief Justice could do about court orders which is clearly unlawfulon record.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Pausing here, I must point out is that the Plaintiff does not pinpoint any factual matters or any evidence to suggest that the courtorder against him made by Deputy Judge Mayo was made at the direction of Justice Ma.  According to my understanding the relevantcourt order is a restrictive application order [âRAOâ] made in another set of proceedings in accordance with the prevalent practice.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Therefore I see no basis for the Plaintiff to suggest that this order was made specifically at the direction of the Chief Judgeof the High Court at that time, namely Justice Ma.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In terms of the validity of an order of this sort, that had been explained in a number of authorities, including the judgment ofthe Court of Final Appeal in <i>Ng Yat Chi v Max Share</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%201%20HKLRD%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 1 HKLRD 473.</a>  Again I need not go into details of those authorities.  Since then a practice direction (PD 11.3) has come into effect providingfor the procedures and mechanism for making this sort of orders.  I see no basis for suggesting that the RAO was in contraventionof the human rights of the Plaintiff or in breach of any of his rights under the Basic Law.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Thus it was not surprising that the then Chief Justice, Chief Justice Li, did not deem it necessary to take the matter further inrespect of his complaint.  Despite that, the Plaintiff now sees fit to make very serious allegations against the former Chief Justiceand Chief Justice Ma by alleging that they have or must have entered into an agreement to obstruct and pervert the proper administrationof justice.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  These are serious allegations which a litigant must have proper factual foundation before he can advance the same in front of acourt.  The Plaintiffâs Statement of Claim as well as his documents do not disclose any shred of evidence in support of such seriousallegations.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The Plaintiff apparently seeks to make something out of the reply letter from Justice Maâs clerk in terms of he having nothingto add.  I fail to see how this can take his case further.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  In considering of the evidence put before the court in support of the allegations of the Plaintiff, one has to bear in mind primarilyhis claim is for a conspiracy against him in terms of his reputation and legal practice.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Taking all the materials of the Plaintiff into account, I am unable to see anything which merits any further investigation of thematter.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  In his Statement of Claim the Plaintiff also referred to support by overseas governments, including the U.S. government, the Irangovernment and the Japan government.  If one looks at the documents attached to his Statement of Claim these were just letters fromthe foreign State Departments acknowledging receipt of his letter.  There is nothing in those responses to suggest that the foreigngovernments have any reasons to support him.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  On the whole one can see plainly and obviously that this is a piece of vexatious litigation with no proper basis in terms of factsand evidence to support very serious allegations against the Chief Justice and the former Chief Justice as well as the other Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  I am satisfied that this is a proper case that the court should exercise its power to strike out on its own motion on the groundthat the claim by the Plaintiff is vexatious and an abuse of process.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  For all these reasons I now decide to strike out the Plaintiffâs claim and the action is dismissed.</p>    <p>(Submission re RPO application and costs)</p>	<p> </p>		<p> </p>		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">		<tr>			<td width="50%" valign="top"></td>			<td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(M H Lam)<br />			Judge of the Court of First Instance<br />			High Court</td>		</tr>	</table>		<p> </p>		<!--sino section representation --><representation>		<p>The Plaintiff, in person, absent</p>		<p>The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, in person, absent</p>		<p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, in person, absent</p>		<p>The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, in person, absent</p>		<p>Mr Withington, of Messrs Herbert Smith, for the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant</p>		<p>The 5<sup>th</sup> Defendant, in person, absent</p>		<p>The 6<sup>th</sup> Defendant, in person, absent</p>	</representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2011/645.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
