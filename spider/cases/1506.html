class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  This is an application by the plaintiff, who claims damages for personal injuries, to adduce expert evidence of a clinical psychologistat the trial of the action. The application has been made after the case was set down for trial. The trial of this action will takeplace before me on 2-9 September 2011. On 23 March 2011, the plaintiffâs solicitors wrote to my clerk to say that they had setthe action down for trial on that day. They also intimated that the plaintiff might apply to adduce psychological expert evidencenotwithstanding that the action had been set down. On 11 April 2011, the plaintiffâs solicitors again wrote to my clerk statingthat the parties failed to agree on the appointment of a clinical psychologist as the single joint expert in the case and also failedto agree that a joint examination be conducted by the partiesâ respective experts. The plaintiffâs solicitors enclosed, in theirletter of 11 April 2011, a letter dated 7 April 2011 from Professor Peter Lee, a clinical psychologist, which expressed his viewthat a comprehensive assessment of the plaintiffâs overall psychological status and well being, as well as his overall cognitivefunctioning, should be undertaken. On 13 April 2011, the plaintiff issued a summons returnable before me on 18 May 2011 for leaveto obtain and adduce expert evidence from a clinical psychologist at the trial of this action. Given the opposition to the summonsby the defendantsâ solicitors, I re-listed the summons, originally fixed for 3 minutes, to be heard before me on 9 June 2011.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  After hearing submissions from the partiesâ counsel and solicitors on 9 June 2011, I dismissed the plaintiffâs application andawarded costs of the application to the defendants, with certificate for counsel.  The plaintiff is legally aided, and I directedthat the plaintiffâs own costs be taxed in accordance with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  These are the reasons for my decision. </p>    <p class="heading">The relevant legal principles</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Even prior to the enactment of the Civil Justice Reform (âCJRâ), the right of the parties to adduce expert evidence at trialwas subject to the leave of the court.  However, it is fair to say that leave was usually granted, provided that the parties seekingto call such evidence established the expertise of the individual concerned and disclosed the substance of his or her opinion evidencein written form prior to trial.  The prevailing judicial view was to allow the parties to call the experts of their choice, justas they could call factual witnesses of their choice.  Indeed, in personal injury actions, the plaintiff was required, from veryearly on, to serve, with his statement of claim, medical reports substantiating all the personal injuries alleged in the statementof claim which the plaintiff proposed to adduce in evidence as part of his case at the trial<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The substantial increase of expert evidence, particularly in personal injury cases, became the subject of judicial criticism.  Beginningwith the English Court of Appeal case of <i>Liddell v Middleton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20PIQR%2036" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] PIQR 36</a>, expert evidence reconstructing a road traffic accident became the exception rather than the rule<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>. The clampdown on expert evidence on liability issues in personal injury cases extended to cover non-medical expert evidence on quantumissues, such as evidence from employment consultants and property surveyors.  Whilst âmainstreamâ medical expert evidence fromorthopaedic surgeons and neurologists continued to be readily admitted, a sea change was occurring with regards to âquasi-medicalâexpert evidence from occupational therapists, rehabilitation consultants, physiotherapists, speech therapists, nursing consultantsand care managers.  In <i>Wong Hin Pui v Mok Ying Kit and anor.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3"><b>[3]</b></a></i> Seagroatt J said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â56. I cannot stress too strongly that this court is aware of the excessive, expensive and wholly unjustified use of occupationaltherapists in personal injury cases. In the vast majority of cases their reports state no more than is apparent to any judge withany understanding of the effect of serious injuries on any human being. Essential matters are within the cognisance of orthopaedicand neurological consultants. Any practical problems can adequately be dealt with by rehabilitation consultants and nursing advisers.</p>        <p class="quote">â¦</p>        <p class="quote">58. In this case I read reports from neurologists, psychiatrists and occupational therapists totalling 170 pages, quite apart fromthe essential reports, one of which I ordered as a joint report.  Some of these reports were in any event premature. This aspectof the case is a classic example of what this court sees as an unrestrained use of resources with little regard for the cost involved. As a consequence a significant amount of time and effort has been wasted.  The trial lasted at least two days more than was necessary. If the Plaintiff is required to meet any of the costs to which I have referred, out of his damages, then that would be wholly unwarranted. In my view they fall to be paid out of the costs of the legal advisers<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> who failed to exercise that judgment, where they are not met by the unsuccessful party.  The time is now ripe for the court to exercisea controlling hand far earlier than I thought was necessary if practitioners are not prepared to look hard and fast at the case ofthe person they represent and ask themselves â âWhat do we really need in the way of expert evidence, and what can we ask theDefendants to agree at an early stage?â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The courtâs control over medical evidence in personal injury cases was evolving long before the courtâs case management powerswere created by the CJR.  The evolutionary process, initiated by the need to ensure cost efficient and speedy resolution of personalinjury litigation, resulted in the adoption of a joint approach, both at the pre-action and at the post-writ stages, of obtainingand deploying expert medical evidence for use at trial.  The tri-partite benefit of such an approach, to the courts and to the partiesconcerned, cannot be denied.  As Fung J explained in <i>Mok King Sun v Turn Round Company Limited<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5"><b>[5]</b></a></i> at Â§26, a joint approach has the following virtues :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1) avoidance of different observations on different occasions, or disputes on observations under single examination;</p>        <p class="quote">(2) discussions amongst the experts to narrow down the issues;</p>        <p class="quote">(3) specifying matters agreed and matters not agreed and the reasons for any non-agreement;</p>        <p class="quote">(4) avoidance of numerous supplemental reports commenting on the reports of the other side;</p>        <p class="quote">(5) minimizing the need to call the experts to deal with matters which could have been dealt with under (1) to (4) above.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The adoption of the joint approach, even before the implementation of the CJR, can be seen from the decisions of Fung J at <i>Cheng Lung Fong v Mitoyo Hong Kong Limited</i> (HCPI63/2007, 22 September 2009), <i>Limbu Bhimraj v All Clad Asia Limited</i> (HCPI603 &amp; 606/2007, 4 November 2008), <i>Wong Kam Lee v Dragages et Travaux Publics (HK) Limited</i> (HCPI 824/2004, 17 November 2008) as well as in <i>Mok King Sun v Turn Round Company Limited</i> quoted above.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The adoption of the joint approach can also be seen in the decisions of HH Judge Marlene Ng in in <i>Ansar Mohammad v Global Legend Transportation Limited</i> (DCEC1090/2006, 8 May 2007), <i>Lau Lai Shan v Hospital Authority</i> (DCEC784/2007, 29 February 2008), <i>Lee Sau Fat v F.H. Security Services Company Limited</i> (DCEC1720/2006, 6 July 2009), <i>Ip Sau Lin v Hospital Authority</i> (DCEC584/2007, 9 April 2009), <i>Wong Cheuk v Falcon Insurance Company (Hong Kong) Limited</i> (DCEC688/2008, 29 May 2009) and <i>Chan Lai Ying v A S Watson &amp; Co Ltd</i> (DCEC1767/2006, 31 July 2009).</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The enactment of the CJR did not result in a change to O.38, r.36 of the Rules of the High Court (âRHCâ).  However, after theenactment of the CJR, it is clear that the courtâs discretion, whether or not to grant leave to a party to adduce expert evidence,is to be exercised within the ambit of the courtâs management powers.  Those powers must be exercised in the light of the underlyingobjectives of the CJR, including the need to ensure the cost effectiveness of the proceedings; to ensure that the case is dealt withexpeditiously; to ensure reasonable proportionality having regard to the amount of money involved, the importance of the case, thecomplexity of the issues, and the financial position of each party; to ensure procedural economy in the conduct of the proceedings;and to ensure fairness between the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The courts recognise that the primary aim of its case management powers is to secure the just resolution of the dispute in accordancewith the substantive rights of the parties.  However, the substantive rights of the parties to a personal injury action do not includea legal right to call experts of their choice.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The expert evidence can only be adduced with leave of the court and, in deciding whether or not to grant leave, the court must ensurethat such evidence is admitted only if it is likely to be of real assistance to the determination of the issues, and that it is adducedin the most effective and economic way consistent with the objectives of the CJR.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In this regard, I echo the observations of <i>Evans-Lombe J in Barings PLC v Coopers &amp; Lybrand (No.2)</i> [2001] Lloyds Report Bank 85:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â45. Expert evidence is admissible â¦. in any case where the court accepts there exists a recognised expertise governed by recognisedstandards and rules of conduct capable of influencing the courtâs decision on any of the issues which it has to decide and thewitness to be called satisfies the court that he has a sufficient familiarity with and knowledge of the expertise in question torender his opinion potentially of value in resolving any of those issues. Evidence meeting this test can still be excluded by thecourt if the court takes the view that calling it will not be helpful to the court in resolving any issue in the case justly. Suchevidence will not be helpful where the issue to be decided is one of law or is otherwise one on which the court is able to come toa fully informed decision without hearing such evidence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Court of Appeal in <i>Mann v Messrs. Chetty &amp; Patel (a firm)</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2000/267.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] EWCA CIV 267</a> proposed 3 questions that ought to be asked before deciding to allow expert evidence :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(a) how cogent the proposed expert evidence will be;</p>        <p class="quote">(b) how helpful it will be in resolving any of the issues in the case; and</p>        <p class="quote">(c) how much it will cost and the relationship of that cost to the sums at stake.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Chu J, as she then was, referred to <i>Barings PLC v Coopers &amp; Lybrand</i> and concluded, in <i>Wong Hoi Fung v. American Assurance Co. (Bermuda) Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%203%20HKLRD%20507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 3 HKLRD 507</a>, that the expert evidence must be reasonably required to resolve the issues before the court before leave would be granted to adduceit.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In summary, the expert evidence must be in a recognised discipline, reasonably required to enable the court to resolve the issuesin dispute, and proportionate.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  However, even if a <i>prima facie</i> case is made out for the admission of expert evidence, in every case, the court must also have regard to other relevant circumstances,such as the potential disruption to the trial, the prejudice to the other parties, and the explanation offered by the applicant incases where a late application is made for expert evidence to be adduced.  These matters have to be considered and weighed in thelight of and against the underlying objectives of the CJR: to ensure cost effectiveness and economy, expedition, proportionality,and fairness between the parties.  Ultimately, the court strives to do justice between the parties and, in cases where the courtpermits the parties to call expert evidence, the court strives to ensure a level playing field with fair access to proper expertsfor all parties.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  These objectives and the joint approach are reflected in the protocol for commissioning expert reports set out in section I of thePersonal Injuries List Practice Direction PD18.1.  Of particular relevance are the general provisions Â§Â§69-71, reproduced as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â69. As a general rule, leave of the court or consent of the parties is required before any expert evidence can be adduced at trial.</p>        <p class="quote">70. A party who obtains expert evidence before obtaining leave, other than from a single joint expert or pursuant to joint examinationand joint expert report with the expert(s) of the other party or parties, does so at his own risk as to costs and/or eventual refusalof leave to adduce such expert evidence.</p>        <p class="quote">71. As soon as it is realized there exists a need or an anticipated need for adducing expert evidence at trial or if parties failedto reach agreement on arranging joint examination and/or compiling joint expert report by the partiesâ respective experts beforeor after the commencement of proceedings or if no agreement can be reached as to directions on obtaining expert evidence and/or forpermission to adduce expert evidence, a party shall apply (by <i>inter partes</i> summons or by restoring the case for Check List Review Hearing) or the parties shall jointly apply (by Consent Summons to expediteor restore the hearing of the Check List Review) to the PI Master as soon as possible upon the commencement of or in the course ofproceedings, as the case may be, for directions on obtaining expert evidence and/or for permission to adduce expert evidence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  It must be emphasised that the courts do not purport to control or inhibit a partyâs right to consult experts and to obtain reportsfrom them.  The party with means may do so.  The party, not under disability, who has obtained an interim payment, may deploy partof that payment towards the costs of such experts.  In a recent case involving a plaintiff who was either in a permanent vegetativestate or minimally conscious state, I indicated that I might be willing to grant leave for part of the interim payment received tobe used in obtaining a functional MRI report to ascertain the true level of consciousness of the plaintiff.  In a legal aided case,such as the present one, the plaintiff or his legal advisers may be able to persuade the Director of Legal Aid to grant permissionto obtain an expertâs report.  However, the point to emphasise, as reflected in Â§70 of PD18.1, is that, whilst a party is freeto obtain his own expert report, he does so at his own risk as to costs and possible refusal of leave to adduce such expert evidence.In addition, parties need to know that non-compliance with PD18.1 and the pre-action protocol set out therein without good reasonmay result in adverse costs consequences and sanctions, including wasted costs orders<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Another point to emphasise is that the party who obtains an expertâs report, without agreement of the other party and withoutleave of court, runs the risk of disqualifying that expert from appointment by the court as the single joint expert. The risk maynot be high at the beginning of proceedings when the court, although refusing leave for the party to adduce his solo expert report,may be amenable, nevertheless, to grant leave for a joint examination to be carried out by the expert concerned in conjunction withthe expert nominated by the other party, and for a joint report to be prepared by them. However, if application is made, late inthe day and when trial is imminent, for expert evidence to be adduced, the court may refuse the application or may only allow iton the basis of a single joint expert being appointed.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Another point to note is that the party who obtains an expertâs report without agreement of the other party and without leaveof court runs the risk of losing his right to claim privilege over such a report, if leave is later granted to appoint the same expertas one of the 2 joints experts to examine the plaintiff and to report on the case.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  A detailed exposition on the protocol for commissioning expert reports, both at the pre-action stage and at the post-writ stage,is contained in the post-CJR decision of Master Marlene Ng in <i>Siu Fook Cheong v Siu Kwok Fai</i> (HCPI768/2009, 2 February 2010).  The judgment provides particular guidance on the proper approach to be adopted in commissioningexpert reports at the pre-action stage.  If pre-action communications do not result in agreed arrangements for single joint reportor joint expert medical examination and report, the intended plaintiff is entitled to commence legal proceedings forthwith, withoutrisk as to costs, and to issue an <i>inter partes</i> summons, as soon as possible after the commencement of proceedings, returnable before the PI Master, to seek directions on obtainingexpert medical evidence. Alternatively, the intended plaintiff can apply for the CLR hearing to be expedited for the same purpose.</p>    <p class="heading">Expert evidence from clinical psychologists or psychiatrists</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who has specialised in psychiatry.  He can prescribe drugs and admit people to hospital.  A clinicalpsychologist may have a doctorate degree but he does possess a medical degree.  He is trained to administer psychological tests buthe cannot perform physical examinations.  He cannot prescribe drugs and he cannot admit people to hospital.  Whilst a clinical psychologistcan carry out psychotherapy and can advise on the plaintiffâs need for psychotherapy, he cannot advise on drug therapy.  Wheredrug therapy is expected to play a role in the treatment of psychiatric injury, whether or not in conjunction with psychotherapy,expert opinion from a psychiatrist is preferable to opinion from a psychologist<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a>. Where a case involves the assessment of cognitive impairment, a report from a psychologist, who is trained to carry out a batteryof tests for such purpose, is to be preferred.  In the latter case, unless a single joint expert is to be appointed, it is preferablefor arrangements to be made for joint testing by the partiesâ respective psychologists.  As Deputy Judge Carlson noted in <i>Chu Man Ting v Kwan Kam Kei</i><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a>:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â33. The fact remains that these IQ readings, as both experts accept, are liable to be something of a movable feast depending onthe candidateâs performance on any given date.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  There appears to be a misconception that the courts will not readily grant leave for evidence from a psychiatrist or a psychologistto be adduced.  The law of negligence does not provide a remedy for distress which does not amount to a recognised psychiatric illness<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a>, unless the distress, anxiety or fear is accompanied by a physical injury.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a>  The courts award damages where a party has suffered a recognisable psychiatric illness over and above emotional distress and disquiet. The court will almost invariably require expert evidence to determine whether or not this is the case<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a>.  Even where it is not disputed that the plaintiff suffers from psychiatric illness, there may be a dispute as to causation: wasthe psychiatric illness caused or contributed to by the tort complained of.  A trial judge who has to determine this issue of causationmay need assistance from an expert in this field.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Indeed, in most cases, the need for psychiatric treatment or psychological counselling is apparent long before the commencementof proceedings. Inappropriate conduct or speech is noted by family members or recorded on the hospital records.  Prolonged sadness,excessive anxiety, unusual irritability and temper tantrums are all indicia of possible psychiatric illness.  These are often recognisedby treating doctors and nurses and the patient referred to a psychiatric unit, whether in-patient or out-patient, for assessmentand treatment.  Even if the hospital records or treating doctors and nurses make no mention of a plaintiffâs psychiatric illnessor possible psychiatric illness, orthopaedic or neurological experts examining a plaintiff in order to prepare expert medical reportson his physical condition will often recognise the presence of a psychological or psychiatric component and recommend that reportsbe obtained from relevant experts in that field.  Each case must depend on its own facts and a mere recommendation without supportingreasons by an expert from another field may be insufficient, but where the need for psychiatric or psychological evidence is clearand obvious, there can hardly be any realistic challenge to a request for relevant expert examination and reporting. </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In other cases, where there is no apparent indicia of a psychological component in addition to the physical injuries suffered bythe plaintiff, the request for leave to adduce evidence from a psychiatrist or a psychologist will need to be properly justified.Such justification may be provided by submitting a written note from the intended expert setting out brief reasons explaining whythe expert opinion is necessary in the particular case. However, for the reasons set out in Â§Â§18 and 19 above, a full medical examinationand report should not be commissioned without agreement from the other party or leave of court.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  If the request is made late in the day, or close to the commencement of trial, it is likely to be refused even if justified. AsBrooke LJ explained in <i>Baron v. Lovell</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%20PIQR%20P20" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] PIQR P20</a>, each party is afforded an opportunity by the rules to make a well informed valuation of the claim and a well informed <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A#p36" class="autolink_findacts">Part 36</a> offer (or, in Hong Kong, a sanctioned offer).  The regime simply will not work if the former latitude in serving late evidence isallowed to persist.  It is quite wrong for a trial to be delayed, and for the possibility of making an effective <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A#p36" class="autolink_findacts">Part 36</a> offer (or, in Hong Kong, a sanctioned offer) to be rendered nugatory, because of the late service of an expertâs report.</p>    <p class="heading">The present case</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  This is a medical negligence claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, the Secretary for Justice on behalf of The Secretary for Food and Health, in respect of the matters of complaint spanningfrom the period from 24 June 1990 to 19 December 1991 and against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the Hospital Authority, in respect of the matters complained of after 19 December 1991.  It is alleged that the plaintiffwas born at the Prince of Wales Hospital on 23 July 1990 with a normal Apgar score and that, on 24 July 1990, the plaintiff was misdiagnosedas suffering from transposition of great arteries (âTGAâ), and that the infant underwent unnecessary surgery on 26 July 1990when a balloon septostomy was performed.  The surgery created an atrial septal defect (âASDâ), commonly described as âa holein the heartâ.  Prior to its closure on 5 February 2003, it is alleged that the childâs normal growth and development was stuntedand it is further alleged that the plaintiff suffers from life-time disabilities, consequent upon the unnecessary surgery performedon 26 July 1990 and negligent treatment during the period from March 1991 to August 2002.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Substantial claims for damages had been advanced in the Revised Statement of Damages including a claim for future loss of earningswhich was pleaded in these terms :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIV. FUTURE LOSS OF EARNINGS</p>        <p class="quote">The Plaintiff is now aged 20. He is studying at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The Plaintiff is studying Chemicaland Environmental Engineering. He hopes this will lead to a B. Eng. Degree. The Plaintiffâs future career will be restricted andin particular:</p>		<blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a) His education progress was delayed and diminished because of his disabilities and the constant medical treatment.</p>        <p class="quote">(b) His future career prospects are limited by his physical problems and in particular chest pains on exertion and when under stress.</p>        <p class="quote">(c) His promotion prospects are reduced.</p>		</blockquote>        <p class="quote">On graduation, the Plaintiff can anticipate earnings in the region of HK$10,000 to HK$12,000 per month rising to about HK$30,000 permonth within 5 years. Were it not for his disabilities his future earnings within 5 years would at least HK$40,000. It is unlikelyhe will be able to move into a management role with much higher earning since his work experience will be more limited than ablebodied colleagues. Website pay analysis (USA) shows that higher salaries are about 60% higher than lower salaries in this field e.g.http://www.doe.mtu.edu/news/degree_Â­ worth.html. It is likely that the Plaintiff will be at the low end whereas were it not forhis disabilities he would be likely to be at the higher end. Were it not for the negligence of the 1<sup>st</sup> and/or 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants, their servants or agents, the Plaintiffâs choice of his future employment would not be constrained as it now is.</p>        <p class="quote">The Plaintiffâs choice of employment is limited. He will suffer significant loss of earnings. Additionally, in the future the Plaintiffwill be at risk on the labour market and more vulnerable in times of economic downturn or other events outside his control. In theevent that he loses his employment or otherwise seeks new employment, he will be at risk on the labour market.</p>        <p class="quote">The Plaintiffâs academic development has been stunted so he is precluded from high paid jobs requiring professional or other high-levelqualifications. He cannot perform any high paid jobs that involving large physical effort. His loss of earnings will be at leastHK$10,000 per month.</p>        <p class="quote">The appropriate multiplier is 20. The Plaintiffâs claim for loss of future earnings is:</p>        <p class="quote">HK$[10,000 (monthly loss) x 12 (months) x 20 (multiplier) x 1.05 (MPF)]</p>        <p class="quote">FUTURE LOSS OF EARNINGS               HK$2,520,000â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The proceedings were commenced on 18 December 2006 at which time the plaintiff was still an infant and he sued by his father andnext friend, Mr Fung Kwai Fuk. After his 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, the pleadings were amended to enable the plaintiff to sue as an adult person. </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Master Betty Kwan made orders at the Check List Review hearing on 24 July 2009, including an order that the medical expert on theissue of quantum be limited to a consultant in cardiology for each party.  Dr David Hu was nominated as the plaintiffâs expert,and Dr Ng Yin Ming as the expert of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants.  Directions were given by Master Kwan for their reports to be prepared and exchanged, and for supplementary reports tobe prepared and exchanged.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Since then, the matter came before Master Roy Yu once on 3 February 2010, and before Fung J on 11 March 2010 and 21 April 2010.On those occasions, there was no application for additional expert evidence on quantum to be adduced.  Nor was any such applicationmade before me when the matter came before me, on a case management conference, on 10 November 2010, and at the pre-trial reviewon 16 February 2011. I ordered that no further additional expert medical reports were to be obtained or adduced without leave ofthe PI Judge on the first occasion and, at the PTR on 16 February 2011, I ordered that Dr Hu and Dr Ng be called at trial to giveoral evidence, that no further or additional expert medical reports were to be obtained or adduced without leave of the PI Judge,and that the case be set down for trial in the fixture list commencing on 2 September 2011.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The plaintiffâs expert on liability and quantum is Dr Hu and the defendantsâ expert is Dr Ng. In his report on quantum dated19 August 2009, Dr Hu recorded the complaint that, from 1996 until after the corrective surgery, the child had repeated respiratorysymptoms of shortness of breath and suffered from edema, in particular in the lower limbs. His father recalled that he had difficultyfeeding the infant as compared with his sisters.  In 1996, the child was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital due to generalizedswelling, abdominal pain and skin rash.  Dr Hu had examined the plaintiff on 12 August 2009. He gave the appearance of being a nervousboy.  He had just finished his A-Level exams.  He complained of chest pains, for which he took painkillers prescribed by doctorsfrom Grantham Hospital, shortness of breath and inability to exercise or attend P.E. lessons since childhood.  He expressed a deepsuspicion and distrust of doctors.  Dr Hu noted that the plaintiffâs self confidence and the way he viewed himself appeared tobe low.  His exercise stress test showed that the plaintiff was in normal cardiac rhythm but that he was only able to run 10 minuteson the treadmill when he should have been able to run 14 minutes.  His heart rate had shot up to 190 beats per minute and he wasextremely exhausted.  Dr Hu expressed the opinion that his exercise function was comparable to that of a 50-year-old man.  He concludedthat the delayed surgical repair brought about consequential morbidity and âdeep psychological damage to this child and familyâand that the plaintiff suffered âphysical and psychological impairment during teenage years with possible long-term consequencesâ. </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Dr Hu stated that the current limitation of physical activity and the symptoms sensed by the plaintiff was likely to be a resultof long-term self, or parental, imposed limitation; initially out of necessity from symptoms of heart failure.  These limitationshad been imposed in the long term since childhood and it had been reinforced in his mind all his life that he could not run or exercise. This would take long-term psychological treatment to correct, together with exercise therapy.  Of prime importance was the needfor psychological assessment and rehabilitation by psychologists and physical exercise regime by a cardiac rehabilitation specialist. His physical and psychological impairment had to be assessed by these specialists.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Notwithstanding this clear call from the plaintiffâs cardiologist, no application to call a clinical psychologist was made untilrecently.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The defendantsâ expert, Dr Ng, prepared a report on quantum dated 3 November 2009 in which he stated that there could be psychologicalfactors affecting the plaintiffâs physical ability after 2005.  He was probably worried and distressed about his heart surgeryand the presence of a sternal scar.  He could not enjoy swimming like others because of the scar which he would consider to be unsightly. He might be affected by the frequent and multiple follow-up and investigations for the first year that he was seen at Grantham Hospital. He was old enough to understand the importance of the litigation and the imminent legal action and might worry about the resultsand compensation.  Dr Ng expressed the opinion that the plaintiff might have some psychological impact and disturbance with the surgery,the follow-ups, the scar, the attitude of the father and the litigation.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  In conclusion, Dr Ng expressed the opinion that there was no deleterious side effect of the ASD on the plaintiffâs health or lifestylebefore surgical repair as he had been enjoying good health with excellent growth (â97 percentile in weight and heightâ), andhe had been participating in competitive basketball games.  Dr Ng made the observation that there was no psychological impact onthe plaintiff, nor any record of such impact, before he reached the age of 15, not even after the operation performed on 5 February2003, but that it surfaced with the timing of the legal action.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Dr Hu and Dr Ng cannot give expert opinion evidence on the psychological condition of the plaintiff, but neither can they give anopinion on the cause of any psychological condition suffered by him.  In their joint report dated 31 May 2010, appears the followingstatement :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFrom conversing with the patient and his father, Dr Ng felt that there may be family pressure involved in influencing the behaviourof Fung Chun Man and his exercise ability. Whilst, Dr Hu felt that the inherent mistrust of the doctors made a tremendous influenceon the psychology of Fung Chun Man which may have long-term consequences.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Dr Hu was clearly right to call for specialist opinion from a psychologist to be obtained.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Mr Neal Clough, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff to seek leave to adduce the expert report of the clinical psychologist,Professor Peter Lee, complained that the underlying psychological problems should have been apparent over the years to the plaintiffâstreating doctors and that these should have been addressed.  Be that as it may, it is clear that both cardiologists alluded to theplaintiffâs suffering from a psychological condition, and that the plaintiffâs own expert expressly stated that an opinion shouldbe sought from a psychologist.  In the light of that, I do not understand the submission made to me by Mr Clough that there was nothingin the medical history to indicate any psychological overlay.  It may well be that, before he attained the age of 18, the plaintiffâscase was conducted by his father and instructions were given on the basis of the plaintiffâs physical complaints, and not his psychologicalproblems, and that, on attaining his majority, he was still influenced by his father.  Nevertheless, the need to obtain a psychologicalreport was apparent as early as Dr Huâs report dated 19 August 2009.  There was no good reason advanced to me to explain why itshould take almost 2 years to obtain legal aid approval and to make the present application.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The plaintiffâs claim for future loss of earnings as pleaded in his Revised Statement of Damages was pleaded without the benefitof Professor Leeâs psychological report.  To that extent, the inability to adduce his report is not fatal to the plaintiffâsclaim, although it must be recognised that the plaintiff would not have the benefit of Professor Leeâs opinion that the plaintiffâssocial awkwardness, distress of his body, together with chronic physical malaise, as well as pervasive sense of inferiority, willlikely impose a highly adverse impact on his future career attainment.  However, the absence of that opinion evidence at trial willnot prevent me from making my own assessment of the personality of the plaintiff, when he gives evidence before me, the factors thataffected his development into adulthood, and what adverse impact, if any, that development and his personality, would have on hisfuture career prospects.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Apart from supporting the claim for loss of earnings, Mr Clough said that he wished to rely on the expert opinion of Professor PeterLee at trial on the quantum of the PSLA award by demonstrating that the plaintiff suffered from an adjustment disorder, with mixedanxiety and depressive symptoms of a chronic nature, of mild to moderate intensity.  However, the absence of that opinion would notprevent me from taking into account the anxiety and emotional state of the plaintiff, suffered as a result of his heart conditionover the years of his growth from childhood to teenager to young adult, and his current emotional state, and to adjust the awardfor PSLA accordingly.  The court can award damages for anxiety and emotional distress consequent upon physical injury suffered bythe plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Clearly, absent the opinion of Professor Peter Lee, Mr Clough cannot advance a claim for the costs of counselling.  However, heacknowledged that the reason for the application was primarily to support the claims for future loss of earnings and PSLA, and notso much to claim the costs of counselling.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Mr Sakhrani appeared on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to oppose the application and his submissions were adopted by Mr Wong, who appeared for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  Mr Sakhrani submitted that the defendant opposed the granting of leave to adduce Professor Leeâs report as his viewswere highly contentious and disputed by the defendants.  The defendantsâ case was that this was a case of a son who was affectedby the actions of an obsessional father. There were controversial issues of causation and if expert evidence were to be admitted,to assist the court to decide to what extent the heart condition of the infant impacted on the plaintiff, as opposed to the influencesof his father and his own personality traits, the trial would be lengthened, even if such evidence could be adduced in time for trialcommencing in September 2011.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Whilst I am not sure that I agree with the submissions of Mr Sakhrani that this case was more appropriate for the opinion of a psychiatrist,as opposed to a psychologist, I certainly accept that a personâs motivation can have a huge impact on the results of psychologicaltests administered on him.  It is for this reason that such tests should be conducted jointly by the two psychologists nominatedby the parties, in cases where a single joint expert is not appointed.  That, however, is a luxury not available to the parties inthe present case without derailing the trial dates or, at the very least, prolonging the duration of trial.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  I also accept the submission of Mr Sakhrani that the need for a psychological expert report was apparent as early as 3 November2009 when Dr Ng prepared this report on quantum.  Indeed, the need for such evidence was apparent even earlier, when Dr Hu reportedon quantum in his report dated 19 August 2009. </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Balancing the impact of the psychological evidence on the quantum of the plaintiffâs claims; the cost implications of allowingProfessor Peter Leeâs report to be adduced and granting leave to the defendants to obtain a report from their nominated psychologist,with the consequent need for a further joint report from the psychologists; the likelihood of the trial dates being derailed by thisprocess or, at the very least, the trial being lengthened by the additional expert evidence which is likely to be contentious, particularlyas regards the cause of the plaintiffâs current psychological condition, if any, I had little hesitation, seeing that the applicationwas made so late in the day and at the eve of trial, to dismiss it.  In this case, the expert evidence sought to be adduced is froma recognised discipline.  The evidence is reasonably required to enable me to resolve the issues in dispute although, for the reasonsexplained above, I would not be seriously affected in my ability to resolve this case without that evidence. I am also prepared toaccept that the costs of adducing such evidence are proportionate, perhaps just barely proportionate, to the sums at stake. However,the potential disruption to the trial, and the absence of a good explanation for the late application, have led me conclude thatI ought to dismiss this application. </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  I cannot conclude this judgment without expressing my dissatisfaction at the fact that the full report of Professor Lee dated 25May 2011, and numbering some 40 pages, was submitted to me under cover of the plaintiffâs solicitorsâ letter dated 3 June 2011,less than a week before the hearing on 9 June 2011, as a âDraft Clinical Psychological Reportâ.  I cannot understand how thisreport can be described as a draft report when it contains a declaration signed by Professor Lee that he has compiled with in accordancewith the code of conduct for expert witnesses contained in Appendix D of O.38 of the RHC, and when he has appended his statementof truth at the end of the report stating that he believed that the facts stated in the report were true and the opinion expressedin it were honestly held. This is a solo expert report obtained by the plaintiff without the leave of the court, obtained in breachof the protocol for commissioning joint reports contained in PD18.1, and obtained in breach of my orders of 10 November 2010 and16 February 2011.  Calling it a draft report does not change its character.  If the plaintiff had not commissioned this full reportbut had simply relied upon Professor Peter Leeâs earlier letter of 7 April 2001, in which he justified the need for a comprehensiveassessment of the plaintiffâs psychological status and well being, and if the plaintiffâs solicitors had expedited the applicationbefore me for leave to obtain such evidence, I may well have been persuaded to appoint a clinical psychologist as a single jointexpert for all the parties, particularly given the earlier call for such evidence by Dr Hu.  At that time, an expedited single jointexpert, to be adduced without calling oral evidence, could have been obtained without disrupting trial dates.</p>	<p> </p>	<p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Mohan Bharwaney)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance<br />High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>	<p style="text-align:left">Mr Neal Clough, instructed by Messrs Henry H.C.
