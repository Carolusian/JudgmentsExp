The 1st Defendant, which I shall call Priway, is a limitedcompany and at all material times the owner of a residential flat being flat B, 26th Floor, Fu Shan Mansion, Koo Shan Terrace, 25Taikoo Shing Road, Taikoo Shing, Hong Kong. I shall call this property the flat. The 2nd Defendant whom I shall call Miss Cheungused to be one of two directors and one of two shareholders in Priway before resigning her office and disposing of her shares.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> This action stems from Mr and Mrs Tsui entering into a provisional agreement for the purchase of the flat from Priway. Miss Cheungheld herself out to be authorized to represent Priway, and signed the agreement as its authorized signatory. Subsequently Priwaythrough its majority shareholder refused to recognize the agreement as having been made by Miss Cheung without its knowledge or authority,and because by the time it came to learn of the agreement it had already entered into another agreement for sale to a third party.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Deprived of their right to complete the purchase Mr and Mrs Tsui by this action are now suing Priway for the loss suffered, namelythe difference between the agreed sale and purchase price and the value of the flat on the due date for completion. In the alternative,in the event that Miss Cheung is found to have acted without Priway's authority whilst holding herself out to have it, they are suingher for breach of warranty in the sum total of their losses occasioned thereby.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Priway was prevented from performing the agreement to sell the flat to the third party because Mr and Mrs Tsui registered copiesof their agreement and the writ in this action against the title, which registration continues to this day. Priway by its defaultwas liable in damages in a suit brought by the third party purchaser and has suffered further loss by being denied the right to resellthe flat. It counterclaims for the losses occasioned thereby.</p>    <p class="heading">History</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The story begins in the evidence of Mr Patrick Tang (Mr Tang) who is by primary occupation a merchant of footwear. He was approachedby a friend in the trade, Miss Cheung, who proposed to him that they join forces in property investment. He agreed. Through his accountantsthey acquired, in March 1995, the shares in Priway, then a shelf company, increased the capital to $10,000 and allotted themselveshalf each. Miss Cheung was appointed a director, and a secretarial company, controlled by Mr Tang's accountants and committed toact on his instructions, was appointed the other director. Miss Cheung found a suitable property to buy and so it was that in March1995 Priway became the owner of the flat, bought for $3.78m. Mr Tang says he put up all the share capital and advanced to Priwaythe balance required to complete the purchase. Miss Cheung apparently had no funds to contribute although she promised to do so inthe fullness of time.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> I digress here to say that Miss Cheung neither filed a witness statement nor chose to attend the trial and give evidence; althoughrepresented at the outset she chose to discharge her solicitors before the trial date. Thus I have only Mr Tang's word on Priway'ssituation as I have just described. Having said that I have no reason to doubt what he has told me.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> I return to the history. In June 1995 Miss Cheung negotiated a two year tenancy of the flat to run from July of that year. In hercapacity as director she signed the tenancy agreement for Priway in the office of the real estate agent through whom the lettingwas negotiated, a Mr Joe Wong of Dynamic Property Consultants Limited (Dynamic). Rent receipts evidencing payment of the monthlyrent reveal that the first, dated 15 June 1995 was signed by Miss Cheung, under a chop marked "Priway Investments Limited - authorizedsignatory". Those for the months to November 1995 have not been produced. But on Mr Tang's account they probably were signed in thesame way given that Miss Cheung was until then in charge of collecting and banking the rent cheques in Priway's account. From December1995 the receipts was signed under a chop marked "for and on behalf of Priway Investment Ltd - authorized signature" by Mr Tang.This came about because in November 1995 Miss Cheung having been unable to raise capital being her share of the investment electedto pull out. She resigned from her office of director and assigned all but one of her shares to Mr Tang. His accountants chose anothersecretarial company to take the remaining share and Miss Cheung's seat on the board. Thus, ostensibly, Mr Tang became in sole controlof Priway. Miss Cheung handed to him a green box in which she had kept the memorandum of association, minute book, bank book, chequebook, seal and chop. Subsequently she gave him the book of receipt forms she had been using in the rent collection. These had beenchopped in advance in the manner I have described already. I mention here that the chop used differed in form from that returnedto Mr Tang amongst the company records in the green box, and is significant in that the word "Investment" in the name was wronglyin the singular. This discrepancy escaped Mr Tang's attention, however, until a dramatic chain of events I shall come to soon.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> In late 1996 the tenant asked Mr Tang to be released early from his tenancy. Mr Tang acceded to the request and on behalf of Priwayexecuted a surrender, which formality was minuted in the minute book. Then having checked the newspapers and noted a rise in thereal estate market, he decided to list the flat for sale, with a target in mind of $5m.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The circumstances giving rise to the role Miss Cheung played from this point on are central to the issues before me. It is Mr Tang'saccount that because he was busy at the time and lived some distance from Taikoo Shing and because Miss Cheung lived handily andwanted to earn some pin money she should approach various agents in the area and list the flat with them and, if necessary, introduceany who found a buyer to the tenant and the flat. For this he promised to pay her 1/2% of the price if a sale was achieved. I haveno version of Miss Cheung before me, although in her pleadings she claimed that Mr Tang had asked her to do much more, namely, toactually sell the flat on Priway's behalf.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In the event Dynamic was one of the real estate companies with whom Miss Cheung listed the flat. Coincidentally, the same Mr Wongwho had handled the tenancy came to show Mr Tsui through on 27 November 1996. He was told the asking price was $4.6m and he expressedinterest. Mr Wong took him back to the flat on 29 November, this time with his wife and cheque book. On their account Miss Cheungwas present when they arrived. Mr Wong introduced her as the owner but she corrected him by saying in fact the owner was a limitedcompany but she represented it and was authorized to act on its behalf. She produced a Priway chop. It matched the one used to chopthe rent receipts Mr Tang had been signing, with "Investments" incorrectly missing the second "s". Mr Wong told the Tsuis that MissCheung was an old customer who had on an earlier occasion signed the tenancy agreement for and on behalf of the owner which was infact true. Mr and Mrs Tsui were keen to buy. There was some haggling but Miss Cheung held firm to her price. Mr Tsui offered $4.57m,completion on 1 March 1997, conditional upon their obtaining mortgage approval by 2 December. Miss Cheung made a telephone call asif to take instructions, for when she hung up she agreed to that price and those terms. They all retired to Dynamic's office andthere a provisional agreement incorporating the agreed terms was prepared and signed. Miss Cheung using her Priway chop signed asauthorized signatory. Mr Tsui wrote a cheque in favour of Priway for the initial deposit of $50,000 which Mr Wong was to hold unbankedpending the outcome of their approach to their bank for mortgage assistance.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> On 2 December the parties met again at the flat. When Mr and Mrs Tsui arrived with Mr Wong, Miss Cheung was already there and therewere also other people apparently inspecting it. The Tsuis had been treated favourably by their bank earlier that day and they wereable to announce that the agreement was now unconditional. Miss Cheung told the others the flat was now sold and they left. Onceagain the parties went down to Dynamic's office to complete the paper work and payment and receipt of the deposit. But once thereMiss Cheung, without warning, tore up the agreement. When asked why she said nothing. She was ushered into another room by Mr Wongwhere she spoke to Mr Wong and his manager, a Mr Yu. Mr Wong emerged to tell Mrs Tsui that she had said she regretted selling attoo low a price but had been persuaded to restore the deal if the vendor's share of the real estate commission could be reduced by$10,000. The Tsuis, to preserve the deal, agreed to increase their share to make up the shortfall. A fresh provisional agreementwas prepared, this time containing no conditional clause and adjusting the parties' share of commission to be paid. Miss Cheung signedas before, using the chop. Mrs Tsui signed for herself and her husband and handed to Miss Cheung a deposit cheque for $120,000 madepayable to Priway. Mr Wong handed back the cheque for $50,000 now superseded.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> And so, it seemed, the deal was done. Mr and Mrs Tsui handed their copy of the provisional agreement to their solicitors and anticipatedcompletion and a move into their new home come the following March.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> But it was not to be. Miss Cheung wrote to Dynamic the following bombshell, which I repeat verbatim:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"DATE: 7 DECEMBER 1996</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">DYNAMIC PROPERTY CONSULTANTS LTD.<br />        SHOP 31, 4/F KORNHILL<br />        PLAZA SOUTH QUARRY BAY<br />        HONG KONG</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote"><em>ATTN: MR JOE WONG</em></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">DEAR SIR</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote"><em>RE: 26TH FLOOR FU SHAN MANSION, TAIKOSHING, HK</em></p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">I REGREAT TO INFORM YOU THAT THE PRELIM CONTRACT FOR THE SALES OF ABOVE PROPERTY IS NOT VALID AS THE OWNER REFUSED TO RELEASE THELETTER OF AUTHORIZATION, AND THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE BUYER'S CHEQUE FOR HK$120,000.00 BEING PAYMENT FOR THE INITIAL DEPOSIT, WHICHIS RETURNING HEREWITH FOR YOUR DISPOSAL BY DHL B/L NO.

He is adamant that Miss Cheung's role was limited to listing the flat with suitableagents and assisting in showing off the flat to interested buyers. Since retiring from Priway she had no authority to represent itas she had when a director. She had no authority to sign any agreement on its behalf or receive a deposit cheque. Had that been sothere would have been a minute to record that but there was none. He had no idea that she had in fact signed an agreement on 29 November.He does not remember if he received the telephone call from her on that date. But it is highly unlikely given that his China Re-entryPermit discloses that he took one of his regular visits to the Mainland on that date to visit one or more of the factories he controlsthere. On such occasions he leaves early and returns late and does not take his mobile phone which cannot be reached there. But evenhad she communicated an offer he would not have authorized her to sell at $4.57m. Apart from the fact that there was to be no authorityto sell, the figure was far below his target price. He had no idea of events of 2 December and in particular that she had signedanother agreement for Priway and collected a deposit from the purchasers. In fact, bizarrely, Miss Cheung telephoned him on 4 Decemberto say that one of the agents with whom she had listed the flat, not being of Dynamic, had a buyer keen to pay $4.8m. The upshotof that was that he agreed to be taken by her to the agent's office where he and the buyer, a Miss Florence Lee (Miss Lee), signeda provisional agreement at $4.8m. Throughout Miss Cheung was present, but she said not one word about her commitment with Mr andMrs Tsui entered into two days before. He was not to hear about that until she telephoned him a few days later and told him as suchby which time it was too late to ratify and he declined to do so. He told Miss Cheung to return the deposit cheque. When in due courseshown a copy of that agreement he noticed, for the first time, the chop used with the incorrect spelling of Priway's name. Thoughhe came to realize the inscription matched that on the receipt forms he had been signing he had not seen the chop before nor beenaware of its existence. He had believed all along there was only one; that returned in the green box. He had not authorized thatanother chop be made, or that it be retained by Miss Cheung.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> But Mr and Mrs Tsui were not prepared to accept that Miss Cheung had no authority to sign their agreement on behalf of Priway andwere not prepared to release it from its obligations. They took advice and issued a writ claiming wrongful repudiation, seeking specificperformance or damages in lieu. Copies of the agreement and writ were registered against the flat's title. That was to have drasticconsequences, for it effectively scuppered Priway's sale to Miss Lee, and has prevented any subsequent sale being considered. MissLee sued Priway in damages and was awarded summary judgment which was ultimately settled at $1.1m inclusive of costs. Priway incurredits own costs in the litigation of $300,360.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The final chapter in the saga is that the Tsuis appointed valuers to ascertain the value of the flat as at their agreed date of completionto ascertain the extent of their loss. Priway did likewise to establish today's value for the same purpose. The valuers came up with$5.8m and $2.8 respectively, which highlights the dramatic slump that the market was to suffer in between. Neither figure was challenged.</p>    <p class="heading">The claims</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The Tsuis no longer sue for specific performance having now bought another flat. They seek from Priway damages, being the differencebetween the contract price and the flat's worth at the date of completion, namely $1.23m, interest and costs. In the alternativein the event that Miss Cheung is found to have acted without authority in signing for Priway they sue her for breach of warrantyin the sum total of what they may be required to pay on Priway's counterclaim and additional loss they have suffered.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Priway denies being in breach of a contract it was not party to. It counterclaims for immediate cancellation of the registered writ,the $1.1m it was required to pay Miss Lee, the costs of that action and interest. In addition, by virtue of its inability to sellthe flat because of the encumbrance on title it seeks as further damages the difference between what Miss Lee had contracted to payand what the property is now worth, namely $2m and costs.</p>    <p class="heading">Liability</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The case of Mr and Mrs Tsui against Priway stands or falls on whether they can establish that Miss Cheung as agent was authorizedto sell the flat for and on behalf of Priway the principal.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The general rule is that a principal is bound by (and, of course, entitled to the benefit of) a contract made by his agent on hisbehalf within the scope of his actual authority. That authority may be directly pronounced by the principal, or be established bywords or conduct by the principal whereby he represents to a third party that the agent has his authority. This latter doctrine isknown as apparent or ostensible authority, and includes those cases where the principal allows another who is not his agent at allto appear to be his agent, and where a person who is his agent within certain limits to appear to have more authority than he actuallyhas, and where the principal allows it to appear that a person who used to be his agent continues to have his authority when in factsuch authority has been terminated.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> The question of whether the person held out to represent and bind the principal has the necessary authority is one of fact. A statementby such person that he is an agent with authority does not of itself give him authority, although such announcement can be prayedin aid of the claim that he has it.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> A contract for the disposition of property is bound by the same rules. Chitty on Contracts, twenty eighth edition, at para. 32-075states:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"(f) <em>Disposition of Property through Agent</em></p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">32-075  <em>Disposition of property by agent.</em> A disposition of property made by an agent acting within his actual authority obviously transfers the property, in accordance withgeneral principles. And a disposition made by an agent acting within his apparent authority will likewise be effective: if the doctrineof apparent authority is based on estoppel, the estoppel has here an unusually wide effect, for it operates as against all the world.The principal must have made a representation as to the agent's authority to the third party or to a group of third parties, or havebeen negligent in circumstances in which he owed a duty of care ......"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> So, what of the facts in this case?</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> In considering the evidence adduced by Mr and Mrs Tsui and Mr Tang by their adopting their witness statements in the usual way andsupplementing the same from the witness box, I am bound to say that I found them all to be witnesses of the truth not given to fabricateor dress up their respective accounts. Any lapse in accuracy was I believe a lapse of memory and incidental only to the issues Ihave to decide. I am satisfied that they are honest people and were doing their best to remember and recount events which gave riseto this litigation.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> There is no direct evidence that Mr or Mrs Tsui had notice of actual authority acquired by Miss Cheung from Priway to sell the flat.But they were given every reason to suppose she had apparent authority to commit Priway to a sale on 29 November and 2 December.First of all she was at the flat, waiting to receive them, when they called with the agent to inspect it. She told them she representedthe owner, whom she named as a private company, and had with her what had the appearance of the vendor's chop. The agent, Mr Wong,assured them he knew her from a past transaction, namely the tenancy, when as an authorized signatory of the landlord, now vendor,she had signed the tenancy agreement. When the Tsuis presented their offer it seems she made a telephone call as if to discuss thesame or get instructions.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> On the other hand I have Mr Tang's account that the role Miss Cheung was to play was, for the consideration of 1/2% commission, tointroduce agents to the flat and assist with inspections and no more than that. Had she been given the authority to commit therewould have been a minute to record that, as there had been when she signed the tenancy agreement on Priway's behalf. There was nosuch minute. However she presented herself, she had no authority to commit Priway. He had not exhibited any conduct to suggest otherwise.As far as he was aware she had returned all the company documents and records, chops and so on when she resigned as a director andassigned her shares; he had no idea she had in her possession a chop purportedly of Priway or indeed that there was such a chop.And finally, Miss Cheung's extraordinary behaviour in tearing up an agreement before entering into another one on terms only slightlymore favourable to the vendor should have put Mr and Mrs Tsui on enquiry as to her authorized status.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The burden is on Mr and Mrs Tsui to establish that Miss Cheung acted with the authority of Priway to commit Priway to the agreementthey entered into. They have not, in my view, satisfied that burden. There was neither actual nor apparent authority. The resultas I find is that Priway was not a party to the agreement and not bound to perform as if it was. Thus the claim against Priway fails.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> I come now to the counterclaim.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Mr and Mrs Tsui's election to register the encumbrances as they did was to protect what they believed, presumably on advice, weretheir rights to the flat or damages in lieu. As I have now found they have not and never have had such rights this registration amountedto a wrongful act, for it denied Priway the right to dispose of its flat. By such registration they wrongfully interfered with Priway'stitle.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> As a consequence Priway has suffered loss. First it was prevented from performing its contract with Miss Lee, which ultimately renderedPriway liable to satisfy the judgment debt in favour of Miss Lee and the costs of the action she mounted. Secondly, the ongoing existenceof the encumbrance on title has prevented Priway mitigating its loss by selling after that. The market has slumped and the flat isnow worth substantially less. That is further loss.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> The consequences of the wrongful act committed by Mr and Mrs Tsui is that they are, as I find, obliged to make good all of this loss.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> What of Miss Cheung?</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The rule is that one who expressly or impliedly warrants that he has the authority of another is liable in a contract for breachof warranty of authority to any person to whom the warranty is made and who suffers damage by acting in the faith of it, if in facthe had no such authority.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Miss Cheung pleaded she had authority to commit Priway to the agreement with Mr and Mrs Tsui. But as I have indicated, that was illusory.It is hard to know why she performed as she did; suffice to say it was a performance which justified Mr and Mrs Tsui believing theywere dealing with a bona fide agent with authority, as a direct result of which they signed the agreement for the purchase of theirnext family home.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> Beyond question I am satisfied that Miss Cheung warranted that she was authorized to sign on Priway's behalf when she had no suchauthority, in breach of that warranty. Mr and Mrs Tsui having entered into the agreement in reliance of that warranty and by reasonof being unable to enforce the terms of the agreement have suffered consequential loss, for which, to the extent permitted by lawas I shall come to, Miss Cheung must now be held liable.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The consequences of my rulings on liability are regrettably far reaching, exacerbated by a violent swing in property values duringthe course of this litigation. It does not escape me that this is a nightmare result for Mr and Mrs Tsui, whose only default wasthat they believed, as they had every entitlement to, that they were signing an ordinary agreement to buy a home. With perhaps thebenefit of hindsight it calls to question why enquiry was not made of Priway to show why Miss Cheung had no authority before theyissued the writ; and, further, the wisdom of registering a lis pendens against the title of the subject property in a volatile marketlike Hong Kong's; I shall say no more than that.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> It will be of small comfort to Mr and Mrs Tsui that they will have judgment in their favour against Miss Cheung given the uncertaintyof her whereabouts and circumstances.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Be that as it may it is now my duty to work out who owes what to whom.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> First, the counterclaim.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Mr and Mrs Tsui are liable to meet Priway's loss consequential upon its inability to complete with Miss Lee or thereafter sell theflat. This amounts to the settled final figure after judgment and costs, in all $1,400,360. There will be an award of interest onthis amount from the date of payment. The additional loss is the difference between what Miss Lee would have paid and the flat'scurrent worth, $2m. there will be a further order that the copy agreement and writ registered at the Land Registry Office be vacated.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Next, the Tsuis' claim against Miss Cheung.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> The general rule in determining the quantum for breach of warranty of authority is that the party relying on the warranty is entitledto recover the difference in worth between his position had the contract been one he could enforce and his position by virtue ofthere being in fact no enforceable contract.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> I quote from McGregor on Damages, 16th edition at para. 1308: Lord Esher MR put the measure for breach of warranty of authority conciselyin <strong>Firbank's Executors v.

THE RULE AS TO AVOIDABLE LOSS: NO RECOVERY<br />    FOR LOSS WHICH THE PLAINTIFF<br />    OUGHT TO HAVE AVOIDED</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">295 The extent of the damage resulting from a wrongful act, whether tort or breach of contract, can often be considerably lessenedby well-advised action on the part of the person wronged. In such circumstances the law requires him to take all reasonable stepsto mitigate the loss consequent on the defendant's wrong, and refuses to allow him damages in respect of any part of the loss whichis due to his neglect to take such steps. Even persons against whom wrongs have been committed are not entitled to sit back and sufferloss which could be avoided by reasonable efforts or to continue an activity unreasonably so as to increase the loss. This well-establishedrule finds its most authoritative expression in the speech of Viscount Haldane L.C. in the leading case of <em>British Westinghouse Co. v. Underground Ry</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1912%5d%20AC%20673" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1912] AC 673</a> at p. 689 where he said:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">"The fundamental basis is thus compensation for pecuniary loss naturally flowing from the breach; but this first principle is qualifiedby a second, which imposes on a plaintiff the duty of taking all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss consequent on the breach,and debars him from claiming any part of the damage which is due to his neglect to take such steps."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> In practical terms could the Tsuis have mitigated their loss?</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> The simplest and most effective way would have been to purchase another comparable home in Taikoo Shing. Their own valuer put theflat's value on the date of completion at $5.8m. Had they gone back to the market it is likely within a complex the size of TaikooShing they would have found a comparable alternative at no more than that price.
