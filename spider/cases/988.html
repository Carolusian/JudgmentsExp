After over 28 years of service,he was found guilty on 2 counts of disciplinary offences on 27 June 1994 by a disciplinary tribunal. For the first count of neglectof duty contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/232A/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 3(2)(h)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/232A" class="autolink_findacts">Police (Discipline) Regulations</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232">Cap.232</a> (the Regulations) , the applicant was awarded the penalty of a severe reprimand on 27 June 1994. For the second count ofconduct calculated to bring the public service into disrepute contrary to regulation 3 (2)(m) of the Regulations, he received thepenalty of reduction in rank and dismissal from the force. As the penalty in respect of the second count was beyond the jurisdictionof the Adjudicating Officer presiding over the tribunal, the applicant was referred to a Senior Police Officer on 12 July for impositionof the said penalty. The findings and awards of the tribunal and the Senior Police Officer were confirmed by the Force DisciplineOfficer on 22 September 1994. The applicant's appeal to the Commissioner of Police was dismissed and by a memorandum dated 27 October1994 the applicant was advised of such confirmation and he was dismissed from the force with effect from 1 November 1994.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Pursuant to the applicant's application dated 17 November 1994, leave was granted to apply for judicial review of the tribunal'sdetermination of 27 June 1994.</p>    <p class="heading">Count One</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> On 14 September 1992 the complainant, a housewife aged 44, reported a case of burglary at her flat with cash and jewellery stolen.The applicant then came to her flat to conduct investigation into the case. Thereafter, the applicant made telephone calls to heron a number of occasions and invited her to go out with him. On 20 September 1992, the complainant's flat was burgled again and apair of earrings stolen. The complainant alleged that the applicant advised her not to report the second burglary to the police andsimply treat the earrings as part of the property stolen in the first burglary. Such an advice by a police officer, if proved, wouldbe a neglect of duty contrary to regulation 3(2)(h) of the Regulations.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The applicant's case is that the complainant telephoned him and told him about the second burglary and the stolen earrings. He saidshe informed him that a report of the burglary and stolen earrings had already been made to the police and that officers had alreadycome around to her flat. He alleged she further told him that she would not want to make any further statement as the stolen propertyin the first burglary had not been recovered yet. His defence on count one is a complete denial of the accusation.</p>    <p class="heading">Count Two</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> On 24 September 1994, the complainant alleged that the applicant telephoned her and insisted that he would come to her flat to collectthe sales memos of her stolen jewellery despite her observation that such sales memos would not assist in the investigation of thecrime. Apprehending trouble, the complainant alleged, she telephoned her godfather and her female cousin advising them that the applicantwould be coming to her flat at about noon and asked them to come to keep her company. Neither could come to her assistance as a resultof other commitments. However, the cousin said she would telephone the complainant every 5 minute. The complainant alleged that afterthe applicant arrived at her flat at about noon , he made advances to her. She said the complainant massaged her left arm and shoulders.She did not object initially, but after a couple of minutes she did ask him to stop. She said when she asked him to leave he manhandledher to the bedroom and forced her onto the bed. She struggled without success and the applicant touched her pubic area over her underpantsand told her he wanted to kiss that part of her body. She ultimately managed to escape. When the applicant left he did not ask forthe sales memos he said he was coming to collect. The complainant alleged that immediately after the applicant had left, she madetelephone calls to her godfather and cousin about the incident. The cousin confirmed receiving a call at around mid-day that dayfrom the complainant. She found the complainant to be emotional and angry when she told her about the assault.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The applicant's case is again a complete denial of the incident. He said he was working in the police station during the morningof that day. He went out for lunch at about 12:35 pm. He said he was walking down Lockhart Road at about 12:50 pm when he had a chancemeeting with the complainant. He told the complainant that it would help if the sales memos of the stolen properties could be givento him. He alleged the complainant lost her temper and started to abuse him and the police force for not putting more effort intothe case. He said she complained of insomnia and depression as a result of the case. He said he then walked away from the complainantand returned to the police station without taking any lunch. The applicant's version of events prior to his departure from the policestation was confirmed by another police officer who gave evidence for the defence.</p>    <p class="heading">The Objections</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The applicant contends the Adjudicating Officer erred in the following respect :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) That he wrongly held that "<em>the fact that the Applicant's actions may have amounted to indecent assault or any other criminal offence is irrelevant to these proceedingsand not a matter for consideration</em>";</p>        <p>(ii) That he wrongly held that the standard of proof required was proof on a balance of probabilities;</p>        <p>(iii) That he gave the impression, as regards certain features of the evidence, that the applicant had the burden of establishingmaterial facts;</p>        <p>(iv) That he wrongly minimised the significance of the complainant's conviction for an offence of dishonesty;</p>        <p>(v) That he failed to appreciate the need to see whether corroborative evidence existed; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(vi) That he wrongly characterised the evidence of 2 supporting witness as being corroborative of the complainant.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Ground One</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The statement the applicant complains of was made by the Adjudicating Officer in the following context :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"Criminal nature of A) Charge</em></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">46. The Defence say that the A) charge '........ is, in fact, a case of 'Indecent Assault'. It is criminal ......" The defence quotearticle 10 of the Bill of Rights as an argument that the A) Charge should not be heard by a domestic tribunal. The defence are ofthe opinion that the Attorney General wrongly decided that the venue of trial for this case having considered the quality of theevidence to be inadequate for a criminal trial.</p>        <p class="quote">47. The Bill of Rights has no relevance to these domestic proceedings. The defaulter has not been charged with the criminal offenceof indecent assault, or anything similarly criminal. Whether the defaulter's action amount to indecent assault or any other criminaloffence is irrlevant (sic) to these proceedings and not a matter for consideration."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> It is the function of a court in a judicial review to supervise the exercise of quasi-judicial powers of the administration. However,in doing so, it is not the function of the court to subject a determination of a domestic tribunal to a lawyer's relentless knifein a judicial surgical dissection. The determination cannot be construed like a statute. Nor should it be subject to the punishmentof fine surgical analysis in isolated compartments. A statement made in a determination should not be segregated and be put to apatheticallyliteral construction <em>out of context</em>.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> This proper approach in the construction of a determination is clearly illustrated in <strong>A.G. v. Tsui Kwok Leung</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20HKLR%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 HKLR 40</a>, another judicial review of a determination of the police disciplinary tribunal. At page 43 of the report :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" As regards the Superintendent's findings the words impugned were :-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'The defence has not managed, in my view, to rebut the case presented by the prosecution.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The judge found that he thereby erred in his approach to the onus and consequentially to the standard of proof and showed that hedid not appreciate that it was for those who brought the charges to prove them and that no evidentiary burden rested on the defaulter.</p>        <p class="quote">Looking at the Superintendent's findings as a whole it is clear beyond a peradventure that on all material issues he accepted thetestimony of the prosecution witnesses and rejected that given by those called on behalf of the defaulter. Neither the Superintendentnor the Chief Superintendent were lawyers but would have had available to them the guidance as to burden and standard of proof appearingin paragraphs 16 to 18 of Annex J to the Police Discipline Manual. Like 'the Guide' referred to by Webster J, whose general conclusionswe do not accept, in <em>R v Home Secretary ex parte Tarrant</em>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%201%20QB%20251" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 1 QB 251</a> at p 284, it is a document warmly to be commended. With all respect to the judge who, like us, was working from the record, we construethe critical words, <em>in context</em>, as meaning no more than that the defence evidence had not caused the Superintendent to change the favourable view of the prosecutionwitness which, provisionally, he had formed." (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Furthermore, when reading a determination in its proper context it should always be borne in mind the specific circumstances andmatter that each statement was dealing with. The Adjudicating Officer was there dealing with a Bill of Rights argument based on theallegedly criminal nature of the charge. The defence insinuated that it was an abuse to charge the applicant in a domestic tribunalas a result of insufficient evidence for laying a criminal charge. The contention was that the applicant should have been prosecutedin a criminal court and not disciplined in a domestic tribunal. It was in this context that the Adjudicating Officer found the criminalnature of the complaint against him to be irrelevant as he was only facing the charge in a domestic disciplinary tribunal and notcharged with any criminal offence in a criminal court. Such a statement is a far crying from the alleged misapprehension on the relevanceof the criminal nature of the charge in relation to the standard of proof applicable. The Adjudicating Officer was not dealing withthe standard of proof in the quoted passage. The standard of proof was specifically dealt with by him separately in the subsequentparagraphs under another express heading. I am wholly satisfied that if the impugned statement is read in its proper context therecould be no room for any criticism.</p>    <p class="heading">Ground Two</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The standard of proof required of a police disciplinary tribunal has been the subject of quite frequent judicial consideration inrecent years. The contention that it should be on the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt had been advanced on behalfof applicants on many occasions. Such controversy has finally been put to rest by the Court of Appeal in <strong>Tsui Kwok Leung</strong>. It was a case involving identical charges as the present case though the particulars relied on differed considerably. The applicantwas alleged to have held on to the complainant's tie for an unduly long period of time and dragged him from the premises, and hadalso failed to identify himself and informed the complainant of the reason for his arrest as soon as practicable. The particularscomplained of would amount to a criminal offence of common assault. The Court of Appeal extensively reviewed the state of local,English and Privy Council authorities and concluded at pages 45-46 of the report that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" Generally in civil proceedings, which, in our opinion, must include those conducted within the parameters of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/232A" class="autolink_findacts">Police (Discipline) Regulations</a>, it remains good law that the civil standard of proof obtains albeit when considering, for example, an allegation of fraud, a higherdegree of probability will be required than when considering an allegation of negligence. The degree of probability, falling shortof satisfaction beyond all reasonable doubt, must be commensurate with the occasion even when the liberty of the subject is at risk.In cases of great gravity and in the realm of vendor and purchaser of land the civil standard may well approximate to the criminal.<em>R. v.

McAllister, a Scottish doctor, was facing charges of dishonesty in respect of a cheque before the Professional Conducts Committeeof the General Medical Council. It was held that in a charge of serious professional misconduct the conduct of the proceedings beforethe committee had to be fair to the doctor concerned, but it was unnecessary in all such proceedings for the onus and standards ofproof appropriate to a criminal trial to be applied, although it might be appropriate to do so if the charges against the doctorbeing considered by the committee related to incidents on which serious criminal charges could also have been based. After consideringthe dictum of Lord Lowry in <strong>Lanford v. General Medical Council</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20AC%2013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 AC 13</a> ( a decision the Court of Appeal in <strong>Tsui Kwok Leung</strong> refused to follow in preference to conflicting decisions in the unreported Privy Council case of <strong>Tarnesby v. GMC</strong>, PC App. No.21 if 1969, and <strong>Khawaja</strong>); Lord Jauncey delivering the judgment of the Committee said at page 399 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Their Lordships do not consider that the above dictum can be treated as having universal application in all cases arising beforethe committee. In charges brought against a doctor where the events giving rise to the charges would also found serious criminalcharges it may be appropriate that the onus and standards of proof should be those applicable to a criminal trial. However, therewill be many cases, where the charges which a doctor has to face before the committee could not be the subject of serious or anycriminal charges at all. The committee is composed entirely of medical man and women learned in their profession and to requiredthat every charge of professional misconduct has to be proved to them just as though they were a jury of laymen is, in their Lordships'view, neither necessary nor desirable. What is of prime importance is that the charge and the conduct of the proceedings should befair to the doctor in question in all respects."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The Committee was clearly of the view that the wide statement of Lord Lowry in <strong>Lanford</strong> that criminal onus and standard of proof applied to disciplinary proceedings conducted by the General Medical Council was a dictumthat would not have been couched in such wide terms had the relevant 1988 Rules been drawn to the attention of the Board. Secondly,the observation of the Committee in <strong>McAllister</strong> on the propriety of application of criminal onus and standards of proof to such medical disciplinary proceedings is itself a dictumsince it was held in that decision that the proceedings are civil in nature and does not require corroboration even if Scottish lawswere to be applied.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> I am not persuaded that <strong>McAllister</strong> has reopened the issue in Hong Kong in respect of police disciplinary proceedings. <strong>Tsui Kwok Leung</strong> has put the issue beyond any controversy. Proceedings in the Police Disciplinary Tribunal are civil in nature, and the civil onusand standard of proof apply to such proceedings. In this respect, one should bear in mind the wise words of Lord Scarman in <strong>Khawaja</strong> at page 112 of the report :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"My Lords, I have come to the conclusion that the choice between the two standards is not one of any great moment. It is largely amatter of words. There is no need to import into this branch of the civil law the formula used for the guidance of juries in criminalcases. The civil standard as interpreted and applied by the civil courts will meet the ends of justice."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Later on at page 113, he said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" The flexibility of the civil standard of proof suffices to ensure that the court will require the high degree of probability whichis appropriate to what is at stake.............the nature and gravity of an issue necessarily determines the manner of attainingreasonable satisfaction of the truth of the issue: Dixon J. in <em>Wright v Wright</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%29%2077%20CLR%20191" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948) 77 C.L.R. 191</a>, 210."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The civil courts are no strangers to allegations of fraud and dishonesty that may well found criminal charges. Such allegations havealways been approached with care and caution by the application of a more stringent degree of probability. To attempt to formulatesuch probabilities is an exercise both unwarranted and dangerous. To echo the words of Cons JA, in <strong>Tai Hing Cotton Mill v. Liu Cheong Hing Bank Ltd. &amp; Others</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20HKLR%2095" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] HKLR 95</a> at page 114 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is then complained that even so he failed to indicate the exact standard, between the extremes of mere balance of probabilitiesand beyond reasonable doubt, which he thought would be appropriate in the particular circumstances. With respect I find no meritin this point. The judge indicated most clearly that he would not be satisfied by the former. I do not think he is required to gofurther and analyse his feelings to ascertain, and express if he can in suitable language, the precise degree of his conviction."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The question of expressing the degree of conviction in a balance of probabilities exercise was also dealt with by Slade L.J. in <strong>R. v. Hants, C.C., ex parte Ellerton</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%201%20WLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 1 WLR 749</a> at 761 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A number of the speeches in the <em>Khawaja</em> case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20AC%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] A.C. 74</a> use phrases such as a "high degree of probability" or corresponding phrases: see, for example, p.97G <em>per</em> Lord Fraser of Tullybelton, p.113H per Lord Scarmen, p.124E <em>per</em> Lord Bridge of Harwich and p.128C <em>per</em> Lord Templeman. Lord Scarman referred, at p.113H, to the 'flexibility of the civil standard of proof.' However, my understandingof the concept of the flexible standard of proof reflected in the speeches in the <em>Khawaja</em> case is <em>not</em> that it involves proof on (say) a 51 to 49 balance of probabilities in some cases and (say) a 75 to 25 balance in others: any slidingscale of this nature would lead to intolerable uncertainty in application. My understanding of the concept, which I think was thatof the judge, is simply that the relative seriousness of the allegation is a relevant factor (on occasions a highly relevant factor)in considering whether or not the civil burden of proof on the balance of probabilities has been discharged in any given case. This,as I understand it, was essentially the point which their Lordships thought it right to spell out in the <em>Khawaja</em> case in the particular context of an allegation of illegal entry. However, in other cases, of which I think the present was one,the point may be so obvious that it does not need to be put into words."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In that case the fire officer was facing charges of corrupt practice in that he made personal use of a fire brigade vehicle. I agreewith the sentiment and observations of the said judges, in particular that of Slade L.J.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The Adjudicating Officer found as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"Standard of Proof</em></p>        <p class="quote">48. The Defence quote a civil case, namely <em>Bater v. Bater</em> etc., as their argument for a criminal standard of proof being adopted in these domestic proceedings in which the A) charge is particularlyserious in nature.</p>        <p class="quote">49. The consequences of a finding of 'Guilty' in a case of this nature must be serious, likely to attract the maximum punishment ofdismissal. Whilst I accept that the Tribunal is bound to weigh the evidence up extremely carefully in a case such as this, the factis that it is still a civil case and the civil standard of proof 'on the balance of probability' remains. The normal rules of evidencein a criminal court, such as hearsay, do not apply."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> It is beyond a peradventure that the Adjudicating Officer clearly understood the correct standard of proof applicable, with a properappreciation of the serious nature of the charges. It was at the forefront of his mind that extreme care was required albeit thatthe civil standard was to be applied. I found the Adjudicating Officer's understanding of the correct standard of proof and the properapproach in reaching a determination in the application of such standard to be unassailable. As with the tribunal in <strong>Tsui Kwok Leung</strong>, the Adjudicating Officer had Annex J to the Police Discipline Manual to assist him in the appreciation of the standard of proofapplicable.</p>    <p class="heading">Ground Three</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The applicant complains of a misplacing of the onus of proof on him to establish the circumstances of the previous conviction ofthe complainant for an offence involving dishonesty in the obtaining of a replacement identity card. It is contended by the applicantthat the conviction showed that the complainant was an unreliable witness. The Adjudicating Officer dealt with the issue in thismanner :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"55. The Defence have not been able to ascertain the prosecution facts of the said case. The explanation given by PW1 does tend tofit the the (sic) wording of the offence and it would appear, from the wording of the section , that there is an element of dishonestyin the offence. It would appear from the punishment that the offence committed by PW1 was not regarded as serious. Secondly, thisis her only conviction and she has not been convicted of any other offence since then. I find that PW1's evidence is not adverselyaffected by her previous conviction."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The Adjudicating Officer then went on to consider and dismissed an allegation that the complainant had been coached in her evidenceby her cousin's husband, a police officer. It is clear to me that the Adjudicating Officer had not misplaced any burden of proofas alleged or at all. The Adjudicating Officer made a finding that when the applicant raised the issue of the character of the complainanthe had not placed sufficient material before the tribunal to shaken the impression it had of her credibility. It is not for the prosecutionto establish the circumstances of the complainant's previous conviction. Furthermore, the applicant had never sought assistance fromthe prosecution in the production of relevant court records or other information. Without any sufficient material before the tribunal,the Adjudicating Officer had dealt with the issue properly and as best he could. His finding in the circumstances is beyond criticism.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The applicant also complains that the Adjudicating Officer had misplaced the burden of proof in dealing with the issue of the complainant'salleged dishonesty in concealing her alleged knowledge of the breaking in at her flat. This complaint was dismissed by the AdjudicatingOfficer for similar reasons as the preceding one. The Adjudicating Officer found that though police investigation at her flat disclosedevidence of a breaking in, there was no evidence that the complainant was ever made aware of this by any police officer. The AdjudicatingOfficer cannot be faulted for any alleged misplacing of burden of proof in such a finding.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Finally, the applicant complains that throughout the determination the Adjudicating Officer had repeatedly accused the applicant'stestimony and defence evidence to be "uncorroborated". It is true that the Adjudicating Officer is guilty of using such terminologyin describing the defence evidence. However, if one read such descriptions in their proper context, it can immediately be seen thathe was using "uncorroborated" indiscriminately as "unsupported". There is no doubt in my mind that he did not use the term in itslegal sense as a lawyer would understand it. In all likelihood the Adjudicating Officer was borrowing the term from paragraph 11of Annex. J of the <em>Force Discipline Manual</em>, where the term corroboration was loosing use to mean supporting testimony without any implication on the burden of proof. Readingthe determination as a whole, I am left with no doubt at all that the Adjudicating Officer was fully aware that it was for the prosecutionto establish not only the guilt of the applicant, but also to discharge the burden of satisfying the tribunal on all facts necessaryto found such guilt. I am not persuaded that by the indiscriminate and cavalier use of a legal term, without the intention to attributeto it its full legal effect, the Adjudicating Officer had misdirected himself on the burden of proof as alleged by the applicantor at all. The Adjudicating Officer had clearly not intended to place any unwarranted burden of proof upon the applicant when describingdefence evidence as being "uncorroborated". To do justice to themselves, administrators presiding over administrative tribunals,in particular those without any assistance of legal advisers or lawyers, should refrain from using technical legal terms or jargonsin their determinations to avoid attributing to their reasons a wholly unintended and unwarranted distortion. The danger of laymenattempting to use legal terminology is too obvious a point to further labour.</p>    <p class="heading">Ground Four</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> The substance of this complaint has been dealt with under Ground Three supra. The Adjudicating Officer was entitled to take intoconsideration the known circumstances of the previous conviction and to arrive at the conclusion on their effects in the manner hedid. I find this complaint to be void of any merits.</p>    <p class="heading">Grounds Five and Six</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> This is the most substantive complaint made by the applicant in the judicial review. It is rightly conceded by the respondent thatthe Adjudicating Officer erred in finding the evidence of the complainant's cousin and godfather on the recent complaints to be "<em>circumstantial corroboration</em> of such quality as should not be disregarded" (emphasis added). It is trite law that recent complaints cannot afford corroborationin a sexual offence. However, the relevance and significance of that error in the context of his determination have to be considered.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The issue of corroboration was dealt with by the Adjudicating Officer in the following manner :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"Lack of corroboration</em></p>        <p class="quote">52. The Defence state that, without corroborative evidence of the gravamen of the A) charge, the defaulter has to be acquitted.</p>        <p class="quote">53. I do not accept this assertion. The manner in which PW1 gave her evidence; her demeanour and her attitude; left an impressionof truthfulness and sincerity which simply <em>did not need corroboration</em>. Notwithstanding, I was impressed with the evidence of both PW2 and PW3, the sum of which amount to circumstantial corroborationof such quality as should not be disregarded."(emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> He held in no uncertain terms that corroboration was not required to substantiate the charges. He further held that the quality ofthe complainant's evidence was such that he was satisfied of its truthfulness without corroboration. The applicant, somewhat departingfrom his grounds dated 17 November 1994 (without objection from the respondent), contended that corroboration, or alternatively awarning to himself of the danger of finding the applicant guilty without it, is required before the applicant could be found guiltyon the second count of misconduct. It is submitted that such a requirement is founded on the particulars of the count being of anature involving a sexual complaint. The applicant based this submission, firstly, on his contention that the proceedings are criminalin nature with the consequence that the criminal standard and burden of proof are applicable thereto. Alternatively, the applicantcontended that even if the civil standard and burden of proof applied, the serious criminal nature of the accusation required corroborationor a warning of the absence of it be given.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The applicant's first contention founded on its submitted criminal standard and burden of proof must fail for reasons given supra.On his alternative submission, should the requirement of corroboration nevertheless be brought into disciplinary charges involvingsexual complaints on the same or similar basis as the criminal standard?</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> No corroboration, or a warning of the absence of it, is required in a civil claim founded on sexual complaints. For example, theapplicant did not suggest that there can be such a requirement in an action for damages in tort founded on an indecent assault orrape. Can a departure from this general principle in disciplinary proceedings in a domestic tribunal be justified on any grounds?</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The applicant placed heavy reliance again on the dictum of Lord Lowry in <strong>Lanford</strong>. In the medical disciplinary tribunal cases, regulation 50 of the English 1988 rules deals with admissibility of evidence in certaincircumstances but makes no reference to corroboration which has therefore not been made the subject of any provision. In the circumstancesthe Privy Council made the following observation in <strong>McAllister</strong> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The committee is composed entirely of medical men and women learned in their profession and to require that every charge of professionalmisconduct has to be proved to them just as though they were a jury of laymen is, in their Lordships' view, neither necessary nordesirable. What is of prime importance is that the charge and the conduct of the proceedings should be fair to the doctor in questionin all respects. It is not without significance : (i) that rule of the Rules of 1988 clearly contemplates that the committee mayconsider evidence which would not be admissible in criminal proceedings; and (ii) that the rules nowhere provide that criminal standardsof proof and corroboration must at all times apply.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Neither rule 50 nor any other rule required to be considered by this Board in <em>Lanford v. General Medical Council</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20AC%2013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 A.C. 13</a> and their Lordships doubt whether the dictum at pp. 19-20 would have been couched in such wide terms had it been drawn to the attentionof the Board. Indeed if Parliament had intended that rules of evidence appropriate to criminal proceedings should apply in all proceedingsbefore the committee, it is surprising that the council were not directed to make such rules in paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 4 to theAct of 1983."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> I can see no justification for applying criminal rules of evidence and practice to disciplinary proceedings. These proceedings arecivil in nature despite the dire consequences that may be brought upon their subject in some cases. A proper understanding of thathigh degree of probability which is required of the tribunal prior to a finding of guilt is sufficient safeguard for the subjectof the complaint. There is no need to seek assistance from the rules of evidence and practice of the criminal courts. The civil standardis adequate to protect the interests of the subject facing the accusation.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Lord Diplock made the following observation in <strong>Mahon v. Air New Zealand Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20AC%20808" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 AC 808</a> at pages 820 - 821 in respect of the rules of natural justice in the exercise of an investigative jurisdiction:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The rules of natural justice that are germane to this appeal can, in their Lordships' view, be reduced to those two that were referredto by the Court of Appeal of England in <em>R. v. Deputy Industrial Injuries Commissioner, Ex parte Moore</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%201%20QB%20456" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] 1 QB 456</a>, 488, 490, which was dealing with the exercise of an investigative jurisdiction, though one of a different kind from that which wasbeing undertaken by the judge inquiring into the Mt. Erebus disaster. The first rule is that the person making a finding in the exerciseof such a jurisdiction must base his decision upon evidence that has some probative value in the sense described below. The secondrule is that he must listen fairly to any relevant evidence conflicting with the finding and any rational argument against the findingthat a person represented at the inquiry, whose interests (including in the term career or reputation) may be adversely affectedby it, may wish to place before him or would have so wished if he had been aware of the risk of the finding being made.</p>        <p class="quote">The technical rules of evidence applicable to civil or criminal litigation form no part of the rules of natural justice. What is requiredby the first rule is that the decision to make the finding must be based upon some material that tends logically to show the existenceof facts consistent with the finding and that the reasoning supportive of the finding, if it be disclosed, is not logically self-contradictory."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Lord Diplock was there referring to his own decision in <strong>Moore</strong>. His classic exposition of the principle in the 1965 decision was approved by the Court of Appeal in <strong>Re Lo Wing-tong</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20HKLR%20325" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 HKLR 325.</a> In <strong>Moore</strong>, Diplock L.J., as he then was, said at 488 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"For historical reasons, based on the fear that juries who might be illiterate would be incapable of differentiating between the probativevalues of different methods of proof, the practice of the common law courts has been to admit only what the judges then regardedas the best evidence of any disputed fact, and thereby to exclude much material which, as a matter of common sense, would assista fact-finding tribunal to reach a correct conclusion : <em>c.f. Myers v. Director or Public Prosecutions</em>.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">These technical rules of evidence, however, form no part of the rules of natural justice. The requirement that a person exercisingquasi-judicial functions must base his decision on evidence means no more than it must be based upon material which tends logicallyto show the existence or non-existence of facts relevant to the issue to be determined, or to show the likelihood or unlikelihoodof the occurrence of some future event the occurrence of which would be relevant. It means that he must not spin a coin or consultan astrologer, but he may take into account any material which, as a matter of reason, has some probative value in the sense mentionedabove. If it is capable of having any probative value, the weight to be attached to it is a matter for the person to whom parliamenthas entrusted the responsibility of deciding the issue. The supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court does not entitle it to usurpthis responsibility and to substitute its own view for his."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> As corroboration or a warning of the lack of it is not a requirement in the proceedings before the Adjudicating Officer, his errorto treat the evidence of the cousin and godfather as "circumstantial corroboration" is of no moment at all to the determination.Though such evidence is not probative to establish the truth of the complaint itself, they are probative in the consideration ofthe credibility of the complainant's allegation of making recent complaints, and of the telephone calls for assistance she allegedlymade prior to the occurrence of the unhappy incident. I am not convinced that any criticism can be made against the AdjudicatingOfficer alleging a failure to appreciate the fact that the complainant's evidence was not supported by any independent evidence.He was satisfied of the guilt of the applicant on the complainant's evidence alone as he stated in clear terms. He was clearly awareof the advice in Annex. J of the Force Discipline Manual that in serious charges, one should look for supportive evidence. In fact,the advice in the manual went beyond the requirements stipulated by any criminal standard in that it advised of supportive evidencein "more serious charge which could result in serious consequences for the officer such as dismissal"; and not only in respect ofrecognised categories in criminal law where corroboration is required or desirable. I find no merits in this ground.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> I am satisfied that the applicant was given a fair hearing and that the evidence before the Adjudicating Officer amply justifiedhis findings. I am not satisfied that the applicant had been able to make out any valid grounds of objection against the findingsof the Adjudicating Officer and his application for orders of certiorari to quash the determination of the Adjudicating Officer andthe awards made consequential thereto is dismissed. No grounds have been shown why costs should not follow the event and an ordernisi for costs to be awarded to the respondent against the applicant is made.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <div style="text-align:center">        <center>            <table border="0" width="100%">                <tr>                    <td width="50%"></td>                    <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Jerome Chan)</td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="50%"></td>                    <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">Judge of the High Court</td>                </tr>            </table>        </center>    </div>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Philip Dykes, inst'd. by M/s Pang, Tang, Wan &amp; Choi, for Applicant</p>        <p>Miss Lynda Shine and Miss Susana Sit, S.C.C. of Crown Solicitors, for Respondent</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/1995/391.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
