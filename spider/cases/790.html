On 3 May 2002 the schoolarranged a day camp for its teaching staff at the Jockey Club Sai Kung Outdoor Training Camp located at DD Lot No. 256, Tai MongTsai Road, Sai Kung, New Territories (âthe Campâ).  The Camp was operated and run by the Defendant, the Hong Kong Federationof Youth Groups.  While participating in the activities at the Camp, Miss Chan sustained back injury in an accident.  She was takento the Tseung Kwan O Hospital for treatment.  Subsequently, she was given over 27 months of sick leave by her treating doctors. On 6 October 2004, she was assessed by the Medical Assessment Board to have suffered 3% permanent loss of earning capacity.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Under ECC No. 431 of 2004, Miss Chan took out an employee compensation action against her employer, the Hong Kong Red Cross (âtheRed Crossâ).  She succeeded in obtaining compensation under the Employeesâ Compensation Ordinance in the sum of $669,049.71 withcosts agreed at $125,000 by an order made on 17 October 2005.  In addition, the Red Cross, in defending the ECC action incurred legalcosts in the sum of $91,474.  The Red Cross is now seeking, in the present action, the recovery of the compensation it had to payMiss Chan including her legal costs and the Red Crossâs own costs in defending the action in the total sum of $885,523.71. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Miss Chan also took out an action against the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups (âthe Federationâ) for common law damagesin HCPI 388 of 2005 in the Court of First Instance.  The action was subsequently settled by consent order on 17 October 2006 wherethe Federation agreed to pay Miss Chan a compensation in the sum of $250,000 plus agreed costs of $230,000 on a without admissionof liability basis. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Federation, did in the present proceedings, bring a counterclaim against the Red Cross for damages it paid to Miss Chan includingher costs in the total sum of $480,000 and the Federationâs own costs in defending the action at $367,206 making a total sum of$847,206.

Its mission isto provide opportunities and facilities for the social, educational, cultural and physical development of young people.  The JockeyClub Sai Kung Outdoor Training Camp is and was one of the camp site established by the Federation providing leisure and trainingfacilities for young people.  The Camp is and was operated and owned by the Federation at the time of the accident. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Miss Chan was an employee of the Plaintiff, the Hong Kong Red Cross, at one of its schools, the Hong Kong Red Cross Hospital Schoolin May 2002.  She took part at an outing organized by the school for its staff at the Camp on 3 May 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  At about 3.30 p.m. Miss Chan took part in an âenvironmental protection and education activityâ at the Camp consisted of a fieldtrip to the mangrove forest prepared and organized by the Federationâs staff at the Camp.  The activity involved the crossing ona floating bridge (âthe bridgeâ) constructed with rows and columns of plastic drums tied to a frame of bamboo poles on the surfaceof the drums.  The bridge consisted of 3 such sections of raft-like bamboo and plastic drum structure linked together by wooden planksacross the 3 sections serving as a bridge and walkway for pedestrians (see photographs and the DVD exhibited).  The ends of the woodenplanks were tied to the ends of each raft section and secured with ropes to the horizontal bamboo and drum structure on each sectionof the three rafts. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The floating bridge did not straddle the width of the river.  At each end of the river bank, a pole had been erected with a ropetied to it and the other end of the rope tied to the floating bridge.  For visitors crossing the bridge to reach the opposite bankof the river, upon crossing the three raft sections that formed the floating bridge, the person closest to the opposite bank on thefloating bridge would be required to pull the rope by hand in order to reach the opposite bank of the river.  Once the floating bridgereached the opposite bank, a link between the two banks of the river would be formed and participants following the first personwould be able to cross the floating bridge to the opposite bank.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Miss Chan was in the process of following her colleagues on the floating bridge after it was secured to the opposite bank of theriver when she fell into the river.  It was her evidence, that as soon as she stepped with her right foot onto the first right woodenplank linking the second raft section to the third raft section, she suddenly fell into the river.  She claimed that when her rightfoot stepped onto the first right plank, her left foot was still on the second raft section.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The groupâs initial crossing was captured on a video tape taken by a participant in the group.  The video recommenced after MissChan fell into the river, it showed her standing facing the remaining planks with the river water reaching her mid-thigh and theplank she had stepped on had its front part submerged in the river.  The rear end of the plank was still attached to the second raftsection.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>The Issues</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  To determine whether the Federation is liable to compensate the Red Crossâs loss, it is necessary to find out if:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)  the Federationâs Camp staff was in any way negligent in the construction, maintenance and repair of the floating bridge; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) whether the Camp regulations and exemption clause set out in the standard application form signed by Miss Grace Wong Kit Ching,a teacher of the Red Cross School, on behalf of the school exonerated the Federation from liability. </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Miss Wong Kit Ching first visited the camp on 8 March 2002 with 3 other colleagues.  They were shown around the facilities and giveninformation on the activities offered at the camp.  A camp standard application form was given to Miss Wong.  After Miss Wong obtainedinstructions from the Red Cross Headquarters, she was authorized to proceed with the booking and complete the form.  She had orallyinformed the campâs staff the four activities the Red Cross School staff would be using which included: (1) âocean ecologyâconsisting of a visit to the mangrove forest; (2) the Roman catapult; (3) karaoke and (4) swimming.

The presentation wasmade by DW2 Mr. Ching See Ho, one of the three instructors in charge of taking the participants on the visit.  He introduced to theparticipants the composition, functions, flora and fauna of the mangrove forest they were about to visit. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  It is to be noted that at the auditorium presentation, Mr. Ching did explain to the participants they would be crossing a floatingbridge on the visit to the mangrove forest.  They were informed the crossing was challenging but fun.  That they should be carefulwhen walking on the floating bridge and people have fallen into the river before, but the river was shallow and not dangerous.  Theywere also warned they should walk carefully and follow the instructions of the instructors.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  It is not disputed that over 60 participants took part at the mangrove forest visit that morning.  It is unfortunate that the videoof the crossing did not capture Miss Chanâs crossing from the second raft section to the third raft section and the cause of MissChanâs fall into the river.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The video of the crossing, however, did show the condition of the planks between the second raft section and the third raft section. The particular wooden plank (âthe first right plankâ) that Miss Chan stepped onto with her right foot appeared to have a deepercurvature than the other two planks on the left that linked the second raft section to the third section prior to Miss Chanâs crossing. These can also be seen from the printed still pictures of the relevant period exhibited, namely at 1 min 38 sec, 1 min 58 sec, 2min 01 sec and 2 min 10 sec.  The last print showed Miss Chan standing in the river with part of the plank submerged in the waterand its end still attached to the second raft section. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  It is the Plaintiffâs case that the first right plank had become detached due to the frequent and regular use by pedestrians crossingthe floating bridge.  Constant wear and tear had resulted in the loosening of the rope  securing the plank resulting in the plankbreaking loose, leading to Miss Chanâs fall into the river as she put her weight on it during the crossing.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Counsel for the Plaintiff, Miss Lau, relied on the evidence of PW2 Mr. Hung Wai Ming, a colleague of Miss Chan, who had made thecrossing immediately before Miss Chan.  His evidence in court was, he noticed the rope tying the front end of the plank to the bambooframe of the section in front was loose and there was a space between the rope and the plank showing the plank to be unstable.  Hefurther alleged that when he stepped onto the said plank before Miss Chanâs crossing, it sank to such an extent that the under-sidealmost touched the water.  His reaction then was to rush across to the other side as quickly as possible.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The Defence submitted the floating bridge would naturally move up and down as floating bridges would do when people walked on it,it is up to the person crossing it to keep a good balance and walk with caution to avoid falling into the river.  The defence claimedthat the floating bridge as seen on video was in good order before the accident.  It further suggested it was Miss Chan who had steppedeither into the gap between the first and second planks and her weight as she fell caused the loosening of the front portion of theplank from the raft section in front and dislodging the plank or that Miss Chan had lost balance and fell onto the first right plankand the weight of her fall caused the dislodgement. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The Federation produced as exhibit D-1, a plank and pole construction made for the purpose of the trial, it illustrated the waythe plank was secured with ropes onto the bamboo frame on the raft.  It is not disputed that the wooden plank in Exh. D-1 was tightlyand securely fastened to the bamboo frame by means of a âsquare lashing knotâ ãåæ¹çµãused for tying together 2 polesat right angle.  Judging from the video and photographs of the floating bridge, the same method was used in the construction of thefloating bridge linking the three rafts together to form a bridge.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  It is the evidence of DW1 Mr. Wong that as the floating bridge moved along the river, the angle of the connecting planks betweendifferent sections would vary, thereby creating variance in the distance between the left and the right side of the raft sections. He also explained how the planks would adjust themselves to the varying distances through the dynamic force of the ropes securingthe planks to the bamboo frame.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Mr. Wong agreed under cross-examination that the ropes used to fasten the planks to the bamboo frame would become loose in time. However, he claimed that on the day of the accident before the participants were taken to the mangrove forest, he had visually inspectedand walked on the floating bridge to make sure it was safe for the crossing of the participants on that day.  He admitted that hedid not check the ropes fastened to each plank on each raft section.  He agreed the rope fastening the planks could be loosen bythe weight of a heavy person, and a group of 60 participants at the mangrove forest was a large group.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Findings</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  After viewing the video repeatedly at the trial and careful examination of the still photographs exhibited on the section of thefloating bridge where Miss Chan had the accident, and upon hearing and considering the evidence of the Plaintiffâs witnesses, Ifind the evidence of Miss Chan and Mr. Hung to be both credible and reliable.  Mr. Hung was the last person to cross the bridge beforeMiss Chan.  He was a large person of about 100 kg and he described the first right plank was bending and curving so much that hefelt it was about too touch the river as he crossed it and he had to rush through the remaining part of the plank.  It is a clearindication that the first right plank was weaker than the other planks on the floating bridge.  It is also clear from the photographsthat that particular plank had an unnatural curve quite unlike Exh. D1 which looked sturdy and secured.  From the photographs exhibited,I am not convinced the gap between the first right plank and the middle plank was wide enough for Miss Chanâs right foot to beaccidentally lodged causing Miss Chan to lose balance and fall.  Based on Miss Chanâs and Mr. Hungâs evidence and the video tapeof her colleagues crossing the bridge, I am satisfied she was careful in crossing this section of the floating bridge and could nothave put her right foot in the gap between the two planks by accident.  Her colleagues who preceded her on the bridge were seen tohave crossed the same section of the bridge with caution.  Furthermore,  Mr. Ching, one of the Campâs instructor also confirmedthe gap was not wide enough for a foot to go through.  Mr. Wong (DW1), on the other hand, confirmed the planks could be dislodgedby a heavy person. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Based on the evidence adduced, I am satisfied the particular plank in question was loose by the time Miss Chan started to crossit due to constant use and the large number of people that preceded her on the floating bridge that morning.  When Mr. Hung crossedthe same section of the bridge, the plank had clearly shown signs of instability that he felt he had to rush over it.  His weightand quick action could have contributed to the detachment of the plank from the rope fastening.  Hence, when Miss Chan followed himand crossed the same plank putting her weight on her right foot, it was probably âthe straw that broke the camelâs backâ andthe plank became dislodged.  When the plank was dislodged at the front, Miss Chan lost balance and fell into the river, the fallhad caused the injuries she suffered from.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  As to the camp regulations printed on the back of the application form which stated:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â2ï¼ ä½¿ç¨çå°æéï¼ç¨çèçé éµå®è·å¡æç¤ºâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The video recording of the presentation before the visit to the mangrove forest showed the camp instructors informing participantsthat they would be crossing the floating bridge on their way to the mangrove forest and the experience would not be dangerous.  Accordingto Mr. Wong, who led the participants in the crossing and who had also given directions to the participants before the crossing,Miss Chan did not do anything against the instructions of the instructors.  As it is not the Defendantâs case that the accidentwas due to Miss Chanâs failure to follow instructions of the camp staff, this is therefore not an issue that I need to consider.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  There was no evidence adduce to show Miss Chan had failed to follow the instructions of the instructors under the camp regulation. I do not find Miss Chan had in any way contributed to the accident.  I hold the accident was caused by the detachment of the plankfrom the rope fastening due to heavy usage and inadequate maintenance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  For reasons set out above, I find the Federation responsible for Miss Chanâs accident and liable to compensate the Red Cross under<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 25</a> (1)(b) of the ECO and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> (1) of the CLCO. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The Exemption Clause</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  I agree with Miss Lau that the exemption clause on the application form of the Federation does not apply in the present case.

The reference to ãæ¬äºº/æ¬åé«ã was not crossed out.  Therefore,it is not clear whether the exemption applied to a person or an organization.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  I further agree with Miss Lau that in order for an exemption clause to take effect in excluding a partyâs liability for his ownnegligence, the 3 stage test of Lord Morton in <i>Canada Steamship Lines v R</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1952%5d%201%20All%20ER%20305" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1952] 1 AER 305</a> should be considered:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â(1) If a clause contains language which expressly exempts the person in whose favour it is made (âthe proferensâ) from theconsequence of the negligence of his own servants, effect must be given to that provision;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(2)  If there is no express reference to negligence, the court must consider whether the words used are wide enough, in their ordinarymeaning, to cover negligence on the part of the servants of the proferens;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(3)  If the words used are wide enough for the above purpose, the court must then consider whether âthe head of damage may be basedon some ground other than that of negligenceââ (p. 310 A-C)</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Clearly, the words in the clause relied on by the Federation do not satisfy the stage (1) test because it did not contain expresslanguage exempting the Federation from liability for the negligence of its servants and agents.  If the Red Cross was to bear theburden of the consequences of an accident, the exemption clause should specify it in clear terms.  As the wordings of the exemptionclause did not so specify, I agree the clause did not positively exempt the Federation from liability of any accident caused by thenegligence of the Federationâs servants or agents.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Quantum</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The Plaintiff Red Cross is seeking to recover:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)  Compensation that it had paid out to Miss Chan under ECC 431 of 2004 where the Court ordered the Red Cross to pay Miss Chan thesum of $669,049.71 plus costs agreed at $125,000 and the Red Crossâs own legal costs in defending the ECC action of $91,474.

She was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department of Tseung Kwan O Hospital where Dr. Kung ShuWing found positive sign of tenderness on her lower back region.  X-ray of the lumbascaral region did not show any fractures, hisdiagnosis was âback contussionâ and Miss Chan was given analgesic and sent home.  However, subsequently, Miss Chan suffered persistentback pain which at times became severe.  The maximum duration for her to either sit, stand or walk was 10 â 15 minutes.  On 5 June2002, Miss Chan suffered great pain and attended the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and was admitted into the orthopaedic ward.  Again,the doctorâs diagnosis was âback contussionâ  she was prescribed with physiotherapy treatments.  The physiotherapists recordedthe condition as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â(1) Local tenderness over 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> lumber regions;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(2) diminished spinal movements;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(3) no motor-sensory deficits;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(4) only mildly positive straight leg raising tests.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">These findings were consistent with back sprain.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Her physiotherapy treatments included manual therapy and ultrasonic treatments.  After a few sessions of such treatments, when shewas found to have obvious improvements, the treatments terminated.  A few weeks later, Miss Chan again experienced exacerbation ofback pain, she was admitted into hospital again.  The therapist observed exacerbation of back pain with more positive signs and shewas given further therapy treatments.  In July of the same year, Miss Chan experienced another episode of the exacerbation of theback pain and the same therapy treatments were given to her once more.  MRI was taken and the doctors found only multiple sacralmeningeal cysts which, according to the doctors, were usually harmless and asymptomatic.  The neurosurgeon confirmed no active interventionwas required.  The doctorsâ orthopaedic judgment was, Miss Chan had poor level of musculoskeletal and cardiovascular fitness whichwas limiting her functional ability.  Back fitness and physical rehabilitation program was suggested and given by the therapists.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In spite of repeated treatments, Miss Chan continued to experience the same degree of back pain with intermittent exacerbationsand was intolerable to standing, sitting and walking.  During those periods she had to rely on the wheelchair for outdoor activities.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Miss Chan was examined by Professor Leung Ping Chung of the Chinese University Orthopaedics &amp; Traumatology Department appointedby the Federation and Dr. Johnson C.K. Lam, specialist in Orthopaedics &amp; Traumatology.  According to Professor Leung, when heexamined her on 27 October 2005, Miss Chan informed him that her symptoms had already improved by 60% to 70% compared to 2002 and2003.  In Professor Leungâs opinion, Miss Chanâs lower back pain undoubtedly started after the accident when she fell from thefloating bridge into the river.  However, in his opinion, pain caused by a falling sprain would have gone away with treatment andtime and that a spinal sprain itself should not have produced a disabling situation.  He did not think the persistent pain of MissChan could have been solely caused by the accident.  Upon further investigation, in Professor Leungâs supplemental report of 15June 2009, he agreed the cysts shown in the MRI in Miss Chanâs sacral area were common incidental findings that did not give riseto symptoms of pain, neither would the cysts in Miss Chanâs pelvic cavity cause back pain. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Dr. Johnson Lamâs medical report of 13 January 2005 revealed Miss Chan had consulted a private Orthopaedic specialist at the BaptistHospital and later Dr. Chau Yat Sang on 1 August 2003 for back pain and knee pain after exercise.  Miss Chan had continued to consultDr. Chau up to 23 July 2004.  At the time, she was not able to walk for longer than 25 to 30 minutes or sit continuously for 15 to20 minutes.  When Dr. Lam examined her in December 2004, Miss Chan was still complaining of back pain and intolerance to prolongedwalking, sitting or standing.  She was not able to return to her pre-accident occupation as a teacher of sick children at the hospital. Dr. Lam found at the physical examination of Miss Chan, presence of muscle guarding and mild spasm over the lumbar region and tendernessover both iliac crests and midline of the lumbar spine particularly over the lumbosacral junction.  His assessment of Miss Chanâspermanent impairment is 5% and the loss of earning capacity in the region of 6%.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Dr. Lam agreed that Miss Chan suffered from low back pain after the accident, it was not in existence according to her previousmedical records.  He did not agree with Professor Leung that Miss Chanâs persistent back pain was not caused by the accident alone. His opinion was:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âthe absence of radiologically or MRI abnormalities did not imply that the fall had not been serious at all because many injuriesdo not always appear on these scans.  The pain they induce can cause significant acute and disabling back pain, which in some patients,even in the absence of radiological or MRI abnormalities, could persist and cause chronic pain, as in this case.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Professor Leung accepted Miss Chanâs pain to be genuine and had arisen after the accident.  In Dr. Lamâs opinion, if not forthis accident it was very unlikely that Miss Chan as a young person would suffer from impairment and disability in her lower back.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  I have considered both doctorsâ medical reports, in particular Professor Leungâs supplemental report in June 2009 that confirmedMiss Chanâs back pain could not have been contributed by the cysts in her ovaries and that Miss Chan was a fit and young individualwho did not have any low back pain before the accident.  I accept it is indisputable that her back pain was caused solely by theaccident on 3 May 2002. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Pain suffering and loss of indemnities</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Based on Miss Chanâs evidence, she experienced recurrent low back pain, sometimes on a daily basis or once every two to threedays.  At the time of the trial, 7Â½ years after the accident, she was still attending regular physiotherapy treatments 2 to 3 timesa week and she would experience acute inflammation causing constant pain on her low back every now and then.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">55.</a>  Miss Chanâs</a> condition cannot be classified as âseriousâ, but the long period of her suffering resulting in her inability to return to herpre-accident job should be taken into account.  I accept Dr Lamâs assessment of Miss Chan that she suffered from a whole personimpairment of 5% and a loss of earning capacity of 6%.  I agree with Miss Lauâs submission that an appropriate award under PSLAfor Miss Chan would be in the region of $300,000 to $350,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Pre-trial loss of earnings and MPF</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Professor Leung assessed that in the usual case the sick leave for injuries sustained in a fall of this kind would be between 3to 6 months, however, Miss Chanâs treating doctors all agreed and accepted her complaints of pain were genuine and she was certifiedthe appropriate period of sick leave between 5 May 2002 to 31 August 2004, a period of 27.75 months.  I accept she should be awardedthe loss of earning for a period of 27.75 months at the pre-accident monthly salary of $22,683.73, it comes to $629,462. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  In addition, the pre-trial loss of earnings would include the period after the 27.75 months of sick leave.  According to Dr. Lam,Miss Chan would be fit to engage in light duties such as working as a clerical assistant.  Miss Lau relied on the Hong Kong GovernmentQuarterly Report of Wage and Payroll Statistics for June 2003 that the average monthly pay for a female clerical worker in variousindustries was $10,000.  The calculation of the difference of earnings from 3 November 2004 to the day of trial, 3 December 2009,a period of 61 months, at the notional earnings of a clerical worker of $10,000 per month including the MPF, would be in the sumof $640,500.  In total, should the trial for common law damages take place today she would have been awarded under PSLA and pre-trialloss of earnings a sum of over $1,200,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Future Loss of Earnings and Loss of Earning Capacity</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Miss Chan expressed a desire to work in the finance industry in future and she is studying for a qualification to enter that industry. Whether she would succeed or not and what her earnings would be is unknown.  For this reason, it is not realistic to estimate MissChanâs future earnings based on the pay of a clerical assistance earning $10,000 a month even though I agree that the future multiplierof 15 for Miss Chan who is 35 year old is appropriate.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  As Miss Chan did not return to work because of her persistent back pain which I accept to be genuine, an award for loss of earningcapacity is appropriate.  Such an amount would be in the region of $100,000 should future loss of earning not be awarded.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Medical, travelling and other miscellaneous expenses</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Miss Chan had consulted a number of private medical specialists.  The parties have agreed the medical expenses of $65,918, thissum is reasonable.  So far as travelling is concerned, the Defendant also agreed the sum at $20,200, it is a reasonable sum.  MissChanâs claim of miscellaneous items of special damages such as wheelchair, walking stick, fitness ball, fitness cycle, hot packsand tonic foods which came to a total sum of $4,761, I find to be reasonable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  It is clear that Miss Chan would have been awarded much more than the $250,000 settlement she reached with the Defendant in herHigh Court common law claim against the Federation had the action not settled.  As stated above, her claim easily exceeded the RedCrossâs claim of $669,049.71 with costs that the Red Cross paid to Miss Chan under the ECC action.  I further find the Red Crossshould also be compensated with the costs it incurred in defending the ECC action as part of the loss incurred.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  I hold the Federation to be liable to indemnify the Red Cross under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 25</a> (1)(b) of the ECO and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> (1) of the CLCO.
