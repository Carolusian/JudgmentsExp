More specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed. These are three in number.  First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he suppliesin the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying âget-upâ (whether it consists simply of a brand nameor a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offeredto the public, such that the get-up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiffâs goods or services. Secondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likelyto lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff.  Whether the publicis aware of the plaintiffâs identity as the manufacturer or supplier of the goods or services is immaterial, as long as they areidentified with a particular source which is in fact the plaintiff.  For example, if the public is accustomed to rely upon a particularbrand name in purchasing goods of a particular description, it matters not at all that there is little or no public awareness ofthe identity of the proprietor of the brand name.  Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in a <i>quiatimet</i> action that he is likely to suffer, damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendantâs misrepresentation thatthe source of the defendantâs goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Some of the wrongful acts complained of took place in the Mainland.

For present purposes, the summary of the major events as set out in Part B above is sufficient. </p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> As regards the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, a local claimant, the position is straightforward.  Historically, the goodwill in theå¹æ­£name and Insignia was firstcreated in the Mainland whenå¹æ­£æ¸é¢was set up in 1889.  Whenç§ç«å»£å·å¹æ­£ä¸­å­¸é¦æ¸¯åæ ¡was established in Hong Kong1933, the goodwill in theå¹æ­£name and Insignia extended to Hong Kong.  Since 1951, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, as the owner and administrator ofå¹æ­£schools in Hong Kong, has been responsible for the quality of the educational servicesprovided through the schools.  By providing such services, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff has continued to build up the goodwill in theå¹æ­£name and Insignia in Hong Kong, which enures for its benefit.  Plainly,the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff has the requisites goodwill in Hong Kong to sue the defendants for passing off. </p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> As regards the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, a foreign claimant, strictly the question is whether it has goodwill in theå¹æ­£name and Insignia in Hong Kong.  To answerthat question, it is however necessary to first consider its legal position in the Mainland.  Dr Lin dealt with that aspect in his1<sup>st</sup> opinion dated 16 November 2007 thus. </p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Dr Lin first pointed out that there existed no specific law to protect the goodwill in a business in the Mainland under the reignof the Qing Dynasty, the Republic of China and the Peopleâs Republic of China until 1986.  In 1986,ãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååæ°æ³éåãwaspromulgated.  Underãæ°æ³éåã, ãåè­½æ¬ãis protected.  And as an important component of a legal personâsãæ³äººåè­½æ¬ã,åè­½ (goodwill) in a business is also protected.  By virtue of theæé«äººæ°æ³é¢éæ¼è²«å¾¹å·è¡ãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååæ°æ³éåãè¥å¹²åé¡çæè¦(è©¦è¡)ç¬¬196 æ¢, ãæ°æ³éåãapplied to civil acts committed before 1 January 1987.  Thus although no law specifically existed before1986 to protect goodwill, a plaintiff can still resort toãæ°æ³éåãif necessary. </p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> Dr Lin then said that factually, the goodwill in theå¹æ­£name and Insignia had come into existence since 1889.  Whenå»£å·å¹æ­£ä¸­å­¸wasnationalised in 1953, the goodwill was not extinguished.  It survived.  But there was noè¼é« (carrier) to continue with and developthe goodwill.  Given its historical and sentimental value, the Dongshan Premises was widely recognised as the carrier for the nameå¹æ­£. That was the reason whyå»£å·å¸äººæ°æ¿åºdecided to allowå»£å·å¸ç¬¬äºåä¸ä¸­å­¸situated at the Dongshan Premises to resumetheå¹æ­£name in 1984.  å»£å·å¸äººæ°æ¿åºofficially recognised thatå»£å·å¸å¹æ­£ä¸­å­¸as the continuation of the originalå¹æ­£schoolat the Dongshan Premises.  å»£å·å¸å¹æ­£ä¸­å­¸has since become the carrier to continue with and develop in the Mainland the originalgoodwill in theå¹æ­£name and Insignia, together with the goodwill developed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff in Hong Kong and Macau.  In short, the residual goodwill in theå¹æ­£name and Insignia in the Mainland has since 1984 beenrevived and re-vested with the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff is the owner of the goodwill.  By virtue ofãæ°æ³éåã, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs goodwill is and was at all material times protected by the law in the Mainland. </p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> Now the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff has all along regarded the <i>alma mater</i> at the Dongshan Premises as the very source of the goodwill in theå¹æ­£name and Insignia in Hong Kong.  The goodwill here, as extensionof the goodwill originated in the Mainland, cannot be separated from the goodwill enjoyed by the <i>alma mater</i> there.  The <i>alma mater</i> owns and shares with the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff its goodwill in Hong Kong.  So after the resumption of theå¹æ­£name in 1984, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff as the official continuation of the <i>alma mater</i>, has the same goodwill as the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff does in Hong Kong.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff can also sue the defendants for passing off here. </p>    <p class="heading">J.       THE 2<sup>nd</sup> ELEMENT â MISREPRESENTATIONS</p>    <p class="heading">J.1.

On 21 December 2001, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant published the Statement in Sing Pao, which read :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â     ç±çæ­¡è¿</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">é¦æ¸¯ç¹å¥è¡æ¿åå¨åæ¿åå§å¡</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">è¦å¯ç§ç«å¹æ­£åå­¸é¢</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">å¹æ­£æè²åºéæéå¬å¸è´æ¬</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">å¹æ­£æè²åºéæéå¬å¸æ¯ä¸çåå°ç±å¿å¹æ­£</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">æè²äºæ¥­ä¹æ ¡ååç¤¾æè³¢éæåµç«ï¼å°éæååæ¯æ</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">å¹æ­£æè²äºæ¥­ä¹åé æ´»åãæ¾æååæ¯æéï¼</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">è±é½å¹æ­£åå­¸é¢ãé¦æ¸¯å¹æ­£ä¸­å­¸ãå»£å·å¹æ­£ä¸­å­¸ãâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> What Koo then went on to say can perhaps best sum up the responses that the Statement had provoked :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â35. I was totally baffled by the 1st Defendantâs publication of the Notice.  The HK Pui Ching Alumni has tried to clarify theconfusion caused by the 1st Defendant and the College through the Newsletter.  However, shortly after the issue of the Newsletterand within such a short span of time, the 1st Defendant published the Notice giving the public a false impression that it had supportedthe operation of Pui Ching Group of Schools.  I was unable to fathom the intention of the 1st Defendant other than to confuse thepublic into believing that the 1st Defendant has some sort of connection with the Pui Ching Group of Schools or that any donationmade to the 1st Defendant will be passed to the Pui Ching Group of Schools despite the Hong Kong Alumniâs attempt to clarify thatthe 1st Defendant was not part of the Pui Ching family.  Further, by making reference to the College in the Notice, the 1st Defendantalso gave the wrong impression to the public that the College was connected with Hong Kong Pui Ching and the 1st Plaintiff.  It ismy understanding that none of the Pui Ching Group of Schools has been financially supported by the 1st Defendant or the College.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">36.  I was also infuriated by the 1st Defendantâs action in publishing the Notice because for those members of the public who werenot privy to the background of the matter, namely that the 1st Defendant and the College were not related to the Pui Ching Groupof Schools, it was highly likely that they would falsely associate the 1st Defendant and the College as belonging to the Pui ChingGroups of Schools/family.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Obviously, the Statement falsely misled the public into believing that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was associated or connected with the plaintiffs.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is liable. </p>    <p class="heading">J.2.    In the Mainland</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> The wrongful acts that took place in the Mainland are the continuous operation of the College after the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff withdrew the support in late 2001, the registration of the Mark and the granting of the Licence.  For these matters, thedouble actionability rule applies. </p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> It is not disputed that the College was initially set up with the support of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  In paras. 18-27 of his affirmation, é³è¡¡édetailed the circumstances leading to the setting up of the College.  é³æ¦®çalsogave evidence on the same subject matter.  Two major points arose from their evidence.  First, all those involved in the settingup of the College, including the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and other members of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs school board and theå¹æ­£alumni, understood and agreed that the College would be a non-profit making tertiary educationinstitution to realize the dying wish of Mr Wong.  Second, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had at all material times purportedly acted upon that agreement and understanding.  He had by his conduct represented tothe 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff that the College, when formed, would be such an educational institution. </p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> é³è¡¡é, é³æ¦®ç, Lee See Yuen and Clement Young Kwok Hung had at all material times served on the Collegeâs board of directorsbut had already resigned.  They described how the College was run in reality.  In gist, contrary to the initial understanding andagreement supporting the setting up of the College, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, together with his sonæ¢æ®å»º, treated and ran the College as his own business.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant also used the apparent association of the College with theå¹æ­£family of schools to solicit support from the alumni andothers, including donations.  He had caused the incorporation of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants for the purpose of soliciting financial support for the College.  When the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff found out the falsity of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs representation in late 2001, it immediately withdrew its support.  The College had since been âdisownedâ by the1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and excluded from theå¹æ­£family of schools.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had also caused the College to distance itself from theå¹æ­£family of schools.  In the past, the College used to describein its school brochures its association with the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and theå¹æ­£alumni.  Such description was removed in 2002.  But in its ãééç´å¿µå¹æ­£åå­¸é¢å»ºæ ¡11 å¨å¹´æ¨å¹æ­£åµå»º115å¨å¹´ãç¹åpublished in 2005, the College again reasserted its relationship with the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and theå¹æ­£alumni. </p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> Yip Wai Hong referred to an interview that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant gave on ATV in 2002 to show that he had regarded the College as his own business.  In that interview, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was described as the one who initiated the idea of setting up the College and that the College was formed through his endeavours. Towards the end of the program, the interviewer said, presumably with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs endorsement, that he would leave the management of the College to his son after his retirement when he reached 84.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> Dr Lin said that under the PRC law (<i>lex loci delicti</i>), the College is not in the circumstances described above entitled to use theå¹æ­£name and its insignia.  Such conduct has causeddamage to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs goodwill in theå¹æ­£name and Insignia in the Mainland.  Under Hong Kong law (<i>lex fori</i>), the position may be analysed thus.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff granted the College was a licence to use theå¹æ­£name when it was first set up.  The College was then treated as a memberof theå¹æ­£family.  As a member of theå¹æ­£family, the College would not generate any independent goodwill.  In 2001, the licencewas terminated and the College had since ceased to be a member of theå¹æ­£family.  After cessation of its membership, the Collegedoes not have any right to use theå¹æ­£name.  See <i>Wadlow</i>, <i>ibid</i>, <i>Dawnay Day &amp; Co. Ltd v Cantor Fitzgerald International</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%20RPC%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] RPC 669.</a>  The double actionability rule is therefore satisfied. </p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> Plainly, the continuous operation of the College with its name bearing the referenceå¹æ­£and its insignia since late 2001 constitutesa misrepresentation that it is associated or connected with the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  In fact, as evident from theãç¹åãpublished in 2005, the College continued to mislead the public that it was associatedor connected with the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, who is and was at all material times in charge of and responsible for the Collegeâs operation with full knowledge thatit is wrongful to do so, is liable.  So are the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, which were formed and are being run by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant with the main purpose of supporting the College.  </p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> Inferentially, it is beyond doubt that the intention of registering the Mark by the College in November 1999 was to monopolize theå¹æ­£namefor the field of education services in the Mainland.  Understandably, many in theå¹æ­£family were infuriated.  At the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs school board meeting held on 8 December 2001, members of the board includingé·ç¦®å, å³ç¦and é³æ¦®çconfrontedthe 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  After the meeting, further discussions were made with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to see if the matter could be resolved amicably.  These efforts had unfortunately failed. </p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> According to Dr Lin, under the PRC law (<i>lex loci delicti</i>), the registration of the Mark was wrongful.  Had it been committed in Hong Kong (<i>lex fori</i>), it was also unlawful.  The double actionability rule is satisfied.  I note that the registration of the Mark had already been cancelledafter the commencement of the proceedings.  But it does not detract from the fact that at the time of the writ it constituted anactionable misrepresentation in passing off.  (And it would appear from the recent development in the trademark proceedings, theCollege still wishes to assert, though wrongfully, that it is the owner of the Mark.)  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who was the owner of the Mark at the time of the writ is liable.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant who had caused the registration of the Mark by the College is also liable. </p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant also purported to use theå¹æ­£name as if it was the owner by granting the Licence.  The plaintiffs carried out investigations,throughå»£å·å¸æºæè¿éç¥è­ç¢æ¬ä»£çæéå¬å¸, as to how theå¹æ­£name was used in connection with the Housing Estateand the Primary School.  ææ­âs evidence is this. </p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> The investigations were carried out byå¼µå, who had left employment in 2005.  On 13 February 2003, the investigator went to thesales office of the Housing Estate.  A sales representative gave him floor plans of the Housing Estate.  At the back of the floorplans, the words âåµå»ºä¸­ä¹å¯¶è¯å¹æ­£å°å­¸â and a red and blue insignia resembling the Insignia with the motto âè³åè³æ­£âappeared.  The representative told the investigator that the Primary School is the âéå¥å°å­¸â of the Housing Estate.  Childrenof the Housing Estateâs residents have priority to enrol as students.  The investigator then went to the construction site.  There,another sales representative told him that the Primary School was set up with the developerâs financial assistance.  The PrimarySchool helped promote the sale of units in the Housing Estate.  Children of the residents, if enrolled with the School, were entitledto subsidy.  On 17 February 2003, the investigator visited the Primary School.  At its entrance is the name of the School and itsred and blue insignia with the motto âè³åå¯æ­£â.  The investigator was received by the deputy principal.  The vice principaltold him that the Primary School was directly authorized to be set up by an entity in Hong Kong, whose name she refused to disclose. She was said that the Primary School and the primary school at the Dongshan Premises wereå¹³ç´å­¸æ ¡.  She further said that whatthe sales representatives told the investigator concerning the Primary School was mere promotional tactics by the developer.  Childrenof the residents of the Housing Estate did not enjoy priority for enrolment or subsidy.  Subsequently, the investigator went to thesales office of the Housing Estate again.  Another representative told him that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant invested in both the Primary School and the College.  In short, the investigations showed that Primary School with theå¹æ­£nameand logo resembling the Insignia had been used to promote the Housing Estate. </p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> What revealed in the investigations showed that the Licence had enabled the Primary School to misrepresent to the public that itis connected or associated with the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  The Primary School, which was being misrepresented in such a way, was used as a selling point to promote the HousingEstate.  Dr Lin opined that it is wrongful under the PRC law (<i>lex loci delicti</i>).  It would likewise be wrongful under Hong Kong Law (<i>lex fori</i>).  In particular, the Licence would constitute a supply of an instrument of deception to enable the Primary School to wrongfullyuse theå¹æ­£name to mislead the public that it is connected or associated with the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  The double actionability rule is satisfied.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is liable.  </p>    <p class="heading"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">K.       the 3<sup>rd</sup> element â Damage</span></p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> It is well settled that the claimant in a passing off action does not have to prove that he has actually suffered damage by lossof business or in any other way.  A probability of damage is enough, but the actual or probable damage to him in his trade or business,that is to say, damage to the goodwill in respect of that trade or business.  See <i>Wadlow</i>, <i>supra</i>, paras. 4-11 at pp. 246-247.  The defendantsâ wrongful conducts had obviously caused damage to the plaintiffsâ goodwill in theå¹æ­£nameand Insignia. </p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> All the three essential elements are satisfied.  I find that the defendants are all liable for passing off. </p>    <p class="heading">L.      THE 2<sup>nd</sup> DEFENDANTâS LIABILITY AS MEMBER OF THE SCHOOL BOARD</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> I now come to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant for breach of his duty of fidelity as member and chairman of its school board.  Here the double actionability rule applies.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> æ±ç´ è­andé³è¡¡édescribed how the school board was set up thus.  After the resumption of theå¹æ­£name, a group of alumni includingthe 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant set up the school board in February 1988 for the purpose of promoting the development of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to become a school of the highest calibre by soliciting and engaging the support ofå¹æ­£alumni everywhere.  Accordingto æ±ç´ è­, å³ç¦ and é³è¡¡é, although the school board was an advisory body, members have always been held in high esteem. The majority of their advice has invariably been followed by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  Dr Lin said that under the PRC law (<i>lex loci delicti</i>), the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as member and chairman of the school board owed a duty of integrity to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  He had acted in breach of such duty by committing the various acts complained of.  Under Hong Kong law (<i>lex fori</i>), he would have owed a duty of fidelity to act in the best interest of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and had breached in breach of such duty by reason of the wrongful acts in question. </p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> I find that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is liable to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff for breach of his duty of fidelity as member and chairman of its school board by committing the wrongful acts complainedof.  </p>    <p class="heading"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">M.     Estoppel</span></p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> For completeness, I would deal with the defence of estoppel very briefly.  The burden rests on the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants to make good the defence on estoppel.  As they were absent at the trial, they have adduced no evidence in support.  Iwill dismiss that plea on this ground alone. </p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> In any event, I do not think the evidence before me is capable of supporting any estoppel as alleged.  Central to the conduct givingrise to the alleged estoppel is the acceptance of donations by way of two cheques dated 24 April 2001 for HK$161,000 and HK$16,100by the Hong Kong å¹æ­£schools.  The two cheques were drawn by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and were accompanied by a cover letter with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs letterhead signed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, stating that âè©²æ¬¾æ¯ä½éå®¹å¥³å£«æåéæç¤ºæ¬åºéææè´çµ¦è²´æ ¡â.  The donations did not come fromthe 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  It came fromä½éå®¹å¥³å£«æåé, a trust fund managed by Ho, who, according to Lee See Yuen, Clement Young KwokHung and Johnny Law Chi Keung, had in the past made similar donations to theå¹æ­£schools using his personal cheques or cheques ofhis various companies.  The plaintiffs treated the donations by way of the two cheques as Hoâs.  See the letter of thanks issuedby Pui Ching Primary School to Ho dated 27 July 2001.  Further, the plaintiffs learnt of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs existence only because of the two cheques.  Almost immediately thereafter, they had demanded the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to change the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs name.  No estoppel could have arisen as alleged. </p>    <p class="heading">N.
