When not engaged in his flying duties for Pan American World Airways, which detainhim in Europe for about two weeks in every four, her husband lives and has lived aboard with her. They keep a couple of dogs.  Overa period of years Mr. Bond has campaigned against what he considers excessive speed by other power-driven pleasure craft.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The ketch, adapted to provide an agreeable home for Mr. and Mrs. Bond, is also used for its ostensible purposes as a sailing andmotor cruiser. It is 57 ft. in length, has a beam of 14 feet, displaces 18 tons and is equiped with an array of radio and navigationaldevices which would not disgrace a spy ship. Mr. Bond is a radio "ham" and transmits "the big weather picture" to sea-going yachts.He holds a master's but not an engineer's certificate of competency from the Marine Department. The plaintiff holds neither. Mr.Bond candidly admits that over a period of years he has, in consequence, been in breach of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/313G/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/313G" class="autolink_findacts">Merchant Shipping (Pleasure Vessels) Regulations</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/281">Cap. 281</a>. In this he is in pari delicto with the defendant who does not hold an engineer's certificate apt for his motor cruiserwhich I shall shortly describe.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Wednesday, the 17th June, 1981 was a hot and sunny day. At about 6.15 p.m. Mr. and Mrs. Bond were minded to take "Clipper-One" intoPort Shelter so that they might enjoy an evening swim. According to their evidence they moved under power into and remained in themiddle of the fairway leading in and out of the Hong Kong Marina and maintained a speed of some 2 to 3 knots. The plaintiff was atthe port side hauling up fenders and coiling ropes while Mr. Bond was at the helm. Half way down the channel Mr. Bond observed alarge white cruiser approaching from the direction of the Man Tau Tsui point ahead of him. It was a 28 foot Bertram, registered number15496, driven by twin petrol fuelled engines, owned and piloted by the defendant who had five others aboard. They were two friends,Stephen and Edmond Wong, an engineer employed by the Hong Kong Marina, Mr. Tse Wai Sum, a boat boy in the same employ, Mr. Ma YungFat, and a friend of Mr. Tse's called Cheng Ngau Chai.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Mr. Bond explained that he steered the ketch into the centre of the fairway, some 40 to 50 metres broad at its narrowest point, inorder to preclude the risk of fouling loose ropes and debris from abandoned vessels albeit he was strictly bound to keep as nearto the outer limit of the starboard side of that channel as was safe and practicable. This duty is expressed in Rule 9A of the InternationalRegulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 which, at the material time, were applicable in Hong Kong waters by reason of theprovisions <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/369/s93.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 93</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/369/s111.html" class="autolink_findacts">111</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/369" class="autolink_findacts">Merchant Shipping (Safety) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/369">Cap. 369</a>. The Governor-in-Council had made no regulations under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/369/s93.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 93.</a></p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> I now quote Mr. Bond's account of the critical events:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"The cruiser turned towards me. Its course appeared erractic. Then it adopted a course coming directly towards my bow. I thought ofsteering to starboard. Correctly I should pass the Bertram on my port side. (Rule 14 of the International Regulations) I had theimpression the Bertram was planing. It was leaving a very large wake. The rate of closure between us was very rapid. Then the Bertramturned slightly to port which would have involved him in passing me to starboard. The bow wave was large. I felt the situation wasdangerous. In such circumstances I felt that my safest course of action was to hand the wheel to my wife and to keep the headingsteady. I did so. I then ran forward down the starboard side of the ketch but did not go as far as the bow. I was about mid-shipsand gestured 'slow down' by raising and lowering my arms and also yelled 'slow down' "</p>            <p>The Bertram was almost upon him when Bond yelled "5, knots maximum". It passed starboard to starboard, at a distance of approximatelytwo metres.</p>            <p>Mr. Bond continued:</p>            <p class="quote">"On the bridge of the Bertram was Tse Wai Sum, the defendant and others. Tse Wai Sum was grinning at me saying 'How many knots?' Thedefendant was grinning also. My ketch heeled heavily to port from the wake of the Bertram. I ended on the port side. I did not fall.I followed the life line aft back to the cockpit where I found my wife on the floor in agony. I took the wheel. The ketch had turnedto port - not more than 45 degrees. I turned right round to starboard to return to Hong Kong Marina. At this stage I noticed theBertram was already entering the Marina".</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> When Mr. Bond used the expression "planing" he said he meant that the bow of the Bertram was out of the water so that he could seethe blue underside of the hull. He said it was "near planing" all the time.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Mrs. Bond, the plaintiff, explained how she came to be in the position in which she was found by her husband:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>We entered the fairway but half way along my husband drew my attention to a power boat coming in very fast. We were doing two to threeknots as a courtesy to other vessels and for safety. I think we were about in the middle of the curved fairway. I stopped coilingropes, came to my husband in the cockpit on the port side and looked at the on-coming boat. At this stage we were just approachingthe red and green buoys. The on coming boat was coming into Hebe Haven at a high speed leaving a large wake. It looked very dangerousto me. It turned right to enter our fairway but did not hold a steady course. Its heading was erratic. Then for a short time it helda head-on course towards us. Then it turned left putting it on our starboard side. My husband said 'Toshie, take the wheel and holdthe heading steady'. I took the wheel immediately and held the course steady. My husband ran forward to the starboard side of theketch about mid-ships. He started motioning with his arms, palms down, and shouting 'slow down, slow-down'. The power boat came closerand closer to us on our starboard side. It did not reduce speed and was leaving a large wake. I felt a sense of danger. I could seethe blue under-side of the white boat. I could hear my husband shouting loudly. Our horn could have made a louder sound. The on-comingboat looked like photograph 3 in Ex. D.4 Bundle 3. When the Bertram came even nearer my husband shouted '5 knots. 5 knots'. I couldsee four to five people on the flying bridge of the Bertram. Near the helm was Mr. Tse Wai Sum. I kept seeing the big wave the Bertramwas creating. I knew the situation was dangerous because of the big wave. So I braced myself very firmly as I kept the course steady.My feet were apart. I held the wheel firmly with both hands. My hands were at 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. I was wearing track-shoes which havea very good grip. They are not laced but have an adhesive grip. Mr. Tse shouted back 'How many knots?' as he passed by to starboard.About two metres separated the vessels. After it passed our stern our ketch heeled heavily to port. The steering wheel itself turnedto the left. This combination threw me instantly onto the deck. I think the Bertram's wave caused the ketch to heel over. It wasas if my whole body was pulled left downwards. I was loosing my balance. The wheel was coming with me. My lower back near the spinehit the deck first. It came into contact with one of the metal rings on a batten secured to the deck which is used on occasion forsecuring a helmsman's chair. I felt a very sharp pain in my back. My husband came to my side almost immediately from the port side.I could not get up though I tried".</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>In cross-examination the plaintiff said she was not paying attention to the position of the ketch in the fairway and that the Bertramwas planing throughout. She agreed that her forward view was to some extent obstructed by the masts of the ketch and by an air-conditioningunit.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The defendant's account of the matter was that he had been testing the engines of his Bertram in Port Shelter. On his return he sloweddown to four or five knots as he passed the Bang Bang Fisheries. He said that at this stage the revolution counters for the Mercury228 engines showed between 1200 to 1300 r.p.m. or 4 to 5 m.p.h.:-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"As I approached the Hong Kong Marina along the star-board of the fairway parallel to Sha Tsui and having passed Man Tau Tsui I sawanother vessel coming directly towards me head-on. The sails were not hoisted. It was some two hundred yards away. I was keepingthe same speed. He did not change his course. I sounded my horn by giving five short blasts to warn the on-coming vessel which wason the wrong course. He should have sailed to his starboard side of the fairway. But in fact he was sailing with his port side closeto the edge of the fairway. Someone on the ketch waved his hands indicating that I should pass to his starboard. I did so. If I hadtried to pass the ketch to port I would have been out of the fairway and might have collided with some of the boats moored adjacentto its edge. I had not altered speed and ensured there were no other vessel about. We were the only two boats on the fairway at thetime. As Mr. Bond waved to me to pass to his starboard side I thought something must be wrong but I did not stop because I was concentratinga hundred percent on my steering in order to avoid a dangerous situation. It would be difficult for him to hear a question from mehaving regard to the distance and the noise from engine and water. Little or no noise was being made by the ketch at one to two knots.But at 1200 r.p.m. the Bertram was making too much noise for me easily to be heard by Mr. Bond."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>Apparently the covers of the engines were off. Nonetheless Mr. and Mrs. Bond purported to have heard what was shouted by Mr. Tse.The defendant said he saw Mr. Bond standing on the bow of the ketch as he made his signals and that he remarked to his companions"This man is crazy. He took the wrong course".</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> What is important is that the defendant stated that he passed the ketch at a distance of between 10 and 20 yards. He did not suggestthat the position of the ketch in the fairway forced him into close proximity with it.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In general terms the defendant's account of the matter was supported by evidence given by Mr. Cheng Ngau Chair, by Mr. Tse Wai Sum,who was testing the Bertram and its engines at the material time, and by the boat-boy Ma Yung Fat. However, I have considerable reserveabout the evidence of these witnesses in so far as they relate to the material incidents since they all made similar statements,which were procured and forwarded by the defendant to the Marine Department at its request, in circumstances which suggested to methat their real concern was to support his version of the matter. As Mr. Ma said "The defendant asked me to prove what happened atthe time". The three of them wrote their statements on the same occasion in the tea-house which forms part of the Hong Kong Marinaand were less than forthcoming in revealing this fact.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> I return to Mr. Bond's evidence about events subsequent to his wife's fall.</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Having reached my berth I grabbed pen and paper and ran along D Dock to encounter the pilot of the Bertram before he could get away.I found the Bertram. The boat-boy was washing it down. Four men were on the other side of the dock. I ran up to them and said 'Whois the owner of that Bertram?' The defendant said 'I am, so what?' I said 'Would you please give your name and address. I intendedto report the matter to the authorities' He said 'If you want it get it from the Hong Kong Marina'. I was very angry. I did not knowmy wife was seriously injured. I did a lot of swearing the defendant swore a bit too. I said 'Are you aware that the maximum speedallowed in this bay is 5 knots?' The defendant laughed and said 'Ha, Ha, it is not effective until the 1st of July'. I said 'That,still does not allow you to operate your vessel in an irresponsible manner that may cause damage or injury to people. So I will tellyou right now I am going to make a full report to the Marine Police and to bring charges against you'. He laughed and said 'Go ahead.Do anything you want to do' as if the whole thing was one big joke. I shook my finger in their faces and did some more swearing".</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr. Bond then described how he saw his wife hobbling towards them; how he helped her back to the car park where she collapsed andhow she was taken to hospital.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Mrs. Bond's account of these exchanges was very similar. She said:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"My husband looked very angry and upset. This was at the berth. I realised that he might get involved in a fight with the people onthe Bertram if he caught them and as there were several of them he might be in trouble. I still had a pain in my back but steppeddown to the dock and hobbled along. I used a hand-line to support myself. I too was upset and angry as I approached B Dock. I heardpeople yelling and shouting; my husband and the Bertram people. I saw three to four people facing me and my husband facing them.I came down the dock in pain still very angry. I hobbled five to six metres before I reached my husband. He turned round and sawme and walked towards me."</p>            <p>The defendant too described the incident in like terms:</p>            <p class="quote">"The boy and I were washing down my boat when I saw Mr. and Mrs. Bond approaching; Mr. Bond leading. He said 'The speed of your boatwas fast and caused the wave which caused my boat to wobble and my wife to fall'. I said 'Mr. Bond I was avoiding you because youwere on the wrong side. My speed was slow. Your wife is behind you. She is not injured in any way.' There was swearing on both sides.Mr. and Mrs. Bond left for the car park."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> When the boat-boy, Mr. Ma, described the incident on the dock he told me that Mr. Bond sounded friendly! As already indicated I placelittle reliance on his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Inspector Yeung Hoi Ko of the Marine Department produced a marked chart of Hebe Haven which has been exhibited as D.3". It purportsto show in blue the course of the ketch and by red dotted line that of the Bertram. It bears a cross in blue pencil. Inspector Yeungsaid that this document has been sent by him to Mr. Bond under cover of a letter dated the 6th August 1981. The letter read:</p>    <p class="quote">                "Dear Sir,</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">                With reference to your complaint on the speed boat 15596 I would be grateful if you would sign your name on the attachedmaps and statements (in duplicate).</p>            <p class="quote">                Please also return one set of each statements and maps (marked with x) to us as soon as possible. Thank you for yourco-operation."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The Inspector said first of all:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"The marks in blue pencil were not on the chart when I sent it to Mr. Bond. They were on it when it was sent back."</p>            <p>And later:</p>            <p class="quote">"The blue asterisk is in similar crayon to the supposed course of the ketch. It is possible that the course was marked on before thechart was dispatched. I do now faintly recall that when the Bonds came to make a statement my superior used the chart ("Ex. D.3")and did something with it in their presence and later found no signature from them on it so the chart was sent to the Bonds so thatthey might sign it. I would not have sent a chart with the defendant's markings to Mr. Bond."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The plaintiff admitted that the statements and charts were sent to her and her husband for signature and that they had signed suchdocuments. She said:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"In the original a red writing-instrument was used. That is in my husband's hand writing. Similar markings appeared on the chart returnedto the Marine Department. We were happy to sign the map showing that the Bertram had passed to starboard. I did not think the dottedlines had any significance."</p>            <p>Mr. Yeung said that they were schematic. Mrs. Bond continued:</p>            <p class="quote">"The chart ("Ex.D.3) is accurate save that it shows us on the port side of the fairway and going outside the fairway on our returnto the Marina and the boats are represented by excessively large symbols."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>It is conceded on her behalf that the red asterisk, the words "see below" and others in red and the signature are in her hand-writing.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> I find on the balance of probabilities that the marks on the chart in question were made by Inspector Yeung's superior followingor contemporaneously with the earlier account of the matter given to him by Mr. and Mrs. Bond and that they acknowledged and acceptedthat account by returning it signed to the Marine Department. This means that the Bonds were navigating their ketch into open wateron their wrong side of the fairway at the material time thereby prompting the defendant to give the interrogatory signal of fiveblasts on his horn, which I find he did, to take evasive action and to pass the ketch starboard to starboard.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> What was really the outstanding feature of this action was the anger and indignation expressed by Mr. Bond; immediately after theincident complained of to the defendant; then to the Marine Department and, more recently, to the Court. This indignation may havebeen fuelled by his continued campaign against motorboat owners who, in restricted conditions, propell their vessels at what he consideredan excessive and inconsiderate speed. Be that as may I regard it as genuine; nonetheless so for the forcefulness with which it wasexpressed. I found myself quite unable to persuade Mr. Bond to use any description more delicate than "arseholes" for those who thusprovoked his wrath.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> If then I find, as I do, that Mr. Bond was expressing genuine indignation from the outset it must follow that there was some reasonfor it. Prima facie at least the reason was that which consistently he has given namely that the speed of the Bertram and its proximityhad caused the ketch to heel over and his wife to fall to the deck and to injure her back in the way she described. Letter beforeaction was dated the 22nd February 1982 and writ claiming damages for negligence was issued on the 15th March following.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> This brings me into the realm of expert evidence. In a sense Mr. Tse Wai Sum was an expert. He holds a master's licence from theMarine Department, has twenty years experience of marine engines and has worked at the Hong Kong Marina for some 12 years. He toldme that a fast moving power cruiser passing close to a larger yacht would cause that larger yacht to roll about to such an extentas possibly to cause a helmsman to loose his grip on the wheel and to fall onto the deck. He further told me "for a Bertram, say,to pass a large yacht at high speed would be a very dangerous manoeuvre".</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> I pass to the evidence of the acknowledged marine experts, the first of whom to be called was Mr. John Hamilton Third, a partnerof Brookes, Bell &amp; Co., marine consultants in this territory. Mr. Third has served as a navigating officer in a variety of oceangoing vessels. He holds a master's foreign-going and extra master's certificates of competency issued by the United Kingdom Departmentof Trade and the Royal Society of Arts Silver Medal for Academic Achievement. One of his particular interests is ship motion andresponse in heavy seas. Mr. Third expressed the view that the capacity of the hull of a power craft to make waves is directly proportionalto the loss of energy characteristics. Therefore the maximum wave effect was to be expected when the power-boat was operating ina medium power range insufficient to provide the dynamic lift required for the craft to plane. In that mode the hull form has a relativelylarge wetted surface and there is significant energy loss. "Certainly such effects will be experienced when the craft is acceleratingfrom full displacement to planing mode and vise versa". I emphasise the words "vise versa".</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Posing to himself the question "Could a helmsman at the wheel of the ketch 'Clipper-One' be thrown to the deck by reason of a wavecaused by a close-passing Bertram:" Mr. Third expressed the view, which was not exactly that opened by Mr. Ford who appeared forthe plaintiff, that he could and, on the footing of the evidence he had read, that the Bertram was at the material time moving ata speed producing something near maximum resistance. This, he said would cause the wheel of the ketch to spin. "The wave effect whenthe Bertram's bow is up could indicate that the Bertram was not planing. You tell by the wash. If clear it is planing. If disturbednot planing. You looked behind the transom. If the Bertram was slowing down there would be increased pressure and if the Bertrampassed some two metres from the ketch there would be little room for the wave it caused to dissipate". However, when he looked atphotograph 3 in Book 3 of Ex.D.4, Mr. Third expressed the view that the Bertram there shown was planing.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Having considered this evidence in the light of all the expertise deployed I believe it to be very difficult for an observer to gaugethe critical moment when a boat is commencing or ceasing to plane, insofar as it changes speed at all, thereby producing maximumwave effect.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> On behalf of the defendant Mr. David Marshall Cauvin was called. He is a British master mariner and a marine surveyor and consultantwithin this territory also. He owns a 50 ft. sailing yacht displacing 18 tons which he has sailed regularly for the past 5 yearsand has great experience of small craft. On the basis of the information given to him, including an interview with the defendantin his solicitors' offices on the 2nd August 1983, he formed the opinion that the wakes thrown out by fast power boats could causea ketch like that of Mr. Bond to roll and its wheel to spin and even, if the power boat passed close enough, to roll 10 or 15 degrees.But at no time had Mr. Cauvin found that the spinning of the wheel on, say, a ketch had sufficient torque to have knocked anyoneover nor had there been sufficient thrust on the rudder from a passing speed boat to spin the wheel hard over.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Mr. Cauvin had carried out certain tests with a Bertram but none at that critical speed between full displacement and planing describedby Mr. Third. He did, however, express this view:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"It would be dangerous for a Bertram travelling at about 20 knots, that is just below planing speed, to pass close to a ketch movingat 2 to 3 knots. This is because of the great bow wave. I feel that such behaviour would endanger both vessels and possibly individualson them. If the ketch were to roll heavily the greater would be the danger to persons on that vessel. I assume that no one wouldrun his boat at just below planing-speed with the accompanying turbulence. That is why I made no test at that speed. Such speed wouldbe the way to cause a slow moving ketch the maximum inconvenience".</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Mr. Cauvin was also asked about the unauthorised manual signals given by Mr. Bond which were apparently understood by the defendantas an invitation to pass the ketch to starboard. I do not think it necessary for me to make any finding in relation to them savethat they were liable to be misunderstood. Rather like the issue as to whether the fairway was straight or curved the efficacy ofMr. Bond's signals has no direct relevance to the issues which I have to determine.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The final piece of evidence to which I should refer in relation to liability is a statement made by one Rosemary Nease admitted inevidence pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 47</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8">Cap. 8</a>. Having regard to its contents it is reasonably apparent to me that Rosemary Nease was indeed an eye-witness. Her statementreads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"I observed A1 Bond on his yacht, 'Clipper-One', leaving his slip at Hong Kong Marina and proceeding to the fairway putting Mr. Bondon a course passing my yacht to leave Shelter Cove - Mr. Bond's wife, Toshi, at the helm. My attention was next drawn to Mr. Bond'syacht when I heard loud shouting and saw a lot of arm waving and motioning - my first observation of the situation was the excessivespeed at which a white cabin cruiser with dark blue trim was travelling. The approximate speed can be easily established by the factthat the cabin cruiser was planing and creating an extremely large wake. In my opinion the cabin cruiser was travelling in excessof 15 knots. Additionally, I noticed the cabin cruiser was very close to Mr. Bond's yacht. In fact, from my point of observation,it appeared that Mr. Bond could have touched the cabin cruiser with his hands if he leaned outboard from his yacht. Another odditywas the fact that the speed boat passed Mr. Bond's yacht to starboard. - My next observation was that Mr. Bond's yacht had reversedit's course and was heading back to the Hong Kong Marina, which seemed unusual".</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Making due allowance for the fact that Rosemary Nease has not been available for cross-examination and is admittedly out of the jurisdictionby reason of her indebtedness to many creditors here I regard this statement as genuine and reliable and so find after taking intoaccount the opinion of Mr. Cauvin that the position of Rosemary Nease's vessel would not have allowed her a very good view of whattranspired if the two vessels passed each other at a particular point on the fairway. I am not, on the evidence available, preparedto say exactly where on the fairway the two vessels in question did pass each other nor to make deductions from "collision mathematics".Certainly I do not regard the word "wake" where it appears in the letter before action and in the Statement of Claim as a term ofart.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> I find on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff fell in the way she described. Her evidence was given with care and confidenceand, as Mr. Ford candidly conceded, was perhaps to be contrasted with the rather aggressive and possibly exaggerated testimony ofher husband. Finding that she so fell I am further satisfied that she did so following the passage to starboard of the Bertram. Fromthis I find that the passage of the Bertram caused the ketch to roll and the rudder violently to move the wheel of the ketch. I also,necessarily, find that at the material time the Bertram must have been moving at the critical speed to which I have already alludedalbeit several witnesses thought that the Bertram had been planing as it approached. It may be that they were right and that thedefendant decreased speed to some slight extent as he turned to port in order to pass the ketch.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> I do not find that "Clipper-One' s" incorrect course on the fairway, failure to sound its horn or the change of helmsman to any degreecaused or contributed to the plaintiff's fall. Had the helmsman attempted to change course on the approach of the Bertram a collisionmight well have ocurred.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> In the premises it falls to consider what duty of care was owed by the defendant to the plaintiff and then whether any such dutywas broken. It is happily common ground between the parties that a duty of care is owed by the helmsman of a powered vessel to othervessels and their occupants which and who may be affected by the course he steers and by the speed at which his craft is propelled.This would appear to involve a fresh application of the doctrine described by Lord Atkin in <u>Donoghue</u> v. <u>Stevenson</u><sup>(0)</sup> at page 580. On the other hand the helmsman is entitled to assume that persons on other craft which may be affected by his steeringor speed will take appropriate measures to protect themselves from the day to day incidents of marine navigation; for example, bybracing themselves and holding on to firm parts of their craft when an unusual wave is to be anticipated. Again it is common groundthat, in this instance, to establish a breach the plaintiff must satisfy the Court both that the defendant's boat passed so fastand also so close to the ketch as to cause the wave or wake or both which in turn caused the ketch to roll and the helmsman, beingproperly braced, to fall and sustain the injuries described by the plaintiff and by Mr. Wedderburn.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> I find that the defendant was in breach of his agreed duty and that the plaintiff's injuries were indeed caused by his speed andproximity to the ketch when passing. "But in all difficulties one owed a duty to one's fellows and a man did not discharge his dutyto his fellows if, in a position where he could stop and take stock" as the defendant with his easily manoeuverable craft could havedone "- he chose merely to proceed" "The Acclivity"<sup>(1)</sup> at page 202 per Langton J. The defendant proceeded even when he thought the ketch was in some sort of trouble.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur has no application to circumstances where so much is known as in the present case. It is not asituation where the plaintiff has proved matters calling for a rebuttal from the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> In relation to damages Mr. Ford has invited me to look to the decisions of the English Courts in order to determine the proper sumto be awarded to the plaintiff. In so doing he necessarily relies upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in <u>Li Ping Sum</u> v. <u>Chan Wai Tong &amp;</u> <u>Ors</u><sup>(2)</sup> where Barker, J.A. giving the judgment of the Court said:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"We think it is helpful in considering what kind of awards should be given in Hong Kong that the Court's attention should be drawnto decisions of other jurisdictions and in particular England."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>This opinion was expressed to depart from that given by Cons, J.A., also giving the judgment of the Court, in <u>Lee Ting Lam</u> v. <u>Leung Kam Ming</u><sup>(3)</sup> at page 659 namely:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"We think now it is accepted without question that in this jurisdiction the appropriate standards are to be found in the decisionsof the Courts of this Colony and not in those of England and Wales or any other jurisdiction."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Faced with this apparent conflict which cannot effectively be resolved until the decision of the Privy Council in <u>Li Ping Sum</u> v. <u>Chan Wai Tong</u> <sup>(2)</sup> a puisne or District judge or a master can only turn to decisions of the Judicial Committee for guidance in making an election. In<u>Jag Singh</u> v. <u>Toong Fong Omnibus Co. Ltd</u> <sup>(4)</sup> at page 1385 Lord Morris of Borth-Y-Gest used these words:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"In deciding this appeal their Lordships think that three considerations may be had in mind:-</p>            <p class="quote"> </p>            <table width="75%" border="0">                <tr>                    <td valign="top" width="10%" class="quote">(3)</td>                    <td width="90%" class="quote">that to the extent to which regard should be had to the range of awards in other cases which are comparable such cases should, asa rule, be those which have been determined in the same jurisdiction or in a neighbouring locality where similar social, economicand industrial conditions exist."</td>                </tr>            </table>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>That passage was approved and followed by the Privy Council as recently as 18th July last in the case of <u>Ratnasingam</u> v<u>. Kow Ah Dek</u><sup>(5)</sup> at page 1237. Both appeals, as a matter of interest, derived from the Federal Court of Malaysia. For the present I propose to lookto decisions of the courts in this territory for guidance. on quantum of damages for personal injuries.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> In hospital the plaintiff was initially subjected to traction. Though X-ray of the spine showed no abnormality a slipped disc wassuspected. She was discharged from hospital after three days but continued to suffer back pain. Indeed, she indicated that she sufferedat least a degree of discomfort while sitting in court. During 1982 a deep water expedition in "Clipper-One" had to be ahandonedbecause the plaintiff suffered considerable pain after operating a winch to reduce sail and in about April of that year she slippedwhile climbing the mast. Again she felt considerable pain in a particular localised area of her back.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Mr. Wedderburn, who has examined the plaintiff on several occasions, found that the site of the pain suggested a fracture of theleft side transverse process of vertebra lumbar 4 albeit no such fracture was apparent on X-ray. Further or alternatively he consideredthat she sustained severe muscle and ligament tears adjacent to it. Prior to the two incidents in 1982 the plaintiff had, in Mr.Wedderburn's view, recovered from the pain and discomfort attributable to the incident in Hebe Haven. It was the sort of injury which,in his view, always heals up completely in the end. This should be particularly true of the plaintiff who is a gymnast and maintainsher physical fittness and agility. I should add that Mr. Wedderburn examined a steel eye of the type screwed to the batten on thedeck of the ketch and expressed the view that if anyone fell backward on to such an eye a fracture-of a lumbar process might wellbe caused.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> In all the circumstances the sum appropriate to compensate Mrs. Bond for pain, inconvenience and loss of amenity is, in my view,HK$22,000.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> By way of special damages the plaintiff claims an agreed sum of US$9,750 being wages loss by Mr. Bond through remaining in Hong Kongto look after her. Two questions seem to arise. The first is whether it was reasonable for Mr. Bond to sacrifice substantial wagesto be at his wife's side and, secondly, whether the amount of these wages is in any event recoverable by the plaintiff in the absenceof her express agreement to reimburse him. In my opinion Mr. Bond's decision to stay with his wife when the gravity of her physicalcondition was uncertain rather than to return to his duties in Europe was quite proper and particularly so when one considers thatthe domestic circumstances of the Bonds were somewhat unusual in that they were living on a boat, which is not quite the same asliving in a house or a hotel or a nursing home. Nurses acquainted with conditions afloat are not readily available. As to the questionof agreement for reimbursement the answer was given by Megaw L.J. in <u>Donnell</u>y v. <u>Joyce</u> <sup>(6)</sup> at page 462 where he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"The loss is the plaintiff's loss. The question from what source the plaintiff's needs have been met, the question who has paid themoney or given the services, the question whether or not the plaintiff is or is not under a legal or moral liability to repay are,so far as the defendant and his liability are concerned, all irrelevant. The plaintiff's loss - is not the expenditure of money -to pay for the nursing attention. His loss is the existence of the need - for those nursing services, the value of which for purposesof damages - for the purpose of the ascertainment of the amount of his loss is the proper and reasonable cost of supplying thoseneeds. That in our judgment is the key to the problem. So far as the defendant is concerned the loss is not someone else's loss.It is the plaintiff's loss".</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> In the present instance Mr. Bond nursed his wife who was in bed for several weeks. He did the chores and he helped her to the bath.In the circumstances I find that the plaintiff reasonably required her husband's help and is entitled to recover by way of specialdamages this agreed figure of US$9,750 or the HK$ equivalent at the time of payment. It is conceded, subject to liability, that thePlaintiff has suffered special damages in the sum of HK$105.00.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">(M.
