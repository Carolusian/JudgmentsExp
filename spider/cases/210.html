D1 had dischargedits delegable duties by engaging independent contractor.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  On such basis, Mr. Lim suggested that D1 has a reasonable prospect of success on appeal and leave to appeal should be granted.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Mr. Lim further submitted that D1 has a high chance of success and thus execution of the Judgment should be stayed.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The Plaintiffâs Stance</u></p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Mr. Wong for the Plaintiff (who also appeared at trial) submitted that the relationship between D1 and D2 was not only that of amain contractor and employee of a sub-sub-contractor, but that of an owner of a vehicle and an authorized driver. As such, it takesthis case out of the general rule regarding liability of main contractor for tort committed by independent contractors and theiremployees.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr. Wong pointed out that Mr. Limâs argument failed to deal with the fact that D1 was the registered owner of the LGV.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Mr. Wong reiterated his argument that in order to determine vicarious liability against D1 as owner of the LGV, the Court had tobe satisfied that (a) D1 had permitted D2 to drive and; (b) D1 had an interest in the trip in question.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  According to Mr. Wong, the Court was not wrong to find that D1 had an interest in the trip whereby D2 was in the course of dischargingdelegated tasks for D1âs project work, having found that D1 had permitted D2 to drive the LGV and that D2 was transporting D1âsroad signs and fences etc. between D1âs sites at the material times.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  It is said the D1, while not seeking to appeal the finding of facts, cannot challenge the finding that D1 had an interest in thetrip (which is based upon finding of facts) and was therefore vicariously liable for D2âs negligent driving.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>D2âs Stance</u></p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mr. Wong, solicitor for D2, also argued that the finding of vicarious liability was based on facts.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Mr. Wong specifically referred to paragraph 80 of the Judgment where I had cited D2âs testimony at trial.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Mr. Wong also referred to <b><i>Ormrod</i></b> and submitted that D1 had an interest in D2âs trip.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Discussion</u></p>    <p class="heading"><u>Leave to Appeal</u></p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The real issue for the intended appeal is whether I should find D1 to be vicariously liable for the tort committed by D2, when Ihave found that D2 was an employee of D1âs sub-sub-contractor.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  I have no quarrel with the general principle cited by Mr. Lim that the employer is not liable for the negligence of an independentcontractor except when the employer failed to discharge non-delegable duties.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  However, I agree with Mr. Wong for the Plaintiff that D1âs argument failed to take into account the fact that D1, being the ownerof the LGV, has permitted D2 to drive the LGV as its agent.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  As cited by Mr. Wong for the Plaintiff and Mr. Wong for D2, I have analyzed the evidence and made finding of facts. See: <b><i>paragraphs 78 to 89, Judgment</i></b>.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  It was based on such findings of facts that I have found D1 has authorized D2 to drive the LGV, that D2 was carrying out a taskor duty delegated from D1. I then concluded that D2 was driving the LGV as agent of D1 at the material time and as such D1 was vicariouslyliable for D2âs negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The reasoning of Deputy Judge Longley in <b><i>So Wing Kwong v.

The real question is whether D1, being the owner of theLGV, has permitted D2 to drive the LGV as its agent.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  I am of the view that <b><i>Ching Kin Sang</i></b> is distinguishable on facts.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Besides, <b><i>Ching Kin Sang</i></b> was decided before <b><i>So Wing Kwong</i></b>, andMr. Recorder Edward Chan Q.C. did not have the benefit of Deputy Judge Longleyâs analysis on authorities like <b><i>Rambarran</i></b> and <b><i>Ormrod</i></b>.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The fact that D2 was an employee of D1âs independent contractor does not mean that D2 could not be D1âs agent in driving theLGV. I see no contradiction to the general principle relied on by Mr. Lim. Any legal principle has to be considered in context withthe factual background of the case.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The Judgment is a conclusion based upon finding of facts.
