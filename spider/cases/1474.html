The Applicant applied on 2nd December, 1998 for recovery of rentalarrears and possession of the premises.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Trial was originally fixed for 3rd February, 1999. However, on 21st January, 1999 the Respondents took out an application for adjournmentof trial on the ground that the Second Respondent would be out of Hong Kong. This application was fixed for hearing on 29th January,1999. On 29th January, 1999 the parties came before me, On that occasion the Respondents were represented by one Mr. Yeung who didnot seem to know anything about the Respondent's circumstances. Other than the assertion that the Second Respondent would be outof Hong Kong there was nothing to support the application for adjournment. I did not think the mere fact that the Second Respondentwould be out of Hong Kong was sufficient ground for re-fixing trial.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The court's file revealed that the Respondents had filed a two page home-made defence. It would be idle to repeat verbatim what issaid in that defence. In gist, the defence does not mention anything about payment of rent. I took it that there was no denial thatrent had not been paid. The defence talked about some action taken by the Applicant about decoration and a signboard which resultedin some alleged loss of business to the Respondent. The defence also talked about notice given by the Applicant to terminate thetenancy but the Respondents wanted continuance and renewal! Mr. Yeung was asked about rental arrears and he said he did not knowsince when rent had not been paid. In my view there was no defence to the claim for rental arrears and the application to refix trialwas a transparent attempt to stall. The defence should be struck out. The amount allegedly owing as rent had accumulated to somethingover $200,000. In the normal course of events, provided the Applicant could prove its case, judgment should be given with the usualprovision for relief against forfeiture. No prejudice could have fallen upon a tenant who has failed to pay rent punctually becausethe provision for relief against forfeiture would ensure that the tenant may stay after clearing up arrears of rent. In the circumstances,I decided to hear evidence from the Applicant.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> According to evidence for the Applicant, there was a proforma tenancy agreement in Chinese relating to the premises. A photocopyof the agreement was produced. It was noted therein that the tenancy commenced on 1st April 1997 at the monthly rent of $69,750 payablemonthly in advance. The tenant named therein was the Second Respondent and a chop impression bearing the firm name of the First Respondentcan be seen at the space for signature by tenant in addition to the signature under the hand of the Second Respondent. The Applicantfurther produced a document signed by the Second Respondent as manager of the First Respondent showing mutual agreement to reducethe monthly rent for the premises to $60,380. The oral evidence of the representative for the Applicant stated that the Respondentshad not paid any rent since 16th October, 1998. That was all the evidence from the Applicant.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> On the basis of the evidence before me which was not contradicted by the defence filed, there was every reason to give judgment forthe Applicant. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to deal with the question of tort or breach of tenancy agreement resulting in thealleged business loss to the Respondents. The Respondents in their defence insisted that the tenancy agreement was continuing andshould be continued and so liability to pay rent must subsist. In my view, the procedure of the Tribunal being informal, it was aproper case for dealing with the case summarily rather than to require the parties to come back a few days later to go through themotions of a trial. Accordingly, order for possession with usual provision for relief against forfeiture under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s21f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.21F</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap. 4</a> and judgment for rental arrears from 16th October, 1998 together with costs at $2,000 was made.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Subsequently, I was informed of the Respondents' application for leave to appeal out of time. Purely my mistake, I thought the applicationfor leave was made to the Tribunal. The fact that the Respondents did not apply for review or appeal in time gave me the impressionthat they were again trying to stall, I therefore gave leave subject to payment of rental arrears up to date into the Tribunal within7 days as security. I thought I could wait for seven days for report of payment into court before I need to hand down judgment. Asit turn out there was no report of payment into court because, naturally, the Respondents had gone to the High Court. I do very muchregret the failure to lay out the reasons for my decision in time before the High Court</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">Z.
