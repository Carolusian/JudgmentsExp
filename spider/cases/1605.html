I make no criticism of this.

The design was filed on 26 March 2003 which according to section 28 of the Registered Design Ordinance,<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/522">Cap.522</a> is the date when the initial period of registration is deemed to run.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> I say this because it is unlikely that the Order 14 judgment would be entered in respect of the âForeign Patentâ referred toin clause 7 of terms and conditions appended to the plaintiffâs purchase order.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Reverting to the Hong Kong registered design there is authority for the proposition that Order 14 judgments can be and are enteredin relation to infringements of a design where it is plain and obvious that there has been an infringement and that the defendantis unable to demonstrate that it has an arguable defence.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In the present case as there is no specific reference in the purchase orders to infringements of registered designs it is necessaryfor the plaintiff to place reliance upon the implied terms referred to in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 14(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26" class="autolink_findacts">Sale of Goods Ordinance</a>.

The Australian High Court was dealing with a breach of warranty butthat makes no difference to the principle.

He endeavoured to establish this contention by reference to the date appendedat the conclusion of the written terms.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> This however is contrary to the affidavit evidence which has not been challenged.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> None of the matters which have been raised by Mr S.C. Lam in his submissions to the court persuade me that his client has an arguabledefence to the plaintiffâs claim in respect of the infringement of USEâs Registered Design and, this being the case, I am satisfiedthat the master was correct when he ordered that judgment should be entered against the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> This then leaves the defendantâs appeal against the decision to grant leave to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> third parties to defend the third party proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Mr S.C. Lam informed me that he did not wish to pursue an appeal against the decision to permit the 2<sup>nd</sup> named third party to defend the proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> So far as the 1<sup>st</sup> named third party is concerned there is one important distinction in the situation prevailing between the plaintiff and the defendanton the one part and between the defendant and the 1<sup>st</sup> named third party of the other part.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> That is the existence of the affirmation evidence to the effect that when the defendant entered into the cooperation agreement withthe 1<sup>st</sup> named third party the defendant was fully aware of the existence of similar types of watch which may well be infringing watches.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> This being the case, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 14(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26" class="autolink_findacts">Sale of Goods Ordinance</a> would apply to the contractual relationship namely that it was only the intention of the parties that the defendant would transferwhatever title it could.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> Once I come to the conclusion that judgment should not be entered against the 1<sup>st</sup> named third party it is preferable that I should not comment at any length upon the issues which will be ventilated at the trial.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> In my opinion, the master was right to order that leave be granted to the 1<sup>st</sup> named third party to defend these proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Both appeals are dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> I make an order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiff and the third parties are to have their costs.</p>	<p> </p>	<p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">		<tr>			<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>			<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Simon Mayo)<br>            Deputy High Court Judge</td>		</tr>		</table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation><p>Mr Raymund Chow, instructed by Messrs Benny Kong &amp;    Peter Tang, for the Plaintiff</p>    <p>Mr Lam Shun Chiu, instructed by Messrs Rebecca Lo &amp; Co., for the     Defendant</p>    <p>Mr Vincent Lam, instructed by Messrs Lau Pau &amp; Co., for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Third     Parties</p></representation><!--sino section text -->   <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2005/1231.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
