The chest wound was sutured and the fracture reduced and a plaster applied and he was discharged on the17th September, 1979. Dr Wedderburn examined the Plaintiff in June, 1982 and advises that if the left hand is the Plaintiff's preferred(or dominant) hand then the impairment of the arm is 14% and of the Whole Man 7%; he also noted that there was a slight residualdisplacement of the hand at the wrist together with a slight swelling and goes on to say that there is a limitation in bending thehand forward which is limited to 30<sup>Â°</sup> as compared with the normal of 80<sup>Â°</sup> and that extension is reduced to 60% as compared with the normal of 80<sup>Â°</sup>. Dr Wedderburn states that the Plaintiff's only complaint is some weakness of the left hand and discomfort in the wrist when theweather changes. He goes on to explain the effect of a Colles fracture and notes that the fracture is very soundly united.</p>    <p><u>GENERAL DAMAGES</u></p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Mr Leung submitted that the award for pain suffering and loss of amenities should be $25,000 and referred me to three cases, as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <table border="0" width="75%">                <tr>                    <td width="22%">Leung Yiu Keung</td>                    <td width="78%"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20Hong%20Kong%20Law%20Journal%20268" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) H.K.L.J. 268</a> where $30,000 was awarded,</td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="22%">Ng Kwok Leung</td>                    <td width="78%"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20Hong%20Kong%20Law%20Journal%20106" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) H.K.L.J. 106</a> where $18,000 was awarded, and</td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="22%">Cheung Luk</td>                    <td width="78%"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20Hong%20Kong%20Law%20Journal%20391" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) H.K.L.J. 391</a> where $15,000 was awarded.</td>                </tr>            </table>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> On the other hand Miss Burgess submitted that the award under this head should be $18,000, and she referred me to the following cases:-</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Tse Po Chi v Fung Hon Tung (HCA 3254/78) where $25,000 was awarded,</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Lo Chun v Ng Kwok Ming  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20Hong%20Kong%20Law%20Journal%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) H.K.L.J. 104</a> where $23,000 was awarded, and</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Chu Sun-kwok v Lee San-king  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20Hong%20Kong%20Law%20Journal%20604" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) H.K.L.J. 604</a> where $30,000 was warded.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> After carefully considering the cases cited to me, and noting that the cases referred to by Mr Leung are more recent, and allowingfor inflation, I am satisfied that an award of $25,000 should be made here.</p>    <p><u>SPECIAL DAMAGES</u></p>    <p>Loss of Earning Capacity</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> It is well settled that in cases of continuing disability the Plaintiff may be able to remain in his employment for some time butwith the risk that, if he loses that employment at some time in the future, he may then, as a result of his injury, he at a disadvantagein getting another job or an equally well-paid job. There is, in the light of evidence led in this case, a real risk that the Plaintiffwill lose his present employment with the passage of time and that as a result of his injury he will be at a disadvantage in gettinganother job. Admittedly assessment of damages under this head is highly speculative and no real mathematical approach is feasiblebut it is important to state hero quite unequivocally that I am satisfied that there is a real risk that the Plaintiff will be subjectto the disadvantage before the end of his working life and so I must do my best to value what has been called "the chance" takinginto account all the facts of the case.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Mr. Leung submitted that on a lump sum basis the award should be in the range $30,000 to $35,000 and he referred me to:-</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Moeliker v A.

R. 9.</a></p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> My task is not made easier in this particular case if only because the Plaintiff's present employment appears to be so tenuous; forwhilst the Plaintiff and a representative of his employer gave very full evidence of the Plaintiff's somewhat bleak prospects andthis evidence was exhaustively cross-examined by Miss Burgess but I regret to say that at the end of he day it was still not madeclear to me how long the Plaintiff could be expected to be retained by his present employers. I venture to think that Dr Wedderburncame closer to the realities of the situation when he reported:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Before the accident he worked as an engineer in a textile factory. He supervised, maintained machines, gave advice regarding newequipment, and was involved in some design of machines. He frequently had to lift heavy objects. He returned to the same job andhis pay has been maintained and he has had increments in line with that of other workers so he has suffered no earning loss. He cando the work adequately but does have some difficulty lifting heavy weights. Ho is obviously a trained man and must be employed becauseof his experience rather than his physical activity."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> As I understand the position the factory is now virtually closed down, much of the machinery has been sold but for all that the Plaintiffhas been retained, although it seems to me that his previous job of engineer has become downgraded to one of a caretaker. Happilyfor him there. has been no change in his salary status thus far. I venture to suppose that this state of affairs could continue almostindefinitely although commonsense suggests that certainly at some time in the future the owners of this factory will seek to disposeof the premises or convert them for other uses when there is a real and substantial risk that the Plaintiff's services will be dispensedwith.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> So it thus becomes apparent that in striving to arrive at an equitable assessment, it is, in the last analysis, something of "a leapin the dark". I have kept in mind that the plaintiff is now 44 years old and is certainly handicapped as a result of the accidentin that, amongst other things, he cannot now pick up heavy objects. I therefore adopt the general tests used by Silke J., (as hethen was) (in Man Chuen v Cheung Ka Kui and Chow Keung Kwong v Cheung Ka Kui 1978 No's 2455/6) i.e.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The risk that the Plaintiff will, at some time before end of his working life be thrown on to the labour market; his age and qualifications;the nature of his injury."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Applying those tests to the present case and having carefully considered the authorities cited to me I award $30,000 under this head.There will, of course, be no interest on this award. (Clarke v Rotax Aircraft Equipment Ltd (Court of Appeal  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%201%20WLR%201570" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 1 W.L.R. 1570)</a></p>    <p><u>Loss of earnings</u></p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The Plaintiff did not work from the 13th September, 1979 until the let January, 1980 ($w,300 x 3Â½ = $8,050, from that sum $1,500paid to him by his employer should be deducted = $6,550. This claim was agreed and is allowed in the sum of $6,550.</p>    <p><u>Loss of the Plaintiff's wife earnings</u></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Mr. Leung drew my attention to the fact that this item had been revised in the amended statement of claim and now stood at ($300x 38Â½ weeks) which results in a claim of $11,550. In support of the claim Mr Leung referred to <u>Donnelly v Joyce</u> +  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%201%20QB%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 1 Q.B. 454</a> where the Court of Appeal <u>held</u> that since the loss to the plaintiff caused by the defendant's wrongdoing included the existence of the need for the nursing servicesprovided by his mother he was entitled to recover her loss of wages as the proper and reasonable cost of supplying that need. ButMr Leung did concede that if it was considered that the claim extended over too long a period it might be curtailed. He said thatthe Plaintiff's wife was undoubtedly aggrieved by the accident the Plaintiff had sustained. It was in these circumstances that hewas prepared to leave the period for my determination and finally submitted that the multiplicand should not be less than $200.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Miss Burgess for her part vigorously opposed that any award should be made under this head. In support of her contention she cited<u>Schneider v Eisovitch / Same v Same  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281960%29%202%20QB%20430" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1960) 2 Q.B. 430</a></u> at p. 440 where Paull, J., said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <table border="0" width="75%">                <tr>                    <td width="100%" class="quote">"......Before such a sum can be recovered the Plaintiff must show first that the services rendered were reasonably necessary as aconsequence of the tortfeasor's tort; secondly, that the out-of-pocket expenses of the friend or friends who rendered these servicesare reasonable, bearing in mind all the circumstances including whether expenses would have been incurred had the friend or friendsnot assisted; and, thirdly, that the Plaintiff undertakes to pay the sum awarded to the friend or friends......."</td>                </tr>            </table>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Miss Burgess in a very close cross-examination of the Plaintiff's wife got this lady to say that she had not worked when her husbandwas at home because she was "not in the mood". From the evidence it was clear that when the Plaintiff's wife did work she workedat home in her own time, and that the care of her husband was not a full-time occupation. In the last analysis L accept that thePlaintiff's wife certainly did look after the plaintiff, bathing him and attending him generally; but that this was not in any waya whole day's activity. She could I find have done her daily piece work had she so wished, but she chose not to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> I have also kept in mind that whilst at home the plaintiff was fully ambulatory and would generally be able to look after himselfso that his fractured left wrist (in plaster) and other injuries would not have incapacitated him unduly; although I accept he wouldhave needed some assistance with his ablutions etc.; so that L believe that this case can be distinguished if only on the facts from<u>Donnelly v Joyce</u> which concerned a claim for a mother's nursing services to her infant son who required special bathing and daily dressings for somesix months after his discharge from hospital. On the evidence and the authorities cited to me I have come to the conclusion thatno award should be made under this particular head.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> There were other claims under SPECIAL DAMAGES, as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <table border="0" width="75%">                <tr>                    <td width="76%" valign="top">Damaged clothing</td>                    <td width="24%" style="text-align:right">                        <p style="text-align:right">$90</p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="76%" valign="top">Damaged watch</td>                    <td width="24%" style="text-align:right">                        <p style="text-align:right">$50</p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="76%" valign="top">Damaged pen</td>                    <td width="24%" style="text-align:right">                        <p style="text-align:right">$50</p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="76%" valign="top">Damaged shoes</td>                    <td width="24%" style="text-align:right">                        <p style="text-align:right">$70</p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="76%" valign="top">Travelling expenses of wife of plaintiff</td>                    <td width="24%" style="text-align:right">$70</td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="76%" valign="top">Hospital fees</td>                    <td width="24%" style="text-align:right">                        <p style="text-align:right">$25</p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="76%" valign="top">Clinic fees</td>                    <td width="24%" style="text-align:right">                        <p style="text-align:right">$120</p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="76%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="24%" style="text-align:right">                        <p style="text-align:right">____</p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="76%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="24%" style="text-align:right">                        <p style="text-align:right">$475</p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="76%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="24%" style="text-align:right">                        <p style="text-align:right">====</p>                    </td>                </tr>            </table>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> These claims were agreed and are allowed in the sum of $475.</p>    <p><u>Special Foods</u></p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> There is claim for $1,000 under this head. Mr Leung referred me to <u>Yu Ki and Chin Kit-lam and Another</u> (High Court)(Civil Action No. 2224 of 1980) where the Chief Justice <u>held:-</u></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Despite the absence of the supporting evidence as to the advisability or suitability of nourishing food to assist the recovery ofthe injured peron as discussed in Mui Ling-kwan v Wong Yiu-wah  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20HKLR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) H.K.L.R. 465</a> it was proper to allow a nominal sum where relatives have spent this on food which the injured peron or relative reasonably believedto be helpful to the patient's recovery. $10 a day for additional food during the period the plaintiff was in hospital only, wasallowed: a total of $350."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and submitted that a nominal sum was usually awarded in these sort of cases and said that on the basis of the plaintiff's wife evidenceI should award ($375 + $67.50)=$442.50 under this head.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Miss Burgess on the other hand whilst agreeing that a nominal sum should be awarded submitted that this should be computed on thebasis of (10 days x $10) = $100, and she also relied on the Chief Justice's judgment (supra) in support of her submission.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> In this case there was no evidence that any doctor, or herbalist, or person with any medical knowledge, had suggested that the nourishingfood which was supplied was advisable or suitable; only the plaintiff and his wife gave evidence on this aspect of the claim; shesaid that she had heard that pork cooked with herbs called 'Tin Chat' would be good for the plaintiff and stated that it cost about$30 each time and that she had supplied this to her husband for about a month at a cost of about $1,000. The plaintiff confirmedthis to the extent of stating:........</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"as far as we Chinese are concerned we believe that the Chinese herbs would help ........ I believe so........".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> In the particular circumstances of this case I believe that there should be a nominal award of $400 under this head.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> On the question of interest Miss Burgess concurred in Mr. Leung's invitation that I should follow the Court of Appeal in <u>Wong Yuk Chau The Kowloon Motor Bus Cc (1933) Ltd and Tang Suk Yee, Daisy</u> (Civil Appeal No. 13 of 1983) but I learnt after the conclusion of the hearing that there was a possibility that the Court of Appealmight revise their views on interest in the light of <u>Wright v British Railways Board</u> (The Times 29th June, 1983) following <u>Birkett v Hayes</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%201%20WLR%20816" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 1 W.L.R. 816</a>; and so I decided to defer the delivery of this assessment and on the 22nd July, I received a copy of an extract from the judgmentof Fuad J. A., in <u>Leung Ngan and Ng Chai Man/Kowloon Motor Bus Co (1933) Ltd</u> (Civil Appeal No. 55 of 1983) dated 19th June, in which it is stated, <u>inter alia,</u> that ........</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"the new guideline should therefore be that the rate of interest to be awarded in personal injury actions on damages for non-economicloss should be 2% subject to the discretion we emphasised in Wong Yuk Chau......"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> There will therefore be interest on the General Damages for pain suffering and loss of amenities at the rate of 2% per annum fromthe date of service of the writ until judgment; and at the rate of 5.5% per annum in respect of Special Damages in the sum of $7,425from the date of accident until judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> There will be costs to the Plaintiff with a Certificate for Counsel.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" height="47"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" height="43">                (J.
