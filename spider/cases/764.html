During the course of fiveand half yearsâ engagement, the Defendants were not satisfied with the Plaintiffâs services and engaged a solicitorsâ firm,Messrs Kong &amp; Tang, to replace the Plaintiff on 7 August 2002.  Messrs Kong &amp; Tang brought the tax dispute to a conclusionwithin four months on 21 October 2002.  The Defendants refused to pay for the Plaintiffâs services.  The Plaintiff instituted thepresent action to recover his fees and the Defendants counterclaimed for breach of express or implied terms of the Plaintiffâsretainer and in negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Presumably acting under the belief that it was unprofessional or illegal to charge fees on a contingency basis and for tacticalreasons, the Plaintiff launched his case on the basis of a retainer at an hourly rate of $3,500.  That evidence was disbelieved andI dismissed the substantial part of his claim, save for a claim of disbursement of $15,000 for counselâs fee which was admittedby the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in the course of his evidence and later confirmed by his counsel after taking full instruction. </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The Defendantsâ counterclaim is based on an implied duty in tort and in contract to take all necessary steps to reduce and mitigatethe Defendantsâ tax liability which included the duty to advise the Defendants to make available another sum of $7.5 million topurchase tax reserve certificates in payment of the additional tax instead of applying the $7.5 million deposit held by the Commissionerof Inland Revenue towards payment of the additional tax.  Tax reserve certificates are interest earning while the deposit held bythe Commissioner of Inland Revenue is not.  Thus, in the event of a successful objection to the additional tax assessed, the excesstax paid by tax reserve certificates would be refunded with interest, while the excess tax paid by the deposit would not be refundedwith interest.  I was satisfied that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was fully appraised of the situation and that the Plaintiff had made reasonable effort in the discharge of his duty withinthe very narrow time frame that was then available to him.  I dismissed the Defendantsâ counterclaim on the basis that the Defendantsfailed to discharge their burden of proving that the Plaintiff was in breach of his duty.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  I entered judgment in favour of the Plaintiffâs claim and dismissed the Defendantsâ counterclaim.  I made a costs order nisithat there be no order as to costs on the Plaintiffâs claim and that the Defendants shall pay the Plaintiffâs costs on the counterclaim,to be taxed if not agreed.  The Defendants filed a Notice of Appeal on 3 May 2006 to appeal against my decision in dismissing theircounterclaim.  On 21 July 2006, Mr Alexander Wong, who represented the Defendants at the original trial, sought a review of my costsorder nisi.  I did not feel I was precluded from reviewing my costs order nisi by reason of the Notice of Appeal having been filedagainst my decision and heard Mr Wongâs application.</p>    <p class="heading">The costs order for the Plaintiffâs claim</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The thrust of Mr Wongâs application is that the Plaintiff has recovered only a nominal sum of $15,000 not by merit but by concessionfrom the Defendants at the outset.  He argues that the Plaintiff was unable to establish anything of the least value to him and shouldnot be regarded as a successful plaintiff.  He submits that the Defendants should be treated as the successful party and should beawarded the costs of the claim.  In support of his argument, he quoted paragraph 62/2/6 of the <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2006</i> Vol 1 which reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ Where plaintiffs in an action for breach of contract recover only nominal damages and do not established anything which isof the least value to them, they are not to be regarded as successful plaintiffs, and the court will normally treat the defendantsas having succeeded and award the defendants the costs of the action, whether or not the defendants have at any stage made a paymentinto court of nominal damages (<i>Anglo-Cyprian Trade Agencies Ltd v Paphos Wine Industries Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1951%5d%201%20All%20ER%20873" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1951] 1 All ER 873</a>; <i>Alltrans Express Ltd v CVA Holdings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20WLR%20394" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 WLR 394)â</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  I have no doubt that the statement of law quoted by the learned authors is correct and is supported by authorities.  However, MrWong is both wrong on the facts and on the law.  On the facts, the counselâs fee was not admitted by the Defendants at the outset. It was not admitted in the pleading and was never paid at all.  It was only admitted by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant under cross-examination when giving evidence for the defence case.  It is also incorrect to argue that the counselâsfee could not be proved by the Plaintiff and was given away the Defendants by way of admission.  The fee could not be disputed despitethe unfavourable view I formed of the Plaintiffâs credibility.  On the law, the fee is not a nominal sum.  In <i>Mediana</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1900%5d%20AC%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1900] AC 113</a>, the Lord Chancellor, the Earl of Halsbury, held at 116:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âNominal damages is awarded when the plaintiff or the claimant cannot prove any actual damages at all.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The law presumes that damage is suffered in any breach of contract or in any tortious conduct.  If an injured party is unable to provethe quantum of loss suffered, a nominal award on an arbitrary basis is given to mark the infringement of the injured partyâs right. The counselâs fee of $15,000 was a reimbursement and a quantified sum.  It was not a small sum or a token amount, though it wasinsignificant when compared with the amount claimed by the Plaintiff.  Even a small sum does not cease to be a sum of substance andbecomes a nominal sum by reason only of its being small in absolute term or insignificant in relative term.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Mr Wong further argues that the amount awarded was nominal in the sense that it was not for any damage suffered by the Plaintiffbecause it was counselâs fee which would not really go to the pocket of the Plaintiff.  With respect, that argument is convoluted. If the Defendants failed to reimburse the Plaintiff of his expenses, the Plaintiff suffered damage.  This is not the case that thePlaintiff could not quantify his damage which makes it necessary for the Court to arbitrarily award a nominal amount.  The amountis determined by the sum that the Plaintiff had paid or was obliged to pay counsel and is awarded on that basis.  I am firmly ofthe view that the award is not an award of nominal damages.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Mr Yee, Counsel for the Plaintiff, refers me to my judgment in <i>In re Kwan Kai Ming</i>, HCMP 2996 of 1990, in which I adopted the principle in the English Court of Appeal in <i>Ritter v Godfrey</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1920%5d%202%20KB%2047" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1920] 2 KB 47.</a>  But I do not think <i>In re Kwan Kai Ming</i> or <i>Ritter v Godfrey</i> are helpful to the Plaintiff or the Defendants.  The principle in <i>Ritter v Godfrey</i> is applicable only to the case of a wholly successful litigant.  Neither party to this litigation can be regarded as a wholly successfullitigant.  Atkin LJ, as he then was, said at 60:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is not easy to deduce from these authorities what the precise principles are that are to guide a judge in exercising his discretionover costs.  And yet as the discretion is only to be exercised where there are materials upon which to exercise it, it seems importantto ascertain the principles upon which a judge is to discern whether the necessary materials exist.  In the case of a wholly successfuldefendant, in my opinion the judge must give the defendant his costs unless there is evidence that the defendant (1) brought aboutthe litigation, or (2) has done something connected with the institution or the conduct of the suit calculated to occasion unnecessarylitigation and expense, or (3) has done some wrongful act in the course of the transaction of which the plaintiff complains.  Theseprinciples require further expansion.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Furthermore, <i>Ritter v Godfrey</i> is of no assistance to the Plaintiff for the purpose of depriving the Defendants of their costs even assuming they were wholly successful,because the Defendantsâ conduct fell outside the three categories of conduct defined by Atkin LJ.  The Defendantsâ conduct wasin breach of the retainer but it did not bring about the litigation in the sense as required by <i>Ritter v Godfrey</i> in that it has the effect of inducing a belief in the Plaintiffâs mind that he has a good cause of action.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs evidence was believed.  Accordingly, the Defendants have not done anything connected with the institution or conductof the proceeding calculated to occasion unnecessary costs.  The Defendants were faced with a false case.  They defended by pleadingthe true facts.  They have not done anything wrongful in the course of the transaction of which the Plaintiff complains.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Where neither party is wholly successful, the court has a much wider discretion as regards costs.  The court must first identifywhich is the successful party in the circumstances, i.e. the party who can be regarded as being overall successful.  The generalrule then applies.  Costs should follow the event, unless where it appears to the court that in the circumstances of the case someother costs order should be made: Order 62 rule 3(2) of the Rules of the High Court.  The overriding principle is overall fairnessin all the circumstances of the case.  Sometimes, the court would apportion the costs according to the extent to which the partyis successful but having regard to the extent to which that party is not.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Mr Wong reminds me of the various parts of my judgment in which I criticised the Plaintiffâs credibility and for launching a casenot in accordance with the true facts.  He submits that in that light and having regard to the amount awarded as compared with theamount of the claim, the Plaintiff should not be regarded as even a partially successful litigant.  The Plaintiff has his penaltyfor launching a false case.  He has in reality substantially lost.  But his claim for the reimbursement is genuine and incontrovertiblewhether he was retained at an hourly rate as he alleged or on the basis of contingency fee as the Defendants alleged.  He has obtainedan award.  The award, as I have held, is not one for nominal damages.  On the other hand, the Defendants were resisting the entiretyof the Plaintiffâs claim including that reimbursement until the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was being cross-examined when giving evidence as part of the Defendantsâ case.  The Plaintiff could not have recoveredthe reimbursement had he not instituted this action.  He could not be treated as having wholly lost in the action.  Had he pleadedhis case properly and given evidence according to the true facts, he could have succeeded at least on a <i>quantum meruit</i> basis.  I think it is more appropriate to treat the Plaintiff as one who is overall successful, though only to a small extent.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Thus the general rule that costs to follow the event should apply unless fairness in all the circumstances requires a differentorder to be made.  In terms of quantum, the amount awarded is only a small fraction of the amount claimed.  Similarly, the time spentby the Plaintiff in proving the reimbursement is also negligible when compared with the time spent in proving the retainer on anhourly basis.  But having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including in particular, the extent to which the Plaintiffis successful and the extent to which he is not, I think overall fairness requires not only that I should not apportion any coststo the Plaintiff but I should deprive him of his costs altogether.  Accordingly, I confirm my cost order in respect of the Plaintiffâsclaim.</p>    <p class="heading">The costs order for the Defendantsâ counterclaim</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  As for the Defendantsâ counterclaim, the Plaintiff is wholly successful while the Defendants are wholly unsuccessful.  The generalrule that costs to follow the event is applicable.  Mr Wong seeks to persuade me to depart from that general rule for the followingthree reasons.  Firstly, he refers me to my finding of fact that it was unrealistic to expect the Defendants as laymen would givespecific instructions in respect of each and every aspect of the work to the Plaintiff as a professional adviser, that the Defendantshave provedan implied duty in tort and in contract to take all necessary steps to reduce and mitigate the Defendantsâ tax liability,and that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was fully appraised of the situation.  Then he argues that in that light, I have criticised that the Plaintiffâs advice,though adequate, could have been made more explicitly. Secondly, he argues that the Plaintiff succeeded merely because the Defendantsfailed to discharge the burden of showing that Plaintiffâs discharge of duty was below the standard of a reasonably competent accountant. In my view, it is always incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove his claim.  If a plaintiff could not prove his case even by a smallmargin, he has failed.  The usual consequence of costs follows unless there are exceptional circumstances.  That he is almost successfulis not an exceptional circumstance and cannot mitigate his costs consequence.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Mr Wongâs third and major argument is that the evidence in respect of the counterclaim is mostly intertwined with the evidenceof the Plaintiffâs claim.  Hence he argues that there should be no order as to costs on the counterclaim or as a fall back thatthe Plaintiff should only have half of the costs of the counterclaim.  If indeed the evidence in respect of the counterclaim andthe Plaintiffâs claim is mostly intertwined, it could have an impact on the costs order.  However, on the Plaintiffâs claim andthe Defendantsâ counterclaim as summarised in paragraphs 2 and 3 above, it is obvious that the issues for the two cases are verydistinct and clearly defined.  The issue in the Plaintiffâs case is about the retainer while the issue in the Defendantsâ counterclaimis about one specific advice.  The evidence of the two cases is not intertwined.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In respect of the costs of the counterclaim, the Plaintiff is wholly successful and there are no special circumstances to justifya departure from the general rule that costs to follow the event.
