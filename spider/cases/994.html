The question was whether a will was revoked by a subsequent marriage in the followingcircumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The testator, who has been referred to and to whom I shall continue to refer as "the deceased", was married in 1951. By that marriagebefore his wife died in 1963, he had four children. They are the four defendants/respondents in these proceedings. After the firstwife's death the deceased contracted a Chinese customary marriage with the 1st plaintiff/respondent on 28 February 1966 ("the customarymarriage"). In June 1985, some 19 years later, the deceased and the 1st plaintiff contracted a second marriage under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.38</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181">Cap. 181</a> ("the registry marriage"). The 2nd, 3rd and 4th plaintiffs/appellants are the children of that marriage.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The deceased died on 21 March 1996. Sometime later, the defendants produced the will that is the subject of these proceedings, whichthey say was executed by the deceased on 27 July 1967. Under the will, the defendants are named executors and are the only beneficiariesof the estate. There is no other testamentary document. For the purpose of the determination of the question under O14A r1, the partiesaccept the will as authentic.</p>    <p class="heading">The question of law for determination</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The question of law for determination was whether the registry marriage had the effect of revoking the will.</p>    <p class="heading">The decision below</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Two main submissions were made to Chan CJHC before whom the matter came for determination. The first was that the registry marriagewas not a valid marriage primarily because the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/178" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Reform Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/178">Cap. 178</a> provided a comprehensive code for customary marriages after it came into operation in 1971, and precluded parties to a customarymarriage from contracting marriages under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 38</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181">Cap. 181</a>. This was very much the primary submission which was developed in great detail by leading counsel who appeared below, andinvolved a detailed exposition of relevant provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> and related marriage legislation and their chronology.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The second and very much the subordinate submission, made in the alternative, was that the registry marriage was not a subsequentmarriage within the meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a>, the revocation provision. Although it was a "subsequent marriage" in time, it was submitted that it was not a "subsequent marriage"in effect.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Following a very careful examination of the relevant matrimonial legislation and the principal authority relied on, Chan CJHC rejectedthe first submission. He also rejected the second submission giving his reasons.</p>    <p class="heading">The appellant's case and grounds of appeal</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> In their notice of appeal the appellants relied upon several grounds of appeal but these can all be seen as aspects of the two submissionsmade below, in particular the subordinate, alternative submission.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Mr Dennis Chang SC, who with Ms Cissy Lam appeared for the appellants, but did not appear below, only made submissions pursuing thealternative submission below. While not abandoning the primary submission below, he made no submissions upon it and simply adoptedthe written submissions of leading counsel below in the alternative if his own submissions were not accepted. The essence of hissubmissions, which contended for a purposive construction of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a> was as follows. Marriage has at least two ordinary meanings, i.e. primarily the relationship or status of marriage, and second theceremony of marriage. This ambiguity had to be resolved by reference to its statutory context and the statute's apparent purpose.The purpose of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a> must be to revoke a will upon the subsequent marriage of a testator because of the fundamentally changed new relationship which requiresnew obligations and liabilities to be catered for. Thus, it was status that the word "marriage" in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a> must have been intended to refer, and not the ceremony. The law and circumstances here show that there was no change of relationshipor status on the contraction of the registry marriage. The status and relationship of the parties immediately before that marriagewas one of a monogamous marriage in fact and <em>de jure</em> and it remained a monogamous marriage in fact and <em>de jure</em> after that ceremony. Moreover the purposive construction he contended for was required by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 19</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap. 1</a>).</p>    <p class="heading"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 13(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a></p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> This, at the time of the registry marriage, provided as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A will shall be revoked by the subsequent marriage of the testator except a will expressed to be made in contemplation of that marriage."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Meaning of "marriage" - the ambiguity</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Mr Chang contends that "marriage" has two meanings, i.e. the status or relationship between husband and wife, which he contends isthe primary meaning, and the ceremony of marriage by which that status or relationship is created. I doubt whether authority is neededfor the proposition that "marriage" has those two meanings. However, I will record that Mr Chang relies first upon <strong>Harvey v. Farnie</strong> (1881) 6PD 35 CA, in which Cotton LJ said at p. 47:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I think a great deal of the difficulty in this case has arisen from the ambiguous use of the word 'English marriage' ... The fallacylies in this: the word 'marriage' is used in two senses. It may mean t<em>he solemnity by which two persons are joined together in wedlock, or it may mean their status</em> when they are so joined. ..." (emphasis supplied)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr Chang points also to the following definition in the Oxford English Dictionary:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The condition of being a husband or wife; <em>the relation</em> between married persons; spousehood, wedlock." (emphasis supplied)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and in the same dictionary following upon the foregoing:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Entrance into wedlock; the action, or an act, of marrying; the <em>ceremony or procedure</em> by which two persons are made husband and wife." (emphasis supplied)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He contends that because the former appears first, it is the primary meaning. He points also to s. 57 of the Offences Against ThePersons Act 1861 of England which defines bigamy in the following way:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Whosoever, <em>being married</em>, shall <em>marry</em> any other person during the life of the former husband or wife, whether the second <em>marriage</em> shall have taken place in England or Ireland or elsewhere." (emphasis supplied)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Here he submits that being married refers to the relationship and not a ceremony, and the words "shall marry" and "second marriage"as being references to a marriage ceremony, moreover one which is unlawful and cannot bring into existence a new status. The last,he suggests, may be a third meaning.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> He points out that it is usually unnecessary to make a choice under s. 13 between the two meanings because both produce the sameanswer, and that therefore the ambiguity does not usually have to be resolved. In the present case, however, the ambiguity has tobe resolved; and it must be resolved by its statutory context and apparent purpose.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Mr Robert Tang SC, who with Mr Nelson Miu, appears for the plaintiffs/respondents, having also appeared for them below, does notoppose the contention that "marriage" has two meanings. In fact, he says, there might be four, pointing to marriages by repute.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Given, as appears to be the case, that s. 13 is ambiguous, the legal meaning as stated by Bennion (section 152, p. 323 StatutoryInterpretation, 2nd Edn), is the one to which on balance the factors arising from the relevant interpretative criteria accord thegreater weight. A significant factor in the circumstances must be the purpose of s. 13. Until that is identified, it is necessarytherefore to defer the resolution of the ambiguity.</p>    <p class="heading">Interpretation of section 13 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a></p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> It is well to recall that what falls to be interpreted are the words emphasised in the following part of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13:</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A will shall be revoked by the <em>subsequent marriage</em> of the testator."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>On the face of those words, it has to be said that they are quite clear and there is no ambiguity. As Mr Chang himself put it, therespondents' argument can be put very simply:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The registry marriage in 1985 was a "marriage".</p>        <p>(2) That "marriage" was subsequent to the 1967 will.</p>        <p>(3) It therefore revoked the will.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He concedes that it has the merit of simplicity but submits this is at the expense of logic and over-simplifies the matter, adoptinga mechanistic, illogical and unnecessary interpretation of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13.</a> He submits that what triggers revocation is the beginning of a new "marriage", with a new and changed relationship between, and newstatus for, the parties to the new "marriage". If <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a> were construed as revoking a will where the trigger for revocation was a marriage ceremony which does not have those effects, i.e.is not the beginning of a new marriage nor the initiator of a new and changed relationship between, and new status for, the parties,this would be contrary to any apparent or rational purpose that could be attributed to the provision for revocation in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13.</a></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The word "marriage" in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a>, he submits, cannot, sensibly or consistently with the apparent purpose of the provision, be interpreted as referring simply andnarrowly to a marriage ceremony whether or not it is the beginning of a new marriage relationship and a new status for the parties.Implicit in that submission is that there must be such a new relationship or status. It matters not, he submits, that the new maritalrelationship and new status involved a total or fundamental change, or a minor change, or even virtually no change. What <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a> requires is a new marriage relationship and a new status. In the context of the ambiguity he relies upon, Mr Chang is entitled tomake that submission, notwithstanding that, as will be seen, what he submits primarily in the context of his contention for a purposiveconstruction, is that the purpose of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a> is related exclusively to the first of the foregoing three options, i.e. a fundamental change in a person's life or a total changein the situation of the testator's family. While that is an independent submission, Mr Chang also relies upon a purposive constructionin the present context of the ambiguity in the meaning of marriage. The purpose identified is significantly narrower than the meaningsof the word "marriage", as will be seen; nevertheless it could be said that it lends some support to Mr Chang's contention that marriagemust mean the ceremony as opposed to status. On the other hand, such support cannot be significant, given that the purpose couldbe achieved almost wholly by reference to a valid or legally recognised ceremony.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> However all these matters may be, the answer to Mr Chang's submission upon the ambiguity in the meaning of marriage must lie in thefollowing considerations.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> That "marriage" might have several meanings does not mean that only one of them must apply. The context may point to all, some orindeed one as the proper meaning. Here, it seems to me that the context does not demand or even point exclusively to the meaningcontended for. Why should a valid marriage ceremony be thought not to be the trigger intended by the legislature? That is in anycase a plain meaning of the words of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a>, even if it may possibly not provide for some of one relatively very minor group of marriages, i.e. under s. 38(2). It is well tonote that this is just one such case and yet the feature thrown up, which has precipitated the present proceedings, must be an unusualone. This is that the will was made after the customary marriage, and presumably was made for the purpose of providing for the effectsof the marriage. It was this very same customary marriage that was "solemnised" by the s. 38(2) marriage. Yet, it is that solemnisationthat the customary marriage family rely upon to effect the revocation of the will and so secure to them a major part of the estate.The opposite scenario might be thought to be more or just as likely in reality.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> It may also be thought that if a resulting relationship or status of the requisite nature had to be established in every case ofa marriage contracted subsequent to the making of a will, that would hardly have been regarded as an acceptable remedy or purpose.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> I do not find it necessary to canvass the consideration further. Suffice it to say that I do not find them anywhere near strong enoughto exclude a valid marriage ceremony from a clear ordinary meaning of the word "marriage". I do not find it necessary to excludethe alternative meaning of a relationship or status if the context may so require. Perhaps a marriage by repute, if established,may have to be addressed in that way. I am content to conclude that the ambiguity relied upon does not require the adoption of ameaning that embraces a relationship or status to the exclusion of a valid marriage ceremony itself and that upon that basis, a validmarriage ceremony is included within the meaning of "marriage" in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13.</a></p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> In any case, reverting to the main thrust of Mr Chang's submission, it cannot be accepted that because the customary marriage was,immediately before the registry marriage, <em>de facto</em> or <em>de jure</em> a monogamous marriage, it did not create a new status. It was demonstrated before us that there were changes in status that, in myview, have to be accepted as substantial. Before a registry marriage a customary marriage wife could only obtain a divorce by mutualconsent, i.e. she was at the mercy of her husband's whim, whereas after a registry marriage, dissolution would have to be effectedin accordance with the Matrimonial Clauses Ordinance. On the husband's death, on the footing of a customary marriage she would onlybe given maintenance from the ancestral property, maintenance that could not be enforced as it can under a registry marriage. I amtherefore not persuaded that Mr Chang's submissions founded upon the ambiguity of the word "marriage" avail the appellant.</p>    <p class="heading">A purposive construction</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> This is the final step in Mr Chang's submissions in which he brings together the several other components of his submission.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> It is not in dispute that a purposive construction is a legitimate means of interpreting statutory provisions. Although there appearsto have been a swing in favour of purposive construction in modern times, at any rate, by reference to that designation, it goesback some considerable way to <strong>Heydon's</strong> Case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281584%29%203%20Co%20Rep%207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1584) 3 Co Rep 7(a)</a>, and beyond, although then more commonly referred to as the mischief rule, the purpose being identified by reference to the mischiefand the remedy. That common law position can be said to have been taken further in Hong Kong by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap. 1</a>) which, by its terms requires a purposive approach to be adopted:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"19. General principles of interpretation</p>        <p class="quote">An Ordinance shall be deemed to be remedial and shall receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as willbest ensure the attainment of the object of the Ordinance according to its true intent, meaning and spirit."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>That would be subject to the general saving in s. 2(1) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap 1</a>, i.e. to any contrary intention that appears from <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap 1</a> or from thecontext of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a> or any other Ordinance. However, it has to be said that it is by no means apparent that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 19</a> has produced in Hong Kong any greater emphasis upon purposive construction than adopted in other common law jurisdictions that donot appear to have such a provision.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Mr Tang for his part submitted that the application of a purposive construction would require three conditions to be fulfilled. Thoseconditions are set out in the following passage, upon which he relies, in Lord Diplock's judgment in <em>Jones v. Wrotham Park Settled Estates</em> (H.L.(E))  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20AC%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] AC 74</a>; 105E-106A:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"My Lords, I am not reluctant to adopt a purposive construction where to apply the literal meaning of the legislative language usedwould lead to results which would clearly defeat the purposes of the Act. But in doing so the task on which a court of justice isengaged remains one of construction; even where this involves reading into the Act words which are not expressly included in it.<em>Kammins Ballrooms Co. Ltd. v. Zenith Investments (Torquay) Ltd.</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%20850" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] A.C. 850</a> provides an instance of this; but in that case the three conditions that must be fulfilled in order to justify this course were satisfied.First, it was possible to determine from a consideration of the provisions of the Act read as a whole precisely what the mischiefwas that it was the purpose of the Act to remedy; secondly, it was apparent that the draftsman and Parliament had by inadvertenceoverlooked, and so omitted to deal with, an eventuality that required to be dealt with if the purpose of the Act was to be achieved;and thirdly, it was possible to state with certainty what were the additional words that would have been inserted by the draftsmanand approved by Parliament had their attention been drawn to the omission before the Bill passed into law. Unless this third conditionis fulfilled any attempt by a court of justice to repair the omission in the Act cannot be justified as an exercise of its jurisdictionto determine what is the meaning of a written law which Parliament has passed. Such an attempt crosses the boundary between constructionand legislation. It becomes a usurpation of a function which under the constitution of this country is vested in the legislatureto the exclusion of the courts."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>As will be seen, it is not necessary to consider whether or not Lord Diplock intended the foregoing to apply to all instances of purposiveconstruction or only those involving the reading into a statute of words which are not expressly included in it. However that maybe, it is necessary at this point to turn to the purpose of s. 13.</p>    <p class="heading">The purpose</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Counsel have not found it possible to identify this from the text of the legislation, its long title, the relevant bills, or theofficial record of the proceedings of the Legislative Council. It is however plain that the provision was derived from the WillsAct 1837 of England. Upon that basis Mr Chang relies first upon the English Law Reform Committee's Twenty-Second Report (The Makingand Revocation of Wills) Cmnd. 7902, May 1980), Part III, paragraph 3.2:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"3.2 Although we have not been able to discover as much as we would have liked about the reasons which appealed to Parliament whenit introduced the general rule that a marriage revokes a will, we think that the reasons to justify the retention of the presentrule may be summarised as follows:</p>        <p class="quote">(a) Marriage represents a fundamental change in a person's life and with it he or she requires new personal and financial responsibilities.It is, therefore, a time for starting with a clean slate.</p>        <p class="quote">(b) A spouse and children should not inadvertently be deprived of the rights which they would have upon the intestacy of the otherspouse and parent. In so far as people fail to make fresh wills after marriage, or at least fail to revoke a pre-marriage will, thisis normally the result of inadvertence and most persons marrying would wish their spouse and children to benefit from their estate:the deceased's intentions are, therefore, more likely to be achieved by the statutory imposition of an intestacy than by preservationof his earlier will. This may, indeed, prevent hardship to the family.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c) The present rule is well known and accords with the intentions and expectations of the great majority of those who marry."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr Chang relies also upon <strong>Marston v. Roe</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281839%29%20ER%20742" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1839) ER 742</a>, Exch Ch where, Tyndal CJ giving the judgment of the court stated their agreement with Lord Kenyon in <strong>Doe dem Lancashire v. Lancashire</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=5%20TR%2058" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(5 TR 58</a> , 59), that the foundation of the doctrine of implied revocation of a will by a subsequent marriage was -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"a tacit condition annexed to the will itself when made, that it should not take effect if there should be a total change in the situationof the testator's family; and this foundation of the rule is confirmed by the judgment of Lord Ellenborough in the case above referredto  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20East%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2 East, 541)</a>, where he says this ground is to be preferred to 'any presumed alteration of intention';"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The latter suggests that s. 13 has common law origins of some age, although on the basis of a tacit condition annexed to the willitself, and notwithstanding that the Law Reform Committee put it on a somewhat different basis, while acknowledging the rule to bewell known. It may be doubted, as Mr Tang contends, whether the rule is anything as well known in Hong Kong. However, there is thecommon element of a total or fundamental change. One might, therefore, assume that the generally similar nature and common elementof the foregoing statements provide a general formulation of sorts of the purpose, sufficient at any rate to be tested in terms ofLord Diplock's dictum.</p>    <p class="heading">Whether there was a change of status or relationship</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The customary marriage was originally a potentially polygamous marriage. It also was and remained a monogamous marriage in fact inthe sense that the deceased did not already have a wife and did not after the customary marriage take another wife until after thedeath of the first wife. However with the coming into operation in 1971 of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/178" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Reform Ordinance</a>, which prohibited the taking of a second wife or concubine, the marriage was thereby converted from a potentially polygamous to amonogamous marriage. Mr Chang contends that it was therefore a <em>de jure</em> monogamous marriage. It may be open to argument given the indirect way that resulted whether the marriage would ordinarily be classifiedas a <em>de jure</em> monogamous marriage. However there is no question about it not being thereafter monogamous, so that at the time the registry marriagewas contracted, there was already the monogamous marital relationship in existence. I pause to say that it is not in dispute thatit is the time immediately before the registry marriage by which the question to be determined has to be addressed. At that time,submits Mr Chang, the deceased had the status of husband and the 1st plaintiff the status of wife. That relationship continued unchangedby the registry marriage. How then, he asks, can it be said that the deceased's will made in 1967 could have been revoked by theregistry marriage which so conspicuously failed to change their relationship or status.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Since it has been conceded by Mr Chang that the registry marriage is a valid marriage, it is not necessary for me to canvass theprovisions which clearly establish that conclusion. Ordinarily, of course, persons who are already married to each other cannot contracta new marriage between them. However the Law of Hong Kong has long had express provision for a registry marriage between spouseswho remain married under an earlier customary marriage. This was introduced by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 38(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181">Cap. 181</a>) in 1932 which provided that the parties to a customary marriage might:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... if they so desire and provided they have not living any other undivorced spouse, contract with each other a marriage under thisOrdinance. In such cases the marriage under this Ordinance <em>shall not be deemed to prejudice</em> the previous customary marriage." (emphasis provided)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>By the Marriage Reform Ordinance 1970, that wording was amended to say that the parties to such a customary marriage -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"duly <em>celebrated</em> ... may, unless the husband has any other wife, contract with each other a marriage under this Ordinance; and such marriage <em>shall not invalidate</em> the previous customary marriage."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I pause here to observe that the latter formula "shall not invalidate" supports the common stance that the customary marriage wasa valid marriage. That brings me to the decision of this Court in <strong>Yeung Yue Kwong v Yeung Fung Lai Mui</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20HKLR%2013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] HKLR 13</a>, which has been referred to both sides for the light it sheds on the effect and scope of s.38(2), before its amendment by the MarriageReform Ordinance 1970. Blair-Kerr J said at p. 25:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The monogamous marriage supersedes the customary marriage. Such marital status as was conferred by customary law is (so far thisis possible) absorbed in the new monogamous status."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He also said at p. 22:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The status of a man and woman married monogamously does not change if they go through a second monogamous marriage ceremony."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The former passage does not apply to the registry marriage since the customary marriage here was converted to a monogamous marriagewell before the registry marriage was contracted. It is upon that basis that Mr Chang relies upon the latter passage in support ofhis submission that the registry marriage did not change the deceased's and the 1st plaintiff's existing marital status. Apart fromthat matter, <strong>Yeung v. Yeung</strong> is of little relevance to this appeal notwithstanding the light it sheds upon the effect of s. 38(2) and the support it providesfor the enduring albeit modified nature of a customary marriage so superseded.</p>    <p class="heading">Application of a purposive construction</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The purpose by reference to which a purposive construction is contended for, is, as seen, that a will should be revoked by the subsequentinception of a marital relationship or status <em>that represents a fundamental change in the testator's life or a total change in the situation of his family</em>. The additional elements emphasised are no part of the several meanings of "marriage". So that to provide these, clearly additionalwords would have to be read into s. 13 to qualify such marital relationship along the following lines, that the will shall be revokedby a subsequent marriage [relationship] that makes a fundamental change in testator's life or a total change in the situation ofthe testator's family. The unusually clear necessity to write in additional words that are not in s. 13 reinforce the applicabilityof Lord Diplock's dictum in <strong>Jones v. Wrotham Park Settled Estates</strong>. Addressing the three conditions he specified, as to the first, it is not possible from a consideration of the provisions of the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a> read as a whole to identify what mischief it was that was the purpose of the Ordinance to remedy. Indeed, even from the other materialput before us, it does not seem to me that the purpose can be identified with sufficient precision. Second, it is far from apparentthat the draftsman and the legislature had by inadvertence overlooked and so omitted to deal with an eventuality that may be requiredto be dealt with if the purpose of the Ordinance is to be achieved. Third, it is plainly not possible to state with certainty whatwere the additional words that would have been inserted by the draftsman and approved by the legislature had their attention beendrawn to the omission before the bill passed into law.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Quite apart from the foregoing three conditions, even if the broad somewhat imprecise purposes contended for were indeed the purposethe draftsman and legislature had in mind, it must be questionable whether they would have adopted the precise form of the remedyimplicit in the appellant's contentions, i.e. that the revocation would be triggered by the commencement of a new marital relationshipthat makes the fundamental or total change mentioned. In normal circumstances, all valid marriages do produce or can be assumed toproduce such a change. It must therefore be doubted whether the legislature would adopt an uncertain and potentially complicatedformula when it could achieve its object almost totally by adoption of a simple and straightforward trigger and one that was easilyunderstood and applied, i.e. a valid marriage ceremony. Moreover, if the draftsman and legislature had applied their minds to revocationof the will in the context of s. 38 marriages superseding earlier customary marriages, it seems to me they would have been at leastas likely as not to have concluded that wills made after customary marriages would not have failed to address the obligations andliabilities under those customary marriages, and that accordingly such wills did not require automatic revocation. These considerations,it seems to me, strongly reinforce the rejection of Mr Chang's submissions required by the conditions in Lord Diplock's dictum.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> There remains to be addressed the alternative and subordinate submission, mentioned early in this judgment. The written submissionof leading counsel at the trial below, with which and no more Mr Chang was content to leave us, may have been a full submission there.But here, on appeal, it is a matter of the appellant persuading us that the judge was wrong in some respect or there is other goodreason why the judgment is flawed in some material way. The submission below is simply not directed to that end. I do not apprehendthe task of this Court to be a retrial of the issue concerned.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> However that may be, I have read the submission and again the carefully reasoned and very comprehensive judgment of Chan CJHC onthe issue. I cannot say that I found any material error or flaw.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Therefore, although I have not found the question easy to determine, indeed being initially attracted to the submissions on behalfof the appellant, for the reasons I have given, I would dismiss the appeal. As to costs, I do not see any reason why the usual ruleshould not be applied and would give the successful respondents their costs of the appeal.</p>    <p>Liu, J.A.:</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> I gladly adopt the material facts set out in the judgment of the Vice-President. Suffice it to say that the deceased married his<em>Kit Fat</em> wife in 1951. After her death, the deceased took a <em>Tin Fong</em> wife in 1966. That marriage was a customary marriage celebrated in Hong Kong before 7 October 1991 in accordance with Chinese lawand customs. The 1966 marriage was one within the meaning of a customary marriage in the Marriage Reform Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/178">Cap. 178</a> andthat of a non-Christian customary marriage in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181">Cap. 181</a>. The next year, 1967, the deceased made a Will. Eighteen years later, in 1985 the deceased and his <em>Tin Fong</em> wife as parties to a "non-Christian customary marriage" contracted a marriage under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 38</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181">Cap. 181</a>. The deceased died last year in 1996. The question for our consideration is whether the 1967 Will was revoked by the deceased's1985 marriage under the then <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30">Cap. 30</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> What need to be also borne in mind are : the 1985 marriage (Registry Marriage) did not invalidate the previous customary marriage(vide s. 38 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a>); all marriages celebrated or contracted under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> including the Registry Marriage, shall be "good and valid in law to all intents and purposes" (vide <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.28</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a>); the then <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a> provided : "A will shall be revoked by the subsequent marriage of the testator"; the 1966 customary marriage of the deceased to his<em>Tin Fong</em> wife may now be dissolved either in accordance with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/179" class="autolink_findacts">Matrimonial Causes Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/179">Cap. 179</a> or by mutual consent under their customary marriage which has been expressly kept alive by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 38</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> It was sought to be argued below that the Registry Marriage was not a valid marriage. That contention was rejected by Chief JudgeChan. No submission is advanced to us today save for a bald reference made to the skeleton submissions placed before the Chief Judge.It is for the appellants to demonstrate that the decision of the Chief Judge can be flawed. The bald reference is unhelpful. Theappellants have, in my view, failed to discharge this burden.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> It is agreed on all hands that for our present purposes the Registry Marriage is a marriage within the meaning of the word "marriage"in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a>, but it is submitted on behalf of the appellants that upon true construction of the then <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a>, the deceased's Will was not revoked by the Registry Marriage. It is not disputed that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 28</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> renders all marriages celebrated or contracted under that Ordinance "good and valid in law to all intents and purposes". The customarymarriage of the deceased and his Tin Fong wife was not sought to be registered pursuant to s. 9 of the Marriage Reform Ordinance.Under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 38</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a>, their customary marriage was not to be invalidated by a registry marriage. The parties chose to contract their Registry Marriageunder <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 38</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> in the full awareness of the continued subsistence of their customary marriage.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The submission of leading counsel for the appellants, Mr. Chang, is primarily founded on logic and common sense. Counsel relies onfirst that the later Registry Marriage was contracted between identical parties and secondly that by 1985 an assimilated maritalstatus, at least in terms of a monogamous union, had been enjoyed by them in their customary marriage as in their Registry Marriage.That is because at the time of contracting the Registry Marriage, the deceased could no longer take a concubine (<em>tsip</em>) lawfully. Hence their almost indifferent marital status called for no revocation of the deceased's Will to enable him to start witha clean slate, and there was no necessity for his testamentary dispositions to be adjusted. The bald newly contracted marriage, socounsel argues, had truly little more to offer. Thus, there was no warrant for the Registry Marriage to engage <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13.</a></p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> A Registry Marriage is universally understood to be of the nature of a monogamous marriage in the Christian world, which entails,in its essence,, " the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others". See <strong>In Re. Bethell. Bethell v. Hildyard</strong>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281888%29%2028%20ChD%20220" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1888) 28 Ch.D. 220</a> at p.234. In the middle of the last century, it was pronounced (<strong>Hyde v. Hyde and Woodman</strong>, (1866) L.R. 1 P&amp; D 130 at pp. 134 and 135) : "But marriage is one and the same thing substantially all the Christian world over.""It is obvious that the Matrimonial Law of [England] is adapted to the Christian marriage and it is wholly inapplicable to polygamy".In <strong>Sowa v. Sowa</strong>, [1961] p.70, at p.85 Holroyd Pearce LJ held that, "a polygamous marriage did not come within the word "marriage', nor did the partiesto it come within the word 'wife' ..... or 'husband'."</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The 1966 customary marriage was celebrated as a polygamous union. The subsequent prohibition of the taking of a <em>tsip</em> by law could not have the effect of obliterating the inherent polygamaous nature of a Chinese customary marriage. The monogamousmarriage recognised by the Christian world is diagonally opposite to a customary marriage. Also there is a world of cultural differences.To begin with, in a Chinese customary marriage, the spouses are to show mutual respect, one to the other. At Common law, a husbandhad the right "to beat [his wife] moderately as a matter of correction." "For that is a pyont of an honest man, <em>For to bete his wife well nowe and than</em>" <strong>Johan v. Johan</strong> (one of Heywood's Comedies, circa 1533). Winfield and Jolowicz on Tort, 11th edn. p.654 and footnote 65. Indeed, customary marriagesand Registry Marriages are decidedly different concepts, evolved from cultures poles apart. The mere inclusion of non-Christian customarymarriages by the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> without more is no statutory abrogation of so fundamental a bifurcation, derived from the almost mutually exclusive civilizations.Moreover, appreciable dissimilarities still remain upon contracting a marriage under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 38</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a>. After the 1985 Registry Marriage, the deceased and his <em>Tin Fong</em> wife retained the right of divorce by mutual consent in their customary marriage. The <em>Tin Fong</em> wife's entitlement to a widow's maintenance from the ancestral property would seem to be also preserved because the Registry Marriage,so the law says, shall not invalidate the customary marriage. On the other hand the <em>Tin Fong</em> wife acquired additional benefits such as custodial rights, matrimonial maintenance and other relief as well as a right to sharein the deceased's estate on his intestacy. The 1967 Will, if unrevoked, would deprive the deceased's tsai of her potential rightto come in to share on a possible intestacy after having contracted the Registry Marriage and the deceased husband of an opportunityof properly gauging the amount of his tsai's legacy by reference to what she would have become entitled on a possible intestacy underthe Registry Marriage. What the <em>Tin Fong</em> wife gained in the Registry Marriage was the deceased's loss. In sum, the Registry Marriage and the customary marriage largely retainedtheir own characteristics and fundamental attributes, with the former expressly declared to be good and valid in law to all intentsand purposes. The traditional concept and retained differences will be superimposed upon by a new relationship when the same partiescontract a subsequent registry marriage which, being neither wholly western nor oriental, introduces some changes but does not bringabout integration. Old and new entitlements become intertwined. The entering into such a new relationship under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 38</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> rightly leaves with each of the spouses to the prior customary union a relatively free hand to re-adjust his/her affairs. In that<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a> has an important role to play. I am also not persuaded that the two features of identity and matrimonial fidelity alone would leadto a frustration of the purpose of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a> in the context of the other ordinances. There are other considerations.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The real answer lies in the sweeping <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a>. Its plain language admits of no exception unless a contrary intention is elsewhere expressed, and the parallel marital relationshipis not such a contrary intention. Put another way, unless additional words are read into <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a>, it does not exempt a registry marriage which is not to be lightly eliminated from the purview of that section except by clear words.No restrictive words can be found in the Ordinances under consideration, which would subjugate or otherwise undermine the generalapplication of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13.</a> If it had been intended so to exclude a registry marriage between the very same two parties to a customary marriage, it could havebeen so easily stated in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a> by the legislature, but it was not. Further, the appellants' proposed interpretation would inevitably lead to uncertainty in theapplication of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 13</a>, and that could hardly have been intended by our legislature. Mr Tang, leading counsel for the respondents, leans heavily on Craieson Statute Law 7th ed., page 64 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The cardinal rule for the construction of the Acts of parliament is that they should be construed according to the intention expressedin the Acts themselves. If the words of the statute are unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words inthe ordinary and natural sense. The words themselves alone do in such a case best declare the intention of the law maker".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> S. 38 and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 28</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> suffer from no obscurity and effect should be given to the plain meaning of their language.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> If this court could be properly tempted by a purposive construction, for the language of the provisions under consideration, in respectto which the observation of Lord Diplock made in <strong>Jones v. Wrotham Park Estates</strong>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20AC%2070" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] A.C. 70</a> at pp 105 &amp; p106 would seem to be apposite, none of his three conditions can be said to have been satisfied :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" My Lords, I am not reluctant to adopt a purposive construction where to apply the literal meaning of the legislative language usedwould lead to results which would clearly defeat the purposes of the Act. But in doing so the task on which a court of justice isengaged remains one of construction; even where this involves reading into the Act words which are not expressively included in it.<em>Kammins Ballrooms Co. Ltd. v. Zenith Investments (Torquay) Ltd.</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%20850" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] A.C. 850</a> provides an instance of this; but in that case the three conditions that must be fulfilled in order to justify this course were satisfied.First, it was possible to determine from a consideration of the provisions of the Act read as a whole precisely what the mischiefwas that it was the purpose of the Act to remedy; secondly, it was apparent that the draftsman and Parliament had by inadvertenceoverlooked, and so omitted to deal with, an eventuality that required to be dealt with if the purpose of the Act was to be achieved;and thirdly, it was possible to state with certainty what were the additional words that would have been inserted by the draftsmanand approved by Parliament had their attention been drawn to the omission before the Bill passed into law. Unless this third conditionis fulfilled any attempt by a court of justice to repair the omission in the Act cannot be justified as an exercise of its jurisdictionto determine what is the meaning of a written law which Parliament has passed. Such an attempt crosses the boundary between constructionand legislation. It becomes a usurpation of a function which under the constitution of this country is vested in the legislatureto the exclusion of the courts."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> The Registry Marriage is conceded to be a marriage within the meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.38</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> . Its effect is perfectly clear under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 28</a> which makes the Registry Marriage "good and valid in law to all intents and purposes". These words alone "best declare the intentionof the law maker". In my view, the Registry Marriage revoked the Will of the testator made in 1967. I would dismiss this appeal withan order nisi for costs against the appellants.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p>Keith, J.:</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> I agree that this appeal must be dismissed. Prior to the enactment of the Wills (Amendment) Ordinance 1995 (Ord. 56 of 1995), <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30">Cap. 30</a>) provided:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" A will shall be revoked by the subsequent marriage of the testator except a will expressed to be made in contemplation of that marriage."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The issue in this case is whether the marriage which the deceased and his second wife contracted in 1985 under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181">Cap. 181</a>) is a marriage to which <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30" class="autolink_findacts">Wills Ordinance</a> applies. If the marriage is not a marriage to which <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(1)</a> applies, the deceased's will was not revoked, and his considerable estate will go to his four children by his first wife. If themarriage is a marriage to which <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(1)</a> applies, the deceased's will was revoked, and in that event his second wife and his three children by her will have a share in hisestate because he will be regarded as having died intestate.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> The argument of Mr. Denis Chang S. C. for the Defendants is relatively simple. His primary argument is that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/30/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(1)</a> does not apply to a marriage contracted under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> where the parties to that marriage were already married to each other, and had been married to each other at the time the will wasmade. His secondary argument is that even if <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(1)</a> applies to a marriage contracted under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> where the parties to that marriage were already married to each other, it can only apply in such a case where the new marriage effectsa change in status. In this case, the new marriage did not effect a change in status, because by 1985 the customary Chinese marriagewhich the parties had gone through in 1966 had ceased to be potentially polygamous, but had become monogamous - both in fact, andin law by virtue of section 5(1) of the Marriage Reform Ordinance (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/178">Cap. 178</a>).</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> These arguments involve reading words of limitation into section 13(1) which are not there. They are based on the proposition thatwhat triggers the revocation of the will under section 13(1) is a "new" marriage - either a new marriage between persons who werenot married to each other before, or a new marriage which changes the parties' relationship to each other. Only in "new' marriagesof these kinds will there be a need to consider whether the fact of the new marriage would have had an effect on a person's testamentaryintentions. That accords with both the common law (<strong>Marston v. Roe</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281839%29%208%20A%20%26%20E%2014" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1839) 8 AD. &amp; E. 14</a> at p.58), and what appears to be the thinking behind section 18 of the Wills Act 1837, on which section 13(1) was based: see theLaw Reform Committee's Report on the Making and Revocation of Wills (Cmnd. 7902, May 1980), para. 3.2.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Like Nazareth V.-P. (whose judgment I have read in draft), I was initially attracted by this argument, but in the end I have beenpersuaded that the law in England is not a reliable guide as to what the purpose of section 13(1) was, in view of the existence inHong Kong of Chinese customary marriages, which (by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181" class="autolink_findacts">Marriage Ordinance</a> as amended) are not invalidated by a subsequent registry marriage. In these circumstances, I do not think that the first two conditionsidentified by Lord Diplock in <strong>Jones v. Wrotham Park Settled Estates</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20AC%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] A.C. 74</a> for reading words of limitation into <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(1)</a> have been satisfied.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> But even if they had been, I do not think that it would have been possible to state with certainty what additional words of limitationwould have been used to give effect to the idea that the word "marriage" in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(1)</a> should be limited to a marriage between persons who were not already married to each other as a result of a ceremony recognised bythe law to be valid, or to a marriage which changed the parties' relationship to each other. Accordingly, Lord Diplock's third conditionwould not have been satisfied either.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p>Nazareth, V.-P.:</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
