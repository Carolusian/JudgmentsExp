It was further accepted at the trial that the plaintiff and the workman (PWI)came to an agreement dated the 10th of January 1978, which was approved on behalf of the "Director of Labour Department" on the samedate, that the plaintiff would pay to the workman the amount of HK$18571.34 by way of compensation. The agreement was admitted intoevidence by consent as an agreed document Exh.

Indeed the plaintiff's obligation to pay this sum wasn't disputed at the trial.

He based his claim partly on an alleged breach of the common duty of care provided by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupier's Liability Ordinance</a> and also breach of the ordinary Duty of Care in negligence actions under the common law.

A sketchplan showing the layout of the shop was admitted by consent Exh. P4. At the back of the shop to the left hand side is the accountsoffice. This is separated from the main showroom by means of a partition part of which consists of clear glass to form a window.This can be seen on the extreme left of the photograph Exh. P6 which was taken in the accounts office. Persons at this window inthe accounts office should be able to see most, but not all, parts of the main showroom. There would, however, be limited visioninto the accounts office from the main showroom. The defective air-conditioning equipment was situated in the accounts office atthe place indicated on the sketch plan Exh. P4 and the photograph Exh. P1. This place is well to the left of the clear glass panelwindow separating the showroom from the accounts office. It is in fact in the area marked on the sketch behind a show case. The backof the showcase can be seen in photographs Exh. P1 and Exh. P6 and would obstruct the line of vision of somebody in the showroomto something behind the showcase. To the right of the accounts office is a small room through which access is gained to the accountsoffice. The door to this small room is situated at the very back of the showroom and the switch which operates the air-conditioningequipment is in the small room on the wall to the right of that door. It is marked on the sketch Exh. P4 with a red line. The relativepositions of the door and the switch can be clearly seen in photograph Exh. P5 which was taken from inside the small room lookingin the direction of the door and the switch. The small room is separated from the accounts office by a partition and the door throughwhich access is gained from the small room to the accounts office is at the end of that partition furthest from the wall separatingthe small room form the main showroom. It would be impossible for someone standing at the switch in the small room to see the defectiveair-conditioning equipment in the accounts office through that door, because the three are not in a straight line. That is the geographyof the premises so far as it is relevant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The workman arrived at the premises to repair the defective air-conditioning equipment and he was accompanied by a foki. The shophad not at this time opened for business, but was due to do so two days later on the 15th of April. There were 8 to 10 persons workingin the shop, some of whom were putting articles into the display cases. The workman indicated his reason for being there and togetherwith his foki was admitted into the premises by a person whose identity is unknown. In order to carry out the repair work on theair-conditioning equipment, it was necessary for the workman to have the electricity serving that equipment switched off. The workman,although he had been to the premises on a previous occasion, did not know where the air-conditioning switch was, but gave instructionsto an unidentified person for it to be switch was, but gave instructions to an unidentified person for it to be switched off. Heassumed that the person he spoke to was in charge or the electrical equipment. His request was made in normal tones. The workmanwent into the accounts office to carry out the necessary work. The defective air-conditioning plant was situated above a false ceilingand it was necessary for tiles in the ceiling to be removed to enable the workman to gain access to the air-conditioning plant. Itwas necessary for the workman to stand on a step ladder and to be assisted by his foki for the purpose of taking the ceiling tilesfrom the workman and also handing up necessary tools. The position of the step ladder is shown on the plan Exh. P4 by two parallelred lines. Several persons who had been working in the accounts office had to move out and certain chairs had to be moved in orderto set up the ladder in this position.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> When the workman had been working for about 25 minutes and was adjusting the second of two leather driving belts, an unidentifiedperson switched on the air-conditioning equipment, causing the workman's right thumb to be trapped between the belt and the rollerand causing it in fact to be amputated.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The worker climbed down the ladder exclaiming loudly that somebody had switched on the machine and a voice in reply said "We werefeeling hot so we just turned on the air-conditioner", or words to that affect. The pain was so accute that the workman did not botherto find out who had actually turned on the machine. He was subsequently sent to hospital in an ambulance.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Much reliance is placed by the plaintiff on the instructions given by the workman to the unidentified person in the shop. Unfortunatelythe extent of these instructions is not clear. The workman was trying to recall a verbal exchange which had taken place more than2 years prior to the trial and had no notes to guide him or refresh his memory. Although he made no mention of it in his evidencein chief, he did give evidence under cross examination to the effect that he had instructed the unidentified person not to switchon the air-conditioner while he was working on it. This evidence was not reliable because he gave a number of other versions as towhat he had said at the time.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> His first version in chief was "I asked him to switch of the machine". His second version in chief was "I knew which part was leakingso I told them to switch off the machine".</p>    <p align="left">His third version in chief was "I gave instruction upon my arrival I told them to get someone to switch off the air-conditioner plant,that the repair would take about half an hour".</p>    <p align="left">His fourth version was "I told them to switch off the machine".</p>    <p align="left">His fifth version given under cross-examination was "Anyway I asked him to switch off the machine for me to proceed with the repairwork. I also said that I would tell him to switch on the machine when I finished word".</p>    <p align="left">His sixth version was given under cross-examination "I spoke to him in a voice like I am now speaking asking him to witch off themachine for about 30 minutes to enable me to start my repair work".</p>    <p align="left">When asked if he expected the unidentified man to stand near the switch board he replied "I was not expecting that since I had giveninstructions to switch off the machine I thought that I could start working".</p>    <p align="left">Having positively stated that the man to whom he spoke took charge of the electrical equipment he said "I asked this man to switchoff the machine".</p>    <p align="left">He later admitted that he was guessing that this man was in charge of the electrical equipment.</p>    <p align="left">Later under cross examination he repeated that he had asked the unidentified person "Not to switch on the air-conditioner", but evenlater he said "I just told him to switch off the machine, I would later of course ask him to switch on again after I had finishedmy work".</p>    <p align="left">Yet later he said "I had given him instructions to switch off the machine so I relied on him entirely", and later "I had given instructionsto that man to switch off the machine and I thought other people would not interfere with the switch".</p>    <p align="left">However, he again admitted that he would not expect the man to stand at the switch board.</p>    <p align="left">Later he said "I had given that man instructions to switch off the machine so I relied on him entirely".</p>    <p align="left">Furthermore although he had earlier in chief testified that his words after climbing down the ladder after the accident were to theeffect "I have told you people don't switch on the machine and now someone has switched it on", he later testified under cross-examination"All the lights in the shop were on when I climbed down the stirs and asked why they had switched on the machine, the reply was thatthey felt hot."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> It appears from a comparison of the various pieces of evidence referred to above that he was confused and did not actually know whathe had said. The one thing that seems clear is that he did not expect the unidentified man to stand at the switch throughout thehalf hour that he was to be working on the machine. Furthermore it did not occur to him that anybody would switch on the switch,as throughout his 21 years in the trade, it had never happened to him before. He did not deem it necessary himself to locate theswitch board, but relied upon the unidentified man to switch the machine off. He did not deem it necessary to take the precautionof ascertaining whether the switch board had a fuse which could be removed or putting up a notice cautioning anyone in respect ofits use or covering the switch in any way. However if the switch board had been in the distance away out of his sight he would thenhave got somebody to stand by it. Having instructed the unidentified man to switch off the machine he relied upon him in some wayto see that it was not switched on again before he had completed his work. He did not know whether all the persons in the shop wereemployed by the defendants but assumed they were. He did not know whether there were any decorators in the premises and did not knowwhether decoration work was still going on.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Furthermore his memory of the geography of the shop cannot be considered as completely reliable in view of his evidence that theplace where he was working could be seen from the shop and that the switch board was at the position marked with a red cross on thesketch Exh. P4. The photographs and sketch themselves showed that visibility into the accounts office would have been very limitedfrom the shop, or at least certain parts of the shop, and certainly to the position where he the workman had been working. Furthermorethe switch board would have been on the wall of the small room in the position marked with a red line on the sketch. His evidencethat a person standing near the switch board could see the spot where he was working cannot be accepted as likely. Indeed that factthat he indicate the position of the switch board as being where the 'X' in red appears in the plan, might have been an attempt toadd some credibility to this statement.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Those then are my findings on the facts. It is now necessary to examine the law and to ascertain whether on applying the law to thesefacts the defendants are liable to the plaintiff in this action. The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupier's Liability Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap. 314</a> (taken from the Occupier's Liability Act of 1957 in England) has now superseded the rules of common law on the subject ofOccupier's Liability. It provides in section 2(1)</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The rules enacted by sections 3 and 4 shall have effect, it place of the common law, to regulate the duty which an occupier of premisesowes to his visitors in respect of <u>dangers due to the state of the premises or to things done or omitted to be done on them</u>".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> There can be no doubt and indeed it is not now in dispute in this case that the defendants were the occupiers of these premises at625 Nathan Road, Kowloon and that the plaintiff's workman was a visitor within the meaning of this ordinance. The word "visitors"includes both categories of visitor who at common law where referred to as invitees and licencees.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> What is not so clear is the precise scope of the works "dangers due to the state of the premises or to things done or omitted tob done on them".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> One opinion has been expressed in Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 14th edition paragraph 1013.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is clear that the duty under the Act covers dangers due to the static condition of the premises, and dangers due to the conditionof the premises at the time of the visitor's entry, although the condition has been temporarily brought about by "things done oromitted to be done" thereon ..... It is suggested that it does not cover "superadded negligence" such as dropping a sack of sugaron the visitor from a crane, running into him in a car or locomotive, shooting him, scalding him with hot fat, or pouring tea overhim, where these acts are done by the occupier or his servants."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> The learned authors obviously took the view that, since these were what might be described as "current activities" which happenedafter the visitor had entered on the land, the ordinary rules of tresspass and negligence applied and there was no need to have anyregard to the relationship of occupier and visitor.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Professor Street in his book on Torts 6th edition page 183 had this to say -</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="88%" class="quote">"The Act plainly regulates the duty of the occupier in relation to structural defects or other dangers due to the state of the premisesthemselves. That this is not the limit of its scope is made clear by the fact that in addition to dangers due to the state of thepremises, the Act refers to duties in respect of dangers due to "things done or omitted to be done on them". At the very least, then,the Act covers acts or omissions which have created a dangerous condition of a continuing nature which later causes harm.</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="88%" class="quote">An outstanding question is whether the Act also affects acts (whether by the occupier or others) which cause harm to the visitor atthe time of their commission. Section 1 (2) provides that the Act "shall regulate the nature of the duty imposed by law in consequenceof a person's occupation or control of the premises". At common law an occupier had a duty not to permit a use by others of his premiseswhich would foreseeably harm other persons on the premises which would foreseeably harm other persons on the premises. Regardlesso whether such cases previously fell within the sub-head of the law of negligence creating special duties of occupiers to inviteesor licencees, it is submitted that the joint affect of sub-sections (1) and (2) is to bring those situations within the Act - theduty of care arises in consequence of the fact that the defendant is an occupier."</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> There is some support for this view in the judgment given by the judges in the Court of Appeal in England in Videan and another v.British Transport Commission<sup>(1)</sup> In that case a young child was seriously injured when he trespassed on to a railway line in a small country station. He was injuredby a motor trolley and his father who went to his rescue was killed. The widow's claim in respect of the child failed because hewas a trespasser and the occupier's servant or agent (the driver of the motor trolley) couldn't have foreseen that he would be there.The widow's claim in respect of the husband was upheld in the Court of Appeal.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Lord Justice Denning at page 864 said that if the child was lawfully present, the occupier owes him the common duty of care whichis described in the Occupier's Liability Act of 1975. He added however that if the child was not lawfully there, the occupier oweshim the same duty as he has always owed to a trespasser since the law as to trespassers had not been affected by the Act of 1957.Lord Harman expressed the same view at page 868. Lord Justice Pearson at page 873 expressed himself as follows.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" The principal arguments presented on behalf of the infant plaintiff were that (i) although the defendants as occupier of the landmight owe no duty of care to a trespasser in respect of the static condition of the land, yet the defendants as a person engagedin current operations on the land owed to the trespasser the ordinary duty of care, as one neighbour to another and (2) ...... Thesearguments are based on passages in judgments decided under the law prevailing before the Occupier's Liability Act came into forcewhen the courts were striving to do justice in particular cases in which the excessive rigidity of the then existing rules as toOccupier's Liability was tending to produce injustice. Now that the Act has provided rules as to Occupier's Liability which are flexibleand in line with the general law of negligence, I think that there is no longer any need for this branch of the law to be encumberedwith artifical distinctions and complexities."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The learned Judges clearly took the view that the Act covered things done or omitted to be done on the premises which did not alterthe static condition of the premises and were not of a continuing nature and which may have occurred after the entry of the visitoronto the premises.

At the time whenthe plaintiff's workman arrived at the premises the premises were not in a dangerous condition. There is nothing to indicate thatanybody up to this time should have been put on guard about any possible danger in the activation of the air-conditioning switch.Indeed the evidence implies that the switch was already turned on for otherwise it would not have been necessary for the workmanto ask somebody to switch it off. Once the workman had arrived and the switch had been switched off there was always the risk thatit would be innocently switched on by someone who did not know the reason for it being switched off. In my view the circumstancesas they existed at that time did not rule out the possibility that such a person might have acted innocently in activating the switch.It does not necessarily follow, as Mr. Pirie has suggested, that the unidentified person, who did switch on the switch, was an idiot.He may have been completely unaware of the existence of the workman in the premises. If for instance he arrived at the premises afterthe workman and was completely unaware of his presence behind the showcase in the accounts office, I do not see how he can be saidto have been negligent. The switch was there to be activated and there was no notice or any indication that it should not be switchedon. I do not agree with Mr. Pirie that the person who activated the switch was negligent or was in breach of any duty of care forwhich his employer (assuming the defendant was his employer) would be vicariously liable. I am however satisfied that it has beenproved on a balance of probabilities that the person who let the workman and his foki into the premises and who switched off theair-conditioning plant on the instructions of the workman was an employee and representative of the defendants. That employee ofthe defendants who let the workman in and who switched off the machine must have appreciated the possible risk of somebody switchingit on again. Can it be said that because he took no steps to warn other employees that they should not activate the switch or becausehe did not take any other precautions such as putting up a notice that the defendants are in breach of the common duty of care underthis Ordinance?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Mr. Chan has argued that the defendants are not liable because they are entitled to expect under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3(3)(b)</a> that the workman, in the exercise of his calling, would appreciate and guard against any special risks ordinarily incident to itand that the risk that somebody would turn on the switch was such a risk. He has relied upon such cases as Roles v. Nathan and Others<sup>(2)</sup> (a case brought under the Occupier's Liability act) and Christmas v. General Cleaning Contractors Limited and Others<sup>(3)</sup> and Bates v. Parker<sup>(4)</sup> (cases under the common law). Mr. Pirie for the plaintiff sought to distinguish these cases by reason of the fact that they all relatedto a pre existing condition in the premises before the workman arrived on the premises. He argued that the workman should have inspectedthe premises and guarded against the special risks before entering on the work. He has referred me to the case of Smith v. AustinLifts Ltd. And Others.<sup>(5)</sup> He submitted that this dealt with the intervening act of a servant of the occupier, where the independent contractor's servant anticipatedthat there would be a risk, but because of the intervening act of the servant of the occupier, the risk was increased and the conditionof the prmises was not the same as when the servant of the independent contractor has left them earlier. He submitted that in thepresent case the workman did appreciate the danger of working while the electricity was turned on and so he asked for it to be switchedoff. He submits that having asked the person who in the circumstances he could reasonably conclude was the servant of the defendant,he was entitled to rely on him to ensure (1) that the switch was switched off and (2) that it remained switched off. Mr. Pirie furthersubmitted that the maxim volenti non fit injuria did not apply because the workman, being appreciative of the risk to himself beforestarting work had given instructions for the switch to be switched off. In respect of the defendant's argument based upon <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3(3)(b)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupier's Liability Ordinance</a>, he drew the attention of the Court to the words appearing at the end of that subsection namely "so far as the occupier leaves himfree to do so". He argued that in the present case the servant of the occupier defendants did not leave the workman free to guardagainst the risk of somebody switching on the air-conditioning unit.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> I think there is a good deal of force in the latter part of Mr. Pirie's argument under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(3)(b).</a> Although the authorities quoted by Mr. Chan for the defendants and also Mr. Pirie for the Plaintiff related to defects on the premiseswhich existed when the workman came on, it is my view however that the same principle applies where the danger arises from some actwhile the workman is already on the premises. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3(3)(b)</a> means that the occupier is entitled to expect that the workman would in the exercise of his calling appreciate and guard againstrisks ordinarily incident to his employment even if they may arise from current activities. But the words of the section are "sofar as the occupier leaves him free to do so". In this case the defendant's servant did not leave the workman free to guard againstthe risk of somebody switching on the electricity. He took it upon himself to switch off the electricity instead of showing the workmanwhere the switch was and having done so he took no steps whatsoever to guard against the risk of some innocent person switching themachine on. In my view he was in breach of the common duty of care to see that the workman was reasonably safe for the purpose forwhich he had come to the premises, namely to repair the air-conditioning machine. I do however have some sympathy with the submissionfor the defendants that the workman himself should have appreciated this risk. It has not been proved to my satisfaction on a balanceof probabilities that the workman did instruct the servant of the defendants to ensure that the electricity was switched off forthe full time he was working on the machine. If he did not locate the switch himself and take some steps to prevent that happening(for instance putting up a notice or covering the switch with cello tape), he at the very least should have instructed the servantof the occupier that it not only needed to be switched off but that it should remain switched off throughout the time that he wasworking on the machine. He was to some extent the author of his own misfortune. There was evidence from another technician in thesame calling as the workman that in similar circumstances he would have taken some precautions.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> It is my judgment that the liability in this case should be apportioned, for while the defendants (through their servant) were inbreach of the occupier's common duty of care within the meaning of the Ordinance, the plaintiff's workman was also partly to blamefor not taking precautions himself to guard against the risk of somebody switching on the machine.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> That liability may be apportioned in this way is clear from the following passage in Clark and Lindsell on Torts 14th edition atparagraph 1029.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<u>Contributory Negligence</u> In the light of what has been said above and of the wording of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2(3):</a> "The circumstances relevant for the present purpose include the degree of care, and want of care, which would ordinarily be lookedfor in such a visitor," it is clear that , whatever the position may have been before the Act, the apportionment provisions of theLaw Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945, apply to an action for breach of the common duty of care exactly as to any other actionfor negligence of breach of special duty."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> References are made to Woollins v.

One of the first precautions that they ought to have taken was to see that the electricitywas switched off at all times while their men were working in the proximity of the exposed wires; and that no one had switched iton again, ...... But nevertheless, I agree that Crockfords (1st defendants), being occupiers, have some responsibility under a dutyof care. Seabrook was there as their maintenance man. He knew the switches better than anybody else. He was taking a very considerableinterest in the work and was there ready at hand."</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Liability was approved by the Court of Appeal as being 60% on the part of the 2nd defendants but the Lower Court's finding that the1st and 3rd defendants were each 20% to blame was varied to 10% and 30% respectively.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> It will be noted that the largest share of responsibility was put upon the occupier whose employee had switched on all the switches.It was the act of switching on all the switches in the circumstances of that case which was regarded as being negligent and in breachof the common duty of care. That was clearly obvious as all the judges agreed. In the present case however it cannot be said thatthe person who switched on the electricity could have foreseen that injury might have occurred to somebody. However it seems clearto me that the person who switched off the electricity on the instructions of the workman of the plaintiff, must have foreseen thepossibility that some innocent person might have switched it on again. The 1st defendants in the above mentioned case were held 10%to blame because they had breached their common duty of care to see that the plaintiffs would be reasonably safe. It must have beenforeseen in that case that the plaintiff would have to work in an area of exposed electric wires and that he would be in danger inthe event of the switch being turned on. After all the 1st defendant in that case had a maintenance man at the premises who knewall about the switches and who was taking an interest in the work. It seems to me that the defendants in the present case were ina not dis-similar position. Their employee knew all about the switches for the air-conditioning plant and had shown sufficient interestto switch them off when he was requested to do so. Whilst in the above mentioned case the employers of the plasterer was found tobe 30% to blame, there must be a distinction in the present case. The workman of the plaintiff in the present case is a skilled technician.He himself was the representative of his employer (the plaintiff) on the premises. He was to some extent the author of his own misfortune.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> It is very difficult to apportion liability in a case such as this. Opinions may differ. However after studying all the circumstances,as I am enjoined to do under section 3(4), I hold that the occupier was 70% to blame and the workman 30% to blame.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> As I said at the beginning of this judgment the 3rd essential element of the plaintiff's claim is that the amount he is claimingdoes not exceed the amount of damages, if any, which in the opinion of the court would have been awarded to the workman but for theprovisions of the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance. It is therefore necessary for me now to ascertain what damages this Court wouldhave awarded to the workman but for the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> The doctor who treated him at the Kwong Wah Hospital was Doctor Sai (PW2) and he gave the medical history of the workman. It hasbeen established to my satisfaction that the workman was admitted into the Kwong Wah Hospital on the 13th of April 1977 with an amputatedright thumb. After initial preventive treatment which involved closing up the wound, he was discharged on the 18th of April 1977.However when the wound had sufficiently healed he was readmitted into the Kwong Wah Hospital on the 25th of May for a reconstructionof the right thumb. This was done by means of a bone graft from the iliac (hip-bone). The skin of the reconstructed thumb came fromthe abdominal wall. On top of the reconstructed thumb was added the sensitive skin flap of the ring finger to give the workman abetter sensation in his thumb. The bone and the skin grafts required that he should be motionless for some time with his right handaffixed to his right hip. After the thumb had been reconstructed he was eventually discharged from hospital on the 16th of August1977. At this time there was partial functional loss of the terminal phalange and stiffness of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint ofthe right thumb. He was seen again on the 6th of September and was examined by a medical board on the 12th October. On this day hewas told that he could go back to work. The medical board assessed his permanent disability at 10%. Even now he has difficulty usingthe tools of his trade such as pliars and screwdrivers etc.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> The workman himself gave his opinion while giving evidence that his efficiency had been impaired by about 20%. At the time of theaccident the workman was earning $110 per day and he was off work for 157 days. He would therefore have been entitled to claim damagesfor loss of wages in a sum of $17270. Furthermore in my view the sum which would have been awarded for pain and suffering and lossof amenities would have exceeded $12000. Taking this together with the sum of $17270, and taking into consideration loss of futureearnings by reason of his inability to earn as much overtime, I consider that an award of damages would have exceeded $30000.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Since the liability of the defendants has been apportioned at 70%, the defendants would have been liable to pay a sum slightly inexcess of the amount claimed in this case. I am therefore satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant'sthe full amount of compensation claimed namely $18571.34. I therefore give judgment for the plaintiff in this sum together with coststo be taxed on the upper scale unless otherwise agreed. I also hold that the defendants should pay interest on this sum at the pateof 7% from the date of the payment of this sum to the workman until the date of judgment.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%"></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">( N.B.
