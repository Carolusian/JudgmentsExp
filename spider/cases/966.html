The Respondentargues that "interest" in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 22</a> clearly means simple interest, and that one would expect the same word in Section 22A pointing to have the same meaning. In supportof this proposition the Respondent argues (a) that there is a general rule of construction to that effect (although it must yieldif the context otherwise requires), and (b) is supported by a presumption against a construction which would produce a result differentfrom established legal principle. The Respondent submits that there is nothing in Section 22A pointing to "interest" having a widermeaning, and if that had been intended, it could have been expressed. The Respondent points out that the legislative intent behindSection 22A was to bring the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a> into line with the United Kingdom Arbitration Act 1950.<sup>40</sup> Prior to the amendment the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a> only provided for interest to accrue after the date of the award. Accordingly, as Section 19A of the Arbitration Act 1950 specifiesthat "simple interest" may be awarded, the legislative intention must have been to mirror this in the Ordinance, and that exceptionallyregard should be had to that intention as it would "almost certainly settle the matter".</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="3%" class="quote">52.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="91%" class="quote">The Claimant relies particularly on the point that if the intention of the legislature was to change the law by a power to award interestfor any discretionary period, and to reproduce the English legislation with the sole but significant omission of the word "simple",the Respondent's arguments, including reliance on the Explanatory Memorandum, lose their force.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="3%" class="quote">53.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="91%" class="quote">The 1984 amendment could have put the matter beyond argument by qualifying "interest" by the word "simple" as in the Arbitration Act1950, if indeed it was intended that the new power should be limited to the award of simple interest. On the other hand, if thatwas not the intention, but rather that arbitrators and umpires should have a wider discretion to award compound interest, this couldhave been put beyond argument e.g. by putting the words "simple or compound" before "interest". A slightly less clear option wouldhave been to use the single word "interest", as was done. These arguments demonstrate the danger of speculating about a legislature'sintention in introducing legislation, or, as in this case, amending it. In any event it is not clear from the Explanatory Memorandum,whether the words "This Bill will bring the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a> into line with the Arbitration Act 1950", were intended only to bring the power to award interest for any discretionary period intoline with the Arbitration Act 1950, or additionally to limit the power to award interest to "simple" interest. Therefore, unless"interest" is qualified by the word "simple" as in the Arbitration Act, 1950, it is to be construed as comprehending compound aswell as simple interest. In my view, if it was the latter, the 1984 amendment signally fails to achieve it, essentially because ofthe omission of the word "simple", because the word "interest" may include compound as well as simple interest. I am not unduly troubledby the fact that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 22</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a> also uses the word "interest" and that in the context it may mean simple interest. That section is dealing with the accrual of interestafter an award has been made, and provides that an award shall carry interest as if it were a judgment of the Court. I do not thinkthat the argument assists therefore in construing the word "interest" in Section 22A, which confers an important discretionary jurisdictionupon arbitrators and umpires. I hold, therefore, that Section 22A empowers me to award compound interest in the event that, in theexercise of my discretion, I consider it appropriate to award compound interest.<sup>41</sup>"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The line of thinking is clear. The Arbitrator has taken his authority from section 22A of the Hong Kong <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a>, (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/271">Cap 271</a>), which was added in 1984.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> It is impossible, or at the very least necessarily complex, if I do not trace the development of interest awards historically, bearingin mind that the Courts for centuries turned their faces against awards of interest on a moral basis - it was usurious. Usury originallyhad the same meaning as "interest" has today i.e. periodical payments in consideration of a loan. Contracts could be avoided forusury above ten in the hundred. As a consequence attempts were made to avoid payments being construed as usury or interest by disguisingthen as a rent or annuity. A series of acts making all usurious contracts void became known as the Usury Laws - 1545 to 1850 - theywere repealed in 1854 by the Usury Laws Repeal Act.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The legislation relating to the attachment of interest to judgment debts is traced from the Judgment Act, 1838 section 17 - "everyjudgment debt shall carry interest at the rate of four pounds per centum per annum from the time of entering up the judgment." Itis clearly simple interest which is provided for.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The Law Reform (Misc. Provisions) Act, 1934 by section 3 empowered any Court of Record to award "<u>interest</u>" at such rate as it thinks fit on the whole or part of the debt or damages for the whole or part of any period between the date whenthe cause of action arose and the date of the judgment. But nothing in the section authorised the "giving of interest upon interest"(Compound interest.), or applied in "relation to any debt upon which interest is payable as of right" (i.e. by agreement or otherwise.)Interest could however be calculated at different rates in respect of different parts of the period for which it is given.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> S. 35A of the Supreme Court Act, 1981 replaced s. 3 of the 1934 Act, and specifically stated that the interest which may be awardedis <u>simple</u> interest, for all or part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%">a)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%">in the case of any sum paid before judgment, the date of payment</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%">and</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%">b) in the case of the sum for which judgment is given, the date of the judgment.</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Interest was not to be awarded for a period during which, for whatever reason, interest on the debt already runs.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The argument for Shimizu is that the term "interest" is capable of meaning both simple and compound interest and accordingly thatwas why it was necessary to include in the 1934 Act, the provision excluding the giving of "interest upon interest". The 1981 SupremeCourt Act, consistent with this approach, made the matter certain by specifying "simple interest".

It is notable however that at sub-sections2 &amp; 3 the English provisions are also for simple interest (including damages for personal injury and death) whereas in the HongKong Ordinance at sub-section 3, dealing with proceedings for recovery of a debt where the Defendant pays the whole debt to the Plaintiff(otherwise than in pursuance of a judgment in the proceedings) it provides for the payment of interest (simpliciter) as opposed to"simple interest". This distinguishes it from the English statute - it is the only significant difference in the drafting of thetwo statutes on the question of interest.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> It suggests that the term "interest", without qualification allows the interpretation of "compound interest". It was an 1987 amendment.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The picture emerging is of the use of "simple interest" in similar legislation in a number of jurisdictions, replacing the earlieruse of "interest" with a positive prohibition on the award of "interest upon interest", certainly by 1981 in England and repeatedin Hong Kong by the 1987 amendment which specifically followed the 1981 English statute.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> It is now necessary to look at the Hong Kong <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a> and section 22A which the Arbitrator construed as giving him the power to award compound interest. It was added in 1984. Section22A is already set out at page 2 of this judgment, as an extract from the Arbitrator's award. The term used is "interest". Sub-section(2) says that the power to award interest under sub-section (1) conferred on an arbitrator is "without prejudice to any other powerof an arbitrator to award interest." There is a difference in the construction put upon that section, in relation to the word "interest",by the parties. I do not consider that the term interest in sub-section (1) is restricted to simple interest, for reasons which willappear later but which are already to be inferred from my review of the enactments of different jurisdictions. Sub-section (2) thereforein my view is simply a statement to the effect that the statute does not cut down on any other power of an arbitrator to award interest.It would not make sense to construe it as if the word "simple" were to qualify the term "interest" on both occasions on which itis specified.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> I now turn to the sequence of Arbitration Acts which are the forerunners of the Hong Kong Ordinance. Section 19A of the 1950 Actprovided for an award of "simple interest" unless a contrary intention was expressed in the arbitration agreement.

That is, I think, the only real ground on which damages can be refusedfor nonpayment of money. It is because the consequences are as a rule too remote. But when the circumstances are such that thereis a special loss foreseeable at the time of the contract as the consequence of nonpayment, then I think such loss may well be recoverable.It is not necessary, however, to come to a firm conclusion on this point, because I regard the provision of a credit as differentfrom the payment of money and not subject to the special rules, if any there are, relating thereto."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Romer, L.J. agreed with Lord Denning.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Ormrod L.J. went on to cite both Lord Denning and Scarman L.J., (as he then was) in <i><u>H.

A number of features were advanced being a) the markedchange in currency stability, particularly in the last 25 years b) the fact that arbitrators, and more recently the courts, are freeto award damages in foreign currency and this had led to no great inconvenience. The interests of justice which required that thatshould be so, also require that they should be able to award interest by way of compensation for the wrongful withholding of thatmoney; c) the substantial increase since 1893 in the number of disputes involving foreign parties decided in London, and the seriousinjustice caused by the withholding of monies properly due for which an appropriate award of interest is the only compensation. Thesolution was, in the absence of special circumstances, damages which are to be measured by rates of interest prevailing over theperiod in question as most effectively representing the loss which the Plaintiff can be presumed to have suffered by being kept outof its money. It is against the background of these arguments that one should view the expressions of regret and reluctance of themajority of the House. By contrast Lords Bridge and Brandon felt, or certainly expressed, no such sentiments.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Lord Brandon, with whose judgment the other Lords of Appeal agreed, set out the two questions, the wider ones being:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%">i)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%">what remedies should be held, at this stage of English Legal history, to be available to a creditor for delay in payment of a debtdue to him; and</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%">ii)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%">whether an arbitrator has power to award to a creditor against his debtor more extensive remedies than those to which such creditorwould be entitled, if, instead of bringing arbitration proceedings against his debtor, he brought an action against him in a courtof law.</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Lord Brandon, at page 119, stated that the true position in law in England is that where parties refer a dispute to arbitration inEngland, they impliedly agree that the arbitration is to be conducted in accordance with the law of England, unless the agreementof reference provides otherwise. He cited the similar approach of the High Court of Australia in relation to s. 94 of the SupremeCourt Act 1970 (N.S.W.) and Mason J's statement in <i><u>Codelfa Construction Pty. Ltd. v. State Rail Authority of N.S.W.</u></i> [1982] 56 A.L.J.R. p. 459.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The arbitrator's power to award interest in the present case ... is referable to s. 94.

However case 1 was left out and the recommendation of the LawCommission was ignored.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> He concluded that an ideal system of justice would ensure that an unpaid creditor could recover interest on unpaid debts in case1,2 and 3. Since the intervention of the legislature in 1934 and 1982 however, a complete departure from the scope of the <i><u>London, Chatham and Dover Railway</u></i> case would not be justified. Any interest to be awarded had to be simple interest.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Against the background of the decision in the Pintada, where clearly the sentiments of the majority of the House of Lords stronglyfavoured all 3 cases being treated equally with the opportunity of an award of compound interest, an Australian decision <i><u>Hungerfords</u> v.</i> Walker [1989] 171 CLR p. 125 is to be seen.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Mason C.J. and Wilson J. reviewed Lord Tenterden's Act of 1833, the decision in <i><u>London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway Co.</u></i> as well as the <i><u>Pintada</u></i> and quoted Lord Herschell's reluctance, echoed later by Lords Fraser, Scarman and Roskill (and as we shall see by Lords Goff andWoolf in <i><u>WestDentsche Launde Bank</u></i>):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"When money is owing from one party to another and that other is driven to have recourse to legal proceedings in order to recoverthe amount due to him, the party who is wrongfully withholding the money from the other ought not in justice to benefit by havingthat money in his possession and enjoying the use of it, when the money ought to be in the possession of the other party who is entitledto its use."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The question was posed - If a Plaintiff sustains loss or damage in relation to money which he has paid out or forgone, why is henot entitled to recover damages for the loss of use of money when the loss or damage sustained was reasonably foreseeable as liableto result from the relevant breach of contract or tort? That is the fundamental rule in relation to the recovery of damages accordingto the first limb in <i><u>Hadley</u> v.</i> Baxendale, and subject to proximity, in negligence. The object of the second limb "... was to include loss arising from special circumstancesof which the Defendant had actual knowledge when that loss does not fall within the first limb because it does not arise from 'theordinary course of things' of which the Defendant had imputed knowledge."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> The anomaly of the existing situation was dealt with fully. A Plaintiff is entitled to "restitutio in integrum," i.e. full compensationfor the loss which he sustains in consequence of the Defendant's wrong, subject to the rules as to remoteness of damage and to thePlaintiff's duty to mitigate his loss. The Plaintiff may well sustain an economic loss if there is delay in payment of the damagesdue to him; in the same way as a loss is suffered if the debt is not paid on the due date. The loss could be loss of interest onan investment, or loss of a reduction in interest by reduction of a debt, or the cost of borrowing a sum of money to compensate forthe non-payment or late payment of a debt. Foreseeability is not a problem because the loss is readily calculable by reference tothe interest rates for the loss of use of money.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> At page 145 the Judges stated:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">"The cost of borrowing money to replace money paid away, or withheld, in consequence of the Defendant's breach of contract or negligence,is directly related to the wrong and is not too remote in the sense in which the common law regarded the loss attributable to latepayment of damages as too remote.

The Court was encouragedafter the full review to state that, in the light of sub-section 4(e), "it would be strange if the court were to hold that ... s.30(c) precluded the award of damages for the loss of use of money, in accordance with the logical development of fundamental commonlaw principle so as to accord with commercial reality, to a Plaintiff deprived of the use of money paid away, or withheld as theresult of the Defendant's negligence or breach of contract."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> The Court approved the award of damages for the added cost of funding the business with borrowed money as the result of the lossof use of money overpaid and decided that "the award of interest was <u>of necessity</u> compound interest (my underlining) simple interest would not reflect accurately the extent of the ... loss."

[1996] 2 W.L.R. p. 802 which set its face against any award of compound interest on the basis that as Parliamenthad twice since 1934 considered what interest should be awarded on claims at common law and had expressly not authorised the awardof compound interest, it would be undesirable for equity to award compound interest in aid of a common law claim. Lords Goff andWoolf dissented from the majority judgment.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Lord Goff, at p. 809 summarised the common sense position by stating that in a developed system of law a court should have powerto award compound interest both at law and in equity, and one would expect to find this especially in commercial cases. Sadly, henoted, this is not the position in English law. In the absence of agreement or custom the English courts had no jurisdiction to awardcompound interest at law or under s. 35A of the Supreme Court Act, 1981.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Against the background of an attractive metaphor - "the warm sun of judicial creativity should exercise its benign influence ratherthan remain hidden behind the dark clouds of legal history" he set out his reasoning for equity acting in aid of the common law.The equitable jurisdiction may, where appropriate, be exercised in the case of a personal claim in restitution. This would be newground but desirable and meeting the needs of justice. Claims in restitution are founded upon a principle of justice, the preventionof the unjust enrichment of the Defendant. The jurisdiction should now be available as justice requires in cases of restitution.Lord Goff, in support of his argument added that it would not be inconsistent with Parliament's expressed intention to extend theexisting equitable jurisdiction to award compound interest to enable courts to ensure that full restitution is achieved in personalactions of restitution at common law. In seeking to put the 1934 legislation in its perspective he stated that "to hold that, becauseParliament then did not authorise an award of compound interest in proceedings the nature of which was not then recognised, the courtsshould now be precluded from exercising the ordinary judicial power to develop the law by extending an existing jurisdiction to meeta newly recognised need appears to me to constitute an undesirable fetter upon the judicial development of the law." He affirmedthe jurisdiction in equity, as well as at common law, to order restitution on the ground of unjust enrichment. The fact that thisparticular case was concerned with an order for restitution where the contract was ultra vires made no difference.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Lord Woolf in his review of the decisions in <i><u>Wadsworth</u> v.</i> Lydall La Pintada, and <i><u>London, Chatham and Dover Railway Co</u></i>. set out that what was required for compound interest to be payable is that "the contract either expressly or impliedly providesfor the payment of compound interest or there is a breach of the contract and the breach is such that compound interest will be regardedas flowing from the breach in accordance with the second limb of the principle ... in <i><u>Hadley</u> v.</i> Baxendale. This was one of the three reasons why <i><u>Wadsworth</u> v.</i> Lydall was in his view of such significance.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> He then brought into the equation in his dissenting judgment the views and reasoning of the late Dr. F.A. Mann in his article "OnInterest, Compound Interest and Damages." 1985 101 L.Q.R. p. 30, who posed the question as to why compound interest should not alsobe recoverable under the first limb of <i><u>Hadley</u> v.</i> Baxendale. Any suggestion that interest considered as damages is too remote, is not persuasive or realistic. Who could suggest thata defaulting debtor could not reasonably foresee interest as the creditor's loss flowing from a failure to pay?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> It is perhaps at this stage helpful to draw breath and take stock. The nature of the commercial world and of business generally haschanged significantly since the Usury Laws when the courts set their face against claims for interest. In the past 60 years at leastthere has been a significant change in the cost of borrowing money. Simple interest no longer provides the fair or adequate remedyfor those who are deprived of their money owed under a contract. The principle of "restitutio in integrum" is failing such persons.Those who withhold payment, which by law they are obliged to pay, have the benefit of the use of such sums retained, whilst thosefrom whom such payment is withheld are at the mercy of those to whom they turn for funding, to fill the gap. Unless they meet certaincriteria they can obtained only simple interest and there is a shortfall.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Courts have nonetheless confirmed the restrictive effect of legislation unless they have found some flexible provision in the draftingwhich entitles them to say that their equitable jurisdiction enables them to meet the fair requirements of a much changed commercialworld. The House of Lords has felt itself unable to do so though there remains there a powerful body of pragmatic opinion which wouldhave it do otherwise. The Australian High Court has been able to see in sub-section (4)(e) of section 30(c) of the Supreme CourtAct 1935 (South Australia) the ability to make "the logical development of fundamental common law principle accord with commercialreality"</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"This section does not limit the operation of any other enactment or rule of law providing for the award of interest."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> It may well be that the dissenting law Lords, even though such saving sub-section does not appear in the English enactments, wereapproaching their view that, by implication in any event, the equitable jurisdiction existed apart from the statutory limitations.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> What then of the position in relation to the Hong Kong Law? I need to revert to section 22A of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/341">Cap. 341</a>. There is deemed to be a provision in every arbitration agreement, unless a contrary intention is expressed, that the arbitratormay "award interest at such rate as he thinks fit" on any sum paid before the award, and on any sum which he awards (with appropriateprovisions for the period). In contrast with the English legislation already in force by the time of that provision (1984) the word'interest', without further definition or qualification was used. Sub-section 2 says that this power to award interest "is withoutprejudice to any other power ... to award interest." To my mind this use of the term 'interest' without qualification is entirelyapposite. It must mean interest which may be simple or compound. To define it as meaning simple interest on any or all of the threeoccasions on which it is stated does not, I suggest, make sense.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> There is good reason for so concluding both historically and in the light of modern thinking.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> The earlier legislation had used the word interest on its own, and there qualified it by a saving clause to the effect that it wouldnot authorise interest upon interest. Later legislation, as if to remove a possible misunderstanding, used the term 'simple interest'.By 1984 when the Hong Kong <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a> was amended there had been discussion in important cases of the anomalous position in the English courts where compound interestwould be awarded in only limited circumstances. A drafting of an Ordinance in Hong Kong in 1984 would not have left the term "interest"unqualified and unaffected by any saving clause if it was intended that the word was to be understood to refer only to "simple interest".Such a construction flies in the face of the development of the legislative provisions and the judicial debate.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Nor could it be regarded as a mistake by omission. Over a decade has passed without further amendment, during which time the seriesof significant cases, concerned with the issue, cannot have failed to catch the eye or the concern of lawyers and draftsmen. It isfar more logical to view the position as one in which, in the field of arbitration at least, Hong Kong has given effect to commercialreality by allowing the arbitrator a discretion to exercise in this field.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> The second line of support is to be found in the contents of the Attorney General's address to the Legislative Council when movingthe second reading of the Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 1984:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">"In recent years there have been efforts made in Hong Kong to encourage the process of arbitration ...</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">The purpose of this Bill is to improve still further our legislative framework by making two small amendments to the Ordinance. Thefirst gives arbitrators wider powers to award interest on sums awarded at the conclusion of an arbitration and also to award intereston sums that have been paid after the commencement of the arbitration but before the final award."</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> The Attorney General went on to give some indication of the policy behind the "updating of the law governing arbitration." It wasintended to establish an International Arbitration Centre in Hong Kong to attract to Hong Kong arbitrations relating to businessventures throughout the region, ... "that will add to Hong Kong's importance as a financial and commercial centre."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> I am satisfied that in the light of such amendment being made it was deliberately decided to leave open to the arbitrator the discretionin respect of interest to be awarded. It would not make sense, given the desire to make arbitration attractive and to give Hong Kongan "edge" in the "market", to follow the old formula restricting interest to simple interest, and all the commercial practicalitieswould make it essential to allow compound interest to be awarded in appropriate cases.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> Finally the Rules for Domestic Arbitrations of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, 1985 edition together with the 1993edition make it clear that the Arbitrator may order compound interest to be paid. It is not realistic to assume that those draftingthe 1985 edition would have to drafted this provision if it were considered that the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a> as amended in 1984, provided only for simple interest. Similarly the 1985 Edition of the Arbitration Rules of the London Court ofInternational Arbitration and the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre provide that simple or compoundinterest may be awarded. Section 33 of the Hong Kong Lands &amp; Works Branch Model Arbitration Rules (1985 edition) provides thatthe Arbitrator "may award interest at a commercial rate." Finally, in a reference back to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a> itself, there is in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a> A a section dealing with the application of the UNCITRAL Model Law, a reference to the arbitral tribunal having the discretion toaward "interest at such rate as it thinks fit." (section 34D) This was added in 1989. These references are clear confirmation ofthe desire to reflect the modern commercial approach to the question of interest - it is for the Arbitrator to decide in his discretion,in the context of the dispute referred to him, to what extent and in what circumstances he considers an award of compound interestis appropriate.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> The Arbitrator in these awards clearly exercised his discretion in an appropriate and reasoned manner, and he was entitled so todo.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> This appeal is dismissed with costs to the Respondent</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> I am grateful to both Counsel for the carefully prepared submissions and for the bundles of material from which I have derived considerableassistance and which saved me much time.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Conrad Seagroatt)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">Judge of the High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">Mr. Simon Goldblatt Q.C. and Mr. Peter Clayton instructed by Malleson, Stephen Jaques for the Respondent.</p>        <p align="left">Mr. Ronny Tong Q.C. instructed by the Attorney-General's Chambers for the Appellant.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><sup>40</sup> Section 19A of the 1950 Arbitration Act provides:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Unless a contrary is expressed therein, every arbitration agreement shall, where such a provision is applicable to the reference,be deemed to contain a provision that the arbitrator or umpire may, if he thinks fit, award simple interest at such rate as he thinksfit -</p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="82%" class="quote">on any sum which is the subject of the reference but which is paid before the award, for such period ending not later than the dateof payment as he thinks fit; and</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="4%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="82%" class="quote">on any sum which he awards for such period ending not later than the date of the award as he thinks fit."</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="4%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><sup>41</sup> I add as a foodnote that the parties' enquiries as to whether there is a body of practice among Hong Kong arbitraotrs dealing withdomestic disputes (not governed by the Hong Kong Domestic Arbitration Rules) to award, or not, compound interest, produced no clear-cutanswer either way.
