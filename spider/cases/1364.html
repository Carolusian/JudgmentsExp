It markets its products to ultimate consumersthrough a number of service stations scattered throughout Hong Kong. Although these service stations are described as "Caltex GasolineStations" and the witnesses in the course of the trial of these consolidated actions have referred to them as "our" or "the plaintiff's"service stations, I am satisfied that, at all material times, they were operated by persons who are neither the servants nor theagents of the plaintiff. They are operated by independent contractors, who purchase their supplies from the plaintiff, and then re-sellthem to members of the public who patronise the service stations.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> With the possible exception of the franchised bus companies, these patrons or ultimate consumers include a wide variety of persons,who are involved in the various forms of public and private transport in Hong Kong. They include owners and drivers of private cars,taxis and public light buses, as well as persons who perform various managerial services for such users on an agency, commissionor contract basis. The defendant is in the latter category. Apart from offering repair and maintenance services to its customers,it operates its own vehicles and manages others for individual owners, by hiring drivers, etc.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> For a number of years, the plaintiff has operated a system, which enables such ultimate consumers to obtain petroleum products directfrom service stations on favourable credit terms, which eliminate the need to pay cash for products supplied by such service stations.The plaintiff enters into an agreement with a selected consumer ("account-holder"), under which it issues a series of "chits" tothe account-holder. Anyone in physical possession of the e chits can obtain petroleum products from any of the plaintiff's servicestations without paying cash or using an established credit card, simply on production of a chit. The person acquiring the goodsfrom a service station is, apparently, required to sign the chit, but that signature is unimportant. The chits do not even have tobe signed by the account - holder, but the number of his account, opened with the plaintiff, is printed on each chit. In due course,the service stations set off the value of the goods supplied in exchange for such chits against the price they must pay to the plaintifffor goods supplied to them by the plaintiff. Information derived from these chits is fed into the plaintiff's computer. Monthly statementsare produced and sent to account-holders by the plaintiff. The amount payable by the account - holder to the plaintiff is less thanthe retail price, since the plaintiff gives a discount to each account - holder. In essence, the consumer's obligation to pay forproducts sold by a service station is settled by the system of setting-off used chits against sums owed by the service station tothe plaintiff, which in turn, recovers that sum (subject to the agreed discount) from the account-holder (who may not have been theperson who bought the goods from the service station) under the terms of the agreement between the plaintiff and the account - holder.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Although this system was no doubt devised to promote sales of the plaintiff's products, it offers very real benefits to consumersand to account-holders. In addition to a small discount, the latter enjoy the benefit of a generous period of credit (on average,45 days) at no extra charge. Those who own or operate fleets of vehicles, such as the defendant, are indirectly offered a more systematicmethod of administering and controlling their operations. But, like most modern substitutes for immediate cash settlement of legalobligations, this system exposes an account-holder to the risk of being held liable to the plaintiff in respect of chits which havegone astray or get into unauthorised hands. To cope with that risk, which appears to be one of frequent occurrence, the plaintiffhas devised a feature, which is designed to give some protection to its account-holders against that risk.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> In the case of what may be described as the normal or standard agreement between the plaintiff and its account-holders, one aspectof this protection is to be found in the conditions printed on the inside cover of the chit books, issued by the plaintiff to itsaccount-holders. These conditions hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff's "standard conditions", are expressed in the followingterms :-</p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" height="170">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" height="170" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">(l)</p>            </td>            <td width="79%" colspan="2" height="170" valign="top" class="quote">                You are responsible for the payment for all Caltex products delivered against numbered chits of this book.

This is done by sending out circulars to the various servicestations (see, for example, page 3 of Plaintiff's Supplemental Bundle). At the same time, information is fed into the plaintiff'scomputer, which is programmed to reject any chits which have been honoured after the 3 - day period. If, despite these circulars,a service station deliver goods against a cancelled chit, it will not be able to use that chit as a credit or set-off against thesums it owes to the plaintiff, and that chit should not appear in the monthly statement sent to the account holder.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> It is clear that, so long as these protective measures are properly invoked, the plaintiff bears absolutely no risk from the unauthoriseduse of its chits. If a chit is honoured after the 3-day period, the plaintiff is not concerned with recovering payment for the goodssupplied. It has no cause of action against the account-holder. It does not have to give credit to the service station, which alonemust "chase after" the person who acquired the goods.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> In or about March or April 1983, the plaintiff opened a chit-account with Mei Kan Motors, after a meeting between one of its partners,Mr. Chang Fung Chiu, and Mr. Lam Kwok Leung, the plaintiff's senior sales representative. This chit-account was transferred to thedefendant, upon the latter's incorporation in September 1983. On the 9th July 1984, the defendant gave written notioe (pages 17 and18 of Plaintiff's Bundle to the plaintiff asking it to cancel a large number of chits. On the 13th July 1984 the plaintiff issueda circular (page 4 of Plaintiff's Supplemental Bundle) to its service stations asking them to stop delivery to these chits. Nevertheless,on and after the 20th July 1984, several of these chits were honoured by service stations, and the cost of the goods was later includedin the monthly statements sent by the plaintiff to the defendant in August, September, and October 1984. The defendant disputed theamounts alleged to be due for these months but paid for the chits which had not been cancelled. By these consolidated actions, theplaintiff seeks to recover the balance, totalling $42,502.40. At the trial, it was eventually conceded by the defendant that it wasliable to the plaintiff to the extent of $4381.06, as it was discovered that the appropriate chits had never been cancelled. Aftera small deduction for a sum already paid, it is common ground that the amount now in dispute is $38,086.34, and that this sum relatesto "cancelled" chits, which were honoured on and after the 20th July 1984.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> I now come to the crucial question in this case, namely, in what circumstances was the defendant <u>entitled</u> to require the plaintiff to take the protective measures described earlier? The pleadings in this case are multi-coloured and theamended defence is, in my respectful view, unduly prolix. Although they tend to obscure the issues, the case has been fought accordingto fairly clear "battle-lines".  The plaintiff contends that it was only obliged to take these measures if the defendant gave noticethat a chit had been lost or stolen, and that its agreement with the defendant was governed solely by the standard conditions, setout above. It further contends that none of the cancelled chits was lost or stolen. The defendant, however, contends that it wasentitled to give notice of cancellation of chits in <u>other circumstances</u>, whereupon the plaintiff was under a legal duty to take the protective measures, and only entitled to debit the account of the defendantin respect of chits honoured within 3 days of such notice. These "other circumstances" are not really particularised in the amendeddefence, but the defendant confined this aspect of its case to those chits which it had, in turn, issued to its customers under creditfacilities similar to those extended by the plaintiff to the defendant.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> What had happened was this. I find as a fact that in July and November 1983, Mei Kan Motors and the defendant entered into agreementswith Mr. WONG Wai-woon and Mr. LO Wing-chung, under which Mr. Wong and Mr. Lo were issued with some of the chits which the defendanthad obtained from the plaintiff. These gentlemen defaulted in payment of sums due to the defendant for goods supplied against thesechits, and on the 9th July 1984, the defendant gave notice suspending these accounts and demanding the return of all unused chits.The unused chits were never returned to the defendant, but some of them were used to obtain goods from service stations, and werelater debited to the defendant by the plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Although the defendant alternatively contends that these chits, which had not been returned by its own customers, were "lost or stolen"within the meaning of these terms in the plaintiff's standard conditions, the main thrust of its case has been to justify a widerright to cancel chits which had been issued to its own customers, after they had defaulted in their obligations to the defendant.It seeks to justify this wider right on three grounds. Firstly, it contends that the plaintiff expressly agreed to accept noticeof cancellation in such circumstances. Secondly, it contends that a term to that effect should be implied in fact, having regardto the nature of their agreement and their relationship. Thirdly, it contends that the plaintiff was under a duty, implied or imposedby law, to take the protective measures I have mentioned, and to take reasonable steps to ensure their effectiveness.</p>    <p>               </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In my view, the second and third grounds for enlarging the scope of the plaintiff's duties to the defendant can only arise, if atall, on the basis that the plaintiff was aware, at all material times, that the defendant intended to re-issue chits, supplied toit by the plaintiff, to its own customers, i.e., to persons who were neither the servants nor agents of the defendant, or otherwisesubject to its direct control. Without such special knowledge on the part of the plaintiff, there is, in my view, no obvious necessityfor adding a term or terms, along the lines suggested by the defendant in this case, to these contained in the plaintiff's standardconditions. In the case of an agreement with an "ordinary" account holder, i.e. one who intends to confine use of the chits to himself,members of his family, or his servants, it seems to me that the standard conditions clearly and reasonably allocate the risks inherentin the "chit-system", and make adequate provision for dealing with chits which fall into unauthorised hands. In order to give suchagreements business efficacy, it might be necessary to imply a term requiring the plaintiff <u>forthwith</u> to notify its service stations upon receipt of a report of a "lost or stolen" chit, in order to prevent, or minimise, the risk ofsuch chit being honoured within the 3-days' period. I am not convinced that that limited implied obligation needs to be importedinto ordinary agreements. But, as all the disputed chits in the present case were honoured many days after the 3-days' period, itis unnecessary to give further consideration to this question.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> In my respectful view, the precise scope of the additional term (or duty) to be implied, in the circumstances of the present case,has not been clearly disclosed by the defendant's pleading, and only partially explored in the course of the trial. Much of the evidenceand argument before me has been directed at supporting the defendant's first and primary contention, namely, that the plaintiff <u>expressly</u> agreed to accept notice of cancellation of chits which were not ''lost or stolen", and to take certain steps to prevent such chitsfrom being honoured by service stations, and eventually being debited to the defendant. I consider this aspect of the case laterin my judgment. But, insofar as it is also relevant to the suggested implied term or legal duty, attention has mainly focussed onthe question whether the plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence to prevent such chits from being honoured. The question whetherthe defendant had an <u>implied</u> contractual <u>right</u> to cancel chits which were neither "lost" nor "stolen" (according to the proper construction of these terms in the plaintiff's standardconditions) has been largely assumed or overlooked, except by Miss Kwan, who has throughout maintained that the defendant had nosuch right, whether as a result of express agreement, implied terms, or the operation of modern principles governing the tortiousliability of parties to "special" relationships.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> For reasons I give later in this judgment, I find as a fact that the plaintiff was aware, at all material times, that the defendantwould re-issue the chits to persons not under its immediate control. But, unless I am obliged by authority clearly binding upon me,I would not be disposed to hold that this particular knowledge is sufficient to support the implication, in fact, of a term entitlingthe defendant to unilaterally cancel any chit which was not "lost or stolen".  I do not consider that such a term is obvious or necessaryin order to give business efficacy to the agreement between the parties. Nor do I think that the parties would have readily assentedto the game as a reasonable suggestion from an "officious bystander".  No doubt, the parties had mutual reasons or interests forentering into the present agreement. But, I cannot accept that they were sufficiently common or coincidental to justify the implicationof a right of unilateral cancellation by the defendant of any chit issued to him by the plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> However, if I have correctly understood Mr. Lau's sub-missions on this aspect of the present case, I do not have to be persuadedthat these customary or orthodox tests for the implication of a term are satisfied. Instead, he referred me to <u>Liverpool City Council</u> v. <u>Irwin</u> <i>[</i>1977<i>]</i> A. C. 239, and invited me to follow the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in <u>Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd</u>. v. <u>Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd. and Others</u> <i>[</i>1984<i>]</i> H. K. L. R. 95, and to extend it to the contractual relationship between the parties to the present case, on the basis that the positionof the defendant is directly analogous to that of a banker, and that of the plaintiff is correspondingly similar to a banker's currentaccount customer i.e. it is under a duty to take reasonable care in the operation of its account with the defendant. Mr. Lau contendsthat the supposedly absolute or unlimited responsibility of the defendant for the use of chits issued to it is no different froma banker's obligation to honour cheques drawn by its customer.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> In the context of the present case, I consider that these superficial similarities are more contrived than real. I am prepared toaccept that, <u>if</u> the defendant is <u>legally</u>l entitled to notify the plaintiff that it wishes to cancel chits which are neither lost nor stolen, it may be necessary to implya term that the plaintiff should exercise reasonable diligence to ensure that these chits are not honoured. But that is a differentmatter from the question whether it is necessary to give, by implication of fact or law, a right on the part of the defendant togive notice to cancel chits which are neither lost nor stolen, according to the proper construction of the standard conditions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Although I may be bound by this recent decision of the Court of Appeal, I am not persuaded that I am obliged to extend it to thesituation now before me. Insofar as the Court of Appeal was breaking new ground, I consider that it was doing so only in the contextof the special relationship between a banker and its customer. I do not think that it was intended or contemplated that the dutyfound in that case should, or could, be extended to other relationships which involve the provision of credit facilities. It maybe the case that, in the special sphere of banking law, the result of the cited case was just and reasonable. Whether it can properlybe achieved by the courts, or only by legislation is, perhaps debatable. But, until the opinion of the Privy Council on the issuesinvolved in that particular case is made known, I do not think that I should extend it to the present case, especially as I do notthink that it has any direct bearing upon the question whether the defendant was entitled to cancel the disputed chits. In my respectfulview, the defendant's reliance upon this decision, though ingenious, is mainly misconceived.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The defendant's third ground for disputing liability in this case appears to be based on the proposition that the relationship betweenthe plaintiff and the defendant was sufficiently proximate that, in the reasonable contemplation of the plaintiff, carelessness onits part would be likely to result in damage to the defendant, and, accordingly, the plaintiff was under a legal duty to take thepreventive measures I have mentioned upon receipt of notice of cancellation from the defendant. It is contended that this duty arisesout of modern cases on the scope of the tort of negligence.  cf. <u>Home Office v. Dorset Yacht Co. Ltd.</u> <i>[</i>1970<i>]</i> AC1004; <u>Anns v Merton</u> <u>London Borough Council</u> <i>[</i>1978<i>]</i> AC 728, of which the recent decision of our Court of Appeal is merely an example of its application to parties to a special contractualrelationship. It is further contended that there are no reasons for restricting or cutting down this duty of care, since the classof persons to whom the plaintiff issues its chitbooks is relatively small, and the plaintiff can perform its duty with relative ease.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Accepting these arguments for the moment, I must confess that I have difficulty in appreciating how they afford the defendant anydefence to the plaintiff's present claim. It seems to me, that the defendant's remedy, if any, would take the form of a counterclaimfor damages for breach of this duty of care. No counterclaim has been pleaded; nor is it alleged that the plaintiff is estopped fromholding the defendant responsible for goods supplied against the disputed chits because it was in breach of this duty of care. But,assuming that, upon a generous interpretation of the defendant's pleadings and the arguments advanced before me, the defendant isreally contending that the plaintiff was not entitled to debit the disputed chits to the defendant, because it was in breach of itsduty of care, I consider that it is relevant to take into account the defendant's conduct in relation to its use of the chits suppliedby the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> In my respectful view, there is considerable merit in Miss Kwan's submissions that, before resorting to an implied term or duty ofthe kind suggested by the defendant, the court should consider whether the defendant was under some corresponding duty and had dischargedthat duty. She forcefully points out, and I find as a fact, that the defendant re-issued some of the disputed chits to one of itscustomers (Mr. WONG Wai - woon) on the 4th May 1984, despite the fact that Mr. Wong was already in substantial default in discharginghis indebtedness to the defendant. It seems to me that, whilst the plaintiff must have contemplated, at the time when it enteredinto the contract with the defendant, or issued chits to the defendant, that the defendant might suffer some loss as a result ofre-issuing these chits to its customers, and their subsequent unauthorised use, the plaintiff can, nevertheless, reasonably contendthat the loss suffered by the defendant is directly attributable to its own conduct, and not directly referable to any breach ofan existing duty on the plaintiff's part. Alternatively, the plaintiff can reasonably contend that the fact that the defendant intendedto re-issue chits to other persons is a consideration which "ought to negative, or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or theclass of person to whom it is owed or the damages to which a breach of it may give rise" (per Lord Wilberforce in <u>Anns v Merton London BC</u> supra at 752. It may be more appropriate to regard these counter-submissions as being relevant to the existence of the alleged dutyto use reasonable diligence to prevent certain chits from being honoured, or to the question whether, in the particular circumstances,that duty was broken. But, I also consider that they have some bearing upon the question whether such duty of care can be "triggered"by the defendant's unilateral act of givingnotice of cancellation.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> It seems to me that the <u>Tai Hing Cotton Mill</u> case and the recent decisions of the House of Lords, already cited, indicate that the same conclusionor destination may be reachedby two different routes - the shorter contractual route or the more tortuous tortious route. But, if I have correctly understoodMr. Lau's submissions, he contends that if he fails to get to his destination via the contractual route of an implied contractualterm, he can still get there via a duty imposed by the law governing tortious liability. That may be the case. But in the contextof the present case, acceptance of that argument would involve recognition of the proposition that, although the relationship ofthe parties, at the time when they entered into their agreement (or at the time when the plaintiff issued chit-books to the defendant)was not sufficiently proximate to give rise to a duty of care, such proximity can be brought about simply as a result of the subsequentconduct of the defendant with regard to the chits placed at its complete disposal and under its control. In my view, that would involvethe introduction of a novel concept to the law governing tortious liability. It seems to me that, in the absence of some expresspromise or undertaking on the plaintiff's part, the defendant must bear the risks inherent in placing these chits in the hands ofpersons who are not subject to its immediate control. Accordingly, I turn to the question whether the plaintiff expressly agreedto take the protective measures in the circumstances which have occurred in this case.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> On this aspect of the case, I am mainly concerned with the evidence of Mr. LAM Kwok-leung, of the plaintiff, and Mr. Chang Fung Chiu,of the defendant. Furthermore, I am only concerned to ascertain what was agreed at a meeting in the plaintiff's office in or aboutFebruary or March of 1983, because it is common ground that whatever was then agreed reed between Mr. Lam and Mr. Chang, who wasthey a partner in a firm know as Mei Kan Motors, governed the contract later made between the plaintiff and the defendant, afterthe latter's incorporation. Nevertheless, Miss Kwan has quite properly and forcefully relied on certain aspects of the defendant'sconduct in or about July 1984, for the purpose of demonstrating that Mr. Chang should not be -regarded as a credible witness as towhat was agreed in 1983, or subsequently. Although there are undoubtedly apparent contradictions or inconsistencies in this aspectof Mr. Chang's conduct and his evidence, it is fair to say that similar defects are to be found in the evidence of the plaintiff'switnesses.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Some of these features of the evidence before me are no doubt attributable to defects in recollecting details of conversations afterthe passage of time. Some of the differences may be due to a subconscious desire to justify postures assumed, or judgments reached,hurriedly and stubbornly when the events leading to the present dispute actually occurred. There is, in my view, considerable confusion,or, both sides, as to the precise sequence and content of the various exchanges between Mr. Chang and various employees of the plaintiffin July 1984, consequent upon the defendant's attempt to cancel a surprisingly large number of chits, possibly because these eventsand exchanges took place at a speed and in circumstances in which snap decisions were called for, and were made. During the trial,there were moments when I gained the impression that some of the plaintiff's witnesses were being less than frank or truthful intheir answers to certain questions, and were endeavouring to cover up for mistakes, errors of judgment, or other weaknesses or defectsin the plaintiff's internal management or organisation, or, perhaps, seeking to protect the interests of those service stations whichhad honoured chits, in disregard of the plaintiff's circulars. At the same time, I have not overlooked the possibility that Mr. Chang'sevidence may have been specially tailored to overcome his difficulties with his own customers, and to avoid being saddled with aliability to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> It is, however, tolerably clear that, whereas the defendant, in my view, genuinely believed that it was acting in accordance witha special agreement, made with Mr. Lam on behalf of the plaintiff in 1983, the plaintiff's witnesses, in July 1984, regarded thecontract between the plaintiff and the defendant as governed solely by the standard conditions printed on the cover of the chit books.It is, in my view, significant that Mr. Lam belonged to the section of the plaintiff's organisation concerned with promoting sales.In 1983 he was a senior sales representative, and is now senior merchandiser in the retail department. With the exception of Mr.Chang Chi Yan, who is the retail sales manager, the other witnesses worked in the credit department handling the day-to-day operationof chit - book accounts. It is not clear whether, in July 1984, there were any enquiries within the plaintiff's organisation to ascertainfrom Mr. Lam what precisely had been agreed in 1983, before the other employees of the plaintiff decided to handle the defendant'spurported cancellation of a large number of chits in the way that they did. If there were, and Mr. Lam's recollection of his meetingwith Mr. Chang was similar to the evidence he gave before me, it is not surprising that the other witnesses regarded the contractwith the defendant as governed by the plaintiff's standard conditions, and viewed with suspicion the circumstances in which the defendantsought to cancel the chits in question.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> According to Mr. Lam, when Mr. Chang visited him at the beginning of 1983 to enquire about the plaintiff's chit account, he merelyexplained how to use and re-order chits, and the general mechanics of the operation. He did not explain the relevant terms of theintended agreement, apart from advising Mr. Chang to take great care of the chit books, and to report any loss or theft as soon aspossible, and in writing, and that, in the event of theft, he should make a report to the police. Mr. Chang asked no questions, buthis attention was drawn to the conditions of use on the cover of the chit book, and he was invited to look at them when he left theplaintiff's office. That, in essence, was all that Mr. Lam said in examination in chief then cross-examined, he denied that Mr. Changtold him that the chit books would be issued to Mr. Chang's customers, and that Mr. Chang was worried in case his customers did notpay. He further denied that he was asked if the plaintiff would "chase after" such customers or cancel chits issued to them; and,denied that he gave any assurance that the plaintiff would merely notify the service station, if Mr. Chang notified his desire tocancel any chits. He also denied telling Mr. Chang that he would be liable for chits honoured during the period of three days afternotice to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> In my view, these denials are not surprising. What are, in my view, significant, are the matters which Mr. Lam agreed <u>were</u> mentioned at this meeting. He agreed that t Mr. Chang told him that he (Mr. Chang) was in the business of buying, selling and repairingtaxis; that he operated 20-30 taxis, driven by his own drivers or rented out to others, and wanted his management of taxis to bemore systematic (which, incidentally, was one of the advantages alluded to in the plaintiff's circular (p. 1 of the Defendant's Bundle),sent to Mr. Chang's firm in 1982!), Mr. Lam also agreed that he told Mr. Chang that he would receive a discount on petrol supplied,and that Mr. Chang had a similar chit-account with another supplier, viz, Mobil. But, the denied that Mr. Chang mentioned the detailsof his agreement with Mobil.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Mr. Chang testified that he told Mr. Lam that he would use the chit-account for himself and his customers, to whom he would re-issuechits supplied by the plaintiff. He mentioned that he already had a similar account with Mobil, which gave him a discount of 25 centson every gallon supplied, and "chased after" his defaulting customers. He asked if the plaintiff would offer the same advantages.He was told that he would receive the same discount, but that the plaintiff would not "chase after" Mr. Chang's customers. That wouldbe Mr. Chang's responsibility. The plaintiff would merely stop the chits on receipt of a telephone call, but Mr. Chang would be liablefor chits honoured in the next three days. He asked Mr. Lam to put these assurances into writing, but did not press this request,when Mr. Lam told him that the plaintiff was a big company and did not normally put such things in writing, and asked him to trustMr. Lam. Mr. Chang accepted the terms and conditions offered by Mr. Lam, because, although not as favourable as those offered byMobil, they gave him and his customers access to more service stations than those operated by Mobil.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> I have given very careful consideration to counsel's submissions on various aspects of the evidence which tend to diminish the credibilityor reliability of Mr. Lam and Mr. Chang. But, at the end of the day, I prefer Mr. Chang's account of what was discussed and 3 agreedat this meeting with Mr. Lam. It is clear from some of Mr. Lam's answers under cross-examination that their discussion went far beyonda simple explanation of the mere mechanics of the operation of the plaintiff's chit-account. Given his supposedly limited knowledgeof the nature and extent of Mr. Chang's business, it is, in my view, wholly unrealistic to accept his denials that Mr. Chang mentionedthe difficulties he might encounter from extending similar facilities to his customers. I am satisfied that Mr. Chang did mentionthese with a view to obtaining assurances of facilities similar to those he enjoyed from Mobil. I do not accept Mr. Lam's evidencethat he was never made aware of the details of Mr. Chang's arrangements with Mobil. I am satisfied that Mr. Chang did so for tworeasons, viz, to ascertain what discount the plaintiff would give him - which he described as "the kickback" - and what protection,if any, the plaintiff would give him against defaulting customers. Faced with Mr. Lam's blanket denials, Mr. Chang could have strengthenedhis case by falsely asserting that he was given assurances that he would receive <u>the same</u> advantages he enjoyed from Mobil. He did not do so. He accepted the limited protection which the plaintiff was prepared to offer.Although he has sought (no doubt on the advice of his lawyers!) to extend the scope of the plaintiff's legal obligations, in thecourse of these proceedings, it is noticeable that he has never asserted that the plaintiff ever agreed to "chase after" his defaultingcustomers.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Accordingly, I find as a fact that, in or about February or March 1983, Mr. Lam, acting on behalf of the plaintiff, expressly agreedthat Mr. Chang could give notice of his desire to cancel chits issued to his customers, in the event of their default, and that theplaintiff would take reasonable steps to prevent those chits being honoured by its service stations, or to ensure that he was notheld accountable to the plaintiff in respect of any chits honoured by service stations after three days from the date of his notificationto the plaintiff. I further find that these assurances were not confined to chits which were "lost or stolen", in the strict or narrowsense. Nor were these assurances conditional upon the return of all ''unused chits" to the plaintiff, or a report being made to thepolice. In my view, the return of unused chits was only required in the event of the defendant's intended departure from Hong Kong,or it's decision to terminate entirely its credit facilities with the plaintiff. Furthermore, at the most, a report to the policewas only required if any chit was "stolen".</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> At this juncture, I would merely observe that I have not been able to derive any assistance from the correspondence exchanged betweenthe parties' solicitors, beginning with the letter of the 13th July 1984 from the plaintiff's solicitors. It seems to me, with theutmost respect, that this correspondence indicates that the parties' solicitors had not fully appreciated the extent or nature ofthe differences between the parties to the present dispute, or taken full instructions from their respective clients.  It is arguablethat, even at that stage, the plaintiff was prepared to concede that the defendant was not liable to the plaintiff in respect ofthe disputed chits if it was prepared to support its stance by making a formal report to the police. I find as a fact that the defendantdid make a report to the police, regarding the disputed chits and its inability to obtain payment from its customers, viz Wong Waiwoon and Lo Wing Cheung, on or about the 12th July 1984, in response to a suggestion made by Mr. Lam shortly before that date. Atthe same time, I can easily appreciate why the police did not accept this report as one involving the commission of a <u>criminal</u> offence, as distinct from a <u>civil</u> matter, over which they had no interest or jurisdiction.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> In my view, these findings are sufficient to dispose of the issues in this case. It is strictly unnecessary to make findings of factas to what transpired between the plaintiff and the defendant in July 1984, after the defendant had notified the plaintiff that thedisputed chits should be cancelled. The difficulty of making findings of fact as to the precise sequence of events at that time,is, in my view, largely due to the fact that the plaintiff's witnesses were not then aware of what had been agreed in 1983 or, ifthey were so aware, chose to ignore it, in order to protect Mr. Lam from the consequence of having committed the plaintiff to anagreement which went beyond its standard conditions. Instead, they assumed, or adopted the stance, that the plaintiff's agreementwith the defendant was solely governed by the standard conditions, and that none of the chits included in the defendant's noticeof the 9th July 1984 was "lost or stolen." As to the latter feature, their suspicious were, perhaps, understandable.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> I am unable to accept that the plaintiff's employees responded to the defendant's notice of the 9th July 1984 solely as a matterof "grace and favour", designed to minimise the loss which the defendant might suffer from having issued the relevant chits to itscustomers. Although they took steps to instruct service stations not to honour the chits in question,they clearly knew that theseinstructions might be disregarded. Furthermore, they deliberately refrained from informing the computer department that such instructionshad been given to the service stations, with the consequence that the computer did not automatically reject chits which were honouredafter the 3-day period.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> It is, in my view, clear that the events of July 1984 began with a telephone call by Mr. Chang to Mr. Lam Kwok Leung, on or aboutthe 7th or 8th July, in the course of which Mr. Chang indicated that he wished to cancel a large number of chits, which he had issuedto customers who had failed to pay the sums they owed to the defendant. It is significant that, at that point, Mr. Lam did not tellMr. Chang that he could not cancel chits issued to his customers. He merely asked him to put the numbers of the chits in writingbecause they were so numerous. Nor did he, at that time, ask if Mr. Chang had made a report to the police. In my view, the defendant'swritten notice dated the 9th July 1984 was sent in response to Mr. Lam's request. At about that time or shortly afterwards, I thinkthat Mr. Cheung Yin Hung, the manager of the credit department, and Mr. Cheng Chi Yan, the retail sales manager, came to the conclusionthat the chits were neither stolen nor lost. Acting on their instructions, Mr. Lam then asked Mr. Chang to make a report to the policeand to give the plaintiff some form of undertaking in respect of the cancelled chits. The defendant's second written notice datedthe 13th July 1984 (pages 21 &amp; 22 of Plaintiff's Bundle) was sent in response to this request. On the 13th July 1984, after thisnotice had been sent to the plaintiff, Mr. Chang spoke to Mr. Cheng. I find as a fact that this was the first time that the plaintiffindicated to Mr. Chang that the chits could not be cancelled because they were not lost. Mr. Chang was clearly annoyed at what heregarded as an attempt to renege on the promises given earlier by Mr. Lam.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> I have considered very carefully whether Mr. Chang's conduct at this time indicated that he accepted the plaintiff's version of theiragreement. I do not think it does. I am satisfied that he issued the second notice containing the undertaking, because he realisedthat the plaintiff would not give instructions to the service stations unless and until it received such notice. If, as I find, theplaintiff had expressly agreed to take the protective measures in respect of chits issued to the defendant's customers, the plaintiffgave no consideration for the defendant's undertaking. It undertook to do no more than it was contractually bound to do. The undertakingwould only be binding on the defendant, if the plaintiff was only obliged to cancel lost or stolen chits.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> For the aforesaid reasons, I consider that the plaintiff was not entitled to debit the defendant's account with the cost of goodssupplied in exchange for the disputed chits. Accordingly, I find that the defendant is only liable for the amount conceded at thetrial.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> It is also not really necessary to decide whether the chits in question were "lost" or "stolen" within the meaning of those wordsin the standard conditions. But, in case this goes further, I will state my conclusions on this aspect of the case. Mr. Lau contendedthat the chits were stolen, because the defendant's customers had failed to return them after the bailment thereof had been terminated,upon cancellation of the credit facility, and despite demands for their return. He argues that this amounted to an appropriationof property belonging to the defendant. I am not convinced that mere retention, as distinct from an express refusal, by a bailee,after the bailment has been determined, is an appropriation within the meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/210/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/210" class="autolink_findacts">Theft Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/210">Cap. 210</a>), since it does not obviously connote keeping the property "as owner". Even if it does amount to appropriation, the otheringredients of theft, e. g. dishonesty, intention of permanently depriving the other person, were not obviously present at the timewhen the defendant made its report to the plaintiff or to the police. The subsequent use of the chits might complete these ingredients,but on the evidence before me this did not take place until the 20th July 1984, at the earliest. On the proper construction of theplaintiff's standard conditions, I consider that a chit must have acquired the quality of being "stolen" before a report is madeto the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> In support of his argument that the chits were "lost", Mr. Lau referred me to the definitions of "loss" at p.180 of Vo1.3 of the2nd edition of <u>Words and Phrases Legally Defined</u> and <u>Sivewright v. Allen</u> <i>[</i>1906<i>]</i> 2KB81. With respect, I do not think that these sources offer any guidance on the meaning of "lost" in the standard conditions. Inmy view, Mr. Lau was on stronger ground by contending that the chits were "lost" if the defendant had been deprived of them and couldnot recover them. However, I do not consider that the evidence before me establishes these features of his suggested definition.I conceive that I must consider the meaning of "lost" on the basis that the defendant did not obtain any contractual undertakingfrom the plaintiff to assist it in the event that its customers defaulted in settling their accounts with the defendant. It seemsto me that a person can hardly be said to be <u>deprived</u> of something when he has voluntarily parted with possession of it to another, under a contract which does not expressly stipulatethat it must be returned to him in certain circumstances. No such provision is to be found in the agreement between the defendantand its customers (see e. g. pages 49 and 50 of Defendant's Bundle). In this respect, I think that there is some substance in MissKwan's submission that the defendant had no right to demand the return of the chits from its customers. For my own part, I wouldnot go along with her suggestions that the chits were delivery orders, or that the defendant transferred its property therein toits customers forever. Nor do I think that the authority she cited (<u>Eisinger v. General</u> <u>Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corpn. Ltd.</u> <i>[</i>1955<i>]</i> IWLR 869) supports her argument. The distinction drawn in that case by Lord Goddard C. J., between loss of the car and loss of theproceeds of its sale, could, in my view, only be applied to chits used by the defendant's customers before the defendant cancelledits credit facilities to such customers. Nevertheless, I consider that her submission that a chit is not "lost" if it can be foundor located, after taking reasonable steps to trace it, more accurately reflects what was meant or contemplated by its use in theplaintiff's standard conditions. On the basis of the scanty evidence before me, I do not think that the defendant has establishedthat the chits which it issued to its customers were beyond being found or recovered at the time when it gave either of its noticesof cancellation. Accordingly, this alternative basis for denying liability to the plaintiff in this case must, in my view, fail.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">Sd.
