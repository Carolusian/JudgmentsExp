In each action, the Bank of India (BOI) was plaintiff,while Mr. Murjani and BKM were each guarantors of Murjani industries (HK) Ltd. for facilities granted to that company by BOI. Appealsagainst my decision were dismissed on 11th December 1989. Meanwhile, in September and October 1989, Mr. Murjani had been examinedin accordance with the provisions of Order 49B. It having become apparent to BOI that there were no assets against which executioncould  be levied, BOI caused to be issued bankruptcy notices against Mr. Murjani on 19th October, and against BKM on 29th October,each notice based on the judgment debts.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Within the time specified in the notice, i.e. 7 days, BKM applied for the notice to be set aside upon the ground that he has a counter-claimset off or cross-demand equal to or in excess of the judgment debt as provided in Section 3(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Ordinance (theordinance) which reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"3 (1)     A debtor commits an act of bankruptcy in each of the following cases --</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">.....</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <table border="0" width="80%">                <tr>                    <td width="8%" valign="top" class="quote">(g)</td>                    <td width="92%" class="quote">if a creditor has obtained a final judgment or final order against him for any amount, and Execution thereon not having been stayed,has served on him in Hong Kong or, by leave of the court, elsewhere, a bankruptcy notice under this ordinance, and he does not, within7 days after service of the notice, in case the Service is effected in Hong Kong, and in case the service is effected elsewhere,then within the time limited in that behalf by the order giving leave to effect the service, either comply with the requirementsof the notice or satisfy the court that he has a counter-claim set off or cross demand which equals or exceeds the amount of thejudgment debt or sum ordered to be paid, and which he could not set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained or the proceedingsin which the order was obtained: ..."</td>                </tr>            </table>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Mr. Murjani failed to make his application to set aside in time. Time was not extended by the Court. Accordingly, BOI's petitionagainst him was set down for hearing on 1st July 1991. By re-amended notice of motion dated 4th April 1991, Mr. Murjani gave noticethat he would show cause against the petition on two grounds:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(i)    He is not a debtor within the meaning of Suction 3(2) of the Ordinance, so that the court lacks jurisdiction and;</p>            <p>(ii)    He has a counterclaim and cross demand equal to or greater than the debt.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> By motion dated 25th June 1991, as amended (the June motion), Mr. Murjani sought a variety of reliefs. It is necessary to set outin full the terms of the June motion:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"l.    That the court should hear and determine the application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice in Bankruptcy No. B808 of 1990and/or the application to strike out the Statement of Claim in HCA No. A8752 of 1990 before hearing and/or dealing with the Petitionherein.</p>            <p class="quote"> </p>            <p class="quote">2.

Alternatively that all proceedings on this petition be dismissed or stayed or adjourned for such period and on such terms asthis Court deems fit on the following grounds.</p>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">(1)    That the Debtor denies his alleged indebtedness petitioner by reason of his claim against the petitioner in HCA No. A4481 of1991 and that the proceedings herein should be stayed for such time as may be required for the trial of HCA No. A4481 of 1991;</p>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">(2)    Further or in the alternative, that the petitioner is estopped and/or prevented from proceeding with its petition herein inthat:</p>            <p> </p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(a)    The Petitioner has issued a Statutory Demand against the Debtor in England in Bankruptcy Proceedings No. SD295 of 1990 basedon the same alleged debt on which it relies herein; and</p>                <p> </p>                <p class="quote">(b)    The said Statutory Demand was set aside by Mr. Registrar Scott on 26th October 1990 on the ground that the Debtor had an arguable/triablecross demand, set off or counterclaim based on the same facts as those upon which HCA No. A4481 of 1991 was founded;</p>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(3)    Further or in the alternative, that the issuing of and/or the proceedings under the petition herein constitutes an abuse ofprocess and/or wrongful acts in furtherance of the conspiracy alleged against the petitioner in HCA No. A4481 of 1991.</p>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(4)    Further or in the alternative, that the Petition herein is based on inadmissible evidence purportedly adduced herein withoutleave of the Court, such evidence having been obtained by the Petitioner in other proceedings and subject to the usual implied undertakingnot to use them for any collateral or ulterior purpose."</p>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5"> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/0/A8752/90.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">5.</a> HCA A8752/90</a> is an action for damages by BKM against State Bank of India (SBI), BOI and other Indian banks. It is the counterclaim upon whichhe bases his application to set aside the bankruptcy notice.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6"> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/0/A4481/91.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">6.</a> HCA A4481/91</a> is a similar action by Mr. Murjani, and a company called Fizzazz Inc. (formerly Tommy Hilfiger Company Inc. which I shall call THCo.). It is upon the same grounds as BKM's action and consitutes the primary basis for the relief which he seeks. For that relief,Mr. Murjani relies upon the Court's power to dismiss a petition under s.s. 9(2) and (3) of the Ordinance which read:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"(2)   At the hearing the court shall require proof of the debt of the petitioning creditor of the service of the petition and ofthe act of bankruptcy, or if more than one act of  bankruptcy is alleged in the petition, of some one of the alleged acts of bankruptcy,and if satisfied with the proof, may make a receiving order in pursuance of the petition.</p>            <p class="quote"> </p>            <p class="quote">(3)    If the court is not satisfied with the proof of the petitioning creditor's debt or of the act of bankruptcy or of the serviceof the petition, or is satisfied by the debtor that he is able to pay his debts, or considers that for other sufficient cause noorder ought to be made, the court may dismiss the petition."</p>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">Thus the Court may dismiss a petition:</p>            <p class="quote">(a)    if the Court is not satisfied with proof of debt or the act of bankruptcy;</p>            <p class="quote">(b)    if the Court is satisfied that the debtor is able to pay his debts or;</p>            <p class="quote">(c)    for other sufficient reason.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Mr. Murjani also relies upon the Court's power to stay a petition under Suction 9(5) of the Ordinance which reads:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"(5)    Where the debtor appears on the petition and denies that he is indebted to the petitioner, or that he is indebted to suchan amount as would justify the petitioner in presenting a petition against him, the court, on such  security (if any) being givenas the court may require for payment to the petitioner of any debt which may be established against him in due course of law, andof the costs of establishing the debt, may, instead of dismissing the petition, stay all proceedings on the petition for such timeas may be required for trial of the question relating to the debt."</p>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>and under Section 104 of the Ordinance which reads:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"     The court may at any time, for sufficient reason, make an order staying the proceedings under a bankruptcy petition, eitheraltogether or for a limited time, on such terms and subject to such conditions as the court may think just."</p>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Mr. Murjani further relies upon the Court's inherent jurisdiction to stay for abuse of its process, and its general power to adjournthe hearing of a petition from time to time.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> It was agreed that BKM's application and Mr. Murjani's June motion should be heard together. The principal thrust of the June motionis that Mr. Murjani has a genuine counterclaim which relies on the same facts as BKM's counterclaim. The two effectively stand orfall together. Like Mr. Ronny Tong Q.C., who appeared for Mr. Murjani and BKM, I will deal with the June motion first, and add anythingnecessary in relation to BKM thereafter.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Pare. 3(2) - estoppel</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> After Mr. Tong had addressed me in opening, this ground was stopped in its tracks. An appeal against the decision of Mr. RegistrarScott was allowed on 6th July by Scott, J. I need say no more about it, other than that the Judge based his decision upon the whollyspeculative quantum of damages, and that while I find his decision of interest, I place no reliance upon it.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Para. 3 (4) - inadmissible evidence</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> On the reamended petition itself, two issues arise</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(i)    whether this Court has jurisdiction.

It is clearly established and hasrecently been affirmed in this House that a solicitor who, in the course of discovery in an action, obtains possession of copiesof documents belonging to his client's adversary gives an implied undertaking to the court not to use that material nor to allowit to be used for any purpose other than the proper conduct of that action on behalf of his client: see <u>Home Office v.

(It produces the agreeably entertaining situation of Kennedy, L.J.who delivered the final judgment saying "I agree.

The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the petitioner. The dismissalwas hardly surprising because it was clear that, without interrogatories or discovery, the petitioner had no other information ormaterial to prove the petition, despite what he had sworn to in his affidavit in support. The petitioner was effectively on a fishingexpedition.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> I accept that the court delivered some fairly trenchant judgments against discovery before a receiving order. Vaughan Williams, L.J.said at page 64:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"It is of the utmost importance to consider that in the sections of the Bankruptcy Act and in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/6A" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Rules</a> it is always recognized that anything in the nature of discovery and anything in the nature of examination of the bankrupt is somethingwhich must take place not before the receiving order is made, as in this case, but after the receiving order has been made. So faras my experience goes I have not only never known of an order for discovery or interrogatories to assist the petitioner in provingthe allegations in his bankruptcy petition, but in addition to that the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/6A/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.27</a> and the other provisions of the Act whether for discovery or for the examination of the debtor relate to proceedings which have tobe taken after a receiving order has been made and not before. It is really, speaking of the common law proceeding, as if a plaintiffwho had got no judgment but hoped he might get a judgment applied for an order for the examination of the defendant touching hisor her property before he brought in his judgment. In my opinion no such order as this asked for has ever been made in bankruptcy;nor, taking the analogous stage in common law proceedings, would it have been made at common law."</p>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">Fletcher Moulton L.J. agreed but added at page 65:</p>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">"In my opinion the principles on which discovery and interrogatories have been allowed in actions in the High Court shew that whenthe real issue is of a penal nature neither discovery nor interrogatories will be allowed. Now proceedings in bankruptcy are of coursenot actions, but in my opinion what the petitioner seeks by his petition is in the highest degree penal in its consequences. It amountsto loss of civil status carrying with it grave disqualifications, and the principles which in actions have guided the Court in givingor refusing discovery in the High Court appear to me to apply with special force to proceedings in bankruptcy, and shew that we oughtnot here to allow either discovery or interrogatories."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Mr. Tong submitted that Vaughan Williams L.J. at least made a clear statement that, under the bankruptcy legislation, discovery isnot available before a receiving order is made. I disagree. What emerges clearly is not that there is no power or jurisdiction togive discovery before a receiving order, but that there is a discretion to do so. Vaughan Williams L.J. said at page 62 "it is notdisputed but what the registrar had a discretion, whether he would make the order or not" and at page 65 "here, what is asked foris that the Court should exercise discretion". Fletcher Moulton L.J. used the words "ought not" which implied discretionary relief.Farwell L.J. said at page 66 "I think it plain that the registrar is justified in taking all those consequences into considerationbefore he exercises his discretion".</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> In the same case, Vaughan Williams L.J. referred to an earlier decision of the Court of Appeal <u>In re X.Y. ex parte Haes</u> (1902).  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20KB%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 K.B. 98</a>, in which he delivered the leading judgment. His Lordship expressly said that he was not detracting or departing from the judgmentsin that earlier case. In <u>X.Y.</u>, the Court examined the practice in the bankruptcy court which prevented a petitioning creditor from calling the debtor in supportof his petition, because bankruptcy proceedings were regarded as, in some sense, criminal. The examination was necessary becausethe creditor's application to produce in evidence certain books of the debtor had been refused. At page 104, Vaughan Williams L.J.said:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">"         It is suggested that there is now no ground for supporting this practice. Speaking for myself. I must say very reluctantly,because I consider the practice was a very wholesome one, I cannot find any principle which now justifies it, whether as regardsthe examination of the debtor himself, or the production of his books. In saying this I am bearing in mind, amongst other things,that since 1869 the nature of bankruptcy proceedings has been considerably altered. It is difficult to say that bankruptcy proceedingsare in any sense criminal now that a debtor may petition against himself. Under these circumstances I suppose that this practicewill have to be altered.</p>            <p class="quote"> </p>            <p class="quote">          I should add that if the books are produced, and they are proved to be the books of the debtor, it is plain that prima faciethey are evidence against the debtor as admissions by him. I think, therefore, that an order ought to be made for their production."</p>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">Romer and Cozens-Hardy L.J.J agreed.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> It would follow, as Mr. Robert Tang, Q.C. who appeared for BOI said, that if a debtor can be called on the hearing of a petitionby the creditor there is no reason why he cannot be required to discover documents or answer interrogatories. Indeed, it seems tome that that is the thrust of the decision in <u>Debtor No. 7</u>.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Further, it seems to me that it is <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/6A/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 24</a> which governs discovery generally in bankruptcy proceedings. It contains no restriction upon the timing of an application for discovery.<a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/6A/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 29(1)</a>, however, deals with discovery by third parties for which specific provision is plainly desirable and which would be inappropriatebefore a receiving order is made.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> I am satisfied, therefore, that the court does have a discretion to allow discovery in aid of a creditor in proving a petition inbankruptcy. I agree with Fletcher Moulton L.J., however, that the principles guiding discovery "apply with special force to proceedingsin bankruptcy", so that the Court will give extra scrutiny to any application for discovery before a receiving order is made.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> An Order 49B examination is not, therefore, necessary to circumvent a prohibition upon discovery in bankruptcy proceedings. The questionthen is whether a creditor should be allowed to use material obtained as a result of such an examination in support of a bankruptcypetition. The answer must, as a general rule, be "yes". I see no reason in law, logic or perhaps most importantly commonsense foranswering otherwise.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Both Mr. Tong and Mr. Tang referred to <u>Riddick v.

Again, not surprisingly, the Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff was not entitled to rely on it.In delivering the leading judgment, Lord Denning M.R. said at page 895:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"         The reason for compelling discovery of documents in this way lies in the public interest in discovering the truth so thatjustice may be done between the parties. That public interest is to be put into the scales against the public, interest in preservingprivacy and protecting confidential information. The balance comes down in the ordinary way in favour of the public interest of discoveringthe truth, i.e., in making full disclosure."</p>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">At page 896 he continued:</p>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">"         Compulsion is an invasion of a private right to keep one's documents to oneself. The public interest in privacy and confidencedemands that this compulsion should not be pressed further than the course of justice requires. The courts should, therefore, notallow the other party -- or anyone else -- to use the documents for any ulterior or alien purpose. Otherwise the courts themselveswould be doing injustice ... In order to encourage openness and fairness, the public interest requires that documents disclosed ondiscovery are not to be made use of except for the purposes of the action in which they are disclosed. They are not to be made aground for comments in the newspapers, nor for bringing a libel action or for any other alien purpose. The principle was stated ina work of the highest authority 93 years ago by Bray J. Bray on Discovery 1st ed. (1885), p.238.</p>            <p class="quote"> </p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">"A party who has obtained access to his adversary's documents under an order for production has no right to make their contents publicor communicate them to any stranger to the suit: ... nor to use them or copies of them for any collateral object ...

A party who seeks discovery of documents gets it on condition that he will make use of them only for the purposes of that action,and no other purposes."</p>            <p class="quote">Stevenson L.J. said at page 902:</p>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">"         But in my judgment the court has and should generally use the power to protect parties who make full and frank disclosureof documents, and the public interest in such disclosure; by discouraging the use by a plaintiff in a later action of a documentobtained on discovery in an earlier action. If the court can require an undertaking from a plaintiff not to misuse a document beforeit is produced to him, it should have the power to restrain him from misusing it after it has been produced. And if he misuses itbefore the court restrains him why should the court allow itself to be used to countenance his misuse of it? I think it is entitledand indeed bound to refuse him help and to regard his attempt to get it as an abuse of its process.</p>            <p class="quote"> </p>            <p class="quote">        I would therefore allow the appeal on this ground. There may be cases in which a plaintiff would be justified in bringingan action on a document disclosed in an earlier action. I do not say that it could never be done without abusing the process of thecourt. But generally speaking it would be an abuse of its process and in the circumstances of this case the plaintiff's use of thismemorandum is an improper use which the court should not countenance."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> It is clear, as Mr. Tang accepts, that material discovered in an action must not be used for any ulterior or alien purpose. If itis, it amounts to an abuse. I am at a loss to understand, however, how it can be said that the use to which BOI wishes to put materialobtained in the Order 49B examination is ulterior or alien or amounts to an abuse. I accept that technically bankruptcy proceedingsare different and separate from an action in which a judgment debt has been obtained. The essence of Order 49B and bankruptcy proceedingsis, however, the enforcement and recovery of that debt. Bankruptcy proceedings are, of course, for the ultimate benefit of all creditorsbut they flow naturally and inevitably from the judgment debt, and are no less enforcement than garnishee proceedings or a chargingorder. The notes at 45/1/3 of the Supreme Court practice 1991 recognise bankruptcy as a mode of enforcing a judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Further, as Mr. Tang pointed out, proceedings can be taken under S.60 of the Conveyancing and property ordinance to set aside a dispositionmade with intent to defraud creditors. 1t must be, he said, that material obtained in an Order 49B examination could be used as itcould hardly be said to be for an alien purpose. Equally, such material must be capable of use under Section 47 of the Ordinanceto avoid a settlement made at a time when a debtor was otherwise solvent. Otherwise, the donee would be entitled to keep the gift.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> I am satisfied, therefore, that the Court has a discretion to admit in the hearing of a bankruptcy petition material obtained bya creditor in an earlier 49B examination whether that material relates to assets, jurisdiction or any other matter which has to beproved before a receiving order can be made. I see no reason not to exercise my discretion in favour of BOI. It is not necessaryfor an application to be made in those earlier proceedings for BOI to be released from an implied undertaking. I will hear furthersubmissions, if necessary, as to what documents and other evidence should be used, and as to discovery in these bankruptcy proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> I was informed that an application by BOI in these proceedings for leave to use the order 49B material is part-heard before a master.I have no doubt that the Master will forgive me if I relieve him, as I do, of the burden of further considering that application.The issue having been raised and fully argued before me, I resolve it.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Paras. 2 and 3(1) - No debt due</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> By Action 4481/91 Fizzazz and Mr. Murjani seek damages including general, aggravated, exemplary and, in accordance with New YorkLaw, punitive damages against BOI and SBI. Four causes of action are pleaded against the two banks.</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>            <p>(1)    Conspiracy to injure;</p>            <p>(2)    Malicious detention and false imprisonment;</p>            <p>(3)    Abuse of process;</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(4)    Unlawful interference in economic interests.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> It is also pleaded that the two banks are jointly and severally liable for the three individual torts.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Put shortly, Mr. Tong's argument is thus. Mr. Murjani has a substantial and genuine claim. This gives rise to an equitable set offwhich has the effect of extinguishing the judgment debt. The Court cannot be satisfied that the debt.  upon which the petition isbased is or can be proved. Tharefore, the petition should be dismissed or, at least pending resolution of the issues in action 4481,stayed. Alternatively, if the Court is satisfied that there is a genuine claim, but not satisfied as to the amount, that constitutessufficient cause for dismissal under S.9(3) or for a stay under S.9(5) or S.104 of the Ordinance. Alternatively, the cause of actionhaving accrued in action 4481, and the two banks having become liable to pay damages upon issue of the writ.  Mr. Murjani is ableto pay his debts as provided by S.9(3).</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> I say immediately that I reject the final alternative. It is one thing to establish a genuine claim. It is quite another to say thatthis enables a plaintiff to settle his debts. The outcome on liability is still uncertain, and it may be some years before it isestablished; quantum, even if liability is established, may be assessed at an amount considerably less than that hoped for. In theabsence of authority, I have no hesitation in holding that simply establishing the existence of a genuine claim does not enable adebtor to say he is able to pay his debts within the meaning of S.9(3).</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> It is not in dispute that Mr. Murjani has to prove he has a genuine claim with a reasonable probability of success.

After reviewing the authorities,Warner J. said at page 362:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"         So far as relevant for present purposes, what emerges from those authorities may be summarized as follows. It behoves adebtor who wishes to avail himself of the third option in a bankruptcy notice to file an affidavit, or affidavits under rules 137and 138 showing three things on the face of it or of them, with adequate particularity, the burden of proof being on the debtor.First, the affidavit or affidavits must show that he has a cross-demand against the creditor which is genuine. To satisfy that requirement,the cross-demand must be put forward in good faith and must have a reasonable probability of success, or as it has also been expressed,must give rise to a triable issue. In the latter respect, there is no hard and fast rule as to the degree of proof required. It dependsin each case on the particular facts and circumstances of that case. Secondly, the affidavit or affidavits must show that the cross-demandcould not have been set up in the action in which the judgment relied on by the creditor was obtained. Thirdly, the affidavit oraffidavits must show that the cross-demand equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt. For that purpose the cross-demand neednot be for a liquidated sum or even for a sum of money at all. But it must be capable of being quantified in terms of money and theaffidavit or affidavits must quantify it."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> While accepting that he has a burden, Mr. Tong suggested that Warner J. perhaps went too far. For my part, I am content to acceptthat judge's test. Mr. Tang contended that the burden is no lighter than the burden on a defendant seeking judgment under order 14.He pointed out that a judgment under order 14 is final. In bankruptcy, however, the making of a receiving order upon a petition doesnot necessarily dispose of a debtor's claim, because it can be pursued by his trustee in bankruptcy if the trustee thinks fit.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Pursuant to <u>Bhagwandas Kewalram Murjani &amp; others v. Bank of India</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%201%20HKLR%20586" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 1 H.K.L.R 586</a>, the appeals against my decision giving judgment to BOI, Mr. Tang said he relied upon the inherent implausibility of Mr. Murjani'scase, and its inconsistency with the documents. I do not, however, find that approach to be apposite. The position here is very differentfrom the situation I faced in BOI's application for summary judgment against Mr. Murjani. and BKM where the defence which I characterizedas "transparently a concoction", relied upon Mr. Murjani's unsupported word and defied the other evidence. Mr. Murjani's evidencenow is far from unsupported, while there is considerable documentary evidence from the banks themselves which is capable of lendingsubstance to Mr. Murjani's claims. The more usual weighing of the material is, therefore, required.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> The Murjani family controlled and operated companies world-wide. They were known as the Murjani Group. Since 1985, the Group hashad a negative net worth. In 1987, the Group began to crumble having incurred massive debts which by 1988 were in the region of US$150million. By debt rescheduling and asset realization, it managed to pay off the majority of its creditors, principally its securedcreditors, so that its debt was reduced to US$35 million by January 1989, of which $34 million was guaranteed by Mr. Murjani. OverUS$20 million was owed to the Indian Banks in Hong Kong of which over $12 million was then due to BOI. Much of the funds to bringabout such a.reduction came from the sale or proposed sale of certain trade marks, or the licenses to use those marks, in relationto Coca-Cola, Gloria Vanderbilt, Tommy Hilfiger and Jeep.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> By the beginning of 1989 the Gloria Vanderbilt and Coca Cold rights had been disposed of and an action by Coca Cola settled. Unfortunately,after paying off creditors and settling the Coca-Cola action no surplus cash was left to start paying unsecured creditors, such asBOI, as had clearly been promised. Negotiations for the sale of TH Co. were taking Place about which the Indian Banks in Hong Kongwere kept informed. In November 1988, the Group wrote to SBI with a proposed schedule of repayments between April 1989 and 1993,based on cash flow from its four trade marks or licenses. In relation to the Tommy Hilfiger licence, a note made it clear that thisdepended upon the, sale of TH Co. equity to outside interests.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> The Tommy Hilfiger trade mark was owned by Tommy Hilfiger himself. A licence to use the mark was held by TH Co. which was part ofthe Group. In 1988, it is said the TH Co. business was worth US$31 million.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> It is fair to say, I think, that SBI was less than impressed by the situation.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> On 21st January 1989, Mr. Murjani came to Hong Kong to discuss the sale of TH Co., and on 1st February settled Heads of Agreementwith representatives of credit Agricole for the sale of TH Co. to a consortium of Mr. Murjani, who would take 49%, Credit Agricolewhich would take 17%, and Tommy Hilfiger and partners who would take 34%. The total price was US$23 million, of which paid up capitalwas to be US$15 million corresponding to good will. Mr. Murjani's or the Group's contribution was to be US$7.5 million. The affectwas that 51% of TH Co. was being sold for US$15.5 million. It still remained for Tommy Hilfiger himself to agree. For this purposeMr. Murjani was to fly to New York on or about 4th February to complete the sale. Copies of the Heads of Agreement were sent to lawyersfor Mr. Murjani and Tommy Hilfiger. Meanwhile, Mr. Murjani attempted to negotiate with the Indian Banks in Hong Kong and to reschedulethe Group's debts with them. He informed them of the sale of TH Co. He produced an undated memorandum, undoubtedly on the 2nd February;which has been described as "a document calculated to chill the blood of any banker". That memorandum confirmed that the Coca-Colaand Gloria Vanderbilt rights had been disposed of without any cash surplus. It said discussions for the sale of TH Co. were takingplace but, as there was a condition that all of TH Co.'s creditors be paid in full, an immediate surplus would be unlikely. It continued:</p>    <p class="quote">                "6.        <u>Repayment of Bank Debt</u></p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">            With a continuing negative net worth position, the termination of the Coca-Cola business and the sale of the Gloria Vanderbiltrights (including the rights to future royalties) the Group finds itself unable to formulate proposals for cash repayments at thispoint of time.

The Indian Banks did not like what they saw. They saw their chances as unsecuredcreditors (personal guarantees of Mr. Murjani and BKM apart) of recovering their debt diminishing, as secured creditors and otherunsecured creditors were being paid first. The Indian Banks, it is now alleged, conspired to keep Mr. Murjani in Hong Kong and wreckthe TH Co. sale, partly in the hope of exerting pressure and obtaining some benefit, and partly by way of revenge.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> On 3rd February 1989, SBI telexed its Head Office in India.

The guarantee, under which SBI intended claiming,provided for payment on demand and contained the following clause:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">"4.    Any demand under this Guarantee shall be considered as having been duly made if signed by anyone of your managers or otherauthorised officials and sent by registered post addressed to the Undersigned at the address above given or at the last known placeof abode or business within Hong Kong of the Undersigned."</p>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> Mr. V. Gupta, Chief Manager of SBI, made an affirmation in support of the application. After briefly but reasonably accurately, recitingthe background, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">"10.    It is intended that formal notice be served forthwith on the intended defendant pursuant to the guarantee giving 7 days noticeof demand for payment.

Mr. Tang, however, argued that Clause 4 is simply a deeming provision and does notpreclude an oral demand. He said SBI had, in fact, mad an oral demand. While accepting that Mr. Tang's interpretation of Clause 4is tenable, I do not think that the point has relevance to the issues which I have to determine. The position is that, prima facie,SBI had no cause of action on 4th February, and it is difficult to see how Gupta could have affirmed that it did.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Pelion, hwoever, was piled an Ossa. Order 44A Rule 1, under which SBI's application was made, provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"    1.

No undertaking was given. Proceedings were not, in fact; commenced until 17th February. It is hardlysurprising that the prohibition order was discharged on 24th February. BOI, however, obtained a prohibition order on the same dayissuing its writ on 25th February. Mr. Murjani was then detained in Hong Kong until 19th October, some 8 months, the only apparentbenefit to BOI being the opportunity to examine him, as I have already mentioned.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> Before issuing its writ however, BOI had remained in touch with its Head Office.

The sale of TH Co. fell through andthe Murjani Group lost the Tommy Hilfiger licence, because Tommy Hilfiger in an undated letter to Mr. Murjani explained:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"It was, therefore, directly as a consequence of the prohibition order that the proposed joint-venture collapsed.

Nor can it be arguable that BOI in any way could havecountenanced this, assuming it knew which I think is also unarguable.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> It is also clear that while the banks were clearly acting in concert BOI at least had no predominant intention of injuring Mr. Murjani,TH Co.or BKM. The telexes emphasise that they were at least equally anxious to achieve some sort of compromise or settlement, notleast to avoid protracted litigation (I doubt whether BOI ever anticipated that the litigation would be quite so extensive and protractedas it has become). Further, given that the banks had common solicitors and were acting together, in which I see nothing wrong, Ido not see it as arguable that SBI could have had a predominant purpose to injure Mr. Murjani and the others.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> The crux then is whether SBI's purpose in obtaining the prohibition order was improper, i.e. to stop or wreck the proposed sale ofTH Co. to Credit Agricole.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> Section 21B of the Supreme Court Ordinance, so far as it is relevant, provides:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"21B.

Murjani Industries (HK) Ltd. &amp; another</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%202%20HKLR%20276" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 2 HKLR 276</a>, the Court of Appeal (of which I was a member) held that subsection (3)(d) refers to the period both before and after judgment, i.e.both the obtaining of judgment and its enforcement. Mr. Tong said that the issue is the securing or pursuance of a civil claim. Hesaid in general terms that stopping a sale is not within the purpose of a prohibition order. He said specifically that preventingthe sale of TH Co. could not be said to facilitate the securing or pursuance of a claim on a guarantee and that, in any event theeffect of a prohibition order would not necessarily be to stop the sale. He argued that a consequence, but not effect of Mr. Murjanibeing restrained was to abort that sale, but the order would not necessarily prevent another sale as TH Co. or the Murjani Groupgenerally could continue their activities. He said the use to which S 21B has been put usurps the function of a Mareva injunction,which is the appropriate method of securing an alleged debtor's assets if there is a risk of dissipation, or the function of theCompanies Court wherein winding up of the companies guaranteed by Mr. Murjani more properly should have been sought.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> The real purpose of s.21B Mr. Tong submitted, is to secure the person of a defendant to answer a judgment debt, not now by way ofimprisonment, but at least by way of examination as to his assets. I reject this submission. If that had been the purpose of thelegislature, it could easily, have said' so instead of using the much wider wording which clearly encompasses purposes other thansimply ensuring that a debtor will be available for examination after judgment obtained. I am satisfied that the wording is wideenough to allow the restraint of an alleged debtor in order to prevent him taking part in activities which would in all probabilityaffect at least the enforcement of any judgment obtained. If there is an overlap with Mareva relief I see no difficulty. Both areforms of injunctive relief subject to scrutiny by the Court which will ensure (I hope in all future cases) that they are regularlyapplied for and obtained.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> In deciding this issue it is important to rehearse whet took place during the hearing. In his reply, Mr. Tong attempted to arguethat restraining one person to prevent a sale by another cannot facilitate anything to do with securing or enforcement of a judgmentagainst the person restrained. Mr. Tang objected. I upheld the objection. I had not understood that to be Mr. Tong's argument inopening, although I would have been happy to hear argument to prevent injustice to Mr. Murjani because of. any misapprehension onmy part. In my view; however, the point was not open on the Statement of Claim. In spite of the care with which the pleader had distinguishedbetween the various persons, the thrust of the claim as I read it was that Mr. Murjani was restrained to prevent the sale of TH Co.,it being implicit that he had such right of disposal.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> The position, therefore, was that the Indian Banks were faced with the imminent departure of a man who was guarantor to them forsums in excess of US$20 million; who clearly had direction of the Murjani Group including TH Co. and its funds; who was responsiblefor negotiating with the banks for a possible allocation to them of such funds none of which had to date reached them; who had saidnothing would be forthcoming from the proposed sale of TH Co.; and whose presence was indispensible if that or any other sale wasto be effected. Mr. Murjani being thus so closely identified with TH Co. it is difficult to see how it can be said it was wrong toseek to prevent him disposing of a business on terms which would confer no immediate benefit to the banks, when it might otherwisebe made, through Mr. Murjani to produce something more tangible for them. A Mareva injunction which would perhaps have been appropriatewould not have had the same immediate impact, involving as it would have done taking steps in New York to have it recognized beforeit could become effective.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> In my judgment, SBI's purpose in obtaining the prohibition order was not improper, it being a purpose contemplated by S.21B. I find,therefore, that Mr. Murjani has no genuine claim against SBI or BOI. It follows there is no substance in any of the remaining paragraphsof the June Motion. Accordingly, that motion is dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> BKM's application stands or falls with that of Mr. Murjani. In the circumstances, that application is also dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> In case I am wrong in my conclusion I shall deal briefly with the other two matters it would have been necessary for me to consider,namely quantum and whether to dismiss or stay the petition. As to quantum, it seems to me that two elements are of particular importance.First the consequences of the aborting of the sale of TH Co. I am satisfied that what was being sold (and it is arguable to say thevery least) was the business of that company in spite of the debate as to whether shares or business the subject of sale. I recognisethe inconsistency on the part of Mr. Murjani who said initially that it was the sale of shares. If that was so, of course, Fizzazzwould have no claim. Other witnesses, however, deposed that it was the business to be sold. Analysis of the Heads of Agreement suggeststo me that that is the correct interpretation, otherwise there would have been no necessity to set up a new company to acquire whatwas being sold.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> Quite what would have been the result if the sale had taken place is far from clear. Both Counsel had difficulty in interpretingthe figures in the Heads of Agreement, and demonstrating what benefits would have flowed to TH Co. and, by reason of a reductionof the Groups's debt, to Mr. Murjani as its guarantor. It could be as low as US$3 million. Further, in spite of Mr. Tong's submissionto the contrary, it seems to me at least debatable whether the sale would have gone through, an earlier completed sale having fallenthrough and being a sale in which Tommy Hilfiger was again involved. There is every reason to think that there would have to be areduction in the amount of damages to take into account what Mr. Murjani described as loss of a "significant opportunity".</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a> The other element is punitive damages. It is arguable that <u>The Adhiguna Meranti</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20HKLR%20904" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) HKLR 904</a> was wrongly decided, and that while the lex fori generally applies, a particular issue between parties may be governed by the lexloci delicti. Even assuming, however, that Mr. Tong is correct and that the lex loci delicti, i.e. of New York, applies so as tobring not only the head of punitive damages within the Hong Kong's purview but also its quantification. I think it highly unlikelythat a Hong Kong Court would award the sort of sum that might be obtained in New York.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="pseudopara" id="p93">93.</a> The position as to damages, therefore, I find highly unsatisfactory and speculative. I would have been quite unable to say that therehad been demonstrated not only a genuine claim, but one equal to or in excess of the judgment debt. That would have effectively disposedof BKM's application because under S.3(l)(g) of the Ordinance, it does not appear that the Court has any discretion. The Court mustallow the application to set aside a bankruptcy notice or dismiss it. I did not understand Mr. Tong to argue to the contrary.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="pseudopara" id="p94">94.</a> I would not, in the circumstances, have considered dismissing the petition against Mr. Murjani. My initial reaction was that if agenuine claim was made out, the petition must necessarily be stayed or adjourned. It seemed to me that a genuine claim would demonstratethoroughly reprehensible conduct on the part of the banks. Such conduct does not, however, necessarily emerge. On the other hand,Mr. Murjani does not come to this Court with entirely clean hands. He did not disclose to the banks that between lst and 8th February,the critical period of these proceedings, the TH Co. business was frozen by an injunction in New York obtained by one of the partiesto the earlier sale. In BOI's action against him, he attempted to rely on a defence of moratorium which is now demonstrated as plainlydeceitful. At the same time as he was asserting this defence before the Court of Appeal on 20th July 1989, there was poised in NewYork an action by Mr. Murjani and Fizzazz similar to that which they are now prosecuting in Hong Kong. That New York action was launchedthe following day. Even if Mr. Murjani's Hong Kong lawyers were not aware of the significance of SBI's telex of 3rd February, whichforms the basis of. Mr. Murjani's action against SBI and BOI, Mr. Murjani clearly was. I would add that the New York proceedingshave now been dismissed on the basis that the New York Courts lack jurisdiction.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="pseudopara" id="p95">95.</a> In exercising my discretion, therefore, I would have looked at other grounds. I would have accepted, I think, that Mr. Murjani'saction is inextricably involved with BOI'S claim. This together with the fact that Mr. Murjani admittedly has no assets are powerfulfactors: In <u>Re L.H.F. Wools Ltd.</u> (1970) 1 Chancery 27. I would take into account that if a receiving order is made, Mr. Murjani would have difficulties, althoughnot insurmountable ones, in prosecuting his action since it would have to be done by his trustee. I say not insurmountable becauseFizzazz. would still be able to carry on, and success on its. part must necessarily redound to the benefit of Mr. Murjani. Mr. Murjanianyway is being subsidized by someone to conduct litigation, at no little expense, both in Hong Kong, London and New York. If thatperson feels so strongly about Mr. Murjani's innocence, he will , no doubt, put the trustee in funds. The Court will be able to ensurethat the trustee is not improperly blocked by the creditors if he decides to pursue the action.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="pseudopara" id="p96">96.</a> There would no doubt be delay in prosecuting the action which, apart from the usual consequences, means that Mr. Mrujani's reputationwill remain tarnished for longer than necessary, and BOI will have profited from its wrong-doing, if Mr. Murjani' is ultimately successful.There is also a possibility that BKM who is old and whose health is not good, might die before he is vindicated.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a> On the other hand. BOI has an unassailable judgment for some US$10 million. Whilst it is true that Mr. Murjani now has no apparentassets upon which to fasten, he did have assets of which he divested himself during a period of some ten years before 1989. The trialof Mr. Murjani's action is unlikely to be concluded for two years. While that is not a long time in terms of litigation, it seemsto me desirable that, sooner rather than later; BOI or the trustee should have the opportunity of examining the transactions by whichsuch divestment took place and, if appropriate, having them set aside.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="pseudopara" id="p98">98.</a> I would not, in the circumstances, have exercised my discretion in favour of Mr. Murjani, and stayed or adjourned the petition.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">(N.J.
