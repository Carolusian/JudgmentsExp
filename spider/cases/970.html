He was admitted in 1983and 10 years later, set up his own firm. Prior to becoming a solicitor he had been the Group Public Relations Officer of the SwireGroup.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The day before the article appeared, the Plaintiff received a telephone message to return a call to a Miss Rukie Hussain, who isthe 5th Defendant in these proceedings. When he did so, the 5th Defendant asked him whether he was the Honorary Vice-Consul of Paraguay,to which the reply was yes. Her next question was whether the Plaintiff was aware of any passport scam to which the answer was no.She then said that it had been mentioned in a newspaper in Paraguay. When the Plaintiff asked for a copy to be faxed to him, the5th Defendant said that she had not seen the article herself but that her colleague had seen it. The Plaintiff chided her for raisingsuch a matter when she had not seen the report herself. Her retort was "Then you have nothing to say on this." The Plaintiff disagreed.He said "When you raised -- asked a question," -- I said, "I am not aware of the passport scam. And you should quote me -- you canquote me and you will quote me."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> After this interchange, the 5th Defendant asked the Plaintiff why his appointment had ceased. To this, the Plaintiff replied, "Well,this is quite a normal procedure. A new president was elected last year. And in fact, my appointment should have been terminatedlast year" - or "end of last year." That was the end of the conversation and the article appeared the following morning.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The Plaintiff testified that he considered it normal procedure because senior officials in power had all been changed with the changeof government and the Honorary Consul General's appointment had been terminated, so the Plaintiff considered that the terminationof his appointment would only be a matter of time as this kind of appointment needed the blessing of those in power. As he did notknow the officials then in power, he expected it to be a matter of routine that his appointment would be terminated.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> When the article was brought to the Plaintiff's attention the next day, he felt shocked, humiliated and outraged. Later that morning,he spoke to the 2nd Defendant Mr David Wong who is the Editor in Chief of the Hongkong Standard. He told Mr Wong that his appointmentcame to an end not by dismissal but by simple termination. The Presidential Decree stating this was faxed to Mr Wong who said hewould look into the matter.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Shortly after midday, the Plaintiff spoke to the 4th Defendant who is the Diplomatic Editor of the newspaper. The 4th Defendant informedhim that "those paragraphs about you were not put in by me." When the Plaintiff complained that the article was damaging to him ashe is a solicitor, the 4th Defendant said that he was the one who followed the story and <strong>knew that it had nothing to do with the Plaintiff</strong>. As to the paragraph which talked about "the sackings" by the Paraguayan authorities, the 4th Defendant replied that that was notthe word that he had used in his manuscript because "London only confirmed the termination" and he was unable to explain how theword "sackings" came to be used.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Late that afternoon, after seeking legal advice, the Plaintiff spoke to Mr David Wong again, informing him that the Plaintiff's solicitorswould be sending him a letter which would demand an apology from the newspaper. Mr Wong indicated that they were still consideringthe position and would probably write a follow-up article to clarify the position. He said it would not be possible to let the Plaintiffhave a preview of that article and that if a letter from the Plaintiff's solicitors were received, the Defendants would have to seeklegal advice and if their lawyers did not think that an apology was needed, then "the whole thing could drag on for a long time."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The Plaintiff's solicitors did send a letter dated September 15, 1994 to the Chief Editor of the Hongkong Standard complaining aboutthe article, stating that the allegations that the Plaintiff had been "dismissed or sacked from his office as Honorary Vice-Consulof Paraguay" were highly defamatory of him. The letter asked, inter alia, for the publication of an apology in the terms set outbelow, in as prominent a position as the article complained of.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The apology sought was in the following terms:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">"<u>Apology to Mr Robert H.Y.

The Plaintiff felt annoyedbut at the same time he was also quite worried: he did not know whether there was something that the newspaper knew that he did not.It was not until March 1995, when the Defendants stated in their response to a request for further and better particulars regardingthe plea of justification, that no misconduct was alleged that the Plaintiff's worries on this front were allayed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> On June 11, 1996, for the first time, the Plaintiff saw a copy of a document dated May 24, 1996 issued by the Cabinet Office of theMinistry of Foreign Affairs, certifying:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"that the duties of [Mr S.S. Chan and the Plaintiff] which were exercised in the capacities of Honorary Consul General and HonoraryVice-Consul of Paraguay in Hong Kong, respectively, were terminated by Decrees of the Executive Power Nos.4762 and 5128 dated 18July 1994 and 11 August of the same year. This step was taken on the basis of alleged irregularities which occurred at the Consulate,about which accusations were made and which are under investigation."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">This certificate was issued at the request of the 4th Defendant. The Plaintiff felt it necessary to seek clarification from the ParaguayanGovernment himself and he made a trip to Paraguay. He left Hong Kong on June 19, 1996, only a few weeks before the trial of thisaction and managed to obtain a certificate from the Chief of Cabinet, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Paraguay, in connectionwith the certificate issued on May 24, 1996, which stated that, inter alia,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"in the records of the National Foreign Ministry there are no documents referring to irregularities which may have been attributedto [the Plaintiff], nor are there any investigations now being carried out on that regard, for which reason the reference made inthe certificate dated 24 of May of the current year is not relative to his person."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> From the Plaintiff's point of view, the article came at a bad time. His own firm was set up less than a year prior to the publicationof the article. At a time when he was actively developing his practice, adverse publicity must be damaging. The Plaintiff testifiedthat the action worried him greatly. For almost two years much of his time and attention had to be set aside to handle this litigationinstead of handling matters for his clients or developing his practice. The Plaintiff said that he felt very embarrassed when meetingpeople because he could never tell whether they had read the article and have any views about it.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> There is no doubt that the Plaintiff regarded his Honorary Vice-Consulship as an honour. Both the Queen's commission and the letterspatent had been prominently displayed in his office and attracted much comment from his clients. It is the Plaintiff's belief thathis credibility to his clients was thereby enhanced and to have his termination portrayed as a sacking or dismissal was ignominious.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The Plaintiff holds other honorary office: he is legal adviser to the Japanese school, the supervisor of a Japanese kindergartenand Chairman of the Board of Advisers of an educational institute whose members are prominent people with an interest in education.</p>    <p align="left"><strong>Is the article defamatory?</strong></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Whether the words complained of are defamatory is a question of construction and not of evidence.

At the forefront of their submissions is the plea that these words do not bear any defamatory meaningand that it is true to say that the Plaintiff had been "dismissed or sacked". Mr Huggins Q.C., for the Defendants, submitted thatthese words do not carry any connotation of misconduct or any grounds for suspicion of misconduct on the part of the Plaintiff. Hereferred to the definition of the word "dismissed" in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary,</i> namely:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"To send away or remove from office, employment or position; to discharge, discard, expel."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">and to the definition of "sacked" in the Supplement as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"That has been 'given the sack'; dismissed, discharged (from employment or office)."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> But the meaning of the words conveyed cannot be ascertained merely by reference to their dictionary meanings, divorced from context.As they do not exist in a vacuum, they must be construed in the context in which they appear. In this connection, it is not justthe paragraphs concerning the Plaintiff that are to be read as the Defendants were inviting the court to do. Those words have tobe construed in the context of the article as a whole.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> It is the Defendants' submission that the words mean no more than that the Paraguayan Government unilaterally relieved the Plaintiffof his duties and that his status and functions as Honorary Vice-Consul were terminated without notice, without prior consultationand without reference to his wishes. It was argued that because the Paraguayan Government was entitled so to do, i.e. to unilaterallyterminate his Honorary Vice-Consulship at its own whim and pleasure, the Defendants were entitled to use the words "dismissed" and"sacked" and that such words were not defamatory. In the master and servant context, (which Mr Huggins Q.C. was at pains to pointout was not the case here,) the word "dismissal" is usually associated with summary dismissal, i.e. dismissal for cause suggestingsome kind of misconduct on the part of the person dismissed. Where the words are used in the context of the dismissal of a vice-consularofficial by a sovereign government, the Defendants submit that they do not denote anything other than a unilateral termination ofservices or status and in the context of the article, are simply not capable in their natural and ordinary meaning of being defamatoryas alleged by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> The ordinary reader is unlikely to be aware of the legal niceties that exist between terminations in a master/servant context andby a sovereign government. It would only be natural for the ordinary reasonable reader to associate it with a master/servant situation,that being overwhelmingly the more usual context for those words to be used. In any event, the context in which those words werepublished has to be considered to see if they carried an imputation of disreputable conduct. As Mr Yu Q.C. submitted, the underlyingtheme of the article was undoubtedly about a passport scam: the first and last paragraphs refer to such a scam. It was reported thatthe Plaintiff was asked questions relating to the scam. Throughout the article, the words "sacked", "fired" and "dismissed" wereused interchangeably. Even if the dictionary meanings of "dismissed" and "sacked" are as neutral as Mr Huggins Q.C. makes out (whichis questionable), in the context in which the words were used, they were charged and emotive and wholly inappropriate if all theywere meant to do was to report an innocuous and neutral event rather than to sensationalize it.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The article reported three "dismissals" or "sackings". The first sacking related to an alleged passport scandal or scam. The Plaintiff'sdismissal was not portrayed in a different and self-contained context. He was asked by the 5th Defendant about the scam allegationsand his response was reported. I have no doubt that the ordinary reader would come away with the impression that the three sackingsarose from conduct that was, at the very least, questionable. I do not accept the Defendants' submission that all the article didas regards the Plaintiff was to report and notify readers that the office of the Plaintiff as Honorary Vice-Consul had been terminatedwithout notice or reason which is the prerogative of the Government of Paraguay. Such an innocuous news item would not have meritedspace on the front page. Nor would it have been necessary for the author(s) of the article to depart from the text of the PresidentialDecree in which the neutral word "terminated" was used.</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="3%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="97%"><i>The meanings in para. 5(1), (3) and (4) of the Statement of Claim</i></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The thread running through the article is an alleged passport scandal or scam to which the sackings were related. The desire of largenumbers of Hong Kong residents to acquire foreign passports in the last decade or so is well known and unique at this particularjuncture of Hong Kong's history. Indeed certain unscrupulous individuals have exploited this keen desire and profited from the situation,a fact that is common knowledge, at least among those who live in Hong Kong. Those words mean much more than mere administrativeand procedural irregularities in the processing and issuance of passports: they connote conduct that, on any view, is discreditableto those involved in it.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Mr Yu Q.C. submitted that the reasonable reader would conclude either that the Plaintiff was sacked because he was involved in apassport scandal or at least that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that he was. The Defendants disagree. They maintain thatthere is simply no basis for a court to reach the conclusion that the Plaintiff was implicated in a passport scandal because allthe article did was to report that an investigation was being launched into an <i>alleged</i> passport scandal. The Defendants submit that there is all the difference in the world between saying someone is guilty of an offenceand that he has behaved in a suspicious manner. Moreover, as the Plaintiff has deliberately chosen to plead his case as one of involvementas distinct from being suspected of involvement, the latter meaning is not open to the Plaintiff unless he were to amend his pleadingswhich he has not sought to do and such an amendment could not have been made except on terms that he paid costs up to and includingthe day of the amendment. For this proposition, the Defendants relied on <strong>Jacobs</strong> <strong>v.</strong> <strong>Schmaltz</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281890%29%20LT%20121" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1890) LT 121</a> and the commentary in the <i>Supreme Court Practice</i> at 20/5-8/11.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> The dichotomy between suspicion and guilt was addressed in Lord Devlin's speech in <strong>Lewis v.

It can be said as a matterof practice that it very often does so, because although suspicion of guilt is something different from proof of guilt, it is thebroad impression conveyed by the libel that has to be considered and not the meaning of each word under analysis. A man who wantsto talk at large about smoke may have to pick his words very carefully if he wants to exclude the suggestion that there is also afire; but it can be done. One always gets back to the fundamental question: what is the meaning that the words convey to the ordinaryman: you cannot make a rule about that. They can convey a meaning of suspicion or of guilt; but loose talk about suspicion can veryeasily convey the impression that it is a suspicion that is well founded.</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">....

The use of words such as "alleged" and "allegations" may nonetheless imply guilt.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> The article talked about the launching of an investigation, the sacking of the diplomat to clear the way for a full-scale probe andthe removal of diplomatic immunity. It then referred to another scandal in Antigua involving its honorary consul regarding the allegedselling of visas to Chinese people for US$20,000. This was followed by a report of the dismissal of the Plaintiff who said he hadno idea of the scam allegations. Yet he, like the other two diplomats, was sacked. At the very least, the article conveyed the impressionthat the suspicion was well-founded. Effectively, the same treatment was meted out to the Plaintiff as to the other two diplomatsmentioned in the article who were directly involved. This was followed by a paragraph that purported to state the Plaintiff's explanationfor his termination. But it was cast as a "claim", insinuating that there must be reservations about that claim or that it is somehowquestionable.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> Although Mr Huggins Q.C. stressed that the dismissal of a diplomat is an exercise of prerogative by a sovereign government and noreasons need be given for the exercise of the power, the concluding paragraphs of the article conveyed the clear message that therewere reasons for the sackings but that the Foreign Office and the Protocol Division "had failed to give details". So we have a situationwhere it is said reasons exist but were not disclosed. It would make the reader curious to discover the underlying reasons. Withoutmore ado, the reader is provided with a possible reason, namely, the report in Noticias about allegations made by the British authoritiesover the issue of Paraguayan passports. Although the reference was to "a senior officer", no differentiation had been made betweenthe two sackings (i.e. of the two Chans) and the reader was led to suppose that there were reasons for both.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The following passage from Lord Devlin's speech in <strong>Lewis v. Daily Telegraph,</strong> supra (at p.284) is particularly apt in the circumstances:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"When an implication is made in a general way, the ordinary man is not likely to distinguish between hints and allegations, suspicionand guilt. It is the broad effect that counts and it is no use submitting to a judge that he ought to dissect a statement beforehe submits it to the jury. But if on the other hand the distinction clearly emerges from the words used it cannot be ignored."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Given the common theme of the article, in my judgment, the ordinary reader would suppose that the reasons for the two sackings wouldbe related. This would make the Plaintiff's explanation that his termination was normal procedure false.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> As to the amendment point and whether involvement encompassed suspicion of involvement, Mr Yu Q.C. distinguished <strong>Jacobs v. Schmaltz</strong> on the ground that in that case the pleading without the proposed amendment would not have disclosed a cause of action. That is verydifferent from the case here. Moreover, he submitted that the rule of pleading is clear: the greater includes the lesser but notvice versa.

In <strong>Lewis v.

If, as Ihave found, the impression conveyed is the implication of the Plaintiff in a passport scam, it is not a defence that the Defendantswere merely repeating someone else's libellous statement.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Reading the article as a whole, the ordinary reader could not escape the conclusion that the Plaintiff was tarred with the same brushas S.S.

But with the greatest respect, I donot see that their subjective views as to the meaning of those words can constitute a defence of justification in law. A defendantwho relies on justification has to identify the defamatory meaning which he is prepared to justify. See <strong>Lucas-Box v.

See <i>Duncan &amp; Neill on Defamation</i>, op.cit. para.18.04. Where there has been no retraction or apology, an order for damages is the only solatium available to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> In the recent Court of Appeal decision in <strong>Cheung Ng Sheong Steven v. Eastweek Publisher Ltd</strong>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%203%20HKC%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 3 HKC 601</a>, it had to consider the question of damages for libel. It accepted (at p.613D-F) the submission that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... damages for libel must provide for several disparate elements, not only damage to esteem and reputation. They also 'must be sufficientto publicly and demonstratively and absolutely vindicate the Plaintiff and to compensate for seriously injured feelings (<strong>Yu Kwong Chu v. Consolidated Newspapers</strong> <strong>Ltd.</strong> (A258/86, unreported) at p.30' not only caused by the original libel but all the subsequent aggravation thereof down to the verdict,which would restore the Plaintiff's 'pride and confidence' (<strong>McCarey v. Associated Newspapers Ltd. (No.2)</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%203%20All%20ER%20947" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] 3 All ER 947</a> at 958). They must enable the Plaintiff to convince a bystander the baselessness of the charge if 'the libel driven underground,emerges from its lurking place at some future date' (<strong>Cassell v. Broome</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%201%20All%20ER%20801" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 1 All ER 801)."</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Submissions were made in that case to the effect that in the assessment of damages for defamation, regard should be had to personalinjury awards. Although the disparity between enormous awards made for relatively inconsequential and ephemeral defamation and themodest awards for the most damaging personal injuries that are moreover permanent can only be viewed as scandalous, the House ofLords' decision in <strong>Cassell v. Broome</strong>, supra, is binding and the use of personal injury awards has been held to be impermissible. See also <strong>Rantzen v. Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%20QB%20670" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] QB 670.</a> In <strong>Cheung Ng Sheong</strong>, Nazareth V.-P. said at p.612C-F:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The nature of the injury in libel is very different to that in personal injury so are the consequence and the nature of what is soughtto be made or provided for by relevant damages. Unlike the mixture of inextricable considerations, the punitive element, the conductand attitude of a defendant, the vindication of the plaintiff to the public both at the time and in case the libel driven undergroundshould emerge from its lurking place at some future date, and adequate solatium that all weigh in damages for libel, those for personalinjury are relatively few and straightforward. Plainly the dangers of using awards for one to assess those for the other would begreat, particularly for juries. ... There is no escaping the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal in <strong>Rantzen</strong> at 694D that 'there is no satisfactory way in which conventional awards in actions for damages for personal injuries can be usedto provide guidance for an award in an action for defamation.'"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Mr Huggins Q.C. submitted that as a matter of principle, logic, common sense (and even good taste) awards in defamation cases oughtnot to be in excess of those for physical injury, personal suffering and disability. This, he argued, did not amount to a submissionthat the court should approach its assessment of an award of damages for defamation by using personal injury awards. It appears tome that such a distinction verges on the casuistic: if personal injury awards are to act as some cap or ceiling for a particularcase, they would be providing guidance which is not permissible. I am therefore unable to accede to Mr Huggins' submission.</p>    <p align="left"><strong>(b) Relevant considerations</strong></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> In assessing damages in the present case the relevant considerations include the following: the seriousness of the libel having regardto the Plaintiff's position and standing; the prominence of the article and the circumstances of its publication; conduct of theDefendants including conduct subsequent to the Plaintiff's complaint; and the absence of any retraction or apology.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> The libel is a serious one since it impugns the reputation of a professional man. The article suggested that his termination as HonoraryVice-Consul was because of misconduct or suspected misconduct which associated him with a passport scam or scandal. To the Hong Kongreader, this connotes discreditable conduct involving abuse of power or position for gain and not merely administrative and proceduralirregularities in the granting and processing of applications. It is very damaging indeed to any professional man, much less a lawyer,to have his integrity and honesty impugned and reputation sullied. The importance of a lawyer's reputation appears from the judgmentof Cory J. in <strong>Morris Manning and Church of</strong> <strong>Scientology of Toronto v. S. Casey Hill</strong>, Supreme Court of Canada, July 20, 1995 (unreported) at p.46:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The reputation of a lawyer is of paramount importance to clients, to other members of the profession and to the judiciary. A lawyer'spractice if founded and maintained upon the basis of a good reputation for professional integrity and trustworthiness. It is thecornerstone of a lawyer's professional life. Even if endowed with outstanding talent and indefatigable diligence, a lawyer cannotsurvive without a good reputation ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> In addition, the article was put in a place of great prominence: it featured on the front page of a well-established English languagenewspaper with an average monthly circulation at the time of publication of over 52,000 copies.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> Then there is the conduct of the Defendants. The Plaintiff's evidence of the conversation he had with the 4th Defendant was not challenged.As the Defendants have chosen not to give evidence the Plaintiff's account is accepted as true. The 4th Defendant himself admittedthat he did not know how the paragraphs concerning the Plaintiff came into written: he knew that the Plaintiff had nothing to dowith the story. He could not explain how the word "sacking" came to be used when what had been confirmed was the Plaintiff's termination.Clearly something is seriously amiss when the diplomatic editor responsible for the article can proffer no explanation. In the circumstances,the Defendants' conduct in publishing the article can only be described as irresponsible, reckless and grossly negligent.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> The injury to the Plaintiff was exacerbated by the Defendants' refusal to retract or apologize. Further, additional distress wouldhave been caused by the plea of justification and fair comment having regard to the fact that the 4th Defendant had told the Plaintiffthat he knew the Plaintiff had nothing to do with the scandal, and by the extensive plea in para.6(7) of the Amended Defence sincethat must be intended to suggest that the Plaintiff's "dismissal" or "sacking" was anything but normal procedure.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> When in March 1995, the Defendants made known to the Plaintiff that they were not alleging any misconduct on his part, any alleviationof personal distress brought about by the publication of the offending article was limited in scope: as it was contained in a pleading,it was never made public.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> There is also the fact that within weeks of the start of the hearing, the 4th Defendant went to Paraguay for the purpose of obtainingclarification of the circumstances of the termination of the two Chans. Whilst the Defendants vehemently objected to the admissibilityof the certificates issued by the Cabinet Office of Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Paraguay, they had earlier sought to put in theMay certificate by a hearsay notice. Even assuming that the certificates are not admissible in evidence, the fact and purpose ofthe journey that was made constitute conduct subsequent to publication to which the court is entitled to have regard. The only reasonableinference is that up to the eleventh hour and despite the 4th Defendant's knowledge that the Plaintiff had nothing to do with thepassport scandal and the Defendants' acknowledgment that no misconduct was being alleged against the Plaintiff, the Defendants appearedto go to extraordinary lengths to seek to show otherwise. All of this must have added considerably to the Plaintiff's anxiety anddistress.</p>    <p align="left"><strong>(c) Double recovery</strong></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> As two similar libels were published not only in the Hongkong Standard but also in the Sing Tao Daily on the same day, there is thedanger of double recovery if some part of the damages is the joint result of the two libels. The principles to be applied are setin the speech of Lord Greene in <strong>Lewis v. Daily Telegraph Ltd.</strong>, supra at p.267:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Here there were similar libels published in two national newspapers on the same day and each has to be dealt with by a differentjury. If each jury were to award damages without regard to the fact that the plaintiffs are also entitled to damages against theother newspaper, the aggregate of the damages in the two actions would almost certainly be too large. Section 12 of the DefamationAct, 1952, is intended to deal with that. In effect it requires that each jury shall be told about the other action, but the questionis what each jury shall be told. I do not think it is sufficient merely to tell each jury to make such allowance as they may thinkfit. They ought, in my view, to be directed that in considering the evidence submitted to them they should consider how far the damagesuffered by the plaintiffs can reasonably be attributed solely to the libel with which they are concerned and how far it ought tobe regarded as the joint result of the two libels. If they think that some part of the damage is the joint result of the two libelsthey should bear in mind that the plaintiffs ought not to be compensated twice for the same loss. They can only deal with this matteron very broad lines and they must take it that the other jury will be given a similar direction. They must do the best they can toensure that the sum which they award will fully compensate the plaintiffs for the damage caused by the libel with which they areconcerned, but will not take into account that part of the total damage suffered by the plaintiffs which ought to enter into theother jury's assessment."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> The difficulty with applying those principles in the present case is not only the fact that the English newspaper and the Chinesenewspaper cater for different readership, where the degree of overlapping on damages is likely to be no more than marginal, but alsothe fact that the libels are different in seriousness. Nevertheless, some adjustment would be justified.</p>    <p align="left"><strong>(d) Precedents</strong></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> I am indebted to leading and junior counsel on both sides for their comprehensive review of libel award cases from 1952 onwards.The older cases offer little assistance now since awarded damages need to keep pace with the rate of inflation. See <strong>Melvin Wong v. Jockey Daily News</strong> HCA No.2469 of 1984. As the circumstances of each libel are likely to differ and the factors to be taken into account depend on thefacts of each individual case, it is difficult to extrapolate from previous awards unless there are significant similarities. Ofthe many cases to which counsel on both sides referred, the following including two recent cases should be mentioned.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> The first is <strong>Choy Bing Wing v. Ng Yat Chi</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20HKC%20508" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 HKC 508.</a> Choy was a consulting civil structural engineer who had established a business relationship with a Chinese enterprise. The defendantwrote a letter to the directors of the enterprise which was copied to various ministries in Beijing to the effect that the Plaintiffwas an irregular architect, corrupt and guilty of unprofessional conduct. Exemplary damages were awarded because of various aggravatingfeatures including the fact that (i) the allegation of corruption was wholly unsubstantiated, (ii) the allegations were communicatedto a large number of people and (iii) the conduct of the defendant towards the plaintiff in that case could only be described asoutrageous and despicable. The plaintiff was awarded damages including the exemplary damages of $2.5 million. Mr Yu Q.C. submittedthat as the case was decided in 1992, adjusted for inflation, the current equivalent would be the order of $3.4 million.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Cheung Ng Sheong Steven v. Eastweek Publisher Ltd., supra, was a jury trial concerning a libel of a university professor. The defamationconcerned allegations that he failed to give lectures to students and refused to take a group photograph with the students. The juryawarded damages of $2.4 million which the Court of Appeal found excessive for what it described (at p.612H-I) as a libel "of merelymarginal seriousness". It was corrected within two weeks and was unlikely to have had any effect upon the Plaintiff high professional'sstanding and reputation. In that case, it considered that a minor fraction of $2.4 million would be adequate to compensate the statementswhich were of a petty nature which of course is not the case here. The Court of Appeal's decision is relevant for its statement ofthe principles to be applied in assessing damages which I have already set out above.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> Finally, I should mention <strong>Kan Chung Nin v. Li Kwong Ming</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20HKLD%20949" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] HKLD 949.</a> The publication was a circular sent to members of a residents' association numbering 300 where there was an attack was on the personaland professional integrity of the plaintiff who was chairman of the executive committee of the association and a solicitor. The awardwas $65,000. It is to be noted that not only is this case is a decade old, the libel was published in a limited geographical areato a limited group of people. It will be seen that the facts there are a far cry from those of the present case.</p>    <p align="left"><strong>(e) Quantum</strong></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> Leading counsel for the Plaintiff suggested that having regard to all the circumstances the appropriate award is $2.5 million. Thisis a serious libel against a professional man. The Plaintiff has been under the shadow of this libel for almost two years. He hashad to devote a significant part of his time on the litigation rather than developing his own practice which barely had the chanceto get going before this unfortunate article was published. There has been no retraction or apology. Rather, efforts were made tothe end to prove the Plaintiff wrong despite the absence of reasonable grounds for so doing. The publication could not have beenmore prominent and it was published by a well-established newspaper with a large circulation. Although the aggravating features areperhaps less serious and extensive than <strong>Choy Bing Wing</strong>'s case, there are a number of similarities. The Plaintiff is now completely vindicated.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Having regard to the relevant principles set out above and the need to restore the Plaintiff's "pride and confidence", "to convincea bystander the baselessness of the charge", and after making an adjustment to cater for double recovery, I reach the conclusionthat a proper award of damages in this case is $700,000 and there will accordingly be a judgment for the Plaintiff in this sum. Ialso grant the injunction sought. There will be an order for costs in favour of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Doreen Le Pichon)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">Judge of the High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">Mr Benjamin Yu, Q.C. and Mr Ashok Sakhrani, inst'd by M/s Fok and Johnson, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p align="left">Mr Adrian Huggins, Q.C. and Mr Robert Whitehead, inst'd by M/s Fairbairn Catley Low &amp; Kong, for the Defendants</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/1996/715.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
