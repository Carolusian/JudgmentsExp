They are the sons of Fu Kei Cheuk (ååºçµ). The 4th Plaintiff is the daughter to the 1stPlaintiff. They have another brother called Fu Lee Sang (åå©ç). Fu Lee Sang died in 1978. He had six sons. They are the Defendantsin this action. The Fus are indigenous villagers of Hoi Pa Village (æµ·å£©æ) at Tsuen Wan.</p>    <p class="heading">Lot  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=924%20DD%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">924 DD 449</a> and relocation of Hoi Pa Village</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Prior to 1982, the Fus lived in two village-type houses erected on Lot 924, Demarcation District 449, Hoi Pa Village. Since 1951,that piece of land had been held under the names of the four brothers (viz. the three Plaintiffs and Fu Lee Sang), each holding 1/4of the legal title. Although neither the Rent Roll certified by the District Officer in 1951 (at p. 7 of the Bundle of Documents)nor the Memorial for Division of Property at p. 8 explicitly spelt out each brother's share, their respective interest as 1/4 owneris evidenced by a number of documents. In a letter dated 14 January 1982 from the District Officer to the Fus at p. 79 of the Bundleof Documents, the respective interest of the brothers and nephews was set out. Likewise, in the Memorial for the Succession to Propertydated 8 June 1981 (p. 14), the six Defendants were recorded as succeeding to the 1/4 interest of Fu Lee Sang in the land. To thesame effect is the memorial for the appointment of the 1st Defendant as trustee for the 5th and 6th Defendants in June 1981 (at p.16-17). Although Mr Wong contended that the collective beneficial interest of the Defendants in Lot 924 was more than 1/4, this isnot a matter raised by the Defendants in their Defence and it is also contrary to the evidence of his clients. The 1st Defendantconfirmed in his evidence that his father and uncles each had 1/4 interest in that piece of land. I am not impressed by the submissionof Mr Wong that by the mere fact that Fu Lee Sang's family occupied more than 1/4 this court must conclude that Fu Lee Sang's beneficialinterest was more than 1/4. Counsel did not explore how and why Fu Lee Sang occupied more than 1/4 at the trial and there could bemany explanations consistent with Fu Lee Sang having only 1/4 beneficial interest. On the evidence, I do not find any reason to holdthat Fu Lee Sang's beneficial interest was not the same as stated in the documents, viz. 1/4. I also reject the suggestion of the5th Defendant in Paragraph 9 of his witness statement that his father had a larger share by village custom in the absence of expertevidence proving such alleged custom. I therefore proceed on the basis that the four brothers each held 1/4 beneficial interest inLot 924.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> After the death of Fu Lee Sang, the six Defendants succeeded to his interest in the land. This is evidenced by an instrument calledSuccession to Property registered by memorial No. 220780. That instrument was dated 8 June 1981. At that time, the 5th and 6th Defendantswere still minors and the 1st Defendant was appointed as trustee for them under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 18</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Hence, the 1st to 3rd Plaintiffs and the six Defendants became co-owners of Lot 924. Each of the three uncles held 1/4 interest whilstthe six Defendants each held 1/6 of the remaining 1/4 interest.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The Government was planning for the relocation of Hoi Pa Village in the late 1970's and early 1980's. By a letter dated 11 June 1981,the District Officer proposed that basing on the New Territories village removal policy, two 3-storeyed resite houses each of 700square feet ground area would be reprovisioned to the Fus upon surrender of Lot 924.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Due to the size of their families, the Fus felt that two houses were not sufficient to satisfy their residential needs. They askedfor four houses. After some correspondence, the District Officer replied by a letter dated 14 January 1982 informing them as faras removal policy was concerned the Government could only offer two resite houses. However, taking into account of the predicamentof the Fus, the Government could sell to them two additional small house sites, one at a place called Yau Ma Hom, the other at WestCheung Pei Shan. That proposal was accepted and the Fus surrendered Lot 924 on 3 March 1982.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> As a result, in exchange for Lot 924, the Fus got the following,</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) two resite houses at Lots 1525 &amp; 1526 Demarcation District 451 known as No. 21 and 20 respectively of Hoi Pa Resite Village["the 1st and 2nd Properties"] --- they needed not pay anything for these two houses;</p>        <p>(b) a site at Lot 1514 Demarcation District 451 known as No. 9 Hoi Pa Resite Village ["the 3rd Property"] --- this is one of the additionalhouse site. The Fus had to pay a concessionary premium for its acquisition and constructed a 3-storeyed house thereon at their owncosts;</p>        <p>(c) a site at Lot 1230 Demarcation District 450 known as No. 168 Yau Ma Hom Road ["the 4th Property"] --- this is the other additionalhouse site. Again the Fus had to pay a concessionary premium to acquire it and constructed a 3-storeyed house thereon at their costs.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Distribution of the four properties</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The legal owners of these four properties, as set out in the Government Grants of the respective property were as follows,</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) 1st Property (New Grant No. 6253 dated 22 October 1984) --- 3rd Plaintiff (6/12 share) and the six Defendants (1/12 share each);</p>        <p>(b) 2nd Property (New Grant No. 6254 dated 22 October 1984) --- 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs, 1/2 share each;</p>        <p>(c) 3rd Property (New Grant No. 6209 dated 20 August 1984) --- 1st Plaintiff and 2nd to 6th Defendant, 1/6 share each;</p>        <p>(d) 4th Property (New Grant No. 6040 dated 25 March 1983) --- 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs and 1st Defendant, 1/3 share each.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>These four properties are the subject matter of this action.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> By a Vesting Deed dated 12 December 1986, the legal title in respect of the 1/6 share in the 3rd Property was vested to the 6th Defendantafter the latter attained majority. Similar vesting deeds were executed in favour of the 5th and 6th Defendants with regard to thelatter's interest in the 1st and 3rd Properties.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The concessionary premium and the construction costs of the 3rd and 4th Properties were paid partly by an ancestral fund kept bythe Fus and partly by the sale proceeds obtained from the sale of one unit at the Ground Floor of the 1st Property to outsider. Beforethe sale was completed, the legal owners of the 1st Property entered into a Deed of Mutual Covenants dated 22 January 1987 ["the1st DMC"] (memorial No. 424031). The 1st DMC converted the original 12 shares into 36 shares so that the 3rd Plaintiff held 18/36shares instead of 6/12 shares, each of the six Defendants held 3/36 shares instead of 1/12 share. These shares were allocated inrespect of each floor of the 1st Property. The net result was that each floor represented 1/3 share of the 1st Property. The 1/3share for the ground floor was made up of 6/36 share from the 3rd Plaintiff and 1/36 share from each of the Defendants. The 3rd Plaintiff,as owner of the remaining 12/36 shares was given the exclusive use, occupation and enjoyment of the 1st Floor whilst the six Defendants,as owners of their respective remaining 2/36 shares (in total again 12/36 shares), was given the exclusive use, occupation and enjoymentof the 2nd Floor.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The sale to the outsider was completed by an Assignment dated 22 January 1987 and the 1/3 share together with the exclusive use,occupation and enjoyment of the ground floor unit was assigned to the purchasers.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs also entered into a Deed of Mutual Covenants in respect of the 2nd Property on 22 January 1987. However,no Deed of Mutual Covenants has been executed in respect of the 3rd and 4th Properties.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> In terms of actual occupation or use of the units, up to August 1999, the distribution was as follows,</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) <em>1st Property</em>:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>i. Ground Floor --- sold to others;</p>            <p>ii. First Floor --- 3rd Plaintiff;</p>            <p>iii. Second Floor --- the Defendants.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(b) <em>2nd Property</em>:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>i. Ground Floor --- 1st Plaintiff;</p>            <p>ii. First Floor --- 1st Plaintiff;</p>            <p>iii. Second Floor --- 2nd Plaintiff.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(c) <em>3rd Property</em>:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>i. Ground Floor --- 1st Plaintiff;</p>            <p>ii. First Floor --- the Defendants;</p>            <p>iii. Second Floor --- the Defendants.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d) <em>4th Property</em>:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>i. Ground Floor --- 3rd Plaintiff;</p>            <p>ii. First Floor --- 2nd Plaintiff;</p>            <p>iii. Second Floor --- the Defendants.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> I do not need to describe in details how the Defendants actually occupied and used their units because in this action, the contestis basically between the Defendants on the one side and the Plaintiffs on the other. I should mention that the 2nd Defendant didnot appear at the trial and I was told by counsel for the other Defendants that he was willing to abide by the decision of this court.Hence, when I refer to the Defendants, this rider has to be taken into account.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The 1st Plaintiff had allowed his daughter, the 4th Plaintiff, and her family to occupy and use Ground Floor of the 3rd Property.The 2nd Plaintiff had emigrated to Canada in 1992. Even before his emigration, he had let out the First Floor of the 4th Propertyto a tenant. His daughter Fu Sau Chun collected rent for him after his emigration. The 3rd Plaintiff had also leased out the GroundFloor of the 4th Property.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Hence, discounting the unit which had been sold for the construction costs of the 3rd and 4th Properties, the legal ownership ofthe 1st to 4th Properties were distributed amongst the uncles and nephews in a manner which the Defendants held 1/3 regarding 1stProperty plus 5/6 regarding the 3rd Property plus 1/3 regarding the 4th Property. Attributing 6 shares to each house, the proportionsof distribution of legal interest after the sale of Ground Floor of the 1st Property as between the Defendants and their three unclesand the purchaser of Ground Floor of the 1st Property can be worked out as follows,</p>    <p>Defendants: 9 (2 for 1st Property, 5 for 3rd Property and 2 for 4th Property)</p>    <p>1st Plaintiff: 4 (3 for 2nd Property, 1 for 3rd Property)</p>    <p>2nd Plaintiff: 5 (3 for 2nd Property, 2 for 4th Property)</p>    <p>3rd Plaintiff: 4 (2 for 1st Property, 2 for 4th Property)</p>    <p>purchaser: 2 (for Ground Floor 1st Property).</p>    <p>Amongst the uncles and nephews, the Defendants held 9/22 of the overall legal interest which is much more than 1/4 (the equivalentof which should be 5.5/22).</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> There was also an assignment by way of gift from the 2nd Plaintiff to the 1st Plaintiff in January 1987 regarding the former's legalinterest in the 2nd Property. The 2nd Floor of the 2nd Property was assigned to Fu Man Leung (the son of the 2nd Plaintiff) at thesame time. In 1993, Fu Man Leung sold the unit to people unconnected with the Fu family after the 2nd Plaintiff had emigrated. Sincethere is no dispute between the Plaintiffs, I do not need to work out the proportion of shareholdings as between them.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Of course, I appreciate that the aforesaid calculation does not take into account of the difference in terms of the valuations ofthe four properties. Valuation reports in respect of some of the units have been placed before me. However, I do not have the valuationin respect of the Ground Floor of the 1st and the 2nd Floor of the 2nd Property. The valuations of the 3rd and 4th Properties weregiven by the surveyor by way of one figure for the whole property instead of different figures given for each floor. Hence, I amunable to compare the values of these four houses. Mr Wong did not address me on the case of the defence as pleaded in Paragraph6(f) of the Re-re-re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim. On the material available, I am not satisfied that the total of the marketvalues of the 1st and 2nd Properties is higher than that of the 3rd and 4th Properties as alleged by the Defendants. Regarding thelegal and other costs pertaining to the preparation of the deeds of mutual covenants, the only evidence I have are the receipts ofMessrs.Wong, Hui &amp; Co. issued to the 1st Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> However, I have evidence from the surveyor as to the premium for the discharge of the restriction on alienation in the GovernmentGrants for the 3rd and 4th Properties. By reason of such premium, the net value of the 3rd Property was $1,240,000 out of a marketvalue of $3,000,000 and that of the 4th Property was $1,269,000 out of a market value of $2,820,000. On the other hand, the GovernmentGrants for the 1st and 2nd Properties do not contain any restriction against alienation. If this factor is taken into account, andone were to consider the 1st and 2nd Properties separately from the 3rd and 4th Properties, the Defendants held 1/5 of the overallinterest of the uncles and nephews in the 1st and 2nd Properties (disregarding the Ground Floor of the 1st Property), 7/12 of the3rd and 4th Properties. Hence, in respect of the 1st and 2nd Properties, the Defendants held 1/20 share less than 1/4 whilst in respectof the 3rd and 4th Properties, they held 4/12 more than 1/4. Even taking into account of the premium factor, it is still likely thatthe 4/12 excess is more than adequate to cover the 1/20 shortfall. Further, the surveyors' evidence indicates that the higher thefloor levels, the more valuable the properties would be and the Defendants got the 2nd Floor units for the 1st, 3rd and 4th Propertiesin the distribution. Therefore, one can safely proceed on the basis that the Defendants got more than 1/4 out of the overall legalinterests in the four properties held by the uncles and nephews. As I said, Mr Wong did not advance any arguments to suggest otherwise.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> In terms of occupation and use, under the arrangements set out in Paragraph 13 above, out of the 11 storeys held by the uncles andnephews, the Defendants got 4 storeys, hence more than 1/4.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The Defendants claimed that they had been mistreated by their uncles. Mr Wong said his clients' case was that the beneficial interestsin the 4 properties were not accurately mirrored in the legal ownership. The Defendants' beneficial interest, according to Mr Wong,were greater than their legal ownership. When I enquired with Mr Wong about the defence case as to the extent of beneficial ownership,at first he was unable to tell this court the quantification of the beneficial interest of the Defendants. It was only in the afternoonof the first day of trial that Mr Wong informed this court that his clients' case was that the Defendants' beneficial interest inthe properties should be 6/9 of the total interest of the uncles and nephews on the basis that out of the nine co-owners holdingLot 924, the Defendants accounted for six of them. This seems to be flying in the face of the fact that prior to the relocation,each of the 1st to 3rd Plaintiffs held 1/4 interest in Lot 924 and the six Defendants collectively held the remaining 1/4. But MrWong has tried to argue that 6/9 is equitable in the circumstances and I would deal with his submissions later.</p>    <p class="heading">Changes in 1999</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> I now need to recite an unhappy incident in 1999. As mentioned, the 4th Plaintiff resided at Ground Floor of the 3rd Property. In1999, the 4th Plaintiff lived there with her husband, their son of 12 years old and daughter of 7 years old. Since 26 June 1999,the husband of the 4th Plaintiff had been hospitalized and he sadly passed away on 29 September 1999. The 1st Plaintiff and his wifewere living at the 2nd Property and the 4th Plaintiff and her family used to have dinners at the home of the 1st Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The following account is based on the evidence of the 4th Plaintiff and the conviction of the 4th to 6th Defendants for criminaldamage in Tsuen Wan Magistracy Case No. TWC 3117 of 1999 as well as the admissions of the 4th and 5th Defendants in their evidence.I find the 4th Plaintiff to be a credible witness and in fact her account of the event was not subject to much challenge by Mr Wong.On 8 August 1999, when the 4th Plaintiff was having dinner at her father's place at the 2nd Property, the 1st and 4th Defendantswent there and demanded fiercely for the key to her home. She asked them why they needed the key to her unit. They did not give anyreason but kept on demanding. She did not give the key to them and they left. The 4th Plaintiff asked her brother to check if therewere any mishaps to her flat and when he returned, she was told that her unit was being pried open and some people were going intoher flat. Her sister advised her to make a report to the police and she did accordingly.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> When the police arrived, she went back to her home accompanied by the police and found that her properties including electric applianceswere thrown all over the place outside her door. The locks at the door and iron grille of her flat were pried and damaged. Some ofher properties like television, computer, video recorder and some furniture were damaged. Her bed was overturned. Some of the damageto her flat and her properties were shown in a series of photographs taken on 8 August 1999 produced as exhibit "P-2". It can beseen from those photographs that the damages were quite extensive. Obviously, the persons responsible for such actions meant to oustthe 4th Plaintiff from the flat and the damages done to the properties were caused maliciously.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The three persons who had entered into the flat to cause the damages, the 4th to 6th Defendants, were arrested by police. They weresubsequently charged with and convicted of criminal damage and each was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, suspended for 12months and fined $5,000.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Although the 5th Defendant said in Paragraph 30 of his witness statement that the Defendants regretted about this incident, I amsad to say that I cannot discern any remorse on his part about his conducts in the incident. The 4th Plaintiff testified that theDefendants did not say sorry to her nor did they offer any compensation. They pleaded not guilty and were convicted after trial.When the 4th and 5th Defendant gave evidence before me about the incident, they made it plain to me that they felt justified in theiractions and the 5th Defendant was even critical of the 4th Plaintiff making a report to the police.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The conducts of the Defendants after the incident also indicated their lack of remorse in respect of the incident. They locked upthe Ground Floor of the 3rd Property and refused to allow the 4th Plaintiff to have access to the same. The 4th Plaintiff had toseek the assistance of police officer to accompany her back to the unit to collect some of her belongings. Understandably, in viewof the fact that some of the Defendants were living in the upper floors of the 3rd Property, the 4th Plaintiff did not feel ableto continue to live there and she had to move to live elsewhere. Later on, the 4th Defendant moved into the flat and has lived thereever since.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Regarding the 4th Property, Fu Sau Chun gave evidence before me as to how the Defendants effectively ousted the others from the property.I accept her evidence in this regard which were not seriously challenged by Mr Wong at the trial. In August 1999, the tenant of theFirst Floor was told by someone claiming to be a cousin of her to move out because there was dispute over the ownership of the property.The tenant moved out at the end of August 1999 and handed back the keys to her. She went to the flat to inspect and eventually foundthat the locks had been changed without the knowledge of the tenant or herself. A report was made to the police. Prior to the tenantleaving the flat, he was paying a rent of $4,000 per month. The 6th Defendant moved into the unit later.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Based on the evidence of the 5th and 6th Defendants, it is quite clear to me that the Defendants had procured the moving out of thetenants at the Ground Floor and 1st Floor of the 4th Property. The 5th Defendant said in his cross-examination that the Defendantsrecovered possession of the Ground Floor and 1st Floor after the tenants left. He maintained that the Defendants did not occupy thoseflats prior to 2000 although they had the right to possession. The 6th Defendant lived on the Ground Floor and he also had keys tothe 1st Floor. He said under oath he occasionally lived at the 1st Floor. Although the 5th Defendant tried to impress this courtthat the Defendants only moved in after they found the flats vacant, I do not believe him. Bearing in mind what they did on 8th August1999, and the Defendants' evidence that they were quite frustrated about the lack of living space for their families at the materialtime, it is plain to me that the Defendants were responsible for causing the tenants to vacate from the 1st Floor and Ground Floor.I also accept the evidence of Fu Sau Chun that the lock to the First Floor of the 4th Property was changed as soon as the tenanthad moved out. Hence, when she visited the flat in September 1999, she could not open the door. I have no doubt whatsoever that itwas the Defendants who changed the lock and they did so in September 1999, hence the 6th Defendant got the keys to those two units.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> I have no doubt that they caused the lock to be changed in order to oust the Plaintiffs or their agents from the premises just aswhat they did to the 4th Plaintiff regarding the Ground Floor of the 3rd Property. I do not accept the evidence of the Defence witnesseswho professed that if the 1st to 3rd Plaintiffs asked for keys to the premises which they were co-owners or asked for re-possessionof the units, the matter could be discussed. On their own evidence, the Defendants had been demanding for more units and the uncleshad stalled their demands. They thought they had been treated unfairly and I find as a fact that they decided to resort to forciblere-entry and self-help in August 1999. In those circumstances, it is most unlikely that the Defendants would agree to surrender possessionof units they had obtained through questionable means even if the Plaintiffs were to raise the issue with them. Moreover, there isno suggestion that the Defendants had proposed the surrender of possession of any units to the Plaintiffs after the commencementof this action. To the contrary, the 5th Defendant said in his evidence that there could not be any discussion since the Plaintiffshad made reports to the police and issued proceedings against them. I find as a fact that the actions of the Defendants in 1999 werecalculated to oust the Plaintiffs from the Ground Floor of the 3rd Property and the Ground Floor and First Floor of the 4th Property.Upon the successful eviction or in the case of the 4th Property the procurement of vacation by those originally in occupation, theDefendants intended to and did actually occupy the three units as their owns to the exclusion of the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> After the present action had been commenced, the 3rd Plaintiff sold the First Floor of the 1st Property at $1,380,000 and the proceedswere paid into court pursuant to his undertaking to the court.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Hence, the current position regarding the possession of the units is as follows,</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) <em>1st Property</em>:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>i. Ground Floor --- sold;</p>            <p>ii. First Floor --- sold;</p>            <p>iii.

Ground Floor --- the Defendants;</p>            <p>ii. First Floor --- the Defendants;</p>            <p>iii. Second Floor --- the Defendants.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The positions of the parties</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The final stances of the parties in this trial are as follows. On behalf of the Plaintiffs, Mr Cheung submitted that the distributionof ownership as set out in the Government Grants should not be disturbed. The use and occupation of the 1st and 2nd Properties shouldcontinue to be governed by their respective Deed of Mutual Covenants. The 3rd and 4th Properties should be sold and their sale proceedsshould be distributed in accordance with the shares of the parties under the Government Grants.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> On behalf of the Defendants (other than the 2nd Defendant), Mr Wong asked for all the properties held under the names of the Plaintiffsand the Defendants to be sold and the proceeds be distributed as to 6/9 to the Defendants and 1/9 to each of the 1st to 3rd Plaintiffs.He did not address me specifically as to how I should deal with the three units which had already been sold. I do not think he suggestedthis court should do anything to disturb those sales. The purchasers had not been joined as parties to this action. This is one ofthe reasons why it is simply not possible for this court to grant any relief by way of partition in respect of the 1st and 2nd Properties.The parties have been well advised to abandon their applications for such relief. In respect of the First Floor of the 1st Property,I take it that the Defendants asked for the proceeds that had been paid into court be distributed in the same manner.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Counsel agreed that this court should first decide on the question of beneficial ownership of the properties. After the handing downof my decision, the parties would, if necessary, come back to address the court as to the appropriate order to be made regardingthe sale of the properties in view of this decision.</p>    <p class="heading">Beneficial ownership of the four properties</p>    <p class="heading">The respective case and evidence of the parties</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> As I have said, initially it was not clear to me what was the extent of the beneficial interest claimed by the Defendants. It wasnot satisfactorily pleaded in the Re-re-re-amended Defence and Counterclaim. In Paragraph 6(b), it was pleaded that there was anunderstanding amongst the uncles and nephews that "in due course rights of ownership and occupation of the flats within the 4 Propertieswould be divided and allocated according to need and at the end of the day the 6 Defendants would be entitled to own and occupy nofewer than 6 flats between them". That is not a plea of 6/9 of the overall beneficial ownership of the Properties. Mr Wong submittedthat beneficial ownership of the Defendants could stem from two alternative bases,</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) alleged promises by the uncles;</p>        <p>(b) contribution in terms of exhaustion of concessionary rights on the part of the Defendants.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He relied on cases on constructive trust like <strong>Bannister v Bannister</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1948%5d%202%20All%20ER%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1948] 2 All ER 133.</a></p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Although in Paragraph 6(b), the pleader averred that there was an understanding that in the interim, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffsand the Defendants and each of them would have collective beneficial ownership of all the flats in the four Properties, the evidenceof the Defendants is to the contrary. Their evidence was that the question of ownership was not discussed (see Paragraph 6 of thewitness statement of the 1st Defendant, Paragraph 4 of the witness statement of the 3rd Defendant, both adopted as their evidence).</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Even in their oral testimonies, the Defendants focused on the question of occupation and said they had been complaining to theiruncles about insufficient living space. They alleged their uncles promised them they would be given 6 units. According to the 1stDefendant (the eldest of the six Defendants), the promise was made after they had moved into the properties. This piece of evidence,even if accepted by the court, cannot assist the Defendants. The alleged promise was made after the division amongst the uncles andnephews and it was unsupported by any consideration. It was not evidenced in writing. Even if that alleged promise were to be understoodas a promise regarding the beneficial ownership of six flats, it is not enforceable.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> The evidence regarding the alleged promise is also problematic. None of the Defendants who gave evidence before me was able to testifyspecifically that a promise as to one unit being given to each of the Defendants having been made by the uncles <em>prior</em> to the Government Grants being issued. As I said, the 1st Defendant only adverted to promises made after they had moved into thenew houses. The 3rd Defendant was quite vague in his evidence and he said he did not take much part in the family matter since hewas rarely in Hong Kong. I do not find his evidence to be of any assistance. The 4th Defendant testified that it was mainly the 2ndPlaintiff who told the Defendants that they would get one unit each although the 3rd Plaintiff also mentioned the same. When pressedby counsel for more specific information as to circumstances under which the promise was made, he said he could not remember. The5th Defendant only became involved after 1994. He had discussions with the Plaintiffs including long-distance telephone conversationwith the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs. The specific grievance he mentioned was about the occupation of the Ground Floor by the 4th Plaintiffand insufficient living space for the Defendants. He considered it was unfair that as the owners of 5/6 of the legal interest inthe 3rd Property, some of the Defendants were only given the actual occupation of 2 out of 3 flats. He said the 3rd Plaintiff toldhim that he would solve that problem for them. In his oral testimony, he did not mention any alleged promise from the Plaintiffsto give each of the Defendants one unit in the Properties. Although he referred to that in Paragraph 21 of his witness statement,it was quite obvious from his oral testimony that he did not take part in the matter prior to 1994 and what he said in that paragraphabout the alleged agreement could only be hearsay. Given the evidence of his elder brothers, I attach no weight to it.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> The 1st Plaintiff also gave evidence as to the agreement between the uncles and nephews. According to him, there had been a numberof meetings amongst the uncles and nephews concerning the distribution of the flats. Although the 5th and 6th Defendants did nottake part (as they were then minors), the 1st to 4th Defendants (or at least three of them) took part. Those discussions culminatedin a consensus reached on 7 August 1983 at the home of the 2nd Plaintiff. They had to reach a consensus as they were about to signa contract for the construction of one of the houses. The consensus was subsequently recorded in a Chinese document written by the2nd Plaintiff. A copy of that document was produced as exhibit P-1 which, according to the 1st Plaintiff, was handed to him by the2nd Plaintiff about two weeks after 7 August 1983. It was not signed by anybody.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> P-1 recorded that ancestral fund would be used to construct the house at the 4th Property (which was granted to the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffsand 1st Defendant on 25 March 1983). If the fund was insufficient, the 1st Plaintiff would be responsible for 1/4 and the Defendantswould be responsible for the 3/4 of the balance. As it turned out, according to the evidence of the 1st Plaintiff, neither he northe Defendants needed to pay anything for the construction costs. According to P-1, the construction cost of the house at 3rd Propertywould be paid by sale proceeds from one of the Ground Floor units in the two resite houses built by the Government.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> As to distribution, P-1 recorded that both 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs would each get one unit at the Government resite houses (viz. the1st and 2nd Properties) and one unit at the 4th Property. The 1st Plaintiff would get two units at the Government resite houses andone unit at the 3rd Property. The Defendants would get one unit at the Government resite house and two units at the 3rd Property.As to the remaining unit at the 4th Property, initially the 1st Plaintiff was to hold 1/4 interest whilst the Defendants were tohold 3/4. Presumably, this was to mirror the financial arrangement concerning the construction costs of the 4th Property. Upon completionof the construction of the house at the 4th Property, the 1st Plaintiff would transfer his 1/4 interest back to the Defendants. Hence,ultimately, the Defendants would have the remaining unit at the 4th Property.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> There was no specific allocation of units by reference to a particular floor level in P-1. That was only done when construction ofthe houses were completed and keys were distributed. However, the arrangement recorded in P-1 was consistent with the subsequentdistribution of occupation of the units as stated in Paragraph 13 above.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The 1st Plaintiff said he was anxious to have the agreement recorded in writing as he might have to pay for the construction of the4th Property on which he had no legal title. Hence, P-1 was prepared by the 2nd Plaintiff at his request. The 1st Plaintiff saidsome minor details recorded in P-1 had not been discussed at the meeting of 7 August 1983, but the distribution of the flats amongstthe four fongs ("æ¿", viz. the four branches of the family) had been discussed.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> After the construction of the houses was completed, the 2nd Plaintiff being the eldest in the Fu family distributed the keys. Forthe 3rd Property, the keys were given to the 1st Plaintiff around the end of 1985. The 1st Plaintiff then proposed to the Defendantsthat he would have the Ground Floor whereas the Defendants would have the 1st and 2nd Floors. The Defendants agreed. Hence, the 1stPlaintiff gave the keys to the 1st and 2nd Floors to the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> As to the allegations of the Defendants that the Plaintiffs had promised them one unit for each of the Defendants, the 1st Plaintiffdenied that such promise had ever been made. However, he also said that the Defendants might have suggested that there was such apromise in oral conversations and in casual chats ("å£è¬æèæ", "è«è©±å¾åæèæ", "æ±å¶è¬"). But he was adamant thatthe Plaintiffs did not make such promises.<sup><sup>1</sup></sup> Although he tried to retract such evidence, I attach no weight to such retraction. I have listened to the digital recording of theseparts of his evidence carefully. It had not been suggested that these remarks had been made prior to the acquisition of the properties.From the context in which the questions were asked by counsel and the answers were given by the 1st Plaintiff, my understanding isthat these conversations and chats took place after the Defendants had moved into the houses.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> The Defendants denied that there was such a meeting on 7 August 1983. They said they had entrusted the Plaintiffs to deal with theGovernment concerning the surrender of the land and relocation of their families. They respected their elders and believed that thePlaintiffs would take care of their interest. They did not take part in any discussions and the decision about the distribution wasmade by the Plaintiffs. The Defendants said they only did what the Plaintiffs told them to do in signing documents relating to thesetransactions.</p>    <p class="heading">My analysis as to the consensus in 1983 and the alleged promises by the uncles</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> I think it is necessary to distinguish between two different periods. The dividing line is the time of acquisition of the Properties.In <strong>Gissing v Gissing</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%20886" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] AC 886</a> Lord Diplock observed at p. 906C to F,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">""...[I]n the branch of English law relating to constructive, implied or resulting trusts effect is given to the inferences as tothe intentions of parties to a transaction which a reasonable man would draw from their words or conduct and not to any subjectiveintention or absence of intention which was not made manifest at the time of the transaction itself.

(my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> There is no plea of fresh agreement reached between the parties after the acquisition of the four properties in the Re-re-re-amendedDefence and Counterclaim. The focus is therefore on the parties' common intention when the properties were acquired. Moreover, evenif the case of the defence could be regarded as a claim based on a fresh agreement, for reasons given in the other paragraphs inthis judgment, I would also reject the same.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> I shall first examine what happened prior to the acquisition. Despite the attempts by the 1st Plaintiff to retract his evidence concerningthe casual remarks, I have no difficulty in accepting his evidence that a consensus was reached between the uncles and nephews atthe meeting of 7 August 1983. In this respect I preferred his evidence to the evidence of the Defence witnesses. I find it inherentlyunlikely that the Defendants were not involved in the discussions in the family concerning relocation and the distribution of theunits amongst the four fongs. The 1st Defendant was 33 years old in 1983, the 3rd Defendant was 31, the 4th Defendant was 29. Theywere capable of looking after their own interest and according to the evidence they did take steps to do so. The 1st Defendant wasappointed as the manager for the 5th and 6th Defendants. The 1st Defendant gave evidence that initially, the uncles were minded toaccept the Government's proposal of giving the Fu family 2 pieces of land in exchange for Lot 924. It was upon the 1st Defendant'sinsistence that the Fus asked for 4 pieces of land instead. The letter dated 1 July 1981 from the Fu family to the chairmen of TsuenWan Rural Committee enlisting support for their request for more land was signed by the uncles and the 1st Defendant. It was onlyafter the District Officer had indicated by a letter dated 14 January 1982 that another two pieces of land could be earmarked forthe Fus that they executed the Deed of Surrender on 3 March 1982. The Defendants (except the 5th and 6th Defendants) executed thatDeed personally. Likewise, they also executed the Government Grants in respect of the 1st, 3rd and 4th Properties in which theirrespective shareholdings in the Properties were set out. It is clear to me that the Defendants did have a say in the relocation arrangementand they took part in the discussions.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Having fought hard to get four pieces of land from the Government, it is incredible that the Defendants just left the actual distributionamongst the four fongs to the uncles. I have alluded to the manners in which the legal title and the actual occupation of the fourproperties were distributed amongst the four fongs. It is quite obvious that distribution was by reference to fongs. If these wereall handled by the uncles without regard to the Defendants, and if the uncles were trying to take advantages of the Defendants asalleged by the Defendants, I find it difficult to understand why the distribution would be so favourable to the Defendants. The 1stPlaintiff said in his evidence that the agreed arrangement was based on common understanding and made in the spirit of toleranceand accommodation amongst family members. I find this to be more likely to be the truth than the version put forward by the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> In respect of the sale of the Ground Floor of the 1st Property, the 2nd and 4th Defendants signed the Chinese sale and purchase agreement(together with the three uncles) for selling that at the price of $300,000 on 9 May 1984 (at p. 144 of trial bundle). For the constructionof the house at the 3rd Property, a contract was signed with Wah Kee Construction Company on 24 September 1984 (at p. 177 of trialbundle). The 1st Plaintiff and the 4th Defendant signed that contract. All the Defendants except the 5th Defendant signed an accountstatement dated 7 December 1986 (p. 272 of trial bundle) concerning the incomes and expenses for the construction of the 3rd Property.Further, there was some refund of deposit from the contractor due to uncompleted works and according to a document dated 18 November1987, 2/3 was refunded to the Defendants whilst 1/3 was refunded to the 1st Plaintiff. This document (at p. 330 of the trial bundle)was signed by the 3rd and 4th Defendants. These documents, as well as the execution of the Government Grants, the Assignment of theGround Floor of the 1st Property to the purchaser and the Deeds of Mutual Covenants for the 1st Property in 1987 by the Defendants,in my judgment, evidenced the involvements of the Defendants in the relocation process and the distribution of the four propertiesin accordance with the understanding recorded in P-1 and their connivance to the same.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> I reject the evidence of the Defendants that in executing documents, they only did what their uncles told them to do. Most of theDefendants were adults and as mentioned above, the 1st Defendant gave evidence of an independent stance taken by them at least withregard to four pieces of land as a term for surrendering the old lot. The statement of account mentioned in the last paragraph isalso illuminating. It shows that the uncles did account to the nephews about the construction costs. In my judgment, this piece ofevidence is inconsistent with the scenario put forward by the defence that the uncles kept the nephews in the dark and dictated themto sign documents to implement whatever agreed upon by the uncles.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> I also reject the contention of Mr Wong that the Defendants did not have any real participation in the decision-making process andthe Defendants were in a disadvantaged position in the discussions. The mere fact that the Defendants did not dissent from the proposalsput forward by the uncles did not place the uncles in a position of trust and confidence. I am not satisfied on the evidence thatin 1983, the uncles were holding a fiduciary position towards the Defendants. The uncles were not acting as the guardians of theirinterests. It was the 1st Defendant who acted as the trustee for the 5th and 6th Defendants. Mr Wong has not directed my attentionto any handicaps suffered by the Defendants which rendered them vulnerable or dependent upon the advice or guidance from the uncles.As I said, the 1st to 4th Defendants were all adults at the material time and they had voiced their independent stance and even managedto persuade the uncles to follow their wishes in respect of the inadequacy of two pieces of land. There is no evidence whatsoeverto suggest that the uncles had exerted any actual undue influence over the Defendants regarding the agreement reached on 7 August1983.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> In my judgment, contrary to the suggestion of Mr Wong, the Defendants failed to establish any case of undue influence, whether presumedor otherwise. I have already alluded to the lack of evidence as to actual influence being exerted and as to the existence of a relationshipof trust and confidence. Amongst the many authorities included in his list of authorities, Mr Wong only referred me to <em>Snell on Equity</em>, 29th Edition p. 551-556 and <strong>Tate v Williamson</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281866%29%20LR%202%20Ch%2055" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1866) LR 2 Ch 55</a> on the topic of undue influence in his closing submissions. He did not indicate to me whether he was relying on a case of presumedundue influence or actual undue influence, and if it was a case of presumed undue influence, whether it was Class 2A or Class 2B(see <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>, 28th Edn. Para. 7-043). Given my above findings, there cannot be any actual undue influence nor presumed undue influence of Class2B type. Mr Wong cited <strong>Tate v Williamson</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281866%29%20LR%202%20Ch%2055" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1866) LR 2 Ch 55</a> as an example of undue influence exerted by an uncle over a nephew. Insofar as Mr Wong relied on this case as falling under Class2A (viz. presumption arising from certain specified relationships), I do not think this case supports such a proposition. On my readingof this case, it was a decision under Class 2B (viz. presumed undue influence arising from a de facto relationship of trust and confidence).</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> The equitable jurisdiction of the court in respect of undue influence has recently been examined by the Court of Final Appeal in<strong>Bank of China v Fung Chin Kan</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20HKLRD%20181" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 HKLRD 181</a> at Paras. 49 to 51. The essence of the jurisdiction is highlighted in the judgment of Lord Brightman in <strong>Hart v O'Connor</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20AC%201000" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] AC 1000</a> at 1024 cited in Para. 50 in the judgment of Litton NPJ. I do not find any basis to suggest that the uncles had acted unconscionablyor that the Defendants had been victimized.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> In my judgment, the 1st Plaintiff gave a credible account as to the circumstances under which P-1 was prepared and handed to him.The contents of P-1 were consistent with what happened afterwards. There were detail provisions in P-1 which are not relevant tothe issues that I have to decide and they were unlikely to be there if P-1 was made up for this litigation. As far as I can observe,the 1st Plaintiff is not a sophisticated person and if his evidence about the meeting of 7 August 1983 was untrue, I am sure thathe would be exposed by the skilful cross-examination of Mr Wong. Yet, his evidence about this meeting and the consensus reached thereatremained unshaken. I accept this part of his evidence as truthful.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> I therefore find as a fact that the subsequent distribution of the properties in terms of occupation was in accordance with a consensusreached between the uncles and nephews on 7 August 1983. Up to the acquisition of the properties, there was no agreement or understandingthat the nephews would each be given at least one unit.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> On the issue of beneficial ownership, no evidence has been adduced as to why the legal ownerships of the four Properties were distributedin the manner as set out in the Government Grants. There is no evidence to support the allegation in Paragraph 6A of the Re-re-re-amendedDefence that the uncles "unilaterally abused and/or misused their positions to allot more legal interests to themselves in the fourproperties". Mr Wong has not drawn my attention to any evidence as to how the Government would normally apply its policy regardingsmall houses for indigenous villagers in a relocation situation. The letter of 17 June 1994 from the District Lands Office showedthat the rights of the uncles and nephews had been exhausted by reason of their acquisition of the 3rd and 4th Properties. But thereis no evidence to indicate that the arrangement in the present case was unusual or that it was procured by the uncles to benefitthemselves.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> Given the stance of the Plaintiffs as stated in Paragraph 33 above, they in effect said that the beneficial ownerships were distributedin the same manner as legal ownerships. The Defendants contended otherwise. For reasons already given, I am not satisfied that bythe time the properties were acquired, there had been any common understanding amongst the uncles and nephews that the beneficialownership of the four properties would be held collectively with 6/9 thereof belonging to the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> After the acquisition of the properties, based on the evidence of the 1st Plaintiff and the Defendants, I find that the Defendantshad on some occasions demanded for six units (but not 6/9 of the beneficial ownership). However, the Plaintiffs had never promisedthe same. I do not think the 1st Plaintiff in his testimony ever acknowledged that the Plaintiffs had acceded to such requests. Properlyunderstood, his evidence was that he had heard allegations by the Defendants that such promise had been made, but actually no promisehad been given by the uncles. As to the evidence of the Defendants, due to the unsatisfactory aspects set out in Paragraph 39 above,I am not satisfied on their evidence that any promise had been given by the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Further, as the Defendants had not told me the detailed circumstances under which the alleged conversations took place and what hadbeen said exactly, I am not satisfied that the alleged promises, even if they had been given by the uncles, were meant to be legalbinding. In any event, I am not satisfied that such alleged promises can be relied upon to enable this court to draw an inferencethat there was such a common understanding at the time when the properties were acquired. For these reasons, as well as the reasonsgiven in Paragraph 38 above, I am therefore of the view that the oral conversations between the uncles and the Defendants after theacquisition cannot avail the Defendants in their claims, whether it be a claim for 6/9 of the beneficial ownerships or a claim for6 units.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> The aforesaid findings dispose of Mr Wong's case for 6/9 beneficial ownership based on alleged promises by the uncles. At this juncture,I reiterate that the defence has not pleaded a claim for 6/9 of the beneficial ownership. The only claims pleaded were for no lessthan 6 units (Paragraph 6(b) of the Re-re-re-amended Defence) and 1/12 interest for each defendant (Prayer (c) in the Counterclaim).This case of 6/9 beneficial interest is clearly a recent invention. It cannot be found in pleadings nor in witness statements filedby the Defendants. It took Mr Wong quite a while before he could pinpoint his case as such. I do not believe the Defendants whenthey gave evidence to the effect that 6/9 beneficial interest had always been their case. If what they said were true, I fail tosee why it was not pleaded in their Defence. This again reflected adversely on their credibility.</p>    <p class="heading">The loss of concessionary rights</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> The other basis on which Mr Wong advanced his case of 6/9 beneficial interest is the utilization of the Defendants' rights as indigenousvillagers with regard to the acquisition of the 3rd and 4th Properties. It is not clear to me whether Mr Wong advanced this groundby reference to the principle of resulting trust or that of constructive trust. On final analysis, it does not matter because ineither case he failed. Since the 3rd and 4th Properties were granted by the Government to the uncles and the nephews at concessionarypremium, the Government regarded that as the exhaustion of their concessionary rights as indigenous villagers in relation to acquisitionof land in the New Territories. This stance of the Government was set out in a letter dated 17 June 1994 from the District LandsOfficer of Tsuen Wan to the 1st Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> It seems to me the loss of such concessionary rights is the real grievance of the Defendants. They thought it was unfair to themeven though the uncles' rights were also exhausted. Their reasoning is as follows: all their rights had been exhausted whereas therights of the sons of the uncles were left untouched. Hence, their cousins were able to apply for other pieces of land with the benefitof concessionary rights whilst they could not do so. Therefore, it is pleaded in Paragraph 12(b) of the re-re-re-amended Defenceand Counterclaim,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"For some years the Defendants were prepared to tolerate the situation in anticipation that they would be able to acquire additionalsmall houses sites in accordance with government policy whereby each indigenous male is entitled to a village house...."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>When such expectation turned out to be unsustainable, the nephews blamed their uncles for the same.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> The 1st Defendant said in his evidence that they did not know about such loss until a letter dated 22 May 1992 from the Tsuen WanDistrict Lands' Office. That letter was apparently written in response to a name list submitted by the village representatives ofthe Hoi Pa village concerning applicants for acquisition of land at concessionary rates as indigenous villagers. The District Lands'Office informed the parties that the names of, inter alias, the uncles and nephews had to be deleted from the list because they hadalready benefited under the policy.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> The 1st Plaintiff also gave evidence that the uncles likewise were not aware of the loss of concessionary rights until this letterof 1992. I accept his evidence. This is consistent with the fact that the names of the uncles were also included in the list of applicantssubmitted to the District Lands' Office, hence there was reference to the deletion of the uncles' names in the response of 22 May1992.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> I have no reason to believe that prior to that letter, the uncles knew more about the loss of concessionary rights than the nephews.On the evidence before me, I have no reason to conclude that the District Officers who handled the execution of documents concerningthe relocation exercise had explained the matters in greater details to the uncles than to the nephews. The Defendants (except 5thand 6th Defendants who were represented by the 1st Defendant, not the uncles) attended the execution of the documents at the DistrictLands Office personally. The letters from the District Officer dated 14 January 1982 was addressed to the uncles as well as the nephews.Since the Defendants were anxious to fight for four pieces of land instead of two, they should have read this letter as well. Noneof the Defendants who gave evidence before me has suggested that the Defendants did not have any opportunity to read this letter.They must therefore be aware that the 3rd and 4th Properties were sold to them instead of given to them by the Government in exchangefor resumption of Lot 924.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Mr Wong submitted that the evidence of Fu Kwok Man showed that it was common knowledge that indigenous villagers had concessionaryrights. I fail to see how that could be relied upon to establish that the uncles in fact knew of the loss of such rights between1982 and 1992. As far as common knowledge is concerned, Mr Wong has not put forward any reason why the Defendants were in a lessadvantaged position than the uncles.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Neither party called evidence from the District Lands' Office as to the circumstances under which the relevant Government Grantsand the Deed of Surrender were executed by the uncles and nephews. I am therefore unable to tell whether the loss of concessionaryrights had been clearly explained to the uncles and nephews between 1982 and 1984. On the material before the court, I would proceedon the basis that the uncles and nephews were ignorant in that regard although the utilization of their concessionary rights shouldhave been apparent from Special Condition 13 in the Government Grants for the 3rd and 4th Properties. Based on the evidence beforeme, I am not satisfied that the uncles had misled the nephews on the question as to loss of concessionary rights. The uncles wereequally ignorant in that regard.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> I therefore reject the defence's suggestion of exploitation, non-disclosure or equitable fraud on the part of the uncles in relationto the loss of concessionary rights. But this is not the end of the matter. Mr Wong also based his argument on the contention thatthe concessionary rights should be regarded as contributions to the acquisition of the 3rd and 4th Properties. He submitted thatthe uncles had benefited from the Defendants' contributions and the in terms of head counts, since the Defendants provided 6 nameswhilst the uncles provided 3, the Defendants should be entitled to 6/9 beneficial interest. This seems to be an argument on resultingtrust.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> Taking it to its highest, I fail to see how that argument can be applied in respect of the 1st and 2nd Properties. I also have difficultiesin accepting that the uncles had benefited from the use of the Defendants' names. The Defendants' case is that under the Governmentpolicy, each indigenous villager is entitled to one flat built on land acquired at concessionary premium. Hence, the three Plaintiffswould be entitled to three flats. As it turned out, in respect of the 3rd and 4th Properties, under the arrangement set out in P-1,the Plaintiffs got three flats. Therefore, the uncles did not benefit themselves from the use of the Defendants' names.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> I am of course aware that despite the use of the names of all the Defendants in the 3rd and 4th Properties, they only got three flatsinstead of six. I do not know the reason why the names of all six Defendants had to be included in the Government Grants for the3rd and 4th Properties. I do not know whether it was a special requirement imposed by the Government. The defence adduced no evidencein that regard. I am therefore unable to conclude that this was caused by the uncles. Prima face, the Defendants were given lessthan what they were entitled under the usual Government policy. But I am unable to say that this was due to the fault of the uncles.For reasons already given, my finding is that the Defendants were capable of looking after and should have looked after their owninterest. If they failed in that regard, they cannot cast the blame on their uncles.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> It is also not clear to me as to why the use of the names of the Defendants could be regarded as contributions. Mr Wong referredto the fact that the parties were able to acquire the 3rd and 4th Properties at a concessionary premium due to the status of theDefendants as indigenous villagers. However, the 1st to 3rd Plaintiffs were also indigenous villagers and as mentioned above, theywere entitled to acquire 3 flats at a concessionary premium on their own account.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> Moreover, the concessionary premium came with a price, the restrictive covenant under Special Condition 13 in the Government Grants.Hence, when an indigenous villager wishes to sell to outsiders, he has to pay back the difference in the premium to the Government.Therefore, the concessionary premium is only a personal entitlement of an indigenous villager. It is not transferable and thoughit is beneficial to the indigenous villager, it is not a saleable right. I therefore reject Mr Wong's oral submission that this courtshould recognize that the right to concessionary premium could be traded in the market. That submission is wrong in principle andcontrary to authorities, see <strong>Chung Mui Teck v Hang Tak Buddhist Hall</strong> CACV 20 of 2001, 22.5.2001. Mr Wong relied on <strong>Li Pui Wan v Wong Mei Yin</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20HKLRD%2084" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 HKLRD 84</a> to support his proposition and he also referred to <em>Sihombing &amp; Wilkinson's Hong Kong Conveyancing Law and Practice</em> Vol. 1, II [37]. Unfortunately, the extract included by Mr Wong in his bundle of authorities is an out-dated version. I have checkedthe latest edition of <em>Sihombing &amp; Wilkinson's Hong Kong Conveyancing Law and Practice</em>. That paragraph has been replaced with a paragraph containing explicit reference to <strong>Chung Mui Teck</strong>. When this court referred Mr Wong to <strong>Chung Mui Teck</strong> in the course of his closing submission, he was unable to offer this court any assistance regarding that decision. I have read <strong>Li Pui Wan</strong> and I cannot find anything therein to support Mr Wong's proposition.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> Mr Wong also argued that but for the use of all the Defendants' names, and thus the exhaustion of their concessionary rights, the3rd and 4th Properties could not be acquired. Given the failure of the Defendants to adduce any evidence as to why the names of allthe Defendants were included in the Government Grants when three of them (plus the 1st to 3rd Plaintiffs) should be sufficient tosatisfy the requirement under the usual Government policy, I cannot be satisfied that without the inclusion of all Defendants asgrantees in the Government Grants for the 3rd and 4th Properties, the Government would not sell the same to the uncles and nephews.Hence, this submission fails for want of evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">My conclusions on beneficial interest</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> For all these reasons, I am not satisfied that the beneficial interest in the properties should have any correlation to the factthat all the Defendants were named as grantees (with the result that their rights as indigenous villagers had been exhausted).</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> I would also observe that as far as the 3rd and 4th Properties were concerned, the Defendants' overall legal interest is more than1/4. They have 5/6 in respect of the 3rd Property and 1/3 in respect of the 4th Property. I do not see anything intrinsically unfairor inequitable to the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> In the circumstances, the Defendants failed to convince me that there is any valid ground for intervention by equity as to the distributionof the ownership of the four properties. I therefore hold that in the present case, the beneficial ownership shall be in accordancewith the legal titles as set out in the Government Grants. As mentioned by Litton NPJ in Para. 51 of his judgment in <strong>Bank of China v Fung Chin Kan</strong>,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"[G]enerally speaking, when a person signs a legal document, he or she is bound by the act of signature : As a matter of general law,it is no defence to say that he or she did not understand the contents of a legal document; that person takes the chance of beingbound by its terms, as he or she can take the simple precaution of not signing until its contents have been fully explained and understood."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> Having so decided, I accept the suggestion of Mr Cheung. I am of the view that the existing position with regard to the 1st and 2ndProperties should not be disturbed. The Deeds of Mutual Covenants shall continue to govern the rights and obligations between theparties. The sale proceeds of the First Floor of the 1st Property should be released to the 3rd Plaintiff. Regarding the 3rd and4th Properties, my present inclination is to order a sale thereof with its sale proceeds after deducting expenses and costs (andit may include costs of the present action) to be distributed in accordance with the legal interest of the parties as set out inthe Government Grants. However, I will give an opportunity to the parties to address me before I make an order to such effect. Ifthe Defendants wish to retain the 3rd and 4th Properties, I will give them a chance to make a reasonable offer to the Plaintiffsto acquire their interest in these properties. That offer should be made prior to restoration of the matter before me. As indicatedat the trial, I will hear parties on the exact form of the order which I am going to make. If an order of sale has to be made, theparties should consult the Lands Department as to the form of order bearing in mind the requirement under Special Conditions 12 and13, particularly the requirement as to payment of additional premium. Again this should be done prior to the restoration of the matterbefore me.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiffs' claims in trespass</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> Lastly, I turn to the claims for trespass. There is no Deeds of Mutual Covenants for the 3rd and 4th Properties. As co-owners, theDefendants were entitled to possession of each and every part of the properties under common law. Trespass cannot be maintained bythe Plaintiffs unless there was ouster. The considerations under equity seems to be more flexible. In <strong>Re Pavlou</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20WLR%201046" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 WLR 1046</a>, Millett J (as he then was) said at p. 1050,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"First, a court of equity will order an inquiry and payment of occupation rent, not only in the case where the co-owner in occupationhas ousted the other, but in any other case in which it is necessary in order to do equity between the parties that an occupationrent should be paid. The fact that there has not been an ouster or forceful exclusion therefore is far from conclusive. ... The trueposition is that if a tenant in common leaves the property voluntarily, but would be welcome back and would be in a position to enjoyhis or her right to occupy, it would normally not be fair or equitable to the remaining tenant in common to charge him or her withan occupation rent which he or she never expected to pay."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(See also <strong>Dennis v McDonald</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20Fam%2063" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] Fam 63</a> and my recent decision in <strong>Chou Mei Iu v Kung Mui Fong</strong> HCMP 2026 of 2000, 28 February 2003.)</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> In the light of my findings above, I have no difficulty in concluding that the actions of the Defendants in August 1999 constitutedouster and forcible exclusion of the 1st Plaintiff from the 3rd Property and the 2nd Plaintiff from the 4th Property. Although atthe material time, the actual occupant of the Ground Floor of the 3rd Property was the 4th Plaintiff, given the consensus reachedin August 1983 and the distribution of the keys of the 3rd Property and the relationships between the parties, the Defendants musthave known that she occupied the same with the permission of the 1st Plaintiff. In fact, the 1st and 4th Defendants went to the premisesof the 1st Plaintiff to locate the 4th Plaintiff to demand for keys from her. Likewise, although the tenancy of the 1st Floor ofthe 4th Property was handled by Fu Sau Chun after the 2nd Plaintiff emigrated to Canada, I infer that the Defendants must have knownthat the tenant was a tenant of the 2nd Plaintiff. In the circumstances, the forcible expulsion of the 4th Plaintiff and the procurementof the tenant to leave the 1st Floor of the 4th Property together with the subsequent occupation and change of locks of these unitsby the Defendants were plainly conducts calculating to exclude the Plaintiffs from the use and occupation of the units.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> Bearing in mind the conducts of the Defendants and the means they employed to secure their possession of the two units, I do notconsider the fact that the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs had not asked for new keys to the units as an indication that they were contentto be excluded. Reports were made to the police and the Writ in this action was issued on 11 October 1999 with prayers asking for,inter alias, relief pertaining to the removal of the locks installed by the Defendants at the Ground Floor of the 3rd Property andthe 1st Floor of the 4th Property. The response of the Defendants as set out in the Defence was that the Plaintiffs had deprivedthe Defendants' lawful right of use and enjoyment of these two units (see Paragraph 16 of the Re-re-re-amended Defence). Obviously,it would be futile for the Plaintiffs to demand for keys to those units, particularly in the light of the manner in which the Defendantsharassed the 4th Plaintiff and their lack of remorse.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> The 5th Defendant said in his evidence that the 1st Plaintiff could resume his use of the 3rd Property but it was a matter that hadto be discussed amongst all co-owners and the living requirements of all parties had to be considered. In view of what the Defendantshad done, I can hardly believe this as the sincere stance of the Defendants. Further, as the 5th Defendant himself admitted, therehad not been any meeting of co-owners before the Defendants started to take possession of the three units in the 3rd and 4th Propertiespreviously occupied or used by the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> The Defendants cannot deny that up to August 1999, all the parties had been enjoying exclusive use and occupation of the units inthe 3rd and 4th Properties in accordance with the distribution which I find the parties had agreed upon in 1983 and such agreementwas subsequently put into effect when keys of the units were distributed upon completion of construction. The Plaintiffs had neverdisturbed the Defendants' occupation and use of the units distributed to them. The Defendants therefore have enjoyed the benefitof the 1983 agreement throughout these years. Parties have been dealing with their own units in accordance with that arrangementfor a substantial period of time.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> Mr Cheung relied on the doctrine of part performance to argue that even in the absence of deeds of mutual covenants regarding the3rd and 4th Properties, the 1983 agreement should be given effect by this court and the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs should be regardedas having the right to exclusive possession of the Ground Floor of the 3rd Property and First Floor of the 4th Property respectively.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> Mr Wong submitted that this court should not affirm the 1983 agreement as it would be unfair to the Defendants. Given my findingsas to the circumstances under which the 1983 agreement came into existence and the developments since 1983, also having regard tothe fact that under the 1983 agreement the Defendants actually got more than 1/4 in terms of beneficial ownership as well as actualuse of the properties, I do not find that there is any good reason why equity should not give effect to that agreement. In comingto that conclusion, I have also borne in mind the detriment suffered by the Defendants as to their loss of concessionary rights.For reasons already given, I do not regard that as a sufficient reason to disregard the consensus reached between the uncles andnephews in 1983.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> For the sake of completeness, I record that Mr Wong also argued that the distribution in 1983 entailed the Defendants lived in aless satisfactory conditions than the Plaintiffs. He submitted this is by itself a hardship. I am not aware of any principle of lawor equity which enable a co-owner to claim a greater share in the beneficial ownership of the property or a right to encroach uponthe exclusive right of possession of other co-owners simply because he finds he has inadequate space to live. The absurdity of sucha proposition is readily highlighted by applying that to co-owners in a multi-storey building in Hong Kong. Mr Wong has not advancedany argument before me to suggest the law should be different when the co-owners were uncles and nephews. Neither is there any expertevidence to warrant different consideration in terms of rights of indigenous villagers in the New Territories. Further, on the evidencebefore me, I am not satisfied that as things stood in 1983, the Defendants would not have adequate space to live under the arrangementenvisaged by the 1983 agreement. As the 1st Plaintiff said, the living condition was much more crowded when everyone was living atLot 924.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> I therefore accept the submission of Mr Cheung that the 1983 agreement should be given effect. Equity looks on that as done whichought to be done. Hence, in the eyes of equity, as between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants, covenants for exclusive possessionin respect of the respective units in the 3rd and 4th Properties distributed to the uncles and nephews after completion of constructionare deemed to have been given by them to one another.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> Even if I were incorrect in the above analysis as to the effect of the 1983 agreement, the same conclusion is reached by way of estoppelby convention. It seems to me that obviously, the uncles and nephews have been dealing with each other over the years on the sharedassumption that exclusive possession was given to the respective parties who were given the keys to the respective units. It wouldbe unjust and unconscionable to allow the Defendants to go back on it after so many years by relying on a defence of lack of formalcovenant. In this connection, I do not regard the demands by the Defendants for more units as being inconsistent with such sharedassumption. On the contrary, such demands reinforced this conclusion. If the Defendants were not proceeding on the basis that exclusivepossession of the units had been distributed, they needed not demand for redistribution.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> I am therefore of the view that damages for trespass should be awarded to the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs by reason of their being oustedfrom the use and occupation of the 3rd and 4th Properties by the Defendants (except the 2nd Defendant) and such damages should beassessed by reference to their respective loss of use of the Ground Floor of the 3rd Property and First Floor of the 4th Property.Mr Cheung invited me to assessed the damages by reference to the rent regarding the First Floor of the 4th Property which the 2ndPlaintiff had been collecting before the Defendants caused his tenant to leave. The valuation reports produced by the Defendantsdid not deal with the rental values of the properties. On the evidence before me, I have no reason to believe the rent paid by theformer tenant at the rate of $4,000 per month was not indicative of market rent. I shall therefore adopt that as the basis for thecalculation of damages. In the case of the 1st Plaintiff, damages should start to run from 7 August 1999 whilst in the case of the2nd Plaintiff, it started to run from 1st September 1999. Damages shall continue to run until the sale of the properties or otherwisedetermination of the co-ownership. If the 3rd and 4th Properties were to be sold, such damages shall be deductible by way of equitableaccounting from the proceeds payable to the Defendants (other than the 2nd Defendant) on account of their interest in the properties.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> I am conscious of the fact that the 1st Plaintiff only has 1/6 legal interest in the 3rd Property. However, under the 1983 agreement,he was entitled to exclusive occupation and use of one unit in the 3rd Property. There is no rule of law which prescribes that a1/6 owner could not have exclusive possession of more than 1/6. It depends on the agreement between the co-owners. In the presentcase, regarding the 3rd Property, I find there was an agreement that the 1st Plaintiff would enjoy exclusive possession of the GroundFloor. In those circumstances, in my judgment, damages shall be calculated by reference to the loss of use of that unit. Since MrCheung did not ask for more than 1/6 of the net proceeds upon sale of the 3rd Property, I need not consider whether the 1st Plaintiffshould be entitled to more than 1/6 of the proceeds in the light of this special agreement concerning exclusive possession.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> As regards the damages to the properties of the 4th Plaintiff, there is plainly no defence on liability. Mr Wong challenged the quantum.The 4th Plaintiff gave evidence that she estimated the damages to her properties to be around $40,000 to $50,000 (for items 4 to14, 18 and 20 particularized under Paragraph 12 of the Amended Statement of Claim) whilst the decoration of the premises was about$150,000. Mr Wong suggested that some of the damaged items could still be usable and the 4th Plaintiff just abandoned some itemsbecause she had no place to store the same. There is no plea of failure to mitigate damages in the Re-re-re-amended Defence. Hence,the only question is whether I am satisfied that these losses were caused by the actions of the 4th, 5th and 6th Defendants to the4th Plaintiff. Having examined the photographs and listened carefully to the evidence of the 4th Plaintiff, bearing in mind the itemsdamaged and the extent of damages shown in the photographs, I must say the figure of $40,000 to $50,000 is a very conservative estimate.Taking into account the factor of depreciation given the fact that the 4th Plaintiff was ousted from her home, I would award damages(including fittings and decorations) in the sum of $100,000 to the 4th Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> The 4th Plaintiff also asked for aggravated or exemplary damages. Mr Cheung relied on the case of <strong>Yeung Wah v Alfa Sea Limited</strong>, HCA No. A426 of 1992, 8.6.1993. In that case, Deputy Judge Yeung (as he then was) awarded $50,000 by way of exemplary damages toa harassed tenant. In so doing, His Lordship followed a dicta of Lord Denning in <strong>Drane v Evangelou</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20WLR%20455" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 WLR 455.</a> The rationale was that when a landlord resorted to harassment to evict a tenant and adopted tactics with blatant and wilful disregardof the rights of such tenant, exemplary damages could be awarded to teach the wrongdoer that tort does not pay.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> It is important to distinguish between exemplary damages and aggravated damages. The proper approach is to consider whether aggravateddamages should be awarded and what is the appropriate amount for such damages first. After that has been done, this court shouldask itself whether the award of general and aggravated damages is inadequate to punish and deter a defendant. If it is inadequate,it has to be asked whether the criteria in <strong>Rookes v Barnard</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 1129</a> for award of exemplary damages could be satisfied and if yes, what is the appropriate figure for exemplary damages. On such distinctionin the context of wrongful eviction, see Lawton LJ in <strong>Drane v Evangelou</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20WLR%20455" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 WLR 455</a> at p. 461; <strong>McMillan v Singh</strong> (1984) 17 HLR 120 and <strong>Ramdath v Daley</strong> (1993) 25 HLR 273.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> As Lawton LJ said in <strong>Drane v Evangelou</strong> at p. 461,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"To deprive a man of a roof over his head in my judgment is one of the worst torts which can be committed. It causes stress, worryand anxiety. It brings the law into disrepute if people like the defendant can act with impunity in the way he did."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> In many respects what the 4th to 6th Defendants did to the 4th Plaintiff in the present case is outrageous. The facts speak for itselfin this regard. As I said, they remained unrepentant. No apology has been offered. The 5th Defendant gave evidence that since thePlaintiffs had reported the incidents to police, there could not be any further dealings between the uncles and the nephews. In otherwords, he is of the view that it was wrong for the 4th Plaintiff to make a report to the police. None of the Defendants who gaveevidence before me exhibited any sense of regret, not to say remorse, for the uncivilized acts committed on 7th August 1999. Allthese added insult to injury.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> I think it is fully justified that the 4th to 6th Defendants should be ordered to pay aggravated damages to the 4th Plaintiff. Asto the quantum of aggravated damages, bearing in mind this is to compensate the 4th Plaintiff for injury to her feelings, I willmake an award in the sum of $50,000 under this head.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> As to exemplary damages, on the facts of the present case, I am not satisfied that the 4th to 6th Defendants committed the tort againstthe 4th Plaintiff with an expectation to make a greater profit than the damages payable. Having regard to the other damages whichI have already awarded, and the fact that these Defendants were convicted and sentenced for criminal damages, I do not think thiscase calls for any award of exemplary damages. I therefore make no award under this head.</p>    <p class="heading">Disposal</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> I will leave it to the parties to see whether they can agree on the order that this court should make in the light of this judgment.Parties should liaise with each other in that regard. If no agreement can be reached within one month, the case should be restoredbefore me. Given the manner in which the 3rd and 4th Properties are to be disposed of, I do not think the Plaintiffs need the injunctiverelief set out in the Statement of Claim. It also follows from what I have said that the Counterclaim is dismissed. I also wish tohear parties on the question of costs, in particular whether any order should be made by this court pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/91/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 17(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/91" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Ordinance</a>. I was told by Mr Wong that although he and those instructing him also acted for the 5th Defendant, legal aid has only been grantedto the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 6th Defendants. As the Director of Legal Aid may also have an interest on the question of costs as wellas the proceeds of sale under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/91/s18a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 18A</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/91/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">19A</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/91" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Ordinance</a>, I also direct that notice be given to the Director as to the restored hearing so that if the Director so wishes, he could also addressthis court on those questions. The parties should also consult the Director as to the proposed order for sale, in particular theterm as to distribution of sale proceeds.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(M H Lam)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Kam Cheung, instructed by Messrs David Ravenscroft &amp; Co., for the 1st to 4th Plaintiffs</p>        <p>Mr Derry Wong, instructed by Messrs Clarke &amp; Kong, for the 1st, 3rd to 6th Defendants</p>        <p>2nd Defendant in person, absent</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>    <p>1.
