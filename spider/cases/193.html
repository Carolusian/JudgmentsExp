Ltd (âKMBâ) at Hing Wah StreetWest, Kowloon, Lot No. KX 1992 (âthe siteâ) whilst concreting workers were placing concrete at Level 5 (âL5â) a concretebeam supporting the prefabricated concrete platform from which they were working suddenly collapsed.  This caused the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> plaintiffs in the consolidated action to fall through, together with the collapsed concrete slabs and debris, to the level belownamely, to Level 3 (âL3â).  As a result they suffered serious personal injuries.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> At the material time Chau Kwok Fong (âthe deceasedâ) was assigned to wash the concrete floor at L3.  As a result of the collapseof the beam at L5 and the falling concrete slabs and debris onto L3, the deceased was buried by the rubble.  He sustained severepersonal injuries which eventually resulted in his death.  The 5<sup>th</sup> plaintiff is the administratix of the estate of the deceased. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The project at the site was the construction of a new bus depot for KMB.  This involved the erection of a 3 level main structureto accommodate double decker buses parking at Levels 1, 3 and 5.  There was also to be an office building of six storeys.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> By an order made by Master B. Kwan on 18 May 2005 it was ordered that the actions be consolidated up to and including the determinationof liability.  It was also ordered that if, when the question of liability is determined and each of the plaintiffs has succeededagainst the defendants then the question of quantum of damages for each plaintiff shall be dealt with as the court may direct.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> At the pre-trial review on 17 October 2005 it was ordered by Suffiad J that there be a split trial in this matter.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant (âD1â) is a construction company incorporated in Hong Kong and was the principal contractor of the site at all materialtimes.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> D1 has admitted liability to the plaintiffs.  By a consent order made on 20 December 2006 it was ordered that judgment on liabilitybe entered against D1 in favour of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> plaintiffs in the consolidated action with an order for costs in the plaintiffsâ favour.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was a subcontractor of D1 engaged for the erection of the scaffolding namely, the falsework and the placement of precastbeams and columns.  Interlocutory judgment on the issue of liability was entered against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant by the 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> plaintiffs in September 2004 and by the 6<sup>th</sup> plaintiff in November 2005.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant was the subcontractor of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant engaged for the erection of the scaffolding namely, the falsework and the placement of precast beams and columns.  The1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> plaintiffs entered interlocutory judgment on the issue of liability against the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant in December 2004.  By an order made on the first day of trial on 26 February 2007 the 6<sup>th</sup> plaintiff was given leave to discontinue the action against the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The 4<sup>th</sup> defendant Ng Kam Tong (âNgâ) was at all material times the executive director of the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant Chung &amp; Ng Consulting Engineers Limited (âCNââ).  Ng was the registered structural engineer (âRSEâ) of theproject after the original RSE Yu Chung Yeung (âYuâ) resigned on 22 May 2001.  The 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> plaintiffs discontinued their actions against Ng in September 2004 and the 6<sup>th</sup> plaintiff discontinued the action against Ng in November 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The 5<sup>th</sup> defendant Wong Hang Fai (âWongâ) was an engineer employed by CN and who acted as the representative of the RSE at the site. He was also the resident engineer (âREâ) at the site.  The 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> plaintiffs discontinued their actions against Wong in September 2004 and the 6<sup>th</sup> plaintiff discontinued his action against Wong in October 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The 7<sup>th</sup> defendant Sun Hung Kai Engineering Co. Ltd. (âSHKâ) was employed by KMB to, <i>inter alia</i>, provide architectural services and to act as the authorized person and RSE in relation to the project at the site.  The only plaintiffto bring an action against SHK was the 6<sup>th</sup> plaintiff.  The action against SHK was discontinued in November 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> By a notice claiming contribution and/or indemnity dated 6 October 2005 D1 sought contribution or indemnity against Ng and CN andagainst the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants towards such sums as may be awarded to the plaintiffs. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Leave was given to D1 to withdraw the notice claiming contribution and/or indemnity against Ng by an order made on 3 November 2006. Leave was given to D1 to withdraw the notice claiming contribution and/or indemnity against the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants by orders made on 24 January 2007.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> After the plaintiffsâ claims were discontinued against Ng, leave was given to D1 by Suffiad J at the 3<sup>rd</sup> pre-trial review on 22 December 2006 to issue a third party notice against Ng, such notice to stand as D1âs statement of claim. By the third party notice issued on 15 January 2007 D1 claimed against Ng for contribution or indemnity in respect of the plaintiffsâclaims and costs on the ground that the accident was caused wholly or contributed by his negligence and/or breach of common dutyof care and breach of statutory duty as set out therein.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The trial on liability commenced on 26 February 2006.  At that time the only parties before the court were the plaintiffs, D1 andD6 and the third party Ng.  It was ordered by consent that there be a joint trial of the main action, the contribution proceedingsby D1 against CN and the third party proceedings brought by D1 against Ng.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> On the third day of trial, 28 February 2007, the plaintiffs and the remaining defendant CN settled the action.  By a consent ordermade on that day the plaintiffswere given leave to discontinue the action against CN on terms that CN pay costs to the plaintiffsas set out in the order. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> As CN was no longer a defendant in the main action, an order was made by consent on 1 March 2007 whereby it was ordered, <i>inter alia</i>, that the amended notice by D1 claiming contribution and/or indemnity against co-defendant do stand as the third party notice againstCN and that the amended consolidated defence of CN do stand as the defence of CN in the third party proceedings.  It was also orderedthat Ng be named as the 1<sup>st</sup> third party and CN as the 2<sup>nd</sup> third party.  It was further ordered that the amended consolidated defence of CN be substituted by the substituted defence of Ngand CN in the terms of the substituted defence attached to the consent order.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> As the trial of the main action had already commenced, the remaining parties before the court namely, D1, Ng and CN were anxiousto proceed with the trial of the third party proceedings without requiring any further directions to be made.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The trial continued on that basis and the parties that remained before the court were D1, Ng and CN.</p>    <p class="heading">The Issues</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> There are two main issues:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)       Are Ng and CN or either of them liable in tort to the plaintiffs for the pleaded causes of action?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)       If liability is established, what is the apportionment of liability on the part of D1 on the one hand and Ng and/or CN onthe other hand?</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Mr Bharwaney, for D1, at the outset of the trial accepted that D1 was liable in tort to the plaintiffs.  For that reason, judgmentin favour of the plaintiffs on the issue of liability was entered against D1 before trial.  Mr Bharwaney made it plain that althoughit was accepted that D1 was liable, it was D1âs case that Ng and CN were also liable in tort to the plaintiffs and D1 was seekingan apportionment of liability.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Mr. Bharwaney accepted that D1 was more to blame for the accident than Ng and CN.  In his closing submissions he submitted that liabilityshould be apportioned at 60% on the part of D1 and 40% on the part of Ng and CN.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Mr Pirie, for Ng and CN, disputed any liability in tort to the plaintiffs on the part of either Ng or CN and maintained this stancefrom start to finish.  In his closing submissions Mr Pirie submitted that in the alternative, if the Court found liability on thepart of his clients, the apportionment of liability on the part of his clients should be a maximum of 20%.</p>    <p class="heading">The witnesses</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> I heard evidence from two experts relied on by D1.  They were Dr Eddie Lam Siu Shu (âDr Lamâ) and Mr Dennis Pho Tjie Tjao (âPhoâ). I also heard evidence from Ng.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> I was impressed with Dr Lam and Pho and have no hesitation in accepting their evidence.  I cannot say the same for Ng.  I find thatNg was an evasive, untruthful and unreliable witness.  Where Ngâs evidence is at variance with the evidence of Dr Lam and Pho,I much prefer their evidence to that of Ng.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Apart from the witnesses who gave evidence before me, there was also placed before me two reports into the incident at the site resultingin the personal injuries of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> plaintiffs and the death of the deceased.  The first was the report of the Buildings Department (âthe BDâ) dated 29 June 2001(âthe BD reportâ) and the second was the Report to the Coroner on the Labour Departmentâs investigation dated 29 August 2001(âthe LD reportâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> In arriving at the conclusions and findings in the BD report and LD report, the BD and the Labour Department (âthe LDâ) conducteda thorough investigation into the causes of the collapse.  In particular, the staff of the BD and the LD conducted joint interviewsof 69 witnesses in total.  The particulars of the witnesses interviewed are contained in the list at Appendix A of the LD report. There was also placed in the bundles before me some of those witnessesâ statements and declarations to the BD and LD staff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> The findings and conclusions contained in the BD and LD reports were arrived at as a result of extensive investigations.  That beingso, in my view considerable weight ought to be attached to their findings and conclusions, save where I have otherwise indicatedbelow at paragraph 93.</p>    <p class="heading">The project</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> There is no dispute that KMB was the owner of the site.  SHK was responsible for the overall management and control of the projectat the site.  SHK appointed CN to look after all civil and structural matters related to the project.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> D1 was the principal contractor of the project.  Erection of the falsework at L3 and L5 was performed by the subcontractor and thesubsubcontractor namely, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants, respectively.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The superstructure consisted of two portions namely, the workshop and the carpark portion.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The workshop portion was constructed by the traditional cast in situ method of construction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> The carpark portion was constructed by the prefabrication method.  A full description of the method of construction is containedin Appendix D of the LD report and it is not necessary to repeat the same here.  Suffice it to say that the method involved placingand assembling precast concrete beams.  Precast primary concrete beams referred to as PB1 (âPB1â) were placed in the longitudinaldirection and precast concrete secondary beams of two types referred to as PB2 (âPB2â) and PB3 (âPB3â) respectively, in thetransverse direction.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> For the carpark portion there were three types of precast concrete beams namely, PB1, PB2 and PB3.  PB1s were first stitched to theprecast concrete column to form the first skeleton frame of the superstructure.  Then PB2s were directly laid on the flanges of thetwo adjoining PB1s.  Between two columns and in the direction of PB2 was installed a PB3 which was temporarily supported by the supportingtubular towers (âthe falseworkâ).  The falsework is fully described in Appendix E of the LD report.</p>    <p class="heading">The accident</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Having placed the PB3 on the falsework the workers proceeded to the placement of concrete planks one by one to cover the void spacesbetween the PB3 and the adjacent PB2s.  There were 14 precast concrete planks (âthe planksâ) involved in the incident.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> In the morning of 29 May 2001, concreting work of the floorslab of the carpark portion on L5 started from gridline No. 6E to 7E andproceeded towards gridline 6A to 7A.  The concreting work was carried out by workers of Kin Ching Engineering Co. Ltd (âKin Chingâ)under the supervision of D1âs foreman.  Premixed concrete was pumped up by a pump truck parked inside the site on L1 and conveyedto L5 through metal piping.  At about 2.50 pm concrete was laid near the junction of Column 97 (âC97â) and PB3 beam at gridline7B to 7C.  Suddenly the falsework failed and collapsed under the weight of the beam, the supporting planks, the reinforcement barsand the concrete being laid.  As a result, the beam collapsed with one of its ends and the planks fell down onto L3 together withthe injured workers namely, the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> plaintiffs.  The deceased who was also employed by Kin Ching was on L3 at the time doing cleaning work.  He was crushed by the collapsedstructures and debris.</p>    <p class="heading">The RSE and the RE</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> On the evidence it seems to me to be clear that CN and Ng assumed the role as the consulting structural engineers from an early stagein the construction at the site. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> At the time of the accident Ng was already named officially as the RSE with his appointment on 22 May 2001.  Prior to that Yu wasthe RSE until he resigned on 22 May 2001.  However, as found in the BD report, Ng actually carried out monthly inspections on thesite on behalf of the original RSE Yu since the commencement of the works in January 2001.  Yu in his declaration made on 11 June2001 said that before he resigned as RSE on 22 May 2001 he was the RSE but he was only responsible for signing as the RSE for theworks.  CN were appointed as his representative.  He also said CN would communicate directly with D1 and send copies of their correspondenceto him for his information.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> In the letter from SHK to CN for the attention of Ng dated 25 October 2000 one of the conditions imposed by SHK was:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â Before you officially take over as the RSE, you will take over in full duties as the structural engineer including attending coordinationmeetings and answering all queries that may be raised by concerned parties.  In this respect you are expected to answer these letters/queriesdirect on our behalf.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Ng confirmed in evidence that the letter referred to him as the structural engineer.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> I find that Ng was the <i>de facto</i> RSE from the commencement of the works in about January 2001 and on 22 May 2001 he became the RSE in name.  It is not surprisingthat there was no formal handover of documents when he took over formally from Yu on 22 May 2001 as the RSE as he had been actingas the <i>de facto</i> RSE even before that time.  In any event, at the time of the accident he was already in name and in substance the RSE.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> It is not disputed, and I find, that Wong was the representative of the RSE as well as the RE at the site from the commencement ofthe works in about January 2001.  He was also the person with the duties of T2, T3 and T4 in the site safety supervision of the buildingworks at the site.</p>    <p class="heading">The Technical Memorandum</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The Technical Memorandum for supervision plans issued by the Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands under section 39A of the<i>Building</i><i>s Ordinance</i> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123">Cap. 123</a>) (âthe TMâ) sets out the principles, requirements and operation of supervision plans for construction in Hong Kong. Detailed guidance on the application of the TM and the preparation of supervision plans are provided in the Draft Code of Practicefor Site Safety Supervision (âthe draft Codeâ) issued by the BD in December 1997.  As stated in the foreword to the draft Code:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe Code is now issued as a draft document.  It will be replaced by a finalized edition when it has been reviewed through experiencegained in its application.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The letter from the BD addressed to the 6<sup>th</sup> plaintiffâs former solicitors dated 26 October 2004 makes it plain that the Building Authority took the view that when the sitesafety supervision plan was first submitted on 4 January 2001, at that time the draft Code was the applicable code.  The Code ofPractice issued in November 2000 (âthe new Codeâ) only came into effect on 19 April 2001 and was not applicable to the site safetysupervision at the site at the time of the accident.  Dr Lam was of the view that although the Code of Practice was issued in 2000,it was relevant to look at the draft Code and not to the new Code.  Pho referred also to the new Code of Practice.  Although Phowas of the view that the obligations in respect of the RSE and the contractor were the same under both Codes, I find that it is relevantonly to consider the draft Code and not the new Code as the new Code was not applicable to the site safety supervision at the siteat the time of the accident as confirmed by the Building Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Mr Pirie accepted that the draft Code was applicable at the time.  He conceded that if there were material breaches of the draftCode by the RSE and Wong as the representative of the RSE then liability in common law negligence would have been established againsthis clients and they would be liable to D1 for contribution and the Court would then have to apportion liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Under paragraph 3.1 of the TM, site safety supervision is defined as:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â the necessary supervision required to check that the carrying out of liability works ......., including .................................temporary works pertinent to all stages of building works ................... and the working environment are safe, such that thehazards from these works are controlled and risks to workers on site, all persons around the site ...................... are mitigated;â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> A supervision plan i.e. a plan setting out the plan of safety management of building works or street works, comprises of an outlinesafety supervision plan and a detailed safety supervision plan (paragraphs 4.1 and 4.6 of the TM).  It is important to bear in mindthat under the TM, contractors, authorised persons, RSE and the technically competent persons (âTCPâ) they appoint shall âeachhave a role to play in site safety managementâ (paragraph 5.1).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> It is provided by paragraph 5.1.2 of the TM that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â The site safety management functions of the RSE and his stream are-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(a) â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(b) to verify that conditions on site are consistent with assumptions made in the design of the permanent works and in the designof those method statements and temporary works which are shown on the prescribed plans; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(c) to supervise, in accordance with the frequency set out in the supervision plan, that the method statements and temporary worksshown on the prescribed plans are adhered to.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Thus it is clear that the site safety management functions of the RSE and his stream included the temporary works which are shownon the prescribed plans.</p>    <p class="heading">The draft Code</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> As the draft Code states, the supervision plan sets out a system for safety management of building works (paragraph 1.2).

Thus the duties of T4, T3 and T2 were all to be carried out by Wong.

I accept their evidence and find that the supervision of the falseworkwas within the situation in Case 1.  This was not disputed by Mr Pirie.  Ng also accepted this in evidence although he said thathe did not appreciate at the time that he was interviewed by the BD and LD staff shortly after the incident that the situation inCase 1 was engaged.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> It is clear, and I find, that the RSE and D1 each had their own responsibility and obligation of supervising the carrying out ofthe temporary works namely, the falsework in accordance with the approved plans.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> Under Section 4(3) of the <i>Buildings Ordinance</i> (âthe <i>BO</i>â), a RSE has the obligation to:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â(a) supervise the carrying out of the building works ................... in accordance with the supervision plan;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(b) notify the Building Authority of any contravention of the regulations which would result from the carrying out of any work shownin any plan approved by the Building Authority in respect of the building works .................................., and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(c) ..............................................................................................â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> And by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123A/s37.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation 37(2)</a> of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123A" class="autolink_findacts">Building (Administration) Regulations</a></i> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123">Cap. 123</a>) the duty of the RSE is to:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â give such periodical supervision and make such inspections as may be necessary to ensure that the structural works .........................................are being carried out in general accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance and regulations, the plans approved in respect thereofby the Building Authority, the supervision plan prepared in compliance with the technical memorandum issued under Section 39A ofthe Ordinance (if required) and as order made or condition imposed, pursuant to any provision of the Ordinance or regulations inthat behalf, by the Building Authority.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> Dr Lam made it clear in evidence, which I accept, that Wong as the RE and the representative of the RSE had the duty to go on siteand check that the contractorâs TCPs had done their work.  It was his job to supervise the work of the contractor and not justto check that the forms of the contractors TCPs had been completed.  Dr Lam said that Wong did not have to check each and every falseworkbut he needed to carry out inspections on a fair amount of falsework that had been erected to make sure that the contractorâs TCPshad carried out their safety supervision.  I accept Dr Lamâs evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">The approved plan</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> The relevant approved plan for the temporary works is the plan at page 799 of Bundle CB2 which was issued by Ove Arup &amp; Partnersand signed by Yu as the RSE on 24 October 2000.  The plan was approved by the Building Authority on 21 December 2000 (âthe approvedplanâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> The approved plan shows the construction sequence and the method of construction.  Stages 1 to 5 are set out in the approved plan. According to Ng, this was one of 50 approved plans by the Building Authority in relation to the project at the site.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Ng accepted that the approved plan was a prescribed plan and that the duties on the RSE were as set out in Case 1 namely, to be responsiblefor supervising the carrying out of the works in accordance with the approved plan.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> The approved plan set out the construction sequence for each of the stages 1 to 5.  Under stage 2 it was stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â1. ERECT PRECAST R. C. COLUMN.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2.

Under stage 5 it is stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â1.

They were both of the opinion that the requirement for all temporary supports, and not just those for PB1 beams, were that theybe laterally braced to existing structure like a column.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> Dr Lam and Pho both denied the suggestion made to them by Mr Pirie that in respect of the temporary support for PB3 beams the requirementwas that it be laterally braced to the in situ structure cast in advance shown in the bottom sketches of the approved plan.  Ng alsogave evidence that the requirement of lateral bracing under the approved plan was bracing to the in situ structure cast in advanceshown in the bottom sketches of the approved plan.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> I have no hesitation in preferring the evidence of Dr Lam and Pho to that of Ng whose evidence I reject.  It is, in my view, untenableto suggest that temporary supports or falseworks for beams erected along gridlines which may be 50 m away from the in situ structurecast in advance could be laterally braced to such structure.  It was suggested by Ng in evidence that this may have been a requirementby the BD although in his experience he had never seen a falsework laterally braced to a structure that far away.  Dr Lam explainedthat the cast in situ structures were too far away and members in the centre would not have the assistance from those structures. Pho also said, and I accept, that the only reinforced concrete structure that the falsework could be laterally braced to was thecolumn as that was the closest structure that it could reach.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> It is also pertinent to refer to the police statement of Hui Hok-keung a structural engineer of the BD made on 10 March 2003.  Hesaid that his structural comments on the approved plan included providing for temporary supports with working capacity of 32T andthat these supports should be self standing and laterally braced to âexisting (completed reinforced concrete structures) structuresâ. In answer to Question 10 he made it plain that the description of temporary support in stage 2 was also applicable to stages 3 to5 as it was mentioned in stage 2 that the temporary support system would be maintained up to stage 5.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> I find that the words in brackets in stage 2 in the approved plan namely, âtemporary support to be self standing and laterallybraced to existing structure to maintain up to stage 5â applied to all temporary supports and not just those for PB1 beams.  Ifind that the approved plan clearly shows that the temporary supports for the PB3 beams were required to be of proprietary products,self standing and laterally braced to existing structure like columns and with a loading capacity of 32T.</p>    <p class="heading">The method statement</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> According to the requirements set out in the TM, D1 prepared and submitted various method statements for different stages of constructionworks at the site.  The method statement that is relevant in these proceedings is the one relating to temporary supports namely,the falseworks which was amended on 9 April 2001 with the sequential no. 19 and Revision number A (âthe MS 19Aâ).  The MS 19Awas prepared by Labardin, method engineer of D1 and reviewed internally by others including a safety manager.  A copy was sent toCN for their comments.  This was noted by Ng in his handwriting with the words âno adverse commentsâ and dated 23 April 2001. At that stage D1 was going to use the proprietary product RMD Rapidshor system (âRMDâ) for the falsework for PB1 and PB4 beams,and the proprietary product SGB Titan system (âSGBâ) for the falsework for PB3 beams.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> SGB was in fact used for the falsework for PB3 beams before it was replaced by RMD.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> Dr Lam said, and I accept, that SGB and RMD were substantially different in shape and structural form.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> Ng said that he knew before the accident that there was going to be a change from SGB to RMD for the falsework for PB3 beams butthat he had not seen any design drawings before the accident.  After the accident he saw these in Wongâs office at the site.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> It is not disputed that there was no method statement prepared or submitted prior to the accident showing the change of SGB to RMDfor the falsework for the PB3 beams.  There were also no working drawings for the erection of the replaced RMB falsework for thePB3 beams.  Thus, there were no working drawings for supervisors to refer to on the site.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> The reason for the change from SGB to RMD for the falsework for the PB3 beams appears to be due to insufficient supply of SGB.  JackChan Kin Sing (âJack Chanâ), who was D1âs site agent, said in his declaration of 6 June 2001 that the change to RMD was approvedby D1 around 20 April 2001.  The diagonal bracing for the 16 sets ordered were probably delivered on or after 27 April 2001 accordingto the âTake Off Sheetâ annexed to Dr Lamâs report.  I infer from that and find that the replaced RMD falsework for PB3 beamswas first erected on the site on or after 27 April 2001.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> Wong did not give evidence before me.  However, in his declaration to the BD and LD staff made on 12 June 2001 he said that D1 didnot inform him about the change from SGB to RMD.  He also said that in early May 2001 at the site the project manager Vincent Yuentold him that a demonstration of the erection of RMD for PB3 was underway.  He asked him if the design and calculation of those supportshad been checked and prepared for his comments.  Yuen sent D1âs engineer Reynold Chong to Wongâs office to give him an explanation. Chong went to see Wong and told him that he had checked the design calculation of the RMD falseworks, that there was no problemand that a revised method statement was underway.  However, it is not disputed that D1 did not submit or provide Wong with a revisedmethod statement prior to the accident.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> It is not disputed that the erection of the replaced RMD falsework for the support of the PB3 beams was performed by the subcontractorand subsubcontractor of D1.  However, under Case 1, D1 as the contractor had the sole responsibility to ensure the integrity of thefalsework.  This is also not disputed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> On 20 May 2001 a total of 10 falsework towers were set up at gridline 7 on L5.  Of these, 6 towers were moved from gridline 5 tothe required locations while the remaining 4 were newly erected.  As the LD found, these 4 towers including the one that collapsedwere erected by the workers of the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant.  The 4 towers formed 2 sets of twin towers at gridline 7B to 7C as shown in sketch 5 attached to the LD report.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> Mr Pirie relied on the statement made by Jack Chan in his declaration made on 6 June 2001 and submitted that the falsework that collapsedwas not newly erected but complete or near complete as it was moved from another location.  In his said declaration, Jack Chan inanswer to Question 30, said that the collapsed falsework was not newly erected but âshould be moved from PB3â at gridline 5. This was not accepted by the LD in its findings and conclusions.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> In my view, Jack Chanâs account is not reliable.  I bear in mind that the LD relied on declarations made by the workers who actuallythemselves erected the falsework which collapsed.  In my view, their account would have been more reliable than Jack Chanâs.  Ifind that the falsework which subsequently collapsed was newly erected and not one that was moved from another location.  In my view,the LD correctly found that the collapsed tower was newly erected and not one moved from another location.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> In my view, it is also clear, and I so find, that the falsework that collapsed on 29 May 2001 had been erected on 20 May 2001 andhad been standing there for about 10 days before the collapse on 29 May 2001.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Missing diagonal braces</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> As found by the LD in the LD report at paragraph 28, the falsework should have been fitted with three diagonal braces on each ofits four faces.  As found by the investigators, no braces were fitted at all on the two faces of the collapsed tower perpendicularto the PB3 beam at the time of the accident.  Its twin tower on the other side of column 97 was similarly fitted.  Hence, 50% ofthe required diagonal braces were missing and omitted from the falsework which collapsed.  This is not disputed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> A most helpful illustration of what the falsework with the missing diagonal braces would have looked like is shown in Sketch 1 attachedto the LD report at page 707 of Bundle CB2.  This shows that both sides of the falsework at column C97 had the missing diagonal braces. By contrast the falsework at column C98 did not have any missing diagonal braces as was found by the investigators after the accident. This is also not disputed. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> At paragraph 28 of the LD report it is stated that based on the available information the collapsed tower was fitted with all diagonalbraces on all faces up to 26 May 2001.  I am unable to accept this finding in the LD report.  Dr Lam disagreed with this part ofthe LD report.  It was his view that the collapsed falsework might not be fitted with all bracing members on all faces up to 26 May2001.  He explained in evidence that the people who put up the concrete planks were the same group of workers who erected the falsework. He did not think that the workers would remove diagonal braces which would make the falsework dangerous for their fellow workers. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> I find that it is highly unlikely that the falsework which subsequently collapsed was properly erected with sufficient diagonal bracesand that right up to 25 or 26 May all the faces had diagonal braces.  It is more likely, and I so find, that when erected on 20 May2001 the falsework for PB3 beam already had 50% of the diagonal braces missing.  The reason for this was that D1 did not order sufficientquantities of braces for the replaced RMD.  D1 only ordered 16 sets of braces for the replaced RMD for falsework for PB3.  Thesebraces were of a different dimension than the braces suitable for the RMD for falsework for PB1 beams.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> Mr Pirie also relied on the statement by Jack Chan in his declaration made on 27 July 2001 that on or about 25 or 26 May 2001 hedid inspect the falsework which subsequently collapsed and that he found nothing wrong at that time.  The inference sought to bedrawn is that as he found nothing wrong at the time of his inspection, someone must have removed the missing braces after that time. I am unable to accept the statement made by Jack Chan in the said declaration.  This was a self serving statement of Jack Chan whodid not give evidence before me.  I reject his account that he did inspect the falsework on 25 or 26 May and found nothing wrongwith it.  He was, in my view, trying to minimize his blameworthiness for the collapse.  His account is, in my view, unreliable andI place no weight on it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> Save for the part of paragraph 28 of the LD report which Dr Lam did not agree with as set out above, both experts Dr Lam and Phoagreed with the findings of the LD investigating team as set out in the LD report. </p>    <p class="heading">Lack of lateral bracing</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> On the expert evidence, it is clear, and I find, that there was no lateral support from the falsework to existing structures likethe column.  Pho also said, and I find, that was not a single falsework at the site was laterally supported to existing structureslike columns.  As Pho said, and I so find, such lateral support would have provided strength for the movement of the falsework. The replaced RMD was designed to be laterally braced around the column as shown in the drawing attached to the design calculationsdated 27 April 2001 at page 231 of Bundle PB3.</p>    <p class="heading">32T loading capacity</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> The approved plan clearly required the falsework to have a loading capacity of 32T.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> It was the duty of D1 as the contractor to ensure that the falsework as erected has this loading capacity.  It was also the dutyof the RSE as part of his duty of supervision to ensure that the falsework had the loading capacity of 32T.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> Both Dr Lam and Pho said in evidence that there were no working drawings and detailed calculations for them to be satisfied thatthe replaced RMD for PB3 beams had the loading capacity of 32T.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> There is no dispute that there were no working drawings for the replaced RMD falsework for PB3 beams.  Although Ng said that theRMD system had the loading capacity of 32T I am unable to accept that the falsework which collapsed had the loading capacity of 32T. According to Dr Lam and Pho, whose evidence I accept, when they examined the MS 19A and the RMD design calculations dated 27 April2001 they were unable to find substantiation in the documents provided that the loading for each leg of the falsework had the capacityof 80 kn so that 4 legs had the total loading capacity of 32T.  According to them there was no proof provided why each leg of thefalsework could carry a load of 80 kn and hence there was no proof that 4 legs could carry a load of 32T.  I prefer their evidenceto that of Ng whose evidence I reject.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> Furthermore, according to the report of D.  Hartley, RMDâs Technical director, D1âs requirements for the total load to be carriedby RMD was 26T. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> In the design drawings and revised calculations for the replaced RMD for PB3 from the supplier of RMD to Reynold Chong sent by faxdated 3 May 2001 the calculations show that the total loading for PB3 was 260kn or 26T and not 32 T as required by the approved plan.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> Robert Dover, the managing director of the supplier of RMD also confirmed in his declaration of 13 June 2001 that the design of theRMD system required by D1 was 260 Kn or 26T per tower and their design and drawings were based on the loading required by D1.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> It seems that the supplier of RMD was asked by D1 to provide RMD with a loading capacity of 26T rather than 32T which was requiredby the approved plan. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> I am unable to see how Ng or Wong could have been satisfied that the falsework had the loading capacity of 32T.</p>    <p class="heading">The main causes of the collapse of the falsework</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> In my judgment, on the evidence of Dr Lam and Pho, the missing diagonal braces on the collapsed falsework and the lack of lateralbracing to the column were the main causes of the collapse. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> As set out in the LD report at paragraph 54, the omission of the diagonal bracing pieces should have been easily spotted when comparingwith the falsework at the other supporting end of the collapsed beam where diagonal braces were provided in all vertical faces. But no one noticed and reported the omission.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> Ng, however, said in evidence that it was not easy to spot the missing diagonal braces at the site.  Ng did not himself inspect thesite and he cannot say what Wong did or did not see.  He did, however, accept that as a RSE if he saw the falsework with missingdiagonal braces as shown in Sketch 1 at pg 707 of bundle CB2 he would be concerned about immediate danger of collapse.  He even wentso far as to say that even if one brace was missing there would be immediate danger.  But he maintained that it was not easy to detectthat diagonal braces were missing at the site.  I do not believe him.  I reject this evidence of Ng and prefer the evidence of DrLam and Pho.  Wong as the RE was required to be on the site at all times.  The falsework was erected on 20 May 2001, as I have found,and it was standing there right up to the time of the accident without lateral bracing to a column and with 50% of diagonal bracesmissing.  I find that a reasonably competent engineer would have spotted these omissions easily.  I also accept, as Dr Lam said,that there was a lot of space between the columns and the falsework on the site.  It is clear that the site was accessible with nodifficulty for anyone walking around to inspect the falsework.  Had Wong done his job he would have had no difficulty in spottingthe missing diagonal braces and should have stopped the works from proceeding until the matter was rectified.  Dr Lam said, and Iaccept, that Wong as a qualified engineer and the RE would know that it was dangerous to carry on the work with the missing diagonalbraces.</p>    <p class="heading">Liability of D1</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> D1 was also convicted of the offence of failing to ensure safety of place of work in contravention of Regulation 38A of <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites</i><i> (Safety) Regulations</a></i> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/591">Cap. 591</a>) at the magistratesâ court on 3 April 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> The question of D1âs liability is not in issue.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> In my judgment D1 was right to concede at the outset that it was liable in tort to the plaintiffs.  Mr Bharwaney in his closing submissionsaccepted that D1 was liable in common law negligence as well as for breach of statutory duty.  He accepted that D1 was also liable:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)       as an occupier of the site and was in breach of the common duty of care under the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a></i> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap. 314</a>) (âthe <i>OLO</i>â);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)        under section 7 of the <i>Occupation Safety and Health Ordinance</i> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/509">Cap. 509</a>) (âthe <i>OSHO</i>â);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)        under section 40(2A)(b) and section 40(2B)(a) of the <i>BO</i>.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> As found by the experts there were no working drawings for the replaced RMD falsework.  D1 as the principal contractor should haveprovided proper working drawings on the site for the workers to erect the falsework and for supervisors to ensure proper erectionof the replaced RMD.  D1 did not do so.  D1 also failed to order sufficient quantities of diagonal braces for the replaced RMD falseworkfor use at the site.  D1 required the supplier of RMD to provide RMD with a loading capacity of 26T instead of 32T as required bythe approved plan.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> By paragraph 5.19 of the draft Code D1 had the sole responsibility to ensure the integrity of the falsework and D1 was in breachof its duty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> D1 was also in breach of its duty to supervise under paragraph 5.20 of the draft Code as it did not properly supervise the propererection of the replaced falsework.  The falsework did not have a loading capacity of 32T.  Not a single falsework at the site waslaterally braced to columns.  50% of diagonal braces was missing from the falsework which collapsed.  And some of the other falseworkat the site also had diagonal braces missing as found by the LD in its report at paragraph 29. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> There was also a failure by D1 to properly inspect the falsework before concreting began.  As I have found, the collapsed falseworkwas erected on 20 May 2001 and had been standing there for about 10 days before the accident without lateral support to the columnand with 50% of its diagonal braces missing.  Yet no one reported any non-conformity with the approved plan.  Even at the morninginspection at the site before concreting began on 29 May 2001 there was a site walk with safety officers of D1 as well as with JackChan to inspect the site.  There was no report of any non-conformity with the approved plan.  Any reasonably competent inspectionwould have easily revealed that diagonal braces were missing and that lateral bracing to existing column was not provided as requiredby the approved plan.  It seems to me, and I so find, that there was gross negligence on the part of D1.  This is not disputed byMr Bharwaney.</p>    <p class="heading">Liability of Ng and CN</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> Mr Bharwaney submitted that CN and Ng were also liable for common law negligence and breach of statutory duty. The breaches of statutoryduty he relied on were:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)    as an occupier of the site, under the <i>OLO</i>;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)    under section 7 of the <i>OSHO</i>;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)    under sections 40(2A)(b), 40(5) and 40 (2B)(a) of the <i>BO</i>.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> Mr Pirie accepted that a material breach of the draft Code on the part of CN and Ng would amount to negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Was there negligence on the part of CN and Ng<i>?</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> Ng, CN and Wong clearly owed a duty of care not to cause personal injury to those whom they could reasonably foresee might be injuredas a result of their negligence.  (paragraph 8-078 <i>Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional Negligence</i> 5<sup>th</sup> Edn).  It is accepted that CN would be vicariously liable for the acts and omissions of Ng and Wong.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> It seems to me to have been established that Ng as the RSE and Wong as the RSEâs representative at all times, as well as beingthe RE on the site, were negligent and in breach of their duty of care.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> Ng said in evidence that he did not realize at the time of his declarations to the BD and LD staff that Case 1 under paragraph 5.20of the draft Code was engaged.  As he did not realise that Case 1 was engaged at the time, it seems to me that neither he nor Wongphysically checked the falsework to ensure that they complied with the approved plans.  Ng said that he did not see the design drawingsand calculations for the replaced RMD for PB3 until after the accident at the site.  I find that Ng and Wong could not have beensatisfied at the time of the accident that the falsework which collapsed had the loading capacity of 32T.  The calculations of RMD,which Ng did not even see prior to the accident, only showed a loading capacity of 26T which was what was required by D1 contraryto the approved plan.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> Wong also said in his declaration that as a RE his duties did not include safety supervision of the falsework.  In answer to Question18, he said that Ng agreed with him that the safety of all the falsework fell within the responsibilities of the contractor ratherthan him, and that he was not required to check the safety of the falsework at the site.  This statement of his shows clearly thathe was unaware of his obligations under Case 1 as the representative of the RSE.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> Wong also did not check the calculations.  He did not report any non-conformity with the approved plans.  The reason for this isthat he failed to carry out his obligations and breached his duty of care to supervise the works.  He was the RSEâs representativeand the RE on the site at all times.  Although the falsework that collapsed was standing there for about 10 days before it collapsedhe failed to inspect the same.  He also failed to inspect it before concreting began.  Had he inspected the falsework, he would easilyhave discovered that it was not laterally braced to the column and that 50% of the diagonal braces was missing.  Any reasonably competentengineer would have discovered this.  The fact that Wong did not report any non-conformity with the approved plan demonstrates clearlythat he was in breach of his duty to supervise the falsework that was erected. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> There can be no doubt that the falsework which collapsed was in a dangerous condition and was quite clearly unsafe.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> Both Dr Lam and Pho said that the accident could have been prevented if CN, Ng and Wong had fulfilled their obligations.  It seemsto me that Ng as the RSE and Wong as the representative of the RSE, could have stopped the works from proceeding until the dangerouscondition of the falsework had been rectified and the accident would not have happened.  By the same token, it seems to me that ifD1 had also fulfilled its obligations the accident could also have been prevented.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> I find that there was gross negligence on the part of Wong and Ng.  CN is vicariously liable for their negligence. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> I find that negligence has been proved against Ng and CN.  As negligence has been established against Ng and CN that is sufficient,in my view, to go on and apportion liability between D1 on the one part and Ng and CN on the other part.  However, D1 also relieson the breaches of statutory duty against Ng and CN as pleaded by the plaintiffs in the consolidated statement of claim.  In my view,liability for breach of statutory duty does not make any difference to the apportionment of liability but as this has also been reliedon, I shall go on to consider liability for breach of statutory duty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">OLO</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> In my view, CN and Ng were also occupiers of the site as they were in a position to stop the works from proceeding.

It seems to me that the falseworkwhich collapsed did diverge or deviate in a material way from the approved plan in that it failed to have lateral bracing to existingstructure like a column, it failed to have a loading capacity of 32T and it had missing diagonal braces.  By failing to properlysupervise the erection of the falsework in breach of his obligation under Case 1, Ng has authorized or permitted the works to becarried out in such manner that it caused injury to the plaintiffs and the deceased.  In my judgment Ng is also liable for damagesfor breach of statutory duty under the <i>BO</i> and CN is vicariously liable for the tort of Ng.</p>    <p class="heading">Apportionment</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> Although Ng and CN are liable in common law negligence as well as for breaches of statutory duty, as I have said the breaches ofstatutory duty do not take the matter further.  It seems to me that the question of the apportionment of liability between D1 onthe one part and Ng and CN on the other part would still be the same even if there were no breaches of statutory duty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3(1)</a> of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Liability (Contribution) Ordinance</a></i> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377">Cap. 377</a>) provides that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â(1) Subject to the following provisions of this section, any person liable in respect of any damage suffered by another personmay recover contribution from any person liable in respect of the same damage (whether jointly with him or otherwise).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a> And <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(1)</a> provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â Subject to subsection (3), in any proceedings for contribution under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> the amount of the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the court to be just and equitable havingregard to the extent of that personâs responsibility for the damage in question.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> It is common ground that D1 may recover contribution from Ng and CN as they are liable to the plaintiffs in respect of the same damage.

Hilberry J. took âresponsibilityâ to refer to theextent to which each tortfeasor caused the damage, and not to their relative culpability.  Hallett J., on the other hand, declinedto follow this interpretation, and it is now well-established that neither element should be disregarded.  For example, in <i>Downs v Chappell</i> a negligent defendant was required to contribute equally with a fraudulent defenÂ­dant on the basis that the negligence had a greatercausative impact.  Hobhouse L.J. said that: âIt is just and equitable to take into account both the seriousness of the respectivepartiesâ faults and their causative relevance.  A more serious fault having less causative impact on the plaintiffâs damage mayrepresent an equivalent responsibility to a less serious fault which had a greater causative impact.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a> The apportionment of damages is substantially a matter of discretion.  The Court must apportion the damages between the parties whoare actually before the Court.  It is not relevant to have regard to the possible negligence of some other person, not a party tothe proceedings, whose fault may have contributed to the damages suffered by the injured plaintiffs and the deceased (paragraph 4.25<i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</i>).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a> It is common ground that the question of apportionment is between D1 on the one part and Ng and CN on the other part.  These arethe only parties actually before the court and it is not relevant to consider whether any other person not a party to the proceedingsmay have contributed to the damages suffered.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a> It is accepted by D1 that the major blameworthiness for the accident lies with D1 with 60% liability on its part and 40% on the partof Ng and CN.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a> Mr Pirie submitted that as D1 did not provide adequate working drawings, failed to order sufficient quantities of diagonal bracesfor the replaced RMD for use at the site, failed to properly inspect the erection of the falsework to ensure compliance with theapproved plan, D1 should be liable to the extent of 80%.  He submitted that Ng and CN should only be liable to the maximum extentof 20%.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a> In my judgment having regard to their respective responsibilities and their breaches it is just and equitable to apportion liabilityat 30% on the part of Ng and CN and 70% on the part of D1. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a> As requested by Counsel, I shall leave it to Counsel to agree the minutes of order on the above apportionment of liability.
