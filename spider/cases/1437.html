This document is dated 29 April 1974 and registered with the Land Registryby Memorial No. UB1082794 (âthe DMCâ).</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  This action concerns a breach of the DMC by the defendant. The breach is admitted by the defendant. It contends, however, that thereis a defence to this action, namely, abatement of nuisance.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  To begin, I need to explain the matters concerning the breach of the DMC. At the external wall of the dining room of the Premises,there used to be two windows. They were about 42 in. high and 35 in. from the floor. It appears that the windows were of differentwidths. I have been referred to a photograph of the external wall in question (Bundle (2), p. 115) and it is common ground that thewindows had the same appearance as those of the flat on the 10<sup>th</sup> floor. By looking at that photograph, the window at the left (âthe Left windowâ) appears to be about half the width of the oneon the right (âthe Right windowâ).</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Outside the external wall in question, there is a flat roof and a parapet wall. The effect of those features is such that thereappears to be a small balcony outside the external wall. It is not disputed that the existence of the flat roof is the result ofthe fact that the building decreases in size at the 11<sup>th</sup> floor. For convenience, I shall refer to the flat roof as (âthe Balconyâ). The distance between the external wall and the parapetwall is only 2 ft and the total area of the Balcony is about 22 sq. ft. It is common ground that the Balcony is part of the commonarea of Cliffview Mansion. There was of course no access to the Balcony (other than climbing out of the windows). I should mentionthat there is an architectural fin above the Balcony, but it does not fully cover it.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Shortly after the defendant had acquired the Premises in 2004, the Left and Right windows as well as the part of the external wallon which they sat were demolished. The Left window was replaced by a glass door. Instead of the Right window, one can now find alarger door opening with three sliding glass doors. It is common ground that such alteration constitutes a breach of Clause 6 ofthe Third Schedule of the DMC :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âNo external shades, awnings or window guards shall be used in or about the said building until such shall have been approved inwriting by the Managers and no owner shall without the previous written consent of the Managers paint the outside of the said buildingor any part thereof <u>nor alter the exterior walls window glass</u> nor do any other act or thing which would alter or affect the exterior appearance of the said building.â [<u>emphasis added</u>]</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Having accepted the breach of the DMC, the defendant also accepts that the burden of proof in this trial rests with it. Two witnesseshave been called by the defendant, Mr Daryanani (DW1) who lives in the Premises with his family and a surveyor, Mr Eddie Lee ShueShing (DW2). With respect, the facts in this case are fairly straightforward and the dispute thereof is not, in truth, extensive.I do not find that the evidence of DW2 adds much to that given by DW1 and the undisputed facts.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  According to DW1, he inspected the Premises before they were purchased. At the time of inspection, they were occupied by a tenant,Mr Willie Chan (âChanâ). DW1 looked around the Premises and asked Chan about it. It was pointed out to him that the Balcony wasdifficult to clean. Due to the fact that the Balcony was facing the hillside, during a typhoon, leaves would get blown onto the Balconyand block the drain there. It had happened two or three times during Chanâs tenancy. DW1 said that he noticed that the Balconywas dirty with a bit of water and some leaves. Chan said to him that he cleaned the Balcony by jumping out of the window, which wasnot convenient. Chan also told him that no one from the management ever went to clean the Balcony. I shall refer to the managementcompany appointed by the IO to look after Cliffview Mansion as (âthe Managementâ).</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  DW1 said that it would have been difficult to clean the Balcony. One would require a ladder or a small stool to climb the 35 in.wall. If one slipped, one might get hurt by hitting the parapet wall which was 43 in. high.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  DW1 said that he and his wife were particularly concerned about hygiene because of their young children, the SARS experience andthe concern over dengue fever. After they took possession of the Premises at the end of July 2004, they engaged a contractor to refurbishthe Premises. On DW1âs instructions, the contractor wrote to the Management to ask for permission to carry out the alteration worksmentioned above (see paragraph 7). DW1âs case is that the works were required to allow access to the Balcony so that it could becleaned. The Management declined the request. However, DW1 and his wife decided to go ahead with the works but at the time they triedto convince the IO about their point of view.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  It appears that as late as the end of October 2004, DW1 still had doubt as to whether the Balcony was part of the common area orthe Premises (see Bundle (2), p. 151).</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  It is undisputed that the Management has offered to clean the Balcony once every fortnight if required (it is accepted that theduty to clean any common area rests with the Management.). The offer was made during a meeting of the IO on 25 October 2004 whichwas attended by DW1âs wife (Bundle (2), p. 128). DW1 is not attracted by the offer because it would adversely affect the privacyof his family to have cleaners coming into the Premises. He is also concerned about the security issue and dislikes the idea thatdirt would have to be taken from the Balcony into the Premises before disposal. He said that he would be willing to reinstate thewindows if the Management agreed to discharge the cleaning responsibility without having to go into the Premises. The use of a gondolafor that purpose had been suggested by DW1.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  As to the suggestion that by demolishing the windows the Balcony has been put to the private use of his family, DW1 said that thePremises have an area of 3,800 sq. ft and there is a terrace of about 500 sq. ft attached to the Premises. His family has no needfor any additional space.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In cross-examination, it was pointed out to DW1 that there was no mention in his witness statement of seeing any dirt and wateron the Balcony. In answer, DW1 said that he had told his lawyers about the matter. He agreed that for cleaning purposes, having onedoor opening created would be sufficient. He accepted that a small table and some plants have been placed on the Balcony. He saidthat the single glass door (which replaced the Left window) leads to the dining room whereas the triple one connects to a bedroom.The demolition was carried out in October 2004, but he was not sure. Apart from having the doors installed, the Balcony was tiledin the course of the renovation.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  DW1 agreed that the Balcony can be cleaned with a broom and a garbage shovel, but it would not be a â100%â job. He also saidin re-examination that one could not unblock the drain with a broom and garbage shovel. The Balcony has been cleaned once every 2to 3 days since he started living in the Premises.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  On the whole, I find DW1 to be a credible witness. Indeed, much of his evidence accords with commonsense and is inherently credible,e.g. asking Chan about the Premises. The only blemish is his evidence that he had seen dirt and water on the Balcony during inspection.Such an important matter (in the context of this case) is unlikely to be missed out by the lawyers had they been told.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  However, regardless of DW1âs evidence on this aspect, I am quite prepared to accept that from time to time fallen leaves and dirtcan be found on the Balcony. During a typhoon or on a rainy day, some water will appear on the Balcony. The amount of accumulatedwater would probably depend on the state of the drainage. All these are matters of commonsense.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  One witness has been called by the IO, Mr O Hin Lung (PW1) who works for the Management. Like the case of DW2, I do not believethat PW1âs evidence adds much to what was said by DW1 and the undisputed facts. I mention, however, two points concerning his evidence.Firstly, I do not believe that PW1âs memory is accurate in respect of when Chan moved out of Cliffview Mansion. I prefer the evidenceof DW1 which is supported by exhibit âD1â. Secondly, PW1âs uncontested evidence is that during his nine years working for theManagement, it has never cleaned the Balcony and has not received any complaint about the hygienic condition of the same.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  There is an agreed List of Issues. There are three issues to be resolved. Firstly, whether there was a private nuisance caused bythe accumulation of rubbish and water at the Balcony. Secondly, whether the alteration works in question (âthe Alterationâ) werecarried out to put an end to the nuisance. Thirdly, whether the defendant was legally entitled to carry out the Alteration in breachof the DMC by reason of abatement of nuisance notwithstanding that the Management has offered to clean the Balcony.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In respect of the first issue, Ms Gwilt, who appears for the defendant, agrees that the mere existence of rubbish and water on theBalcony does not necessarily amount to a nuisance. The defendant has to satisfy this court that the hygienic condition was such thatit amounted to a nuisance.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  I do not believe that the evidence before me meets that threshold. Whilst I accept that rubbish and water might appear on the Balcony(see paragraph 18 above), there is no evidence that such constituted a serious problem or a health hazard. I believe that the lackof complaint over a very long period speaks volume in this regard. Further, it might well be the case that the previous occupiersof the Premises were content to carry out the simple cleaning job themselves, possibly by using a broom and a garbage shovel. Inconsidering whether there was a nuisance, I do not believe that one should ignore the simplicity of the resolution â the cleaning.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Once the defendant has failed to cross this first hurdle, its case must collapse. However, I shall deal briefly with the remainingissues. I accept that cleaning the Balcony was one of the reasons for the Alteration, but it was not the only reason. It is quiteclear that the Alteration has improved the Premises by, e.g. allowing more light into the dining room and one of the bedrooms. Further,although the Balcony is fairly small in area, having access to it is undoubtedly an advantage.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Whilst I do understand DW1âs position about privacy, I do not believe that it was reasonable for the defendant not to accept theManagementâs offer to clean the Balcony. Mr Tang, who appears for the IO, has rightly pointed out that the Management has the rightunder the DMC to reasonable access to any flats for purpose of cleaning a common area â Clause B(1) of the First Schedule.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  These two matters would defeat any claim under the principles of abatement of nuisance (if there were any). I have been referredby Mr Tang to <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>, 19<sup>th</sup> ed., paras. 31-24 to 31-25 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThere exists a right to self-help against a nuisance, called the right of abatement; and a very similar right of self-redress fortrespass by encroachment. The victim of a nuisance can lawfully put an end to it by acts done on his own property, where this ispossible...</p>        <p class="quote">The right to abate a nuisance has fallen into a certain amount of judicial disfavour and various limitations have been put upon it.It is suggested that the right of abatement is nowadays subject to the following conditions :</p>        <p class="quote">(a) â¦</p>        <p class="quote">(b) It must be a case in which a court has not refused a mandatory injunction or would not refuse one if the claimant chose to goto court. If it were otherwise, the wrongdoer could be made to suffer loss out of proportion to any damage which has been done: alarge and valuable building could be demolished for a trivial encroachment on a right of way which a small sum of money would adequatelycompensate. Clearly, caution must be exercised when demolishing buildings under the purported exercise of a right of abatement.</p>        <p class="quote">(c) The abatement must be done so as to cause as little damage as possible, not only to the wrongdoer, but also to innocent partiesand to the public. If there are alternative methods of abatement, one of which will be less injurious to the wrongdoer than the other,the least injurious method must be adopted â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  DW1 has accepted that the Alteration was more extensive than was necessary (see paragraph 15 above). Further, I do not believe thatif the defendant goes to court for relief against the IO, there is any real prospect that the court would order a mandatory injunctionfor the demolition of the windows.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  For these reasons, I give judgment in favour of the IO and dismiss the Counterclaim.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Ms Gwilt has tried to dissuade me from exercising my discretion in granting an injunction to have the windows restored. With respect,given DW1âs position that he is quite prepared to have the windows restored if there is a way to clean the Balcony which meetshis requirements, I am unable to accede to Ms Gwiltâs submission.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I grant an injunction in terms of prayer (1) of the Amended Statement of Claim (Bundle (1), p.5) save that the defendant is to have30 days from the date of judgment to complete the restoration. I make an order <i>nisi</i> that the costs of the action and the Counterclaim be to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Last but not least, I thank both counsel for their assistance and their effort in shortening the hearing time for this trial.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(Anthony Chan, SC)<br />            Recorder of the Court of First Instance<br />            High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr David Tang, instructed by Messrs DLA Piper Hong Kong, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Ms Angela Davina Gwilt, instructed by Messrs Huen &amp; Partners, for the Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2009/783.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
