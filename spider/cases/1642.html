They were incorporated on 13 October 1972.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  San Po Kong Mansion is a high rise composite development consisting of 4, 20 storeys blocks which are subdivided into 4 sub blocksand each sub block is divided into 2 units.  There are commercial premises on the first 5 floors and above that are residential units.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The developer Yue Lee Co Ltd reserved the roof of the whole of the building to itself save for lift machine rooms, water tanks etcand a right of way for parties having a legitimate purpose on the roof.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  It can be added that the area of the roof amounts to 16,800 square feet and it is possible to gain access to all of the roof withouthaving to enter by a different stairway.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Deed of Mutual Covenant which provides for the rights and obligations of all owners of the building is dated 15 May 1968.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  It is not a well drafted deed.  It contains inconsistencies.  However it would appear that what was contemplated was that Yue Leereserved the roof with the intention that if the requisite planning consent was obtained an additional floor would be added to thebuilding.  This was never proceeded with.  It was provided in the Deed of Mutual Covenant that Yue Lee and their successors in titlewould not have to contribute towards the maintenance payments payable under the Deed.  However, there is even ambiguity on this issue.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Yue Lee assigned their interest in the roof to one of their Associated Companies for a nominal consideration and they in turn assignedthe interest to another Associated Company which assigned it to the Plaintiff which is also an Associated Company.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In 1995, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant entered into various licence agreements with the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> Defendants which licenced them to install aerials, telephone transmitters and other telecommunication equipment on the roof (thesaid equipment) in consideration of receiving fairly substantial licence fees.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The main purpose of this equipment was to facilitate the transmission of messages on cell telephones operated by the various otherDefendants.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  It is the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs case that the licence fees which they received were used by them to reduce the amount of maintenance payable by theowners under the Deed of Mutual Covenant.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Plaintiffâs contend that the presence of the said equipment on the roof constitutes a trespass.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs defence is in the alternative.  On the one hand it is argued that having regard to the terms of the Deed of MutualCovenant, the parapet walls form part of the common parts of the buildings and they are entitled to licence the other Defendantsto install the said equipment on the roof.  In the alternative they contend that they have obtained a possessory title to the roofby adverse possession of it.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Sakhrani J made an order on 20 October this year that the present hearing would be confined to the issue of liability and that therewould then if necessary be a further hearing on quantum.  One consequence of this was to obviate the necessity of the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> Defendants attending the present hearing.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Three witnesses gave evidence for the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Mr Daniel Kwan is a director of the Plaintiff.  He said that he had given instructions to members of his staff to inspect the rooffrom time to time.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  He had not been aware of any problems in connection with the roof.  He had however been aware of the fact that the managers of theBuilding had erected a structure on the roof for use as an office.  As this structure was mostly on the right of way on the roofhe had not been particularly concerned about it and had not taken any action in relation to it.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  What had concerned him however was that reports came back to him in 1995 that various strange structures had been attached to theparapet walls.  He had made inquiries of the Chairman of the Incorporated Owners as to what these were and why they were there andhe received no assistance whatever in ascertaining what it was all about.  Indeed the attitude of the Chairman had been in everyway obstructive.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  He had subsequently learnt that the structures were telecommunications equipment and that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had been receiving very substantial licence fees from telecommunication companies for the right to install their equipmenton the parapet walls and roof.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  He had not been aware of any resolution having been passed by the Incorporated Owners authorising the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to enter into these licensing Agreements.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  He said that the Plaintiffs had continued to exercise their rights as owners of the roof and that so far as could be ascertainedthe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs presence on the roof had been consistent with their exercising the normal duties required of them by virtue of theprovisions contained in the Deed of Mutual Covenant.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The Plaintiff had not paid any maintenance to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as there was no provision for this in the Deed of Mutual Covenant so far as the owners of the roof were concerned.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  He was cross-examined at some length by Mr Hung for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  It was certainly my impression that the amount of supervision which had been exercised by the Plaintiff of the roof hadbeen of a perfunctory nature.  Mr Kwan had been unaware of the fact that there had been a fire at the building in 1993 which hadresulted in the electricity supply being shut off for about 3 weeks.  Also he was unaware of the fact that apparently extensive remedialworks had been undertaken by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on the roof.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  He also was cross-examined at some length on the subject of the stamp duty which had been payable on the Assignment of the roofto the Plaintiff but this did not seem to me to take matters very far.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  It did however appear to be the case that Mr Kwan had only started to take an interest in the roof when he discovered the substantiallicence fees which were being received by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Mr Albert Chan a junior employee gave evidence of the inspections he undertook of the roof up until 1994.  It was my impressionthat his visits had been of a rather casual nature.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The other employee who had conducted inspections Mr H S Tang also did not appear to me to have spent much time or effort on hisinvestigations.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Both these witnesses gave evidence that they had free access to the roof when they undertook their inspections.  I accept theirevidence that they had no difficulty in gaining access to the roof on their visits and that they did not observe anything which wouldhave led them to believe that the title to the predecessor in title to the Plaintiff had in any way been called in question.  Sofar as it goes I accept the evidence of both witnesses as being truthful.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The two main witnesses for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant were Mr Wong Bit Tat, the Chairman of the Incorporated Owners and Ms Liu Suk Yee who is presently on the committee.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Mr Wong described how the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had discharged its duties and responsibilities since its inception.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The main thrust of Mr Wongâs evidence is the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant has since 1972 proceeded upon the assumption that the roof of the building came within the purview of the IncorporatedOwners.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Indeed the way in which he explained this was to state that the Plaintiff had been âdispossessedâ by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant of the roof.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  This being the case, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had attended to the maintenance and upkeep of the roof and this had involved it in considerable expenditure.  For examplethe roof and parapet wall was in a dilapidated and dangerous condition in 2003 and it had been necessary for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to spend approximately $180,000 so that necessary repairs could be effected.  It needs however to be added that no documentaryevidence was produced to prove that this expenditure had in fact been incurred.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  However the Management Committee resolved in June 2003 that in the light of the ongoing dispute over the ownership of the roof nofurther money would be expended on the roof unless there was an emergency or it was mandated by a Building Authority Order.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The reason Mr Wong gave for not informing the Plaintiff of this situation was that in the opinion of the majority of owners, thePlaintiff did not own the roof.  Having regard to the issues canvassed in this litigation, this is not a plausible or convincingexplanation for not informing the Plaintiff of the position.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Throughout all of the period of the existence of the Management Committee it had proceeded upon the assumption that the roof formedpart of the common parts of the building and had taken appropriate action as required.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  This had included taking measures to evict squatters and closing off access to the roof from midnight to 7 am.  They had also takenaction for the demolition of illegal structures on the roof.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The Management Committee had itself erected a structure on the roof for use as an office for the conduct of management business. This was mainly on the right of way. </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The Management Committee had entered into the Licence Agreements referred to in the pleadings.  According to Mr Wong, they had doneso for what they perceived to be the best interests of all of the owners in the building.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The licence fees had been applied towards the revenue of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and this had meant that the amount of the contributions the Owners were required to make had not had to be increased aswould otherwise have been the case.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  There is an important aspect of Mr Wongâs evidence which has to be borne in mind.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  He was only appointed Chairman of the Management Committee in January 2000.  He took over from a Mr Wong Toi Yee.  It was apparentthat the records and accounts of the Incorporated Owners left much to be desired.  Indeed Accountants declined to prepare some ofthe Accounts on account of the fact that some documents were missing. </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Mr Wong had first participated in the affairs of the Committee in 1998.  It was from this involvement that he had concluded thatlicence fees which had been received from the Telecommunication Companies had been credited to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs funds.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  It has to be said that the Accounts which were before the Court were not in a satisfactory state.  No accounts at all were producedfor the years 1997 to 1999 inclusive.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The explanation Mr Wong gave for this was that no such accounts had ever been prepared.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  When Mr Wong was taken through the accounts which were before the Court he was unable to explain a number of glaring discrepanciesand inconsistencies and I was by no means convinced that all of the licence fees which were received from the other Defendants havein fact been applied for the benefit of the owners at large.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In the final analysis I did not consider Mr Wong to be a reliable witness.  It was my impression that he did not himself have muchdirect knowledge concerning the activities of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant prior to the year 2000.  Even after he was appointed Chairman I was not convinced that his version of what had transpiredwas truthful or accurate and my overall conclusion was that I could attach little weight to his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  The other witness to give evidence for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was Ms Liu Suk Yee.  She is a Member of the Management Committee.  It was clear from her evidence that she has some knowledgeof the affairs of the Incorporated Owners since its inception.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  She had knowledge concerning the roof and its use since the early 1970âs.  It had always been regarded as being part of the commonarea of the building.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  It had been the practice for residents to go on to the roof and have parties there.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Each year after 1995 a party had been held to celebrate the mid Autumn Festival and a number of residents would attend.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  She was aware that extensive repair work had been undertaken on the building in 1982 and 1983.  This had also included work to replacethe gutters on the roof.  All of the expenses for the work had been borne by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to the best of her knowledge.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  She was aware of the fact that it had been necessary to demolish illegal structures on the roof and that it had been the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant that initiated the necessary action.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Ms Liu gave evidence that prior to 1995 there were a large number of what has been described as fishbone antennae which were erectedby individual owners to enable them to receive good television reception.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  She had never considered that it was necessary to obtain permission from anyone to install the antennae on the roof.  In fact mostof the antennae had been installed on the parapet wall.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  In 1995 everyone had been required to remove their antennae as this obstructed scaffolding which had to be erected to enable repairwork to be undertaken on the building.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Subsequent to this a reception disc was installed on the water tank which enabled all owners to obtain good television reception.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  What is important to bear in mind in relation to these antennae is that even if any possessory right was being acquired the beneficiarywould not have been the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant but the individual owners who had erected the antennae.  I say this on account of Ms Liuâs evidence that it did not appearto be the practice for the individual owners to obtain permission from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and their role appears to be confined to turning a blind eye in the situation.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In 1996 there had been problems concerning seepage of water to the flats on the 19<sup>th</sup> floor and this had necessitated substantial repair work being undertaken.  It was her impression that the cost of this had been borneby the owners through the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  To the best of her knowledge the Plaintiffs had not made any contribution towards the costs of this.  The reason shegave for this was that everyone had been under the impression that the roof formed part of the common parts of the building.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Ms Liu was a much better witness than Mr Wong.  She clearly had a detailed knowledge and excellent recollection of the matters shehad been involved in since the early 1970âs.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  It needs however to be emphasised that Ms Liuâs evidence must be of very limited value prior to the time she became actively involvedin the affairs of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in the year 2000.  Prior to this her evidence would for the most part be hearsay and she would have little or no directknowledge concerning the intentions and policies of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  There were some inconsistencies in her evidence.  She referred to the lamentable state of affairs which had existed in relationto the roof when derelicts and other undesirable persons had frequented it and that she considered it to be unsafe to go there.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  All of this was inconsistent with the drift of her evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was exercising control over the roof.  I am inclined to the view that it was only in more recent years that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant exercised any meaningful control such as restricting access to non-residents.  Certainly I do not think that the gate wasinstalled more than 20 years before the Plaintiff issued their writ in these proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  It has to be said however that virtually all of the action Ms Liu referred to which had been taken by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant over the years appeared to me to be consistent with duties normally undertaken by Incorporated Owners.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  They did not seem to me to indicate that the Plaintiff had necessarily relinquished its ownership of the roof.  </p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  So far as the facts of the case are concerned the final matter to be dealt with is the Expert evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Expects were called by the Plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  The Plaintiff called Mr K W Chan of Dudley Surveyors Limited and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant called Mr S T Wong of Proficient Surveyors &amp; Company.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  There was a large measure of agreement between the experts.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  At the present time, there are altogether 35 antennae or aerials.  31 of these are attached to the interior of the parapet walland 4 to the exterior faced parapet walls.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  There are also 4 transmitter boxes placed on the floor of the roof.  According to Mr Wongâs report, the total space taken by thetransmitter boxes amounts to 3.69% of the total area of the roof.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  There were also thick cables attached to the transmitters and the aerials and these for the most part ran along the parapet walls. They did also extend to some extent on to the roof itself.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  There was agreement that the width of the parapet wall was 255 millimetres and that the width of the exterior wall of the flat immediatelybelow the parapet wall was 100 millimetres.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Mr Chan gave evidence that the parapet wall was of different construction to the exterior wall beneath it and in his opinion couldbe considered physically as being separate from the exterior walls.  I accept the validity of this evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Mr Chan also made the point that the Assignment of the roof to the Plaintiff had referred to the Building Authority plan of theroof and assigned to the Plaintiff the area coloured in pink on the said plan.  The measurements on this plan exactly coincided withthe measurements he had taken on the roof which included the width of the parapet walls.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  When the Assignment is taken in conjunction with the Deed of Mutual Covenant, it is difficult to avoid coming to a conclusion thatthe demise of the roof did include the parapet walls.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  One way of looking at this would be to consider whether it would make much sense to reserve to oneself the exclusive right to theroof and not at the same time to include the parapet walls.  Unless these walls were included in the demise, it would be unsafe touse the roof for most purposes.  It might also be added that when an individual flat is assigned to a purchaser, it is not customarilythe case to include in the demise the interior walls of the building.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  In determining whether the parapet wall and roof are common parts of a building, Mr Hung submitted that the starting point mustbe the definition of âcommon partsâ in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344">Cap. 344</a>.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âcommon partsâ (<span>å¬ç¨é¨å</span>)means â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)<span>         </span> the whole of a building, except such parts as have been specified or designed in an instrument registered in the Land Registry asbeing for the exclusive use, occupation or enjoyment of an owner; and (<i>Amended 8 of 1993 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 2</a></i>)</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)<span>         </span> unless so specified or designated, those parts specified in the First Schedule;â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  The next step is to determine whether or not the parapet wall and roof have been reserved exclusively for the use and occupationof any owner.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  Mr Hung referred to the Deed of Mutual Covenant.  While it is apparent that the roof was reserved to the Yue Lee the parapet wallwas not referred to.

Whether that part of the external wall was part of the shop whichthe first to fourth defendants had had the exclusive right to occupy depended on what was originally assigned to them or their predecessors-in-title.

What was before the judge was the deed of mutual covenant defining therights and obligations of the various co-owners of the units in the building as between themselves.

The law will thus, without reluctance, ascribe possession either tothe paper owner or to persons who can establish a title as claiming through the paper owner.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)    If the law is to attribute possession of land to a person who can establish no paper title to possession, he must be shownto have both factual possession and the requisite intention to possess (â<i>animus possidendi</i>â).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)    Factual possession signifies an appropriate degree of physical control.  It must be a single and conclusive possession, thoughthere can be a single possession exercised by or on behalf of several persons jointly.  Thus an owner of land and a person intrudingon that land without his consent cannot both be in possession of the land at the same time.  The question what acts constitute asufficient degree of exclusive physical control must depend on the circumstances, in particular the nature of the land and the mannerin which land of that nature is commonly used or enjoyed.  In the case of open land, absolute physical control is normally impracticable,if only because it is generally impossible to secure every part of a boundary so as to prevent intrusion.  âWhat is a sufficientdegree of sole possession and user must be measured according to an objective standard, related no doubt to the nature and situationof the land involved but not subject to variation according to the resources or status of the claimantsâ: <i>West Bank Estates Ltd. V. Arthus</i>, per Lord Wilberforce.  It is clearly settled that acts of possession done on parts of land to which a possessory title is soughtmay be evidence of possession of the whole.  Whether or not acts of possession done on parts of an area establish title to the wholearea must, however, be a matter of degree.  It is impossible to generalise with any precision as to what acts will or will not sufficeto evidence factual possession.  On the particular facts of <i>Cadija Umma v S Don Manis Appu</i> the taking of a hay crop was held by the Privy Council to suffice for this purpose; but this was a decision which attached specialweight to the opinion of the local courts in Ceylon owing to their familiarity with the conditions of life and the habits and ideasof the people.  Likewise, on the particular facts of the <i>Red House Farms</i> case, mere shooting over the land in question was held by the Court of Appeal to suffice; but that was a case where the court regardedthe only use that anybody could be expected to make of the land as being for shooting: per Cairns, Orr and Waller L JJ.  Everythingmust depend on the particular circumstances, but broadly, I think what must be shown as constituting factual possession is that thealleged possessor has been dealing with the land in question as an occupying owner might have been expected to deal with it and thatno-one else has done so.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)    The <i>animus possidendi</i>, which is also necessary to constitute possession, was defined by Lindley MR, in <i>Littledale v Liverpool College</i> (a case involving an alleged adverse possession) as âthe intention of excluding the owner as well as other people.â  This conceptis to some extent an artificial one, because in the ordinary case the squatter on property such as agricultural land will realisethat, at least until he acquires a statutory title by long possession and thus can invoke the processes of the law to exclude theowner with the paper title, he will not for practical purposes be in a position to exclude him.  What is really meant, in my judgment,is that the <i>animus possidendi</i> involves the intention, in oneâs own name and on oneâs own behalf, to exclude the world at large, including the owner with thepaper title if he be not himself the possessor, so far as is reasonably practicable and so far as the processes of the law will allow.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The question of <i>animus possidendi</i> is, in my judgment, one of crucial importance in the present case.  An owner or other person with the right to possession of landwill be readily assumed to have the requisite intention to posses, unless the contrary is clearly proved.  This, in my judgment,is why the slightest acts done by or on behalf of an owner in possession will be found to negative discontinuance of possession. The position, however, is quite different from a case where the question is whether a trespasser has acquired possession.  In sucha situation the courts will, in my judgment, require clear and affirmative evidence that the trespasser, claiming that he has acquiredpossession, not only had the requisite intention to possess, but made such intention clear to the world.  If his acts are open tomore than one interpretation and he has not made it perfectly plain to the world at large by his actions or words that he has intendedto exclude the owner as best he can, the courts will treat him as not having had the requisite <i>animus possidendi</i> an consequently as not having dispossessed the owner.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  This passage was cited with approval by the Final Court of Appeal in <i>Wong Tak Yue v Kung Kwok Wai</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20HKC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 HKC 1.</a></p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  It is necessary to bear these principles in mind when considering the evidence which was before the Court.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  I do not think that it has been established that the Plaintiff ever relinquished its rights to the roof or parapet walls.

The proportion which each of the parties hereto shall be liable to pay or contribute under Clauses 9, 10, 11, 13, 17 and18 hereof shall be as set out in the Third Schedule hereto and it is agreed that the 16 parts or shares relating to the use of theroof and the right to advertise shall not be liable to contribute to any of the aforesaid expenses and outgoings.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  I realise that there are other provisions contained in the Deed of Mutual Covenant which conflict with this clause.  What appearshowever to be relevant is that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant appears over the years to except the validity of Clause 14 and according to the available evidence has never made any demandupon the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  Before leaving the question of adverse possession it is necessary to make observation upon the recent Court of Appeal case of <i>Chan Tin Shi v Liu Tin Sung &amp; others</i> where judgment was delivered on 19 November this year.  By a majority it held that the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories Leases (Extension) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150">Cap 150</a> had the effect of extending the period for the purposes of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap 347</a>.

Each co-owner is entitled to possession of the whole land, so that if one turns the other off the land or part of it, it isa trespass.  If the common property or part of it is destroyed, there is an ouster.  So, trespass lies by one co-owner against anotherwho digs and carries away the soil.  It is not trespass, however, if one co-owner uses the land in the ordinary and natural way,as by cutting grass and making it into hay, or working a coal mine.  In such a case the owner making the hay or working the minemust account for the profits.  When there are co-owners of a wall, such as a party wall, one owner can maintain trespass againstthe other if there is a destruction of the wall.  But if the wall has been destroyed with the intention of rebuilding it, or thefoundations have been temporarily removed with the object of replacing them, there is no trespass.  Trespass will lie if one owneris ousted from possession of the wall, for example, if the wall is height-ened and a building is placed so as to occupy the wholewidth of the top.  Special statutory procedures exist to facilitate the repair of party structures and the swift resolution of disputesrelating to them.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  He contended that as between Tenants in Common, one could not be guilty of trespass so far as possession of the land owned by theTenants in Common was concerned.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  I do not think that this paragraph makes good this contention.  It is evident that where there has been ouster of one of the Tenantsin Common and action in trespass could be maintained.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  In the present case, the grant of the licences to the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> Defendants did constitute an ouster of the Plaintiffâs interest.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  It is apparent from the Expert evidence that the said equipment encroaches upon both the parapet walls and upon the roof.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  I have no doubt that the Plaintiff has established that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is guilty of trespass.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  The next issue raised by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is that the Plaintiff is estopped from claiming the return of the licence fees by the doctrine of estoppel and or by estoppelby convention.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  The law on this topic is conveniently encapsulated at paras 165.246 and 170.119 of vol. 11 of Halsburyâs Laws of Hong Kong, Butterworths2000:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b>[165.246] Acquiescence and estoppel</b>  The term âacquiescenceâ is used where a person refrains from seeking redress when there is brought to his notice a violationof his rights of which he did not know at the time; and in that sense acquiescence is an element in laches.  There may, however,be a case of acquiescence which does not depend on delay at all.  Subject thereto, a person whose rights have been infringed withoutany knowledge or assent on his part has vested in him a right of action which, as a general rule, cannot be divested without accordand satisfaction or deed of release.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The term âacquiescenceâ is, however, properly used where a person having a right, and seeing another person about to commit, orin the course of committing, an act infringing that right, stands by in such a manner as really to induce the person committing theact, and who might otherwise have abstained from it, to believe that he assents to its being committed; a person so standing by cannotafterwards be heard to complain of the act.  In that sense the doctrine of acquiescence may be defined as a acquiescence under suchcircumstances that assent may be reasonably inferred from it, and is no more than an instance of the law of estoppel by words orconduct, the principle of estoppel by representation applying both at law and in equity, although its application to acquiescenceis equitable.  The estoppel rests upon the circumstance that the person standing by in effect makes a misrepresentation as to a fact,namely, his own title; a mere statement that he intends to do something, for example to abandon his right, is not enough.  Furthermore,equitable estoppel is not applied in favour of a volunteer.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The doctrine of acquiescence operating as an estoppel was founded on fraud.  As the estoppel is raised immediately by the conductgiving rise to it, lapse of time is of no importance; and for this reason the effect of acquiescence is expressly preserved by statute. Certain rights have been held not to have been lost notwithstanding long periods of acquiescence.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><b>[170.119] Estoppel by convention </b> Where parties to a contract put a particular interpretation on it by a course of dealing on the faith of which each of them to theknowledge of the other acts and conducts their mutual affairs, they are bound by that interpretation.  The limits of this type ofestoppel are still in the process of being established however, and the following conditions must be satisfied:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)    there must be a common mistaken assumption by both parties as to the existence of a state of affairs or as to the constructionof a document;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)    the mistaken assumption has to have been communicated to each other;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)    both parties must have conducted themselves on the basis of such a mistake;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)    it must be unjust to allow one party to go back on that assumption; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(5)    once an understanding has been shown to be mistaken, the estoppel will not apply to future dealings between them.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">There can be no estoppel by convention where, although both parties are labouring under a common mistaken apprehension, it cannotbe said that they have acted on the basis of that apprehension.  Nor can the doctrine be invoked to deny a party the protection ofa statute from the terms of which contracting out is not possible.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Estoppel by convention is not confined to an agreed assumption as to fact, but may be as to law; and the court will give effect tothe agreed assumption only if it would be unconscionable not to do so.  Once a common assumption is revealed to be erroneous, theestoppel will not apply to future dealings.
