The Defendant applied to strike out the Plaintiffâs claim.  Iheard the application.  On 19 September 2007, I handed down my decision allowing the application.  The action was dismissed.  ThePlaintiff now applies for leave to appeal against my decision.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>      The hearing was conducted in Chinese but parties agreed that my decision would be delivered in English.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>      Leave to appeal would be granted unless there is no realistic prospect of success in the intended appeal: see <i>Smith v Cosworth Casting Processes Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20WLR%201538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 WLR 1538.</a>  Leave may also be granted if the intended appeal concerns a question of general principle or importance which requires the appellatecourt to decide for the public advantage: see <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedures</i> at 59/14/7.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>      The major reasons for my decision in September are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">There is no reasonable cause of action against the Defendant arising out of his submissions made in his capacity as counsel for thePlaintiffâs opponent before the court in the other action. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Entertaining the Plaintiffâs claim against the Defendant would be tantamount to re-opening the arguments of the parties in thatother action.  This is abuse of process. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>      The Plaintiff insists that he has a valid cause of action against the Defendant in negligence and for misleading the court. It is clear from his amended statement of claim in the present action that the Plaintiff was alleging what happened in the hearingbefore HH Judge Wong on 21 December 2006 in DCCJ Action No. 4492/2004 (see also paras.12 and 15 of my decision).  However, the Plaintiffnow stresses that he has been intending to refer to what happened in a hearing before Registrar Chan in HCA 2132/2005 instead.  Ido not see the justification for this change for the purpose of this application.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>      A major pre-requisite for an action in the tort of negligence is the existence of a duty of care owed by the defendant to theplaintiff.  A litigantâs counsel owes no such duty to the opposite party in respect of the counselâs conduct of the proceedingsin the action (see para.20 of my decision).  The Plaintiff now argues that this case is peculiar in that the Defendant was the onlylawyer before the court in the hearing in question.  This cannot be a valid basis for imposing on the counsel such personal dutyof care to the opposite party.  This also cannot be a valid basis for the counsel concerned to assume or to undertake such duty ofcare to the opposite party simultaneously with his undeniable duty towards his own client.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>      Counsel is certainly under the duty not to make misleading submissions to the court.  This is so irrespective of whether theopposite party is represented or not in the proceedings before the court.  Such duty is owed to the court and the profession.  Itdoes not give rise to a civil cause actionable by the opposing litigant against the counsel personally for compensation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>      Regarding the contention that the Defendant advanced untrue and misleading arguments, it was for the court in that other actionto evaluate such arguments.  That court had come to a decision after hearing the arguments advanced by the Plaintiff and those bythe Defendant on behalf of the Plaintiffâs opponent.  It is for the Plaintiff to decide what to do with that decision if he believesthat it is wrong, be it due to any untrue or misleading argument advanced by the Defendant or not.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>      Entertaining the Plaintiffâs claim against the Defendant in the present action would entail considering whether the decisionof the court in that action was the result of the Defendantâs alleged untrue and misleading submissions and, if yes, whether thatdecision should or could have been different.  This would effectively be a roundabout way of re-arguing the case which had been heardand decided by the court in that other action (see paras.16-19, 22 of my decision).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>      The Plaintiff refers to the cases of <i>Johnson v Gore Wood</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20WLR%2072" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 WLR 72</a> and <i>Arthur J S Hall v Simons</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%203%20WLR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 3 WLR 543.</a>  These cases were in fact cited in <i>Nu Life International Ltd v Healthy Living Products International Ltd</i>, HCA 1157/2006, which I actually referred to in my decision (see para.23 of my decision).  I have considered precisely what weresaid in these cases.  The conclusion that the present action is abusive of legal process is inevitable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>      There is no realistic prospect of success in the intended appeal by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>      The Plaintiff also argues that the striking out of his claim infringes his right of access to the court which is protected byarticle 35 of the Basic Law.  Determination of the merits of a partyâs claim by the court has nothing to do with that partyâsright of access to the court.  Neither the procedure under O.18, r.19 of the <i>Rules of the District Court</i> nor the fact that my decision is adverse to the Plaintiff infringes the Plaintiffâs right of access to the court.  Exactly in exerciseof his such right, he appeared before the court and was heard.  There is no valid basis for granting leave to appeal on the basisof the alternative limb.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>      In this hearing, the Plaintiff states in no uncertain terms that the court has been partial in favour of the Defendant.  Healso criticises counsel appearing for the Defendant in this hearing for misleading this court too.  It should be put on record thatthese suggestions are totally unwarranted.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>      The Plaintiff submits that if I dismiss his application, I should âstayâ the determination of the costs since he would takethe intended appeal further.  This is not a valid reason for departing from the norm that costs should follow the dismissal of theapplication.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>      In the circumstances, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed with costs to the Defendant to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Simon Leung<br />            District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Representation:</p>        <p style="text-align:left">The Plaintiff appearing in person and present</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Louie Wong, senior government counsel, appearing for the Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2007/399.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
