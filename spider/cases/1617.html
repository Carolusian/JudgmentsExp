The expanded but unpleaded allegations of negligence (which relateto the pre-surgery advice/investigation) can be summarized as follows :</p>    <blockquote>		<table border="0" width="85%">			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the 				defendant failed to warn the plaintiff about the risk of 				post-operative stroke, for if the plaintiff had been so warned,				she may not have accepted the operation, alternatively, if that 				warning had been given, the husband of the plaintiff wouldhave 				been alerted to any unusual signs or symptoms exhibited by the 				plaintiff during the post-operative period so as todetect the 				stroke and raise the alarm earlier than was the case;</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b) </td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the fact 				that the stroke was not detected until the evening of 				22 December 1999 has deprived the plaintiff the chance ofbeing 				treated with âthrombolytic agentâ or âre-explorationâ which 				would have changed the outcome; and</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>			<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the defendant 			proceeded in the matter (from initial consultation to operation) 			with indecent haste because he wanted to linehis own pocket.</td>		</tr>	</table></blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The attempt to expand the plaintiffâs case to cover unpleaded allegations of negligence of the defendant was objected to by counselfor the defendant as early as during the opening speech by plaintiffâs counsel.  Despite such objections, no application was madeby the plaintiff to amend the Statement of Claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Instead counsel for the plaintiff sought to justify the expanded case of the plaintiff by reliance upon paragraph 5 of the Statementof Claim.  However, paragraph 5 of the Statement of Claim only goes as far as to plead the duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. What it does not plead are the specific breaches.  Specific breaches are pleaded and particularised in paragraphs 9 to 12 inclusiveof the Statement of Claim and which have been summarised in paragraph 13 of this judgment as being the plaintiffâs pleaded caseon negligence.  What have been in paragraphs 9 to 12 of the Statement of Claim do not include the âexpandedâ allegations whichthe plaintiff now wish to rely on.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> It is not necessary for me to repeat once more in this judgment what these courts and also the rules of practice have time and againstated as to allegations of negligence having not only to be pleaded and particularized but also that the particulars should be preciselyand accurately stated so that a defendant knows exactly the case he faces.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> In a medical negligence case, it becomes even more important for the particulars of negligence to be precisely and accurately pleadedand particularized.  The observation by Patrick Curran QC in <i>Personal Injury Pleadings</i> (2<sup>nd</sup> Ed.) is pertinent in this respect :</p>    <blockquote>        <p CLASS="QUOTE">âAllegations of professional negligence are rightly regarded by practitioners as grave slurs upon their reputation.  There is simplyno comparison with the allegations of negligence which are made against a motorist, for example, whose personal reputation is onlylikely to be affected by an allegation of a disgraceful kind.  Any doctor is likely to suffer intense personal and professional anxietyover an allegation of professional negligence, and this should not be forgotten when pleading the case;â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The course adopted by counsel for the plaintiff in presenting the plaintiffâs case is one where the goal posts has constantly shiftedfrom the moment he opened the plaintiffâs case.  Nor can I accept the explanation offered by counsel for the plaintiff that itwas merely âa shift of focusâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The defendant came to court to meet the pleaded case of the plaintiff but has been greatly hampered in that respect because of theshifting goal posts.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> In the absence of any application by the plaintiff to amend the pleadings, in particular those matters pleaded and particularizedas being the defendantâs negligence in paragraphs 9 to 12 of the Statement of Claim, this claim brought by the plaintiff must bedecided on those allegations pleaded and particularized in the Statement of Claim, and not on any unpleaded case by the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Factual disputes and assessment</span></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> There were several areas of disputed factual evidence between the evidence given by the plaintiffâs husband (âPW1â) and thefactual evidence given by the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> I should deal with the disputed factual evidence first before going into each of the particulars of negligence raised in this case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Firstly, it was the evidence of PW1 that at the consultation, the defendant had told him and the plaintiff that the tumour was cancerous. This is denied by the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> This evidence of PW1 can hardly sit alongside his evidence that the defendant also told them that he could not say whether it wasbenign or malignant and that a small piece will have to be cut out for examination.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> If the defendant had said that it was cancerous then there could not have been any need to cut out a piece for examination to seeif it was benign or malignant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> I think that PW1 was wholly confused in this part of his evidence and shown to be unreliable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Secondly, it was PW1âs evidence that the defendant told him and the plaintiff that the tumour was pressing on the artery.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> However, the defendant could not have said this to PW1 or the plaintiff because the defendant knew, and it was confirmed by the plaintiffâsexpert, Professor Poon, in cross-examination that there was no compression of the tumour on the artery.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Again PW1 must have been quite mistaken as to this part of his evidence and again shown to be unreliable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Thirdly, in his oral evidence given in court, PW1 said that he had specifically asked the defendant about the danger of an operationif the tumour was so close to the blood vessel in the neck.  This, however, was not contained in his witness statement adopted byhim as his evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> On the other hand, the defendantâs evidence was that it was he, the defendant, who had volunteered the explanation to the plaintiffand her husband, without any question being asked by them.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Although the disputed fact here is only of a very narrow compass (whether it was asked by PW1 or whether the defendant gave thatexplanation without being asked), however, the insinuation carries with it a much wider scope.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> This explanation by the defendant goes to the very root of the matters complained of by the plaintiff and I cannot imagine if itwas the case that such explanation came from the defendant only upon being specifically asked such a question by PW1 that PW1 couldhave missed out such a fundamental piece of evidence from his witness statement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Given that PW1 has on other occasions been shown to be mistaken and unreliable in his evidence as to what had happened during theconsultation, I prefer the evidence given by the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Fourthly, in paragraph 10 of his witness statement, PW1 stated that at about 5 p.m. when the surgery was finished, he had noticedthat the plaintiff could not speak.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> In his oral evidence from the witness box, he changed to say that in fact it was not he (PW1) who had realized that the plaintiffcould not speak after the surgery but it was the defendant who had discovered that and told him that it was normal that the plaintiffwould not speak for a few days.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Very likely this evidence was slipped in by PW1 in an attempt to explain why he made no complaint when, according to him, he foundthe plaintiff to be in an half-conscious state on the morning of 22<sup> </sup>December 1999, and in doing so it contradicts with what he had stated in his witness statement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Moreover, when crossed examined, it was put to PW1 that the Progress Notes of Queen Mary Hospital had recorded that during an interviewwhich took place at 2.10 p.m. on 23<sup> </sup>December 1999, he had told Queen Mary Hospital in that interview that he ânoticed aphasia and right side weakness immediate afterthe operationâ.  PW1 could only deny having said that when so confronted.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Once again, this part of PW1âs evidence is so fraught with contradictions with the contents of his witness statement and the recordmade by Queen Mary Hospital, I find that this evidence of PW1 is not reliable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Fifthly, in paragraph 11 of his witness statement, PW1 alleged that he had been told by the nurse at about 9.00 a.m. on the morningof 22 December 1999 at St Teresaâs Hospital that the defendant had seen the plaintiff that morning and had remarked that it wasabnormal for the plaintiff to be in a half-conscious state.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> This evidence of PW1 was contradicted by the nursing notes which records that the defendant did not do the morning round that morninguntil 10.40 a.m.  Moreover, the nursing record further records that the plaintiff was awake when seen by the defendant at 10.40 a.m.(and not in a half-conscious state as alleged by PW1).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> When confronted with such nursing records in cross-examination, PW1 shifted to saying that the conversation with the nurse took placein the afternoon of that day.  In re-examination, he again changed his evidence to say that there were in fact two such similar conversationswith the nurse, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> This part of his evidence is patently unbelieveable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> In the light of such evidence, I have grave reservation as to the evidence given by PW1 where it conflicts with that of the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> On the other hand, the defendant has maintained consistently the same version throughout in so far as his evidence is concerned asto what had happened.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Accordingly, I have little difficulty accepting the evidence of the defendant where it conflicts with that of the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> I now turn to deal with each of the particulars of negligence raised in the pleadings and the evidence relating thereto.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(i)  Wrong diagnosis</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> This allegation was based on the expert report of Professor Poon who was the neurosurgeon instructed by the plaintiff as an expertwitness in this case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> When cross examined on this aspect of the case, Professor Poon said that it was an assumption on his part that the defendant wasdoing an excision biopsy of a lymph node upon his reading of the notes documenting the consultation with the defendant and the operationin this case.  Professor Poon further elaborated that his use of the phrase âexcision biopsyâ meant that the defendant knew hewas excising the whole mass if no problem was encountered and subsequently a biopsy would be performed on the excised mass.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Professor Poon further agreed that paraganglioma can only be diagnosed by histological examination and not normally made by a clinicaldiagnosis, although it may, at that stage, be suspected.  He further agreed that paraganglioma and carotid body tumour are rare occurrences.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> When ultimately confronted with the clinical notes of the defendant wherein the defendant had written by way of clinical diagnosis:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â? parotid   ? lymph node  ? neck of tissue tumourâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Professor Poon agreed that the defendant had not made any wrong diagnosis clinically as that would have been the diagnosis made byhimself as well.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> When further confronted with the Consent form in which it was written the words âexcision of left neck massâ, Professor Poonaccepted that there was no wrong diagnosis by the defendant in this case and that the defendant had intended to excise the entiremass unless problem was encountered during the operation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(ii)  Previous Blood Test and Biopsy Report</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> In respect of this allegation, Professor Poon agreed that when he interviewed the plaintiff and her husband, he was given the impressionthat there were previous Blood Test Report and also a Biopsy Report which was not available to the defendant when the plaintiff consultedhim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> When Professor Poon was told by counsel for the defendant that the plaintiffâs husband had confirmed in his evidence that the Biopsyreport dated 31 March 1999 sent to Dr Choi Kam Yee had been supplied to the defendant at the consultation, Professor Poon was contentto withdraw his criticism relating to the Biopsy report.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> As for the Blood Test report, Professor Poon agreed that the relevance of the Blood Test report was to indicate (at the time) whetherthe plaintiff was or was not suffering from Nasal Pharangeal Carcinoma (âNPCâ).  He agreed that in retrospect since the plaintiffwas not suffering from NPC, even if a blood test was repeated the result would likely be negative and as such would not have affectedthe clinical course of the management of her tumour.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(iii)  Doppler ultrasound, MRI and Angiogram</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Once again this criticism of the defendant came from Professor Poon.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> In cross-examination, however, Professor Poon accepted that as a general proposition, these tests are not done unless it is indicatedby the circumstances of the case that it should be done.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> Professor Poon also accepted that an angiogram is only done where there is a high clinical suspicion that the mass cannot be separatedfrom the carotid artery.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> As for the Doppler ultrasound, Professor Poon admitted that when he wrote his first report in this matter, he was aware that an ultrasoundhad been conducted by another doctor but that report was not made available to the defendant.  What he was not aware of was thatthe defendant had also conducted an ultrasound scan to examine the mass on the plaintiffâs neck when the defendant was consultedby the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Professor Poon agreed that an ultrasound was useful in defining the relationship between the tumour and the surrounding structurein the neck.  A Doppler ultrasound is colour imaging to show vascularity but will not add anything to the relationship with the surroundingstructure.  The degree of vascularity is one aspect to consider when deciding on surgical intervention.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Professor Poon further agreed that for a carotid body tumour, surgical excision is the treatment of choice and in this case surgicalexcision was indicated even if thorough investigation was done.  Whether or not a Doppler ultrasound was done, the surgery will bevery similar, even identical.  However, the observation during and after surgery will be different if a Doppler ultrasound was done.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> Professor Poon went on to agree that the histological report showed that there was no artery attached to the mass; no part of theartery has been cut out with the tumour; and that small veinous structure were present in the surrounding soft tissue.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Professor Poon further agreed that the defendant managed to excise the tumour without substantial blood loss, in fact there was minimalblood loss which showed that the tumour was not too adherent to the arterial wall.  He further agreed that this was a SchamblingType 1 tumour, and by its definition being such, can be excised without much difficulty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> Given all the above, Professor Poon conceded that not to order a Doppler ultrasound in the present case was not falling below thestandard of a reasonable practitioner.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(iv)  Breach <i>of oral representation</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> This criticism of the defendant cannot hold good in the light of the admission by the plaintiffâs husband in his oral evidencethat the defendant did tell him and the plaintiff that the defendant would excise the whole neck mass and that what was stated inparagraph 6 of his witness statement is incorrect.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(v)  Frozen section</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> As already indicated, this particular of negligence has been withdrawn by counsel for the plaintiff in his closing submission inthe light of the defendantâs expert evidence in this case coming from Dr Ah Chong and Dr Lam as well as the concession made byProfessor Poon under cross-examination that not to order frozen section was not sub-standard practice on the part of the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(vi) â (ix) Prolonged surgery manipulation</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> These four items of particulars of negligence can be dealt with together as they relate to the same aspect, namely that the defendantfailed to appreciate the risk of damage or injury to the carotid artery in the neck when carrying out the operation and which resultedin occlusion of the artery causing thrombosis.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> There is no dispute that the defendant, as a general surgeon, was competent to perform this operation of excising the left neck mass.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> The defendant gave evidence of the care taken by him in proceeding with the operation.  That evidence of the defendant was corroboratedby the unchallenged evidence of the anaesthetist, Dr Chan who stated :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThis was a straightforward neck mass excision operation.  [The defendant] performed his operation slowly, carefully, and meticulously. I had a good view of the operation site.  I did not see him applying any vascular clamps to the neck structures.  He only ligatedsuperficial blood vessels of the skin.  I did not see him applying any stitches or haemostatic clips to the structures in the regionof the carotid sheath or to any of the deep structures.  When he eventually removed the neck mass, he showed it to me. I could seethat it was a vascular lump.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> The contemporaneous Anesthetic Record kept by Dr Chan further supported the fact that there was no haemodynamic disturbance duringthe operation.  If there had been any abnormal handling or manipulation of the Carotid Artery, there would have been remarkable changesin the blood pressure during the operation.  Professor Poon conceded in cross-examination that there was no such changes in the bloodpressure during the operation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> During the two hours taken for removing the entire mass, the fact that no more than 20 ml blood loss, the histology showing ânoartery attachedâ and âwell circumscribedâ in respect of the mass further supported the defendantâs evidence that the operationwas smooth and there was no excessive manipulation of the Carotid Artery.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> Given all the above factors, Professor Poon accepted in cross-examination that he had no criticism of the defendant in respect ofthe intra-operative care.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(x) â (xii) Post-operative care</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> The post-operative care complained by the plaintiff can be dealt with together despite it having been pleaded as three distinct particulars.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> In this respect, Dr Walter King, the other expert called by the plaintiff, had stated in a medical report prepared by him and dated26<sup> </sup>April 2004 that the post surgery care received by the plaintiff was âappropriate and sufficientâ and further that he (Dr King)agreed with Dr Ah Chong Ah Kian, the defendantâs expert, that the plaintiffâs post-operative care was adequate.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> In the Summary at the end of Dr Kingâs expert report, it was stated as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe [plaintiff] has an uncommon tumour that requires a complex operation for removal.  Additional preoperative assessment withcomputerized imaging could better prepare the surgeon in the area of surgical planning and counseling of the [plaintiff] in regardto the risk of the procedure.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>       <p class="quote">When operating on a suspected carotid body tumour, good exposure and vascular control of the carotid arteries may help minimize inadvertentinjury to the carotid artery.  It is possible that when all precautions have been undertaken by an experienced head and neck surgeon,the risks of stroke, although small, cannot be entirely eliminated.  Under the circumstances, the plaintiff will benefit from continuingbasic medical care and support designed to maximize her recovery from her unfortunate cerebral vascular accident (stroke).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> In the light of what was contained in his expert report, the defendant was prepared to agree to that report of Dr King being adducedinto evidence without the need for Dr King to give oral evidence in court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> However, despite such offer from the defendant, counsel for the plaintiff still insisted on calling Dr King to give oral evidencein court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> Towards the end of his evidence in chief, it became quite clear that Dr King maintained the opinion expressed by him in his reportthat the post operative care given to the plaintiff in this case was sufficient and adequate.  He also agreed with the opinion ofDr Ah Chong that the defendantâs request for routine post-operative monitoring was reasonable given that the operation was relativelystraightforward.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> Dr King went on to elaborate that gauged against the standard adopted by himself when performing neck surgeries, whether it be athyroid surgery or straightforward simple carotid body tumour he had not routinely sent his patients to intensive care nor had heordered specific more intensive post-operative monitoring.  Therefore gauged by his own standard, he honestly had to agree that thepost-surgery care received by the plaintiff was appropriate and sufficient.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> He qualified that by saying that if there were signs and warning signals that something amiss were happening, then of course thelevel of monitoring could be increased.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> Having stated that qualification, he then went on to say that his opinion that the post-operative care given in this case was appropriateand sufficient was made with the facts of this case (as known to him) in mind.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> One further matter stated by Dr King in his oral evidence given in court was that the surgeon who performs the operation would bethe best person and in the best position to decide whether more intensive post operation monitoring of the patient should be necessaryand in the present case, if there were more firm signs observed from the plaintiff it is possible that earlier detection of the strokecould be made.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> There was no cross-examination of Dr King by the plaintiffâs counsel.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Conclusion on issue of liability</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> It is at once apparent from the above, especially in view of the concessions made by the plaintiffâs two experts, Professor Poonand Dr King, that there can be no question but that there was no sub-standard practice on the part of the defendant, whether duringthe pre-surgery investigation, during the surgery itself or at the post-operative care stage.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> In the light of those concessions made by the plaintiffâs experts, it is not even necessary for me to go into any detail the reportsor the evidence given by the defendantâs experts, Dr Ah Chong Ah Kian and Dr Lam King Hing suffice it to say that they were alsoof the opinion that there was no sub-standard practice on the part of the defendant in his treatment, management as well as aftercare of the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> Perhaps this would be as good a time as any for me to remind legal practitioners particularly those handling medical negligence casesthat the proper criteria and applicable standard of care for medical negligence is as set out in the words of McNair J in the caseof <i>Bolam v. Friern Hospital Management Committee</i>.  In order to satisfy the duty in tort, the standard of care and skill to be attained is that of the ordinary competent medical practitioner,exercising an ordinary degree of professional skill.  Although the standard is a high one, a medical practitioner charged with negligencecan clear himself if he shows that he acted in accordance with general and approved practice.  A medical practitioner :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦is not guilty of negligence if he has acted in accordance with practice accepted as proper by a reasonable body of medical menskilled in that particular artâ¦.merely because there was a body of opinion who would take a contrary view.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> In the present case, there was not even a different body of opinion who took a contrary view to what was done by the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> However, there are instances in Professor Poonâs evidence which suggest that he was wholly oblivious of the criteria and standardof care applicable in a medical negligence case as stated above when he said in cross-examination the following :</p>    <blockquote>         <p class="quote">âWhen we are examining a case for any routine audit, we always look at the scenarios and look at areas where we could improve toavoid the complication happening again if there was a fresh case.  So this is â I am applying a similar principle to this.  Iâmnot particularly focusing on justifying my â what you suggest to justify more intensive post-operative monitoring.  Iâm justâ in here, Iâm focusing on seeing what is â what could be avoidable.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">And further on :</p>    <blockquote>		<table border="0" width="85%">			<tr>				<td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>				<td width="5%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">Q. </td>				<td width="87%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">Yes.  				To apply that to this case, you have no criticism, as you have 				confirmed, about the intra-operative care.
