The plaintiffdeveloped a wide range of software programmes including operating systems and application programmes to perform computer functionssuch as word processing, statistic presentation and document artwork. The plaintiff owns copyright in a wide range computer softwareprogrammes. For the purpose of the present assessment, the relevant software programmes are: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) Office 95 Standard (English Edition);</p>        <p>(ii) Office 95 Standard (Traditional Chinese Language Edition);</p>        <p>(iii) Office 97 Professional (Traditional Chinese Language Edition);</p>        <p>(iv) Windows 95 (ENG OEM); and</p>        <p>(v) Windows 95 (Traditional Chinese Language Edition) (OEM).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> By registration the plaintiff acquired the trademark in relation to the use of the words "Microsoft", "Windows" and "Window NT" inthe computer software industry.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> According to the plaintiff, use of the Microsoft products are available to the market generally through one of the 3 modes:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) The acquisition of the "<em>Full Packaged Product</em>" through ordinary retail businesses where the user is supplied with a boxed version of the product.

"OEM" products are delivered in shrink-wrapped "OEM Packages"to the customers along with the CPU they purchase. An OEM package consists of (a) a copy of the Microsoft programme on a magneticdisc or on a CD-ROM; (b) instruction and reference manuals; (c) a certificate of authenticity, a licence agreement, a registrationcard; and (d) other supporting materials.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The only authorized "OEM" products distributors of the plaintiff in Hong Kong are ACA Pacific Technology (H.K.) Ltd and Tech Pacific(H.K.) Ltd. The authorized distributors reported regularly to Microsoft Hong Kong Ltd, a subsidiary company of the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> In 1996 Microsoft H.K. Limited developed a "Microsoft Authorized Retailer" programme (called "MAR" for short) for the purpose ofsupplying promotional items to valued system builders. To become a member the system builder has to meet a minimum sales target withina year. In return the plaintiff would recommend their consumers to buy from these programme members. The programme members are listedon the plaintiff's web page for consumers' reference.

The promotional leaflets distributed by the defendant stated that Pentium II 300 unitswould be sold at HK$8,380 together with other facilities and 2 complimentary software programmes: (i) Microsoft Window 95 (Chineseversion); and (ii) Office 97 including Word 97, Excel 97 and Power Point 97 self learning manual and CD.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Investigators engaged by the plaintiff were sent to the outlet shops of the defendant on the following visits:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) On 3 August 1998 a Mr. Ross visited one of the defendant's outlet at Shop 171, UG/F, <em>298 Computer Zone</em> at 298 Hennessy Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong and bought a Pentium II 266 megahertz computer for the price of HK$6770. He took deliveryof the computer from the shop on 10 August 1988 and was given a shrink-wrapped software package for Window 95 together with an operationmanual and CD-ROM for Office 97 (Word 97 Excel 97 Powerpoint 97).</p>        <p>Ms. Poh, staff of the plaintiff, subsequently examined the computer and found Microsoft Window 95 (English Edition) and MicrosoftOffice for Window 95 Standard Software (English Edition) to have been installed onto the hard disc of the computer.</p>        <p>Ms. Poh was of the opinion that the pre-installed Microsoft Window 95 (English Edition) was a licensed version as the purchaser wassupplied with a proper OEM package and the Product Identification Code ("PIC" for short) on the certificate of authenticity of OEMpackage received by Mr. Ross corresponded with the PIC code displayed on the computer monitor.</p>        <p>According to Ms. Poh the pre-installed Microsoft Office for window 95 standard software (English Edition) in the computer acquiredby Mr. Ross was an unlicensed version of the plaintiff's software programme since Microsoft Office for Window 95 was only availableas a full packaged product which should be contained in a packaged box of materials containing a certificate of authenticity, anend user license agreement and a registration card. The Microsoft Office for Window 95 was not available as an OEM product. Furtherthe retail price of the full packaged Office 95 was HK$3,199 and the basic costs of the computer hardware was about HK$6000 in 1998.Hence a computer pre-loaded with a Microsoft Office 95 programme could not possibly be sold for HK$6770. The Office programme manualsupplied to Mr. Ross was an Able Computer handbook for use of the Office 97 programme.</p>        <p>(ii) On 4 August 1998 a Mr. Ip visited the defendant's 2nd outlet shop at Shop 121, 1/F, <em>Mongkok Computer Centre</em>, 8 Nelson Street, Kowloon and bought a Pentium II 300 megahertz computer for HK$6,500. He took delivery of the computer from theshop on 6 August 1998 and was given a shrink-wrapped Window 95 (Traditional Chinese) software package.</p>        <p>Ms. Doris Yuen examined the computer and found it to have been pre-loaded with Microsoft Window 95 (Traditional Chinese Edition) andMicrosoft Office 97 Professional (Traditional Chinese Edition) and the PIC code of 58920-467-0023324-55135.</p>        <p>Ms. Yuen found the Microsoft Window 95 (Traditional Chinese Edition) installed in the computer to be a licensed version of softwareas the "PIC" code 09698-OEM-0031235-65082 on the certificate of authenticity of the OEM package supplied to Mr. Ip matched the "PIC"code displayed on the screen of the computer.</p>        <p>Ms. Yuen formed the view that Microsoft Office 97 Professional (Traditional Chinese Edition) installed on the computer hard disc wasunlicensed as Microsoft Office 97 Professional was only available as a full packaged product as opposed to an "OEM" product. Furtherthe "PIC" code for the Microsoft Office 97 Professional (Traditional Chinese Edition) displayed on the screen was 58920-467-0023324-55135which was exactly the same as the "PIC" code found on the other computers acquired by the investigators in the Golden Computer Centreshop and the Golden Centre shop of the defendant.</p>        <p>There was a slight discrepancy of the affidavit evidence of Mr. Ip and Ms Yuen. Ip made no mention of the supply of Able operationmanual and the CD-ROM for Office 97 while Ms. Yuen sworn to the fact that she had been supplied with the Able operation manual anda CD-ROM for Office 97 by Mr. Ip. According to Ms. Yuen the manual and the CD-ROM were subsequently misplaced by the plaintiff andcould not made available for inspection in court.</p>        <p>(iii) On 14 August 1998 the same Mr. Ip visited the 3rd outlet shop of the defendant at Shop 109, 1/F, <em>Golden Shopping Centre</em>, 94-A Yen Chow Street, Shamshuipo, Kowloon and bought a Pentium II 300 megahertz computer for HK$7,250. Mr. Ip took delivery of thecomputer on 19 August at Shop 1 &amp; 2, 1/F, Golden Centre at 94 Yen Chow Street, Shamshuipo and was provided with a shrink-wrappedwindow 95 software package.</p>        <p>The computer was examined by Ms. Poh who found the computer to have been pre-loaded with Microsoft Windows 95 (Traditional ChineseEdition) and Microsoft Office 97 Professional (Traditional Chinese Edition).</p>        <p>Ms. Poh found the PIC number of the certificate of authenticity, 06998-OEM-0030641-30594, of the Microsoft Window 95 OEM package receivedby Mr. Ip differed from PIC number 31097-OEM-002661-37119 displayed on the screen of the monitor.</p>        <p>In relation to the Microsoft Office 97 Professional software Ms. Poh was of the opinion that the software installed on the computerwas unlicensed. She formed her opinion on the basis that Microsoft Office 97 professional programme was only available as a fullpackaged product. Further the PIC code 58920-467-0023324-55135 found on the screen was the same as the PIC codes found on the computersbought in the Mongkok Computer Centre shop and the Golden Centre shop of the defendant.</p>        <p>(iv) On 14 August 1998 a Ms. Wong visited the defendant's 4th shop at Shop 1 &amp; 2 at 1/F of <em>Golden Centre</em> at 94 Yen Chow Street, Shamshipo, Kowloon bought a Pentium II 300 megahertz computer for HK$6,770. Ms. Wong took delivery of thecomputer on 19 August and was given an operation manual and a CD-ROM for Office 97 (Word 97 Excel 97 Powerpoint 97).</p>        <p>The computer was examined by Ms. Poh who found the hard disc of the computer to have been pre-loaded with Microsoft Windows 95 (TraditionalChinese Edition) and Microsoft Office 97 Professional (Traditional Chinese Edition).</p>        <p>As Ms. Wong was not supplied with an OEM package in respect of the use of the Microsoft Window 95 programme, Ms. Poh believed theMicrosoft Window 95 programme installed in the computer was possibly an unlicensed copy of software.</p>        <p>In relation to the Microsoft Office 97 Professional software, Ms. Poh was of the opinion that it was an unlicensed software as theOffice 97 programme was only available as a full package product as opposed to an OEM product. Besides, the computer showed the PICcode of the software programme to be 58920-467-0023324-55135 which was the same as the computers bought by the investigation agentMr. Ip in the other shops of the defendant.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Evidence from Former employees of the Defendant</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Ms. Chiu, the marketing manager of the defendant company between February 1994 and July 1998, testified on a subpoena taken out againsther by the plaintiff. She confirmed the majority of the computers sold by the defendant were pre-loaded with unlicensed softwareprogrammes of the plaintiff. In her estimate only 10% or less of the computers sold by the defendant were installed with licensedsoftware programmes. The sale of the unauthorized software lasted throughout Ms Chiu's employment with the defendant. In Ms. Chiu'srecollection the defendant sold about 1,500 - 2,000 computers per year for retail business and roughly double the volume for wholesalebusiness. In Ms. Chiu's estimate about 80% - 90% of those computers were sold with unlicensed software.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Mr. Tsui, another former employee of the defendant also confirmed the defendant to have sold computers with pre-installed unlicensedsoftware programmes.</p>    <p class="heading">Damages</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> There are few misgivings about the evidence collected by the investigators such as the missing manual. The fact that a purchaserhas been supplied with an OEM package with a PIC code different from the pre-installed programme in the computer could not rule outthe possibility of packaging mistake. The supply of a computer software without an accompanying OEM package is again opened to interpretations.Despite of the misgivings, by and large, with the evidence available from the investigators and the ex-employees of the defendant,the inevitable conclusion to draw was the defendant did pre-load its computers with unlicensed copies of software programmes to cutcosts and to reduce the sale price so as to entice its customers for a greater retailer business.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The major difficulty faced by this court in assessing the damages sustained by the plaintiff is the scarcity of original materialsto delineate the scope of infringement with precision. Hence the present assessment is a rough estimation arrived at by weighingthe available information on a balance of probability.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The plaintiff does not seek to quantify its trademark infringement damages beyond what would be reflected in its copyright infringementcompensation. The present assessment only deals with the copyright infringement compensation.</p>    <p class="heading">Damages for copyright infringement</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The plaintiff is seeking s.107 damages as well as additional damages under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.108(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528" class="autolink_findacts">Copyright Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528">Cap 528</a>.</p>    <p class="heading">The Law</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> In dealing with the assessment of copyright infringement, Mr. Justice Litton, P.J. said in <strong>Oriental Press Group</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20HKLRD%20976" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 HKLRD 976</a> at page 980: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Damages under this head are compensatory: the award is intended to put the injured party in the same position as if the wrong hadnot occurred.

In adopting Lord Wilberforce's approach in <strong>General Tire</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20RPC%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] RPC 197</a> Lord Cooke approved the various yardsticks in ascertaining damages for copyright infringement, in line with patent cases: (1) theloss of profitable sales by a manufacturing patentee; (2) the loss of royalties by a patentee where there is an established royaltyrate; or (3) the loss of notional royalties where there is no such established rate; i.e. what would have been agreed between a willinglicensor and a willing licensee, in other words, the fair market value.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In Australia the matter was viewed with diversified opinions. In <strong>Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2094%20ALR%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 94 ALR 472</a> Wilcox J refused to apply the loss of licence fees approach on the ground that had the licence fees been charged for all the productssold, the sale volume was unlikely to reach the same level were the users required to pay the full licence fees. Further in Mr. JusticeWilcox's view the unauthorized reproduction might increase the residual value of a copyright since the greater use of the productby the public would enhance the ultimate demand.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> On the other hand in the subsequent decision of <strong>Microsoft Corporation</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2038%20IPR%20643" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 38 IPR 643</a> the Federal Court of Sydney accepted the license fees approach as the proper approach for the calculation of compensatory damages.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The defendant in the present proceeding was a MOSP member of the plaintiff. In the MOSP agreement, the defendant agrees " not tostock or sell any pirated, counterfeit, parallel imported or unbundled products at any time" and would "only sell legitimate productspurchased from distributors authorized by Microsoft to distribute in Hong Kong". To honour the terms of the MOSP agreement the defendantshould pay the plaintiff the licence fees for all the software programmes he re-sold to the consumers. Though the arguments acceptedby Mr. Justice Wilcox still have great influence over the need of caution to award damages purely on the loss of licence fees calculation,yet in the present fact situation, falling short of evidence to show the extent of drop in demand when licensed products were sold,I accept the licence fees approach to be the appropriate measure for assessment.</p>    <p class="heading">Damages for the period from April 1997 to October 1998</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Pursuant to the court's order for discovery, the defendant provided the plaintiff with 56,000 invoices for a period of 19 monthsbetween April 1997 and October 1998 for the plaintiff's inspection. The invoices showed the licence acquired by the defendant fromthe plaintiff and the number of CPUs sold by the defendant. During the inspection, the plaintiff caused a summary to be preparedin respect of the invoices produced by the defendant for the period from April 1997 to October 1998.

From the sample computers bought by theinvestigating agents, all of the computers supplied were pre-installed with unlicensed version of the Microsoft Office software.A user is unable to use the Microsoft Office unless the computer has been loaded with an operating system such as the Microsoft Window.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> According to the invoices examined by the plaintiff, the defendant sold 5,084 sets of computer (151 + 42 + 638 + 5 + 4 + 4244) fromApril 1997 to October 1998. In the accounting books of the plaintiff the defendant has bought a total of 1960 sets of Window 95 programmes(i.e. 158 sets of English Window 95 and 1,802 sets of Chinese Window 95). According to the defendant's invoices the defendant hasbought 160 sets of other Microsoft operating systems including 151 sets of Dos-6.22, 5 sets of Windows 3.11 and 4 sets of WindowNT. The number of computers sold by the defendant, on the face of the invoices, not supported by any operating systems are 2964 sets(i.e., 5,084 - 1,960 - 160). I accept it is highly likely that all the computers sold were pre-loaded with the operating programmeWindow 95. Each unit of Window 95 cost HK$690 in 1997/1998. The licence fees the plaintiff would be entitled to receive from thedefendant would be HK$2,045,160 (HK$690 x 2,964) in respect of the supply of the Window 95 programme.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The defendant has pre-loaded all the 4 sample sales with Microsoft Office programme. Its promotional pamphlets stated that MicrosoftOffice would be supplied free of charge. Coupled with the defendant's ex-employee's verbal testimony to confirm extensive unlicensedpre-loading, it is reasonable to accept the defendant to have installed all its computers with the Microsoft Office programmes beforeeffecting retail sale. Of the 5,084 computers only 160 of them were installed with an operating system other than Window 95. Recordsfrom the OEM distributors of the plaintiff showed that the defendant has only bought 26 units of the Office software during the saidperiod. Hence the computer units being installed with Microsoft Office 95 or 97 would be 4,898 (5,084 - 160 - 26). The unit priceof the Microsoft Office 95 was HK$3,199 while the unit price for Microsoft Office 97 was HK$ 4,699. Adopting the mean purchase priceof Office 95 and Office 97 for calculation, the loss of licence fees for the unlicensed supply of the Microsoft Office programmewould be HK$19,342,202 [1/2 (HK$ 3,199 + HK$4,699) $ x 4,898].</p>    <p class="heading">Damages for the period from April 1996 to March 1997</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> There was no direct information about the volume of sales of the defendant nor the scope of its infringing activities, save and exceptthe evidence of Madam Chiu who testified that the defendant's infringing merchandise was about 80% - 90% of the defendant's tradevolume.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The balance sheets of the defendant showed the trading volume of the defendant to be HK$189,613,242 in the year of 1996, HK$186,483,855in the year of 1997, and HK$167,476,457 in the year of 1998. From the financial statements of the defendant, it could be seen thatthe trading volume of the defendant maintained at roughly the same range for the years of 1996, 1997 and 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> From the records of the OEM distributors, the operating system software units acquired by the defendant were 1,354 in 1995; 1,344in 1996 and 1,491 in 1997. Hence the number of purchase of the plaintiff's operating systems by the defendant maintained at roughlythe same level for all 3 years from 1995 to 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> I make calculation of the plaintiff's damages for the period of April 1996 to March 1997 by reference to the same trading patternof the defendant reflected in the invoices disclosed for period between April 1997 and October 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Hence the plaintiff's loss of licence fees in respect of the unauthorized installation of Window 95 for April 1996 to March 1997would be HK$1,291,680 [(2,964 computers x 12 months/19 months) x HK$690]. Correspondingly the plaintiff's loss of licence fees inrespect of the unauthorized installation of Office 95 for the period between April 1996 and March 1997 would be HK$9,896,022 [(4,898computers x 12 months/19 months) x HK$3,199].</p>    <p class="heading">Damages for the period from April 1995 to March 1996</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> As there were no financial statements to show the volume of sales of the defendant, I do not propose to form an assessment in respectof the plaintiff's likely damage for this period.</p>    <p class="heading">Additional damage</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> S.108(2) <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528" class="autolink_findacts">Copyright Ordinance</a> provides that the court may award additional damages in case of copyright infringement having regard to the flagrancy of the infringement,benefits accrued to the defendant by reason of the infringement, completeness and accuracy of the defendant's business accounts andrecords.</p>    <p class="heading">The Law</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> In <strong>Ravenscroft v Herbert</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20RPC%20193" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] R.P.C. 193 (Ch)</a> at page 208 Mr. Justice Brightman said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" ...... The plaintiff claims to be entitled to additional damages under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17(3)</a> of the Act of 1956. That is a matter which I am entitled to leave to the enquiry, but for the convenience of the parties I intendto decide the point now. To entitle the plaintiff to such additional damages it must be established that effective relief would nototherwise be available to the plaintiff giving regard to the flagrancy of the infringement, any benefit shown to have accrued tothe defendants by reason of the infringement, and other material considerations. Flagrancy in my view implies the existence of scandalousconduct, deceit and such like; it includes deliberate and calculated copyright infringements. There is some guidance to be obtainedfrom the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, <em>Nichols Advanced Vehicle Systems v Rees</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20RPC%20127" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] R.P.C. 127</a>, and also from a New Zealand case, <em>International Credit Control Limited v Axelton</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%201%20NZLR%20695" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] 1 NZLR 695</a> at 705."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> In the New Zealand Court of Appeal decision of <strong>Wellington Newspapers v Dealers Guide</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%204%20IPR%20417" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 4 IPR 417</a> at pages 421 &amp; 422: McMullin J said,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...... The ordinary dictionary meaning of flagrant is 'glaring, scandalous, or outrageous". Flagrancy was described by BrightmanJ in <em>Ravenscroft v Herbert</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20RPC%20193" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] RPC 193</a> at 208 as 'Flagrancy in my view implies the existence of scandalous conduct, deceit and such like; it includes deliberate and calculatedcopyright infringement.'</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">What is flagrant must of course be a question of fact and degree to be decided against the background of relevant facts.</p>        <p class="quote">......</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The additional damages referred to in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.24(3)</a> are to be awarded where the court is satisfied that the remedies otherwise provided by the section for an action brought under itdo not provide effective relief. This would suggest that there may be some damage or loss suffered by a plaintiff which compensatorydamages, injunction, the taking of accounts or other remedy would not assuage. It is difficult to see what is contemplated by theadditional damage unless it is something in the nature of punishment to the defendant for the hurt done to the plaintiff which theconventional remedies would not provide. How otherwise would the flagrancy of the infringement be relevant? This is indeed how theequivalent English subsection has been interpreted. In <em>Ravenscroft v Herber</em>t Brightman, J said at p.208 'To entitle the plaintiff to such additional damages it must be established that effective relief wouldnot otherwise be available to the plaintiff giving regard to the flagrancy of the infringement, any benefit shown to have accruedto the defendant by reason of the infringement, and other material considerations.'</p>        <p class="quote">......</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">But while the power to award additional damages under the Act depends on the terms of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.24(3)</a>, the considerations which are relevant to an award of exemplary damages in an action in tort, are of equal application; <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.24(3)</a> expresses the same notions as are expressed by exemplary or punitive damages as discussed in <em>Cassell v Broome</em> [1972] AC1027 and applied by this court in <em>Taylor v Beere</em> [1982] 1 NZLR81; <em>Donselaar v Donselaar</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20NZLR%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 NZLR 97......"</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The defendant was a member of the MOSP. It is fully aware of its obligations under the MOSP agreement to sell only licensed softwareprogrammes. The flagrancy of the defendant's breach is culminated by the following factors:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) the defendant acted in blatant breach of its MOSP obligations;</p>        <p>(b) the infringing activities of the defendant, according to its ex-employee, has been extensive. According to Ms. Chui about 80%- 90% of the defendant's traded commodities were pre-loaded with unlicensed copies of software;</p>        <p>(c) the extensive infringement of the defendant was illustrated by the fact that the defendant has printed its own Able Computer Office97 handbooks which contained substantial extracts from the plaintiff's operation manual and were distributed to the investigatorbuyers during the sample sales in 1997;</p>        <p>(d) the infringing acts were carried out over a long period of time from 1994 to 1998; and</p>        <p>(e) the lack of documentation which deprived the plaintiff a chance to seek an account of the profits made by the defendant in respectof its infringing activities prior to April 1996.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Hence it is proper for additional damages to be awarded.
