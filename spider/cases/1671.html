1st defendant, Madam Zhang at the time of the Initial Public Offerof shares in China Telecom in late 1997. The plaintiff was a licensed moneylender and a wholly owned subsidiary of China MerchantsBank ("CMB"). Madam Zhang was the director and principal shareholder of Fortune Bell Venture Ltd ("Fortune Bell"), which had heldan account with the 3rd defendant. She approached the plaintiff on behalf of Fortune Bell for a loan for the purchase of China Telecomshares in the IPO.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> By a Facility Letter dated 9 October 1997 the plaintiff provided to Fortune Bell loan facilities of up to $200,000,000 for the purposeof subscribing to the shares. By the Facility Letter, Fortune Bell was obliged to repay the loan in full one month after the firstdrawdown. Madam Zhang was to provide a guarantee of Fortune Bell's obligations to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Two drawdowns were made, one of $130,000,000.00 on 9 October 1997, and one on 13 October 1997. The funds were paid into Fortune Bell'ssecurities account ("the Account") with the 3rd defendant. However the loan was not repaid, or not repaid in full; and the plaintiffclaimed against Madam Zhang on a dishonoured cheque for $38,434,600. Part judgment was obtained but on 26 January 1999 Suffiad Jallowed an appeal against the Master's judgment and gave Madam Zhang unconditional leave to defend.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Thereafter on 4 October 1999 the plaintiff amended its pleadings to claim against Madam Zhang, both as guarantor and on the dishonouredcheque and also against the 2nd and 3rd defendants. We are here only concerned with the 3rd defendant. The claim is for $129,210,171.11,being a principal sum of $109,000,000.00 plus interest up to 11 October 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The plaintiff's case against the 3rd defendant is that as security for the loan it required control of the Account, which would holdthe money advanced and the shares subscribed, and that at a meeting on 9 October 1997 at the offices of the 3rd defendant, it wasagreed between officers of and solicitors for the plaintiff, Madam Zhang and her solicitor and an officer of the 3rd defendant, aMr Edward Tam, that such control would be achieved by appointing the plaintiff's officer, Madam Wang Dawei, as the sole signatoryof the account. The plaintiff says that a standard form of mandate was filled in and signed by Madam Zhang as sole signatory to theaccount, and that Mr Tam confirmed that only Madam Wang would be able to operate the Account. Further, the 3rd defendant at thatmeeting provided, on the request of the plaintiff's officer, Mr Li, a computer print-out of the status of the Account.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The loan was then made in two tranches as indicated above. However, it was later found that Madam Wang was not the sole signatoryof the Account, and that other transactions had been made which were not authorised by her, which diminished the value of the assetsin the Account. Particulars are given of two debits totalling $100,000,000.00 between 9 and 17 October 1997, the diversion of $25,000,000.00out of the second drawdown of $70,000.00, and the purchase and sale of various stocks and securities not authorised by Madam Wang.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The plaintiff also pleads that if the sums totalling $100,000,000.00 were removed from the Account prior to the pleaded oral agreementand before Madam Wang became the sole signatory, the 3rd defendant either deliberately or negligently misrepresented the status ofthe Account in the computer print-out on 9 October 1997. If those sums were removed after the pleaded oral agreement and Madam Wangbecame the sole signatory, the 3rd defendant either deliberately or negligently misrepresented that there were no outstanding unexecutedinstructions which would materially change the status of the Account. If there existed on 9 October 1997 some other mandate on whichthe 3rd defendant was obliged to act in relation to the Account after Madam Wang signed the mandate as sole signatory, the 3rd defendantdeliberately or negligently misrepresented to the plaintiff and its solicitors that Madam Wang was the only person authorised tooperate the accounts. Finally the plaintiff says that in all the circumstances the 3rd defendant owed the plaintiff a fiduciary dutywhich prohibited it from operating the Account otherwise than in accordance with the instructions of the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiff accordingly claims against the 3rd defendant for :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(1)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">breach of the oral agreement;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(2)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">deliberate or negligent misstatement of the true status and contents of the Account in the computer print-out;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(3)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">deliberate or negligent misstatement that Madam Wang was the only person authorised to operate and give instructions in relation tothe Account; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(4)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">breach of fiduciary duty.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The 3rd defendant admits that a meeting was held at its offices on 9 October 1997, but denies that any oral agreement to which itwas a party was reached. It is admitted that Madam Zhang on behalf of Fortune Bell signed a form giving Madam Wang authority to operatethe Account, but averred that she only became one of the authorised signatories along with Madam Zhang and one other person who werealready authorised. The 3rd defendant says that it did in fact act on the instructions of Madam Zhang subsequently in making thetransfers and share dealings but denies the particularised breach of agreement, the making of misstatements whether deliberate ornegligent or breach of fiduciary duty.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> It will be necessary to set out in detail what the parties are seeking in the various summonses because that has changed in the courseof the hearing which was adjourned part-heard. The 3rd defendant obtained leave for amendment of its proposed amendments, and theplaintiff abandoned its objections to some of the Interrogatories. The plaintiff before the hearing and during the adjournment gavesome further discovery and produced some of the documents sought.</p>    <p class="heading">The Amendment Summons</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The 3rd defendant seeks to make various minor amendments which are not in dispute and also to add a paragraph 32 to its defence.I set out this paragraph in full because counsel amended it in the course of the hearing. It now reads as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"32.

It is also argued thatsub-paragraphs (e) and (f) should be further amended to make it clear that they only relate to the claims for negligent misrepresentationand breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff also says that insofar as the amendments go to causation, the concept of causation cannotbe divorced from that of contributory negligence, so that if arguments on causation would break down for a particular matter, thatmatter cannot be raised under paragraph 32.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> As to sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) and (l), it is argued that the particulars are inadequate in that they do not state what would havehappened if the plaintiff had taken the steps which the 3rd defendant says the plaintiff should have taken. In any event these stepswould only affect the decision whether or not to lend. Sole control of the Account would have given the plaintiff a complete security,even if the loan was made imprudently, which is not admitted. As to the rest of the sub-paragraphs it is argued, as I understandit, that if there was an agreement that only Madam Wang could operate the account, the steps therein particularised would have beenunnecessary.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The 3rd defendant accepts as it must that contributory negligence is not a defence in contract or in a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation.However, it is argued that since it is a defence to the other claims the amendments should be allowed and further that the amendmentsare relevant to causation for the purposes of the contract and fraud claims as well as to contributory negligence in respect of theother claims.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Leave to amend is discretionary but bona fide amendments should be allowed for the purpose of determining the real question betweenthe parties.

Contributory negligence is not a defence to the breach of a strict contractualduty at common law. The provisions of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 do not apply to give rise to apportionmentin breach of contract because they only apply to fault on a plaintiff's part which would give rise to the defence at common law.See <strong>Standard Chartered Bank v. Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (Nos. 2 &amp; 4)</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20AC%20959" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 AC 959 (HL)</a>; <strong>Forsikringsaktieselskabet Vesta v.

However where the defendant's liability in contract is the same as his liability in the tort of negligence independentlyof the existence of any contract, it seems that the Act does apply; <em>per</em> Hobhouse J in <strong>Forsikringsaktieselskabet Vesta</strong> at 508. The position is the same under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23" class="autolink_findacts">Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap.32</a>. Further, contributory negligence is not a defence to fraudulent misrepresentation; see <strong>Standard Chartered Bank</strong> above. Whether it applies to breach of fiduciary duty was not argued at any length but I expect it would apply if the breach werenegligent rather than deliberate.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> I am not clear about the basis on which the plaintiff says that the 3rd defendant owed it a contractual duty. The 3rd defendant wasFortune Bell's broker. It would be under a contractual duty to follow the instructions of Fortune Bell given by or through MadamZhang. It is pleaded that the 3rd defendant had an interest in seeing that the facilities were provided to the borrower since itwas to buy the shares as Fortune Bell's broker but whether that would provide the necessary consideration between the plaintiff andthe 3rd defendant, given that commission would be payable to under its brokerage contract with Fortune Bell, I do not know, nor wasit argued. It may be possible for the trial judge to find negligent misrepresentation but no contract.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> I do not think that the plaintiff can simply argue that if Madam Wang had been given sole control of the Account, there would havebeen no loss. The question of causation must come in here. It appears that the proximate cause of the loss was Fortune Bell's failureto repay the loan. If a promise is proved, the question will arise whether Fortune Bell would have failed to repay anyway; or atleast, how much it would have paid, because if shares had been bought and had then fallen in value (as they apparently did) MadamWang's sole control might not have availed the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> In any event it seems to me that since the plaintiff is pleading negligent misrepresentation the 3rd defendant should be entitledto plead contributory negligence and the steps which it says the plaintiff should have taken, to protect its own interests. Thosesteps would, I think, include steps taken prior to lending such as due diligence. It must surely be open to the 3rd defendant toquestion whether the loan should have been made at all. I do not see that it would be necessary to specify that this defence onlyapplied to some but not all of the plaintiff's claims in law (which all seem to rely on the same facts); the trial judge will knowthat.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The plaintiff says that "due diligence" is inadequately particularised. Such an amendment should not be allowed following <strong>Perak Pioneer Ltd v. Carrian Holdings Ltd</strong>, CACV No.59 of 1985. The 3rd defendant argues that if particulars are inadequate better particulars can be sought and I can stillpermit the amendments in the exercise of my discretion. Due diligence is a factual question which the 3rd defendant should not bebarred from pursuing. I think this must be right. If further particulars are required they can be sought.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> I propose therefore to allow the amendments sought. There will be an order in terms of the 3rd defendant's summons, but with thedraft referred to amended as shown above. Since this ruling is to be handed down the costs order will be <em>nisi</em> but it is proper that the 3rd defendant which seeks the amendments should pay the costs.</p>    <p class="heading">The Discovery Summons</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The 3rd defendant seeks specific discovery, by affidavit, of the documents in the Schedule to the summons, as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"1.

The 3rd affirmation of Kwan Siu Ming, Joseph, filed on 24 September, deals with this. This effectively removesthe need for argument in respect of those paragraphs except on the question whether, as counsel for the 3rd defendant argues, thereshould be an affirmation to the effect that these are the only documents which are or have been in the plaintiff's possession, custodyor power.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The principles on specific discovery are clear and not in dispute and I do not need to set them out here.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> On paragraph 1 the 3rd defendant argues that the documents sought are relevant to the question whether the plaintiff suffered anyloss at all. Also, the precise funding arrangements between the CMB and the plaintiff are important given that the 1st defendant'scase is that there was no real loan at all. Counsel points to the fact that in the Order 14 proceedings between the plaintiff andthe 1st defendant, Suffiad J found this to be a triable issue.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The plaintiff argues that documents already discovered show, as does Madam Wang's statement, that the CMB borrowed the money fromthe Bank of America and repaid it. The plaintiff never sought to hide that it was a subsidiary of CMB. In particular reference ismade to accounting documents and correspondence showing repayment of the $70,000,000.00 on 12 December 1997 apparently by anothersubsidiary, Silverlink (Hong Kong) Finance Ltd.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> This, it seems to me is all very well. No doubt the money was borrowed from the Bank of America by the CMB and repaid by the CMBor a subsidiary but in no way do the documents discovered cast light on the accounting arrangements for these transactions. It isan obvious inference that there must have been some documented accounting arrangements; a large organisation will not keep trackof money shifted between accounts just by keeping the figures in someone's head. Such documents are obviously relevant to the questionwhether there was a real loan, or a dressed-up joint venture; obviously if it was the latter, this will make a very great differenceto the plaintiff's case against the 3rd defendant. So it seems to me that such documents prima facie exist and are or have been inthe possession, custody or power of the plaintiff; they are relevant under the <em>Peruvian Guano</em> principles; and the plaintiff cannot say that their discovery is not necessary for purposes of rule 8.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> So far as paragraphs 2(a), (b) and (d) are concerned, these stand or fall with the application for amendment. Since I allow the amendmentit follows that documents relating to the exercise of due diligence must be discoverable.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> So far as sub-paragraph (c) is concerned the plaintiff's evidence appears to be that the approval of the loan was agreed verballybetween Madam Wang and the president of CMB, Mr Wang Shizhen. This evidence appears in the 2nd affirmation of the plaintiff's solicitor.It seems unlikely that a large loan of this sort would be agreed "on the nod". One would expect meetings and deliberations and somesort of written record thereof. The 3rd defendant argues that even if the evidence is to be that there were no documentary recordsthis should be given in a proper affirmation by an officer of the plaintiff rather than at second hand by a solicitor. Reliance isplaced on the judgment of Yuen J (as she then was) in <strong>Tang Man Kit v. Hing Ping Timber Co. Ltd</strong>, HCA No.8000 of 1990 to the effect that an affidavit deposing to a list of documents should be sworn by a party personally. Withthis I respectfully agree. If there are no documents, an officer of the plaintiff should depose to it.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Paragraph 3 relates to the interview between Madam Wang and Mr Wang Shizhen covered in the affirmation of the latter. In Madam Wang'smost recent affirmations she says that Mr Wang has told her that he cannot remember what were the relevant files and accounts relatingto the transaction. He is unwilling to be involved further, and according to her, all relevant documents have been discovered. Thisis all very well but what she does not say, so far as I can see, is whether or not any written interview records exist. She wouldcertainly know if a record was kept of her interview with Mr Wang Shizhen. I think this needs to be covered in a further affirmation.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The plaintiff has now put forward various documents sought under paragraphs 4 to 7. The 4th and 5th affirmations of Madam Wang werefiled during the adjournment. The 3rd defendant complains that no reason has been given for late and piecemeal discovery, and arguesthat an affirmation is required to say whether or not discovery is now complete. The very fact that documents can be discovered inthe course of the hearing for discovery supports that.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> I think this must be right. What the 3rd defendant seeks in the summons is an affirmation stating whether it has or has had the documentssought and, if not, what efforts have been made to find those which it has not, and what became of those which it had but does nothave.

For the purposes of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 10</a>, production can only be ordered of a document referred to in pleadings, affidavits or witness statements.

It is suggested that, in case they have not, I makethe order, with liberty to apply. I do not see how this is going to dispose of the cause or matter or save costs.

In many casesthe objections to the interrogatories were founded on objections to the proposed amendments but since the amendments have been allowedthose objections fall away. I turn to those which remain.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Paragraph 1.1(b) and 1.2 : these seek to ascertain who made the fund transfer vouchers for the payments of $130,000,000.00 and $70,000,000.00 and who made a handwritten note on them. There are three signatures on them. Counsel for the plaintiff says, proper questionsabout these can be answered by the plaintiff's witnesses Wang, Li or Peng. Given the defence raised by the 1st defendant - whichthe 3rd defendant is obviously entitled to investigate - it seems to me necessary to know who was involved in authorising the makingof these payments. Investigation could be made with such person or persons. These interrogatories will stand.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Paragraphs 1.4 to 1.7 : these are relevant to questions of the true nature of the transaction, the plaintiff's relationship withthe 1st defendant and the plaintiff's conduct in making the loan. Any objections founded on the contention that the amendments shouldnot be made, or that questions of discovery have not been settled, no longer apply in view of my decisions on these points. Theseinterrogatories will also stand.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Paragraph 2.1 : This is relevant to the plaintiff's conduct in verifying the alleged representations of the 1st defendant particularlyas to the timing of the subscription to the shares. The 3rd defendant is entitled to obtain an admission. This will stand.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Paragraph 2.2(a) : This concerns a meeting at which it is said the loan was discussed. The 3rd defendant was not privy to the meeting,and it is argued that it is relevant for the 3rd defendant to know who attended it for the purpose of investigation and possiblesubpoena of witnesses, in particular on the question of whether the loan was a real one, or a hidden joint venture. However the plaintiffargues that Madam Wang in her statement adequately specifies who was present, and in any event this interrogatory is "fishing". Ithink this is right. The interrogatory is unnecessary and must be withdrawn.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> Paragraph 2.3 (b) and (c) : These concern discussions at a meeting of Messrs Li, Tan and Peng about the control of the Account andhow it was to be ensured. The 3rd defendant asks what (with precision to be relied on at trial) were the matters to be discussed.This is surely a matter of evidence. I do not see why the 3rd defendant needs to know it now, for the purposes of making inquiries,calling witnesses or the like. However so far as (c) goes there is, while there may be a question of privilege relating to the advice,if any of Mr Tan I accept the contention of counsel for the 3rd defendant that it is entitled to know whether advice was given andwhether privilege is claimed so that the claim and any possible waiver may be tested. The interrogatory at 2.3 (b) is withdrawn butthat at 2.3 (c) will stand.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Paragraph 2.5 : This has been superseded by events. Discovery has been given of Mr Tan's relevant documentation. This interrogatoryis to be withdrawn.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Paragraph 2.6 (a) and (c) : The first of these asks is Mr Tan Xiang Dong was present at the meeting referred to in paragraph 17 ofthe statement of Li Ming Tao. I would have thought that on any sensible reading of that and the previous paragraph, it must be inferredthat he was. So this question is not necessary. As to the second, what I have said in respect of the interrogatory at 2.3(b) applieshere. The result is that (a) is withdrawn and (c) will stand.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> Paragraph 2.7 and 2.8 : These go to matters covered by the amendments. Since those amendments have been allowed the interrogatorieswill stand.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> Paragraph 2.9 : The answer to (a) appears at paragraph 25 of Madam Wang's affirmation of 28 July 1998, so this question is unnecessaryand will be withdrawn. As to whether Mr Tan gave advice, and what advice he gave, what I have said in respect of the interrogatoryat 2.3(b) applies so these questions (at (b) and (c) will stand).</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> Paragraph 2.10 : The 3rd defendant asks to whom, at its own office, the draft Broker Letter and Acknowledgment were faxed. In itspleadings the plaintiff says that it does not know who received the communication. I do not understand why this interrogatory shouldbe necessary. If the documents were sent and received, either there was an addressee named or there was not; and if there was the3rd defendant must know who it was. This is to be withdrawn.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Paragraph 3.1 : This relates to whether certain matters were discussed with the lawyers - who, on the statements, were clearly present- at the 9 October meeting, whether the advised, and what advice they gave. Again it seems that the 3rd defendant is entitled toknow whether advice was given and whether privilege is claimed. This could save argument in the trial. This will stand.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Paragraph 3.3 : I do not understand the necessity for this. It asks who were the "Silverlink personnel" present at the meeting. Thatseems to be obvious from the statements and it is a matter of evidence. This interrogatory will be withdrawn.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Paragraph 4.1: This relates to what Madam Wang reported to Mr Wang Shizhen in order to obtain the prior approval of the loan by him,as referred to in his affirmation. The3rd defendant argues that it is relevant to the plaintiff's conduct and state of mind and asto what was understood and relied on by the plaintiff. I have some difficulty with this. It is true that Madam Wang does not dealspecifically with these reports in her statement but nevertheless it goes to her evidence about which she can be asked in cross-examination.She will be able to say what the plaintiff's state of mind was. I also accept that if the questions are asked with a view to testingher consistency with what appears in Mr Wang's affirmation, this goes to credit and is not permissible. I think this interrogatorymust be withdrawn.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Paragraph 4.2 relates to the "relevant officers of Silverlink" with whom Mr Wang Shizhen had discussions. Granted that he, accordingto Madam Wang, has suffered a complete lapse of memory, the identity of such persons should be known to the plaintiff and it seemsto me that the 3rd defendant is entitled to know who they were so that their evidence may be sought if necessary. This will thereforestand.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> Paragraph 4.3 is really a continuation of paragraph 4.1; the same applies; I think it must be withdrawn.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> Accordingly, the plaintiff's application succeeds in respect of those interrogatories which I have ordered to be withdrawn and inrespect of those which the 3rd defendant has withdrawn. There will be an order in terms of the summons in respect of those interrogatories.The plaintiff has, I think, largely succeeded, if one counts the interrogatories which the 3rd defendant has abandoned. So the costs(<em>nisi</em>) will be to the plaintiff in any event.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(G.P.
