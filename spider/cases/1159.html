class="para" id="p1">1.</a> This is an appeal from a judgment of Ma J, as he then was, given on 15 April 2002 with the reasons for the decision given on 23 April2002. At the conclusion of the hearing this court dismissed the appeal with costs and ordered that there be an immediate paymentof costs on account under Order 69 rule 9(2)(a) of $100,000. In doing so, this court indicated that it would give its reasons inwriting which we now do.</p>    <p class="heading">The decision below</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The application in the court below was an appeal from the order of the Master dismissing the action on the basis that the actionwas an abuse of process. There was also an application to appeal out of time a decision in another action refusing an amendment whichhad sought to raise the matter that was said should not be raised in this action. That aspect will be referred to below.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The defendant's argument that this action was an abuse of process stems from the fact that it is the second action brought by theplaintiff arising out of a lease of office premises in Dah Sing Financial Centre, Wanchai. The lease was dated 11 October 1999 andwas for a period of three years finishing on 10 October 2002. Towards the end of the year 2000, the defendant found that the premiseswere too small for its requirements. It wished either to take additional premises or, if it could not take additional premises whichwere convenient, to assign its existing lease. It was unable to obtain the plaintiff's cooperation in this regard. The defendantthen ceased paying rent, office rates, management fees and other charges. It did not take the plaintiff very long before the firstaction was started in the District Court on 19 January 2002. That action was eventually transferred to the High Court and was numberedHCA 4145 of 2001. That will referred to as the "first action".</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Shortly after the first action was commenced the defendant sought to terminate the lease unilaterally. It returned the keys to thepremises to the plaintiff under cover of a letter dated 22 January 2001. The plaintiff considered that this was a repudiation ofthe lease and accepted the repudiation by a letter dated 6 February 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The statement of claim in the first action was served on 14 February 2001. Although in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim referenceis made to the acceptance of the defendant's repudiation, that, as Ma J said, was in the context of limiting the claim for damagesand rates to the period up until 6 February. The statement of claim also claimed damages based on the plaintiff's legal costs onan indemnity basis. A defence and counterclaim was filed in March 2001 and, thereafter, the plaintiff sought summary judgment. Thatapplication came before Master S. Kwang in May 2001. The order made on the application was for payment of a sum of $354,252.00 togetherwith interest. That was in respect of the rent and other amounts claimed other than the legal costs on an indemnity basis. Executionof the judgment was stayed pending the determination of the counterclaim.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> In June 2001, the plaintiff applied to amend the statement of claim in the first action by adding a claim for damages for wrongfulrepudiation of the lease. Master Au-Yeung refused the amendment on the basis that the repudiation alleged by the plaintiff had occurredafter the date of issue of the writ. In might be added that the application was heard on a three-minute hearing and the defendant'ssolicitors did not object to the amendment.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> In July 2001, the plaintiff commenced these proceedings ("the second action"). The writ claimed damages for wrongful repudiation.In addition to rental and other charges the plaintiff claimed the cost of reinstatement and restoration of the premises. In August2001, immediately on service of the statement of claim in the second action, the plaintiff applied for summary judgment. This promptedthe defendant to apply to have the second action dismissed on the basis that it sought to raise matters which should have been raisedin the first action. When the matter came before Master Wong in January 2002 she dismissed the second action. From that dismissalthe appeal was brought before Ma J.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Ma J's decision was clear. He held that Master Au-Yeung's decision was, in the first place, binding on the parties and, in the secondplace, was correct. The proposition that a cause of action cannot be added by amendment, without consent of the parties, if it aroseafter the issue of the writ was one which had been stated by the Court of Appeal in <strong>Lark International Finance Limited v Lam Kim Marisa</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%204%20HKC%20688" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 4 HKC 688.</a> On the basis that the cause of action in respect of repudiation could not be included in the first action, the principle based onwhat has been termed the wider meaning of <em>res judicata,</em> as contained in <strong>Henderson v Henderson</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281843%29%203%20HARE%20100" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1843) 3 HARE 100</a> at 115 per Wigram V-C, and more recently described as an abuse of process by the Privy Council in <strong>Yat Tung Investment Co. Limited v Dao Heng Bank Limited</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20581" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 581</a> see Lord Kilbrandon at 590A, was inapplicable.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Mrs Chan, on behalf of the defendant, took issue with the proposition stated by Keith JA in <strong>Lark International Finance Limited v Lam Kim Marisa and Another</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%204%20HKC%20688" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 4 HKC 688.</a> He had stated at 699I-700A:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is well established that a statement of claim, whether indorsed on the writ or not, cannot be amended, without the defendant'sconsent, whether with the leave of the court or not, where the effect of the amendment is to add a cause of action which accruedsince the issue of the writ: see <em>Eshelby v Federated European Bank Ltd</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1932%5d%201%20KB%20254" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1932] 1 KB 254 (Swift</a> J), <em>Roban Jig &amp; Tool Co Ltd v Taylor</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20FSR%20130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] FSR 130 (Court</a> of Appeal) and <em>Chu and Chow Maritime SA (Panama) v Bulk Sea Transport</em> (Neill J) (Times, 25 February 1984, unreported)."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Whilst Keith JA expressed that view in absolute terms that might give rise to the impression that it were a rule of law, the veryfact that the formulation used included an exception where there was the consent of the defendant would indicate that the rule is,on its face, not an absolute rule. Indeed Swift J's statement in the <strong>Eshelby</strong> case at page 262 was as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Court is limited in giving its leave to the powers which are conferred upon it by the Rules and by the statute under which thoseRules are made, and I cannot see how, without the consent of the parties, the Court can so amend a writ as completely to change thecause of action so as to bring in a cause of action which was non-existent at the time the writ was originally issued."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The rule that a cause of action which arose after the date of the issue of the writ cannot be included in the claim is linked withthe "relation back" theory, namely that the amendments to a pleading relate back to the date of the pleading. Although the relationback theory is the normal rule, it cannot be regarded as absolute in all situations. Brandon L.J., as he then was, in the case of<strong>Liff v Peasley and Another</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20WLR%20781" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 WLR 781</a>, pointed to some of the limitations in the theory when he said at page 803D-E:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"There is, in my view, a high degree of artificiality and unreality about the 'relation back' theory. There is no reason to quarrelwith the general preposition that an amendment of a writ or a pleading relates back to the original date of the document amended,as stated by Lord Collins M.R. in <em>Sneade v Wotherton Barytes &amp; Lead Mining Company</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1904%5d%201%20KB%20295" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1904] 1 K.B. 295</a>, 297. This seems to me to be an entirely sensible proposition so long as the amendment concerned does not involve the addition ofa new party, either as plaintiff or defendant, or the raising of a new cause of action, but involves only the modification, by addition,deletion or substitution, of pleas of averments made between existing parties in respect of a cause or causes of action already raised.Where, however, the amendment concerned involves the addition of a new party or the raising of a new cause of action, it appearsto me to be unrealistic and contrary to the common sense of the matter to treat it as relating back in the same way."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Lord Brandon referred to this statement in respect of the relation back theory in his speech in <strong>Ketteman and Others v Hansel Properties Limited and Others</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20AC%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 AC 189</a> at 210D-H. What was said in those cases does not, of course, impinge upon the question of whether a cause of action which had arisenafter the date of the writ could be included as part of the claim by later amendment.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> In the case of <strong>Vax Appliances Limited v Hoover Plc</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20RPC%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] RPC 656</a>, Mummery J, as he then was, dealt with an application to amend a counterclaim in a patent action. The defendant had been sued inrespect of infringement of a patent for a cleaning head. Initially the counterclaim had sought revocation of the patent. Later thedefendant had redesigned the cleaning head which it manufactured and sought a declaration of non-infringement by the redesigned headas part of the counterclaim. The application to amend the counterclaim met with the argument that the cause of action for a declarationof non-infringement had arisen after the date of the original counterclaim. Mummery J said at page 661, lines 27-29:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I do not find in the rules or in the cases any absolute rule against granting leave to amend to introduce a new cause of action whichhas arisen since the date of the writ or the relevant pleading."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He then went on to distinguish those cases where a plaintiff had no cause of action at all at the date of the writ, specifically asituation where if the cause of action was subsequently acquired and the original writ would be incurably bad. He also distinguishedcases such as <strong>Eshelby</strong> where the amendment had to be made to the writ which, by reason of the application of the "relation back" doctrine, meant that thewrit would pre-date the cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> In the <strong>Vax</strong> case, Mummery J adopted a benevolent view towards the amendment sought in the counterclaim in that he came to his decision on thebasis that it did not constitute a wholly new cause of action. He clearly regarded it as convenient to allow the introduction ofthe claim of non-infringement because the same arguments might also have affected the form of the injunction which would be granted.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> There were two further decisions which Ms Chan relied upon. The first was <strong>Hendry v Chartsearch Limited</strong> [1998] CLC 1,382. That case concerned breaches of three agreements which had been entered into by the defendants with a company ownedby the plaintiff and his wife. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had also induced the company's employees to break theircontracts. Amongst other applications which were made, was one by the plaintiff to amend the pleadings to rely on an assignment ofwhat was termed the third contract. The assignment had been taken after the date of the writ. The third contract contained no provisionrestricting assignment. In paragraphs 19 to 23 of the judgment Evans LJ considered the cases of <strong>Vax</strong> and <strong>Eshelby</strong>. At paragraph 24 he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I therefore proceed to consider whether leave should be granted in the present case. The statement of claim in its original and amendedforms contains a clear statement of the causes of action relied upon under the exploitation agreement. The claims are made in thename of the plaintiff although it is also pleaded that the contracting party was Interface (the company). <em>The purpose of the re-amendment is to specify the reason why the plaintiff alleges that he is entitled to bring the claim. The causeof action remains the same:</em> the additional facts cause no prejudice or embarrassment to the defendants. I cannot see any ground for refusing leave to make there-amendment, and as the exploitation agreement does not contain an assignment clause there is no contractual basis for objectingto the amendment. <em>In any event, I do not consider that the tort claim so lacks 'viability and substance' that the case is equivalent to Roban Jig, wherethe plaintiff had no existing cause of action at the date of the writ</em>." (Underlining added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> That decision of the Court of Appeal was referred to and followed in the case of <strong>Maridive &amp; Oil Services (SAE) and Another v CNA Insurance Co. (Europe) Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 Ll. Rep. 9.</a> Mance LJ referred to paragraph 23 of the judgment in the <strong>Hendry</strong> case which read:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The scope of the Rules of the Supreme Court has been extended since the days when <em>Eshelby</em> was decided in 1932. In accordance with modern practice generally, the court has a general discretion which should not be restrictedby hard-and-fast rules of practice, if not of law, such as that which is suggested here. The judge therefore was wrong to considerthat the court had no power to give leave to make the re-amendment. ... It is a general power which in modern parlance has to beexercised in accordance with the justice of the case."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> But after referring to that passage he then encapsulated what was said in paragraph 24 of <strong>Hendry</strong> case, specifically, the parts which have been underlined above, and said</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We are in my view bound by <em>Hendry v Chartsearch Ltd</em> which appears to me also to reflect the modern approach."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The distinction which was thus drawn by the Court of Appeal in the case appears to be between permitting an amendment which allowsthe real dispute in the case to be determined and one which introduces into the action a cause of action which could be said to beincurably bad because it did not exist at the date of the original claim. Both Ward LJ and Chadwick LJ in the <strong>Maridive</strong> case expressed the view that there should be a flexible attitude dependent on the justice of the case.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> In the light of those cases it cannot be said that the original rule in the <strong>Eshelby</strong> case has disappeared. The courts in England have clearly been disposed to adopt a more flexible attitude, specifically, where theyhave permitted the pleading of subsequent events which clarify why a claim could be made based on a cause of action which existedat the date of the issue of the writ. No decision has been brought to our attention which has gone so far as permitting, in the faceof opposition, an amendment which would introduce into a writ a cause of action which simply did not exist at the date of the issueof the writ.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In those circumstances Master Au-Yeung was clearly justified in refusing the amendment whereby the plaintiff had sought to pleadthe cause of action based on repudiation. Indeed, even if Master Au-Yeung's decision had simply been an exercise of discretion itwas an exercise of discretion which was justifiably exercised and was, as Ma J said, binding upon the parties. In those circumstancesany suggestion that this action, the second action, was an abuse of process was and is entirely groundless.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> It should finally be mentioned that the application before Ma J was not only an appeal against the order of Master Wong strikingout the statement of claim in the present action but was also an application for leave to appeal out of time against the order ofMaster Au-Yeung. Those applications were quite understandably brought on together since it was the plaintiff's case that it shouldbe allowed to bring a claim in respect of the wrongful repudiation of the contract in one or other of the actions. Ms Chan's answerto this was that the claim should have been brought in the first action but that, because the plaintiff had already sought summaryjudgment in the first action and obtained an order, it was too late for the cause of action for wrongful repudiation to be addedto that action. That argument was wrong for two reasons. In the first place, Master Au-Yeung refused the application because thecause of action had arisen after the date of the writ. In any event, the order on the summary judgment application was only in partialsatisfaction of the plaintiff's claim. Part of the plaintiff's claim, namely that for damages based upon the indemnity costs whichthe plaintiff claimed, was left over to be decided later.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Hon Le Pichon JA:</strong></p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(Anthony Rogers)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(Doreen Le Pichon)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Vice-President</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Justice of Appeal</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Ms Roxanne Ismail, instructed by Messrs Herbert Smith, for the Plaintiff/Respondent</p>        <p>Mrs Dora K H Chan, instructed by Messrs Darin Leung &amp; Partners, for the Defendant/Appellant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2003/293.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
