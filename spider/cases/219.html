In 1991, it set up a FoodEngineering Research Centre [âFERCâ].  In 1995, the State Ministry of Education of the Peopleâs Republic of China issued adocument ææ [1995] 27 å· (at Trial Bundle C81) converting the centre into an institute called âåå®¶æå§é£åå·¥ç¨ç ç©¶ä¸­å¿â(Food Engineering Research Centre of State Education Ministry) and appointing Liu Xin [âLiuâ] as the head of the centre.  Theeffect of that document is a subject matter of dispute between the parties.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff said the centre remained part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff.  The Defendants said it became a new legal entity.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The works of FERC consisted mainly of advanced scientific and technological research in life science and food science.  There isa booklet at Trial Bundle C89 introducing FERC and the fruits of its research and their practical applications.  A landmark achievementof FERC was a technology called âgermination activated ganoderma lucidum spore and fully sporoderm broken technologyâ (èåæ¿æ´»èµ¤çµèå­¢å­åå­¢å£å¨ç ´å£ç¢è£æè¡). Since this judgment is not intended to be a paper on scientific research, I think it is not necessary for me to set out the theoryand details in respect of this technology despite Liu had spent some time in his evidence explaining what this is about.  Sufficeto say in laymanâs term, the technology would enhance the health and healing effect of lingzhi.  âèåæ¿æ´»â and âå¨ç ´å£âwere expressions subsequently used in the commercial products sold by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In order to facilitate commercial exploitation of the fruits of the research of FERC, the University set up the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff in 1993.  Its shareholders were the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff (62.99%), Science and Technology Development Centre of the State Ministry of Education of the Peopleâs Republic of China(21.92%) and Liu (15.09%).  The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff has an exclusive licence from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff regarding the latterâs intellectual property rights and has the exclusive right to manufacture and market products incorporatingthe 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffâs inventions.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  One of the products of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff was lingzhi spore powder (éèå­¢å­ç²) capsule.  Since it is a health supplement product, a permit was required beforethe capsule could be produced and marketed for public consumption.  The permit for the capsule was issued by the health authorityin Guangdong Province, å»£æ±çè¡çå»³ in 1997.  The permit was produced as exhibit P-14, ç²¤è¡é£å¥å­[1997] 209 å·.  At thebeginning, the capsules were marketed under the brand names æä¹¡ç, Hometown and Hometown Food.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The spore powder was first sold in Hong Kong under the brand name Hometown Food through a trader called Lam Po Sing who procuredthe same to be sold at various China Resource Limited (è¯æ½¤) retail outlets.  There were also earlier sales in small quantitiesthrough a Japanese in Cheung Chau.  The Plaintiffs were keen to develop other sales network.  Liu had discussions with a number ofpotential traders who might be interested in the product.  In particular, several tests on the products had been done at the requestof a Mr Cheng.  At one stage Liu was optimistic that Cheng would make a substantial investment into the product and the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff had therefore done a lot works on the same. Unfortunately, the discussion with Mr Cheng fell through at the second halfof 1998. Liu therefore needed to find another interested investor.      </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is an orthodontist by profession.  He came to know about Liu and FERC through the introduction of Wu Xiao-Lan, the wifeof a vice mayor of Shenzhen.  There are disputes between the parties as to the circumstances and timing under which they were introducedto each other.  The Plaintiffs said that happened in the end of 1998 whilst the Defendants said it occurred in the Chinese New Yearof 1998.  It is not disputed that there were active negotiations between the parties in January and February 1999.  By an agreementconcluded in February 1999 the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant agreed to act as distributor of the lingzhi spore powder produced by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was a company acquired by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and his associates in July 1998 (as shown by the annual return filed in July1999).  Apart from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and his wife Tong Siu Kan [âTongâ], the other persons involved included the cousin of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, Cheung Kwok Keung, and his friend Cheung Yin Fung [âCYFâ] and one Lam Ky Quang.  Tong was only officially registeredas director and shareholder in April 1999.  According to the annual return of 2003, the shareholders of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as at 8 June 2003 were the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, Tong, CYF and a BVI company called River Silk Development Ltd.             </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The agreement was executed in writing between FERC and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff also executed the agreement as the manufacturer.  There is a dispute as to whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff could enforce the agreement.  The product was referred to in the agreement as âå¤©ç¶­çåè£é·å®ç´çµèå­¢å­ç²è åâ. The agreement was for a duration of three years, from 1 February 1999 to 31 January 2002.  Subsequently, two more agreements wereexecuted with adjustments in the price structuring.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant marketed the lingzhi spore powder in Hong Kong under the brand names ENHANVOL çåº·æ´».  Later on, the parties extendedtheir business to a lingzhi tea product sold under the brand names ENHANTEA çåº·è¶.  The terms of distributorship were set outin another Chinese agreement dated 10 May 1999.  Like the case of ENHANVOL, two agreements were executed subsequently adjusting theprice structuring.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  There was also another agreement dated 13 February 1999 between FERC, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  I will adopt the nomenclature of the Plaintiffs in the pleadings and call this the Collaboration Agreement.  It is commonground that this was not executed on 13 February 1999 but there is dispute as to the date of its actual execution.  More precisely,the dispute is as to the sequence in which this agreement was executed as compared with the distributorship agreements mentionedabove.  The Plaintiffs said the Collaboration Agreement was executed before the ENHANTEA distributorship agreement, the Defendantssaid it was executed after the same.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In the second half of 2001, a new product of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff was launched in Hong Kong by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  The product was lingzhi lipid in capsule.  It was marketed by the name ENHANOID.  As regards the Chinese name, it wasinitially called çåº·å.  Subsequently, it was changed to çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹.  There is dispute as to whether the name çåº·åhad ever been used for marketing in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In parallel with the sale of these products by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in Hong Kong, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff marketed the same in mainland China under different packaging.  Various brand names were used on lingzhi spore powder capsulesby the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff including Hometown, æéç, Guru, å­¸è.  The English name ENHANVOL had also been used together with the Chinese nameå­¸èçµè. However, the nameçåº·æ´» was not used for products sold in mainland China.  As regardsçåº·è¶ and ENHANTEA, the evidence beforeme is not clear as to whether the tea had been sold under these names in mainland China.  As regards ENHANOID andçåº·å­¢å­æ²¹,in the manual (Bundle V, p.94) contained inside the mainland packing, the product was also referred to as å­¸èççµèå­¢å­èè³ªç²¾è¯è ä¸¸. That manual referred to the tea product asæéççµèè¶ (at V97).</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  After the expiration of the distributorship agreements, the parties could not reach agreement on the renewal.  The relationshipbetween the parties worsened and the Plaintiffs claimed that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had been in substantial arrears in payment for goods supplied by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  As shown in exhibit P4-A, the last batch of spore powder was delivered by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on 29 June 2002 whilst the last batch of lingzhi lipid was supplied by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on 18 September 2002.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  By a letter dated 5 October 2002 [Bundle S, p.63], the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff reminded the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant that upon termination of the relationship between the parties, without the consent of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had no right to use the trade names and trade marks of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff including ENHANVOL, ENHANOID and çåº·æ´».  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant continued to sell products under those names after that letter.  Since there was outstanding stock previously suppliedby the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not consider the clearance of such stock to be objectionable.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In about late November 2002, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant marketed products manufactured by other suppliers under those names.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and FERC published a public declaration in several Chinese newspapers on 4 December 2002 announcing that it had been thesole manufacturer of the lingzhi products under those brand names.  It also stated that it was the owner of these trade names andtrademarks.  It declared that it had ceased supply to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and starting from 1 December 2002, Care &amp; Health Limited was appointed as the exclusive distributor of these productsin Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan, Macau and in the international market.  The spore powder and lipid were depicted in that announcementin a new packing under the name Lingzhimaster å­¸èçµèsimilar to exhibit LX-70.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and FERC also indicated that it would take legal action against any passing off and imitation of their products.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On the same day, viz. 4 December 2002, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant placed advertisement in two Chinese newspapers announcing the transfer of the production of lingzhi products from FERCto another factory with a higher standard having a GMP certification.  It also asked the consumers to note certain features of itsproducts in order to avoid purchasing counterfeit products.  This advertisement is the subject matter of the Plaintiffsâ claimof malicious falsehood.  The same advertisement was placed on 5 December 2002.  I shall call this âthe GMP Advertisementâ.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  On 5 December 2002, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant made another public announcement in Chinese newspaper asserting that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs announcement of 4 December 2002 was misleading.  In a nutshell, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant claimed to the owner of the brand names and package designs of ENHANVOL çåº·æ´», ENHANOID çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹ and ENHANTEAçåº·è¶.  It reiterated the transfer of production to a factory with GMP certification and the new products were said to be ofa better quality.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  On 12 December 2002, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant held a press conference with an array of experts and celebrities promoting the ENHANVOL and ENHANOID sold by it.  Therewere further newspaper and other mass media advertisement by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant with reference to ENHANVOL and ENHANOID.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  At the same time, the Plaintiffs were collecting evidence. ENHANVOL marketed in Hong Kong were bought from sales outlets includingWatsons, Mannings, Yue Hwa Chinese Products Emporium and Health Plus.  Investigation was also made as to the new factory producingthe lingzhi products for the Defendants.  Tests were conducted to examine the level of impurity and heavy metal in the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs products.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  On 12 December 2002, the Plaintiffs issued the writ in High Court Action No.4651 of 2002 against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants.  The claims included passing off, infringement of copyright, breach of restrictive covenants in distributorship agreements. A claim of malicious falsehood was added later.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On 29 July 2003, the Plaintiffs commenced a new action in High Court Action No.2802 of 2003 against all three defendants for infringementof registered trademark and passing off by reference to âèåæ¿æ´»â.  That had been registered by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff as a trademark under No.B09183 of 2003.  Based on the certificate of registration, the application was made on 24 December2002 and the certificate was issued on 21 July 2003.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant is a company that was described as a joint researcher of ENHANVOL products sold by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant after the break-up with the Plaintiffs.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and his wife are the shareholders and directors of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  On 10 January 2004, the Plaintiffs issued an Originating Motion against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant seeking rectification of the Register of Trade Mark in respect of the mark ENHANVOL which had been registered by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant under its name.  That registration was applied on 10 August 2001 without any prior notification or consent from the Plaintiffs.

For passing off, the main dispute in this caseis who is the owner of the goodwill in Hong Kong attached to the following names or marks ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», èåæ¿æ´», ENHANOID,çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹, ENHANTEA, çåº·è¶ and the get-ups of these products marketed during the subsistence of the distributorship agreementsor arrangements.  In this connection, there is not much dispute of facts as to how these marks or names had been used in Hong Kongand the get-ups of the products.  There are factual disputes as to how these names were coined exceptèåæ¿æ´».  As for that expression,it is accepted by the Defendants that it was coined by Plaintiffs and the dispute on that focused on whether any goodwill attachedto it.  There are also factual disputes as to who designed the get-ups.  These overlapped with the issues in the copyright claims.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Apart from the names, marks and get-ups, the Plaintiffs also advanced the claim of passing off based on other modes of alleged misrepresentation. In Paragraph 41 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim, specific reference was made to the newspaper advertisements dated 4, 5 and12 December 2002, statements made at the press conference on 12 December 2002 and the contents of a website of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant.  The Plaintiffs contended that there were separate misrepresentations in these publications that could constitute passingoff even if it is held that goodwill of names, marks and get-ups belonged to the Defendants.  I shall refer to these heads of claimas the âfree standing passing off claimsâ.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  For the breach of contract claims, the main issue is who was the party to the contracts.  More specifically, the defence contendedthat FERC is not part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff and the contracts were therefore null and void.  The defence also challenged the scope of the relevant restrictive covenants. It is contended that the subject matters of the contracts were å¤©ç¶­ç lingzhi spore powder and lingzhi tea as opposed to ENHANVOL,çåº·æ´» and ENHANTEA, çåº·è¶.  The Defendants averred that the latter products were not covered by the scope of the agreementsas they were differently priced and not inå¤©ç¶­çpackaging.  There is a factual dispute as to the sequence under which these agreementswere signed.  The Defendants asserted that the subsequent agreements (viz. Agreements B, C, E and F) were made âfor the benefitof PRC custom authoritiesâ.  It is also pleaded that the restrictive covenants in the agreements were null and void for contraveningthe PRC law, in particular åä¸æ­£ç¶ç«¶ç­æ³ Articles 3(7) and 12 and  æ°æ³éå Articles 4, 55, 58 and 108.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  For malicious falsehood, the question of falsehood hinges upon whether the advertisements of 4 and 5 December 2002 implicated thatthe Plaintiffsâ products were counterfeit.  The defence denied that the advertisements made any reference to the Plaintiffsâproducts.  It is said the advertisement was in fact aiming at other counterfeit products in the market.  For that reason, maliceis also disputed.  By reason of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 24</a> of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Ordinance</a></i>, it is not necessary to prove special damage in respect of words published in writing calculated (meaning likely) to cause pecuniarydamage to the plaintiff.  The Plaintiffs relied on this provision.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The copyright claim is more complicated.  Initially, the claim was made in respect of artistic as well as literary works relatingto the packaging of the products.  At the beginning of the trial, Mr Liao SC wisely cut down the scope to the claim.  For the purposeof this action, the Plaintiffs confined the copyright claim to the following,</p>    <p style="text-align:center"><b><u><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Plaintiffsâ copyright works &amp;

For most of these items, the main dispute is as to authorship.  Each side claimed their designer(s) to be the author(s) of the relevantartistic work and alleged the other side of copying.  It is primarily a question of fact that depends substantially on credibilityof the witnesses.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  However, two items require separate consideration.  In respect of item (i), the Defence alleged in the pleadings that the relevantpictures at V162 and V221 were derived from an original design by Chan Chin Hung produced at E730.  A careful comparison betweenE730 on the one hand and V162, V221 on the other reveals that the cracks on the two spores are different.  The cracks appearing atV162 and V221 are clearly identical to the one appearing in the works relied upon by the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  In respect of the photo referred to as item (ix), the use thereof was admitted by the Defendants in Paragraph 64 of the Re-amendedConsolidated Defence and Counterclaim.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  For these two items, the issues are therefore different and they have to be considered separately.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  For the claim based on foreign tort, the Plaintiffs relied on the manufacturing and exporting from mainland China lingzhi productsin packaging or get-ups identical or similar to those of the Plaintiffsâ products and using the disputed trade marks.  On the evidence,there is no dispute that after the cessation of distributorship, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant contracted with other factories in mainland China to produce ENHANVOL and ENHANOID lingzhi products.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  If the double actionability rule applies, the Plaintiffs have to establish that those acts would constitute an actionable tort inHong Kong as well as in mainland China before they could succeed on this head of claim.  Hence, the defence in respect of the passingoff claim is equally applicable to this cause of action.

WhilstI do not find it necessary to resolve each and every single factual dispute, I would like to make some general observations as tocredibility of the witnesses since their evidence has taken up much time in the course of this trial and counsel have made extensivesubmissions on the topic.  </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The Plaintiffs called three witnesses at the trial: Liu, Wang Jianghai (the vice-president of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff) and a designer called Chan Hon Chungé³æ¼¢è°.  For reasons that I shall discuss in the context of the copyright and passingoff claims, I do not accept Liu and Chan Hon Chungâs evidence on authorship in respect of the relevant drawings and design.  Further,I reject their evidence as to the coining of the names ENHANVOL andçåº·æ´».  Given the nature of their evidence, once I rejecttheir claims of authorship, I am driven to the conclusion that both of them put forward false evidence and drawings that were puttogether deliberately with a view to mislead this court.  I appreciate that this is a serious allegation and I should not reach thisconclusion without cogent evidence.  But I am unable to see any other possible explanation that could absolve these gentlemen.  Iregret that I have to say so in respect of Liu who is apparently a well-respected figure in the academic world.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Moreover, Liu was not a satisfactory witness in many other aspects.  The more important points are as follows. </p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">On many occasions, he simply did not give an answer to the question of counsel.  Instead he talked about other matters to his ownliking.  Despite repeated explanations by the court as to the proper role of a witness, Liu continued to respond to cross-examinationin such a manner, especially when he was faced with questions that might expose the weakness in the Plaintiffsâ case.  This ledme to conclude that Liu is a witness who resorted to prevarication to avoid answering questions to his prejudice.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">He produced his diary to corroborate his evidence.  However, as pointed out by Mr Chan, the entries in his diary do not tally wellwith his avowed purpose of keeping such entries as reminder of future important appointments.  Many entries relied on by Liu wererelatively trivial occurrence recorded after the events and it is difficult to understand why he would bother to record those atthat time given the very good relationship between the parties.  Good examples could be found in Annex B to the Closing Submissionsof Mr Liao.  As a matter of common sense, those are simply not matters one would record in oneâs diary.  When cross-examined uponthese, Liu explained that it was due to his intuition.  On the other hand, more important matters like the decision to adopt a specificpackage design was not recorded.  I must say I am not impressed by Liuâs evidence about these entries and I do not accept his evidencethat these were contemporaneous records.  I attach no weight to such entries.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Liu gave evidence about an agreement dated 8 December 1997 made between Chan Hon Chung and the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.

Further, given the evidence about the tactical motive behind the actioncommenced by Chan Hon Chung against the Plaintiffs in mainland China discussed below, I have serious doubt if this agreement wassomething made up in 2004 in order to achieve a tactical advantage.  In this connection, I agree with Mr Chan that the Plaintiffshad not satisfactorily explained why it was considered in December 1997 that this agreement was necessary given that it was not evendecided at that time the design would be used in the package of Plaintiffsâ products.

The whole proceedingswere a farce.  The writs and supporting statements were drafted by Wang, a director of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  Chan Hon Chung admitted that the allegations contained in those documents were not true.  Wang justified those legalproceedings as tactical moves.  For my part, if such proceedings were commenced in Hong Kong, in view of the Plaintiffsâ case asto the oral agreement in 2001 and the copyright transfer agreement dated 8 March 2004, I would have no hesitation in characterisingthem as abuse of process. Liu tried to distance himself from the decision to launch such proceedings.  He said it was a decisionby the legal affairs committee.  He was however forced to admit that he did receive report from Wang about the legal proceedings. He was also present when the legal expert in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff was consulted.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(e)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Given that Wang and Liu should be aware of the oral agreement in 2001 and the copyright transfer agreement dated 8 March 2004, itis to say the least misleading when proceedings were commenced by Chan Hon Chung in Guangzhou without reference to these agreements.

He seized on every opportunity tobelittle the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and Tong and was at times behaving improperly towards counsel.  Whilst I understand that he might feel angry and aggrievedabout the activities of the Defendants, I must say I have problem with his reliability as a witness.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  By reason of their involvement in the Guangzhou proceedings, the credibility of Wang and Chan Hon Chung is also impugned.  I findChan Hon Chung to be evasive.  He tried to exonerate himself by saying these were legal matters that he could not understand as alayman.  I do not accept that for one moment.  I am singularly unimpressed by his evidence about how the Plaintiffsâ designs forthe subject matters of the copyright claims came into existence.  I shall elaborate on that in my discussion on those claims.  Wangâsevidence on the coining of the names conflicted with those of Dr Chow.  Wang said he discussed with Liu in the conception of thename ENHANVOL whilst Dr Chow testified that the name was conceived in a telephone discussion with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  I preferred the evidence of Dr Chow and I rejected Wangâs version.  Apart from the fact that Dr Chow impressed me asa more truthful witness, it is noteworthy that Wang was not an impartial witness.  He is the vice president of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and his part in the Guangzhou proceedings is a testimony to his partiality.    </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  At the same time, I do not feel able to accept the entirety of the evidence adduced by the Defendants.  I have reservations aboutcertain aspects of the evidence of Tong and CYF, some of which I will mention in other parts of this judgment.  In addition, I findTongâs evidence about the telegraphic transfer of $360,000 unsatisfactory.  The Plaintiffs alleged the document at S66 to be aforgery.  There are features which obviously raise suspicion: the absence of any time chop evidencing the time when the applicationform was received by the bank, the striking resemblance between the bankâs chop at S66 and that at S67.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant gave a rather strange response when questioned byè¢å»ºå¹³ about the telegraphic transfer.  He described it as a joke andsaid it was not a legal document.  When pressed further, he said it was very difficult to explain it over phone.  Despite the expressinvitation by the Plaintiffsâ solicitors, the Defendants declined to obtain the relevant documents from the bank to verify theauthenticity of that telegraphic transfer.  Neither did the Defendants call the staff in the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant who handled the application to give evidence.  </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Tong testified that she had instructed a staff of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to bring the application form to the bank and the staff subsequently reported to her that it had been done.  She only discoveredlater that the transfer was not made due to insufficient fund in the relevant bank account.  I note that she did not mention thesein her witness statement or affirmations.  I find it incredible if the transfer was not processed due to insufficient fund, Tongwas not informed about it on the same day.  Further, she could not explain about the suspicious features mentioned above.  Nor isthere any explanation why no step had been taken to obtain documents from the bank to corroborate her story.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Mr Liao invited this court to infer that Tong knew the document was a forgery and the explanation given by her in the witness boxwas false.  I would not go that far.  Suffice to say that I am not satisfied that Tong had told me whole truth about this documentand I will bear this in mind in assessing the credibility of the other parts of her evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  As regards CYF, I also have reservations about his reliability.  He was adamant about the cessation of delivery of goods to theQuarry Bay office of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant before Chinese New Year in 1999.  However, when cross-examined about the Quarry Bay address being used by him on an importlicence declaration dated 24 February 1999 at F962, he gave several answers which did not make sense to me.  At first, he said thedocument was prepared well before that date.  Then he corrected himself and said the goods had been shipped to Hong Kong withoutan import declaration and the document was prepared after the goods had been detained by the Custom authority.  He said he stillput down the Quarry Bay address because the goods were shipped earlier.  When it was shown to him that the goods were shipped on20 February 1999, viz. after the Chinese New Year, he explained that he put down that address because they had just moved and theincident occurred during the transitional period.  Yet he maintained they had already moved their office by that time.  When pressedfurther, he gave a further explanation by reference to his lack of knowledge as to whether the address of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in the Business Registry had been changed.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  CYF testified initially that he had not seen LX-26 before the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant came up with the design of LX-28.  He had to change his position when confronted with the fact that ENHANOID packed inLX-26 had been delivered to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on several occasions before LX-28 was designed and the newspaper advertisement at D334 must have been seen by him.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  I also find his evidence about what material he had referred to in the conception of the design of LX-28 unsatisfactory.  On 12November 2004, he said he was not told about the identity of the manufacturer of ENHANOID.  Then on 15 November, he changed his positionand said it had been mentioned although he was not sure whether it was the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff.  He said he had to refer to some leaflets of ENHANVOL that had mentioned about ganoderma spore lipids in order to learnabout the effect of the product.  He did not specify what leaflets he was referring to.  As far as the leaflets of ENHANVOL thathave been produced as evidence is concerned, there was not much reference to the lipids.  ENHANOID was 100% lipids and thereforemore effective than ENHANVOL.  In that sense, it was an improved product.  Hence, it was rather strange that Cheung chose to referto old leaflets of ENHANVOL to find out the effect of ENHANOID.  Further, the most convenient and direct reference about the effectof ENHANOID available at that time was LX-26.  Yet, Cheung somehow seems reluctant to mention that in his evidence.           </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  On the whole, like the case of Tong, I am not satisfied that CYF had told me the whole truth and I will bear this in mind in assessinghis evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  I find the other defence witnesses to be honest and truthful.  Having considered their evidence in the light of the other witnesses,I do not think my reservations about the credibility of Tong and CYF tainted the reliability of these other witnesses.  I shall discussthe relevant part of their evidence in the context of each head of claim.</p>    <p class="heading">Passing off claims: ownership of the goodwill in Hong Kong</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  At the start of the relationship between the parties, neither party had any goodwill in Hong Kong in terms of the names or marksENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», ENHANOID, çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹, ENHANTEA, çåº·è¶.  Although the Plaintiffs had sold lingzhi products under otherbrand names like Hometown Food and æéç, I have no concrete evidence as to the sale volumes prior to 1999.  In any event, itis not the Plaintiffsâ case that the goodwill of ENHANVOL was in any way built upon the pre-existing reputation of Hometown Foodoræéçlingzhi products in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Mr Liao stressed the consumersâ confidence in the reputation of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff in the promotion of the product as one backed up by its scientific research.

However, it does not follow that before ENHANVOL was launched in Hong Kong 1999, the Plaintiffs already had a goodwillin that name waiting to be tapped.

It is in its latter capacity that any agreement orspecial relationship between the parties becomes relevant.  The two aspects are easily reconciled by saying that the initial vestingof goodwill in one trader or another is always a matter of fact; but that having vested there on its creation it may be transferredto another trader <b><i>by prior or subsequent agreement</i></b>, or by operation of the general law, always provided that the transfer does not offend against the rule prohibiting assignments ingross.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Then, at Para.3-110,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦[A] properly drawn agreement could and should have made it clear who was entitled to the relevant goodwill during the currencyof the relationship and afterwards, and unless the agreement offended the rule against transactions in gross, its terms would havebeen given effect.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the terms of a voluntary agreement deserve to be given effect in full when it serves to reinforce what would have occurredat common law or when ownership at common law would be uncertain.  There are many situations in which, in the absence of agreement,the goodwill could almost equally well be said to belong to one party or the other, and to give effect to the choice of the partiesavoids a difficult, pointless and unreliable enquiry.  If so, it follows that the party agreed to own the goodwill is the only properclaimant in a passing-off action during the course of the agreement, that he alone is entitled to use the names or marks with whichthe goodwill is associated, and that on termination of the agreement it is he who immediately has the right to sue third parties,or even his former colleague, for passing-off.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In <i>Growmax v Don &amp; Low</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20RPC%20367" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] RPC 367</a>, Lindsay J expressed certain reservations about a general proposition as to the prevalence of the terms of a licence agreement onownership of goodwill at p.388,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhilst I recognize that the Courts would not wish to undermine the utility of distributorship agreements (and exclusive distributorshipagreements would be the most vulnerable) I am loath in this area, which is to some extent one of fact and degree, to endorse a propositionwhich is, as framed, so inflexible, so free of regard to the terms of the particular licence, to the state of affairs when the licencewas made and to whether the licensee has, for example, promoted the name in ways beyond such as may have been incidental to his obligationsunder the agreement or beyond preservation or enhancement of such interests as he acquires under the agreement.  I would, however,be content for present purposes with a proposition which stated that subject to special circumstances being proved to the contraryand to the terms of the particular licence, as between licensor and licensee as competitors for the ownership of the goodwill atthe termination of a licence, the position of the licensor should not be taken to be weakened nor that of the licensee enhanced bysuch activity on the licenseeâs part or such his contractual position during the currency of the licence as was respectively eitherrequired of him or conferred upon him by the licence or, as to activity of his known to the licensor, was such as could be fairlyregarded by the licensor as no more than reasonably incidental to the maintenance or promotion of such commercial interest in thename as the licence had conferred upon the licensee.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Professor Wadlow responded to these remarks in Paras.3-121.  He clarified that the proposition was not meant to be applied to asimple distributorship agreement that is silent as to whether the trade mark was being licensed at all.  He identified the inherentcharacteristic of a licence agreement as the rationale behind the ownership of the goodwill by the licensor.  It was suggested thatany other consequence would destroy the licensor-licensee relationship as inevitably as allowing a tenant under a lease to claimadverse possession against his landlord.  In the context of the present case, the scenario where there is no pre-existing goodwillis more relevant.  The professor commented,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ by identifying themselves respectively as licensor and licensee the parties have specified which of them is actually to ownthe goodwill generated in performance of the agreement, and which is to enjoy it on terms, and their decision should be given effect.â¦If the distributorship agreement â¦ had identified one party as the licensor of the name and the other as the licensee â¦ thenat the very least there would have been an estoppel by convention as to which party owned the goodwill in the name.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  It is quite clear that Professor Wadlow was commenting with regard to both a real licence situation as well as an agreement dealingwith a goodwill yet to be acquired.  His view was that the law should give effect to the agreement of the parties in both cases.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The first question to ask is therefore what was the contractual arrangement between the parties.  For reasons given later in thesection dealing with the contractual claims, I find that FERC was part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff instead of being a separate legal entity and the Distributorship Agreements A to G and the Collaboration Agreement weremade between the Plaintiffs and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  I further find that they are valid and binding both as a matter of PRC law and Hong Kong law.  Although the DistributorshipAgreements did not refer to the names or marks ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», ENHANTEA, çåº·è¶and their get-ups explicitly, I find thatit was intended by the parties that they fall within the scope of these agreements.  In other words, these names and marks were encompassedin the references toãå¤©ç¶­çãåè£and æ¬ååæ¸ç£ååç£ååç¨± under those agreements. ENHANOID, çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹are however outside the scope of the agreements.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The Distributorship Agreements did not expressly provided that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff as âlicensorâ granted a âlicenceâ to use these names or marks to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as âlicenseeâ.  We are obviously talking about goodwill to be acquired in the future, hence the use of the expressionsâlicensorâ, âlicenseeâ and âlicenceâ cannot be accurate in their strict legal sense.  A more accurate formulation ofthe issue is whether the agreement provided for the ownership of the expected goodwill pertaining to these names or marks.  The materialclause is Clause 3 (I choose the clause from Agreement A by way of example, the clauses in the other agreements are essentially thesame),</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0"

It was recited in that agreement that the Plaintiffsconsented to the use by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant of, inter alias, ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», ENHANTEA, çåº·è¶ to sell lingzhi products.  The tenor of that agreement was aco-operation between the three parties in opening up the international market for these products.  The arrangement between the partieswas obviously much more than a series of sale of goods transaction.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Mr Chan argued that Clause 3(7) actually pointed towards the other direction.  He submitted that if the goodwill was vested in thePlaintiffs, it made no sense to confine the limitation to 3 years.  Hence, he contended that by implication the goodwill must bevested in the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  I do not think this is correct.  To start with, as pointed out by Mr Liao, Clause 3(7) is drafted in wide terms and coveredaspects other than use of similar names or marks.  Secondly, there is no reason why an owner of goodwill should not secure doubleprotection by way of restrictive covenant.  An action on restrictive covenant obviates the need to prove goodwill.  I reject thesubmission that Clause 3(7) is repugnant to ownership of goodwill by the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  In this connection, I attach no weight the evidence of Tong and CYF that there was an agreement that the new brand name was to bea brand name belonged to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  No doubt there was an agreement for new brand names or trade marks to be used.  But it does not mean that it was agreedthat those new names or marks belonged to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  Tong and CYF were not privy to the negotiation for the terms of the distributorship agreements.  The only person whohad taken part on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in the negotiations leading to the execution of the distributorship agreements was the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  He chose not to give evidence.  Whatever might have been said or discussed at meetings prior to the negotiation for theterms of the written agreements, they must be regarded as being overridden by the latter.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Moreover, I find it unbelievable that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had not shown a copy of the written agreements to Tong or CYF or informed them about the terms thereof.  Tong was his wifeand CYF was his business partner.  If there were any prior oral agreement that the brand names would belong to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, I believe they would have requested for this to be set out in the written agreements and protested about some of the termswhich appeared in the agreements.  Instead, the Defendants had done nothing to challenge the agreements until after the parties brokeapart.   </p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Although the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had to pay for the costs of promotion of ãå¤©ç¶­çãåè£ under the terms of the agreements, this could be regardedas the price that it had to pay for getting the distributorship.  I do not think this factor could negate the common intention reflectedin the other provisions set out above.  I conclude that as a matter of construction, the parties had provided under Clause 3(1) thatthe 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff would grant a licence to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to use the names, marks and get-up encompassed by the expression ãå¤©ç¶­çãåè£.  Further, Clauses and 3(7) and5(4) implicitly governs the ownership of the goodwill pertaining to those names, marks and get-ups upon termination of the agreements. By necessary implication from those clauses, the parties agreed that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff owned such goodwill and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was not free to exploit the same without the consent of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Mr Chan submitted that the terms of a contract which purports to set out the rights and obligations of the parties in the supplyof goods for export before any goodwill has been established through trading is of little or no assistance in determining the questionand there is no presumption of ownership of goodwill in favour of a manufacturer who sells goods to an exclusive distributor fordistribution in a foreign territory.  He derived these propositions from the fundamental premises that goodwill is the attractiveforce that operates on the mind of the purchasing public and it is generated through trading by a business.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  In the light of the detail provisions in the agreements governing the rights and obligations of the parties in the development ofthe market associated with the brand names and the use of the same, it is too simplistic to describe the arrangements as mere saleof goods transactions.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Further, I do not think the propositions of Mr Chan follow from those fundamental premises.  Whilst I accept that goodwill mustattach to a business, it does not necessarily attach to the local trader dealing in the goods of a foreign manufacturer.  As ProfessorWadlow put it in Para.3-125,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA foreign business may have a goodwill in the jurisdiction even though it may not trade here in its own right â¦  It is sufficientthat customers for its goods are to be found here, whether or not the foreign business is in direct contractual relations with them. In particular, if the foreign business is represented by a legally distinct person of whatever capacity then the goodwill will ingeneral belong to the foreign business rather than its local representative provided that the foreign business is recognized as theultimate source of the goods.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Hence, the relevant question is as between the foreign manufacturer and the local trader, who owns the goodwill.  I do not thinkit is particularly helpful to discuss whether there is a presumption in favour of a foreign manufacturer if it is known to the consumingpublic as the ultimate source of the goods.  It is always a question of fact to be decided on the evidence before the court.  Butin my judgment, the authorities clearly show that the agreement between the parties is relevant and if there are contractual termsgoverning the ownership of goodwill, the court will give effect to it.  Apart from those authorities mentioned above, one can deducethis proposition from the following passage in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>Scandecor</i> at p.38-39,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe effects of the expansion of international trade, the globalization of markets and the growth of multi-national corporate conglomerates,are all reflected in this and similar disputes.  A company incorporated outside the United Kingdom and carrying on business in anumber of other countries may expand into the U.K. market in a number of different ways.  It may establish a branch or form a subsidiarycompany to manufacture or to trade in its products or services in the United Kingdom; or it may appoint an unconnected company toact as the sole or exclusive distributor of its products or the supplier of services in that local territory for a fixed term, oruntil terminated on notice or other specified events; or it may enter into an agreement with a local company to make and sell itsproducts under licence.  The local company may use the same marks in the territory as the foreign company uses in other territoriesboth in its corporate name and in relation to its products and services.  No problems are likely to occur while the local subsidiary,distributor, agent or licensee company is a member of the same group <b><i>or is bound by a contractual arrangement containing provisions governing the use of the mark</i></b>.  Difficulties, like those in the present case, are likely to arise when the corporate or the contractual connection is severed <b><i>and there are no express post-termination contractual provisions designed specifically to regulate the future use of the mark</i></b> in the local territory.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  One of the criticisms leveled by the Court of Appeal against the judge in <i>Scandecor</i> was the under-estimation as to the significance of the division of territories on the break-up of the parties in 1979 and its impacton the entitlement to goodwill in the subsequent phases (see p.42).  The Court of Appeal regarded it as critical that under the break-uparrangement, the United Kingdom market was allocated to the ultimate owner of the defendants (see p.44). Hence, the Court of Appealemphasized that the partiesâ agreement as to the distribution of goodwill should be recognized and legal effect should be givento the same in determining ownership of goodwill. </p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  In the supplemental submissions filed by Mr Chan on 24 February 2005, he emphasized that we are dealing with a case where therewas no pre-existing goodwill in either å¤©ç¶­ç or other names or packaging to be designed.  He said it was therefore unsound totalk about licensing as there was nothing to license in the first place.  He referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>Scandecor</i> in holding that the goodwill in question belonged to S Ltd even though there was a subsequent licence agreement from SIAB to S Ltd. The rationale was that SIAB had no pre-existing goodwill in the UK which it could license to S Ltd whilst S Ltd was already entitledto that goodwill.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  It has to be remembered that <i>Scandecor</i> was actually a case where the court found on the special facts of that case that the relevant goodwill was in substance a retailergoodwill as opposed to a manufacturer goodwill.  All along, it was S Ltd that provided the relevant services to generate the goodwilland that had already been so by the time of the licence agreement between SIAB and S Ltd. The situation is materially different fromthe one we are dealing with.  Whilst admittedly we are talking about future goodwill as far as the state of affairs at the time ofthe Distributorship Agreement is concerned, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant cannot in any way be regarded as owner of any goodwill at that time.  The situation in the present case was that the partieshad agreed (albeit impliedly according to my above analysis) upon the ownership of a goodwill to be generated by activities involvingboth of them in the future.  Is there any reason the law should not give effect to such agreement?  In my judgment, the answer isno.  It may not be a licensing agreement in the strict sense, it is still an agreement concerning ownership of goodwill that couldbe enforceable in the eyes of the law.  </p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  In the competition between a foreign manufacturer and a local distributor regarding the ownership of a goodwill built up duringthe course of a long term contractual relationship, I respectfully agree with Professor Wadlow that the ultimate determination asto legal ownership is a two-stage process.  In most cases, both parties would have contributed to the establishment and promotionof the goodwill.  On the facts of the present case, although the costs of the promotion of ENHANVOL, ENHANTEA and ENHANOID in HongKong were paid by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, I do not think it is fair to suggest that the Plaintiffs did not play any part at all in such promotion.  Whatever onemay say as to the other aspects as to evidence of Liu, it cannot be denied that the products were the result of research under hisleadership and the name of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff was used repeatedly in various advertising material.  The quality of the products depends on the quality control exercisedby the Plaintiffs.  Bearing in mind that this is a health product for human consumption, the standard of quality must have some significancein establishing and maintaining the goodwill.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  In fact, from the introduction of the products at the side panels of the packaging for ENHANVOL and ENHANOID (e.g. exhibits LX-22and LX-28), it is quite obvious that at least one of the selling points deployed in the marketing of the products was the advancedtechnology and research utilized in the production.  This is also reflected in the advertisement of the products in Hong Kong.  Therewas a reference to the technology of èåæ¿æ´» in most, if not all, advertisements.  Further, there were references to the technologybeing researched by the FERC in many of these advertisements.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  In so saying, I am not going so far as suggesting that a manufacturer must have some legitimate claim to the ownership of the goodwillirrespective of the facts of the case.  What I said is confined to the facts of the present case.  Given the nature of the product(a health product with a number of competitors already in the market), the manner in which the products had been marketed here, thefact that when it was launched the Defendants were, if I may so without any disrespect, nobody in the field, and the undeniable assistanceprovided by the Plaintiffs in the promotion of the products in Hong Kong (the evidence clearly showed that in 1999, those in the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant involved in the business did not have much knowledge about lingzhi and they had to be educated by Liu), the inevitableconclusion is that the Plaintiffs had played a part in the building up of the goodwill here.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  It is primarily up to the commercial decision of the parties as regards how the fruits of their co-operation would be distributed. Goodwill is a legal property generated from the joint efforts of the parties and I see no reason why the parties could not agreeon its ownership upon the termination of their relationship.  Once it is concluded that the parties have agreed on the same, it isnot for the court to say that such agreement should be upset unless the agreement is in breach of the rule of assignment or licencein gross (as in the case of <i>Oertli v Bowman</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1959%5d%20RPC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1959] RPC 1).</a></p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  In the context of the present case, it cannot be suggested that such rule had been breached.  Nor do I understand Mr Chan to bearguing along that line.  In fact, this is not a case where the consuming public had no idea that the Plaintiffs were the originof the products. Mr Liao helpfully summarized the references to the Plaintiffs in the packaging of ENHAVOL, ENHANOID and ENHANTEAunder Paragraph 5.9 of his Closing Submissions and similar references in advertising material under Paragraph 5.10.  I have alsoexamined to the advertisements alluded to by the defence in the table attached to their Closing Submissions.  One should of coursefocus on the promotional material prior to December 2002, viz. before the parties fell out with each other.  Mr Chan stressed thatin the early advertisements, there was no reference to any company other than the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  In my view, that cannot be too weighty given the fact that in all the packaging for ENHANVOL, there was reference toFERC of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff as the research unit of the product and the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff as a joint manufacturer.  There was also advertisement in 1999 referring to the works of FERC as assurance for the qualityof the products, e.g. an article in the Hong Kong Standard on 13 August 1999 (E607).  There were also numerous newspaper and magazineadvertisements referring to the Plaintiffs as the product of research from FERC and the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  The insert contained in the package also made reference to the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Mr Chan submitted that the names of the Plaintiffs, whenever they appeared in the promotional material, were given the same prominenceas the other names in a long list.  Even so, it does not detract from the fact that the consuming public was informed that the Plaintiffsplayed their parts in the production and research of the products.  Further, it can be seen from the inserts contained in the packagethat more emphasis was placed on the technology and research of the FERC than the other institutes in the list.  There were alsoadvertisements giving notable prominence to the association of the products with the Plaintiffs, e.g. D334-337, exhibit D1.  In thelight of these, I think the Plaintiffs had legitimate claim to the goodwill associated with the marks or names ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´»,ENHANOID, çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹, ENHANTEA, çåº·è¶.  I see no good reason why the ownership of such goodwill should not be governed bythe agreement concluded between the parties.  Of course, as pointed out above, the distributorship agreements did not cover ENHANOIDand çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹.  I will have to deal with those names and marks on the basis that there was no specific agreement as to theownership of the goodwill pertaining to the same upon the termination of the distributorship.  But it is quite plain that all theseproducts were marketed as a series of products, i.e. they were different products in the same family.   </p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  I cannot find anything inconsistent with my above analysis in the cases cited by Mr Chan. In <i>Medgen Inc v Passion for Life Products Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%20FSR%20496" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] FSR 496</a> and <i>Frankau v Pflueger</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281910%29%2028%20RPC%20130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1910) 28 RPC 130</a>, the court was not considering a situation where the parties had provided for the ownership of the goodwill upon termination of theirrelationship.  In <i>Diehl</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20RPC%20435" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] RPC 435</a>, the court only concerned with the validity of a registered trade mark which was found by the court to be an importerâs mark asopposed to a manufacturerâs mark.  There was no evidence before the court that the registered owner of the mark intended to sellproducts not manufactured by the applicant (who challenged the validity of the registration), see p.446.  The implication of therelevant clause (clause 8) in the distributorship agreement was to be considered in another set of proceedings, see p.437, 445 and447.        </p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  I therefore hold that as far as the goodwill associated with the names or marks ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», ENHANTEA, çåº·è¶ and theirget-ups is concerned, the ownership should be governed by the agreements between the parties.  In other words, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff is the owner of such goodwill and the Defendants are not at liberty to exploit the same without the consent of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  As regards ENHANOID and çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹, they were not covered by the distributorship agreements.  As pointed out by the Court ofAppeal in <i>Scandecor</i>, in the absence of any agreement between the parties governing the ownership of the goodwill, the matter has to be resolved by wayof a factual inquiry and there are no hard and fast legal rules in binding precedents or in factual or legal presumptions.  Althoughquite a number of authorities had been cited by counsel, they serve no more than as illustrations of how the court might conductthe factual inquiry on the facts of a particular case.  In <i>Reckitt &amp; Colman Properties Ltd v Borden Inc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20WLR%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 WLR 491</a> at 499C, Lord Oliver observed<i> </i>that in this branch of the law, reference to other cases is generally not of any real assistance except analogically.  Therefore,I do not find it necessary to discuss all the authorities at length.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  It is common ground that the relevant date on which the factual inquiry should focus is around December 2002.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  In <i>Guangdong Foodstuffs Import &amp; Export (Group) Corp v.

The former examines the public perception regarding who was responsible for the products whilstthe latter focuses on asking who was in fact responsible for the character, quality control and production of the products.  BothMr Liao and Mr Chan made submissions based on these tests although they seem to have different understandings on their proper application.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Whilst these two tests could be adopted as useful starting points for the factual inquiry, I do not think they should be regardedas the exclusive tests to be applied.  Recent cases show that the court should examine all the relevant circumstances in the caseinstead of focusing on these two aspects, see the Court of Appealâs decision in <i>Scandecor</i> at p.43-45; <i>Medgen Inc v Passion for Life Products Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%20FSR%20496" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] FSR 496</a> at p.512; <i>Growmax v Don &amp; Low</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20RPC%20367" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] RPC 367</a> at p.389-390.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Turning to the facts of the present case, it is in my view beyond dispute that the Plaintiffs were most responsible for the characterand quality of ENHANOID as a matter of fact.  The product was the result of the research of FERC of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff and it was manufactured and subject to quality control by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  I reject Mr Chanâs submission that in the application of the actual control test, one should ask who was responsibletowards the consumers and examine the following,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">who took charge of devising the market image of the product;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">who had the ultimate say on what the trade dress should look like;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">who made the decisions on how to market the goods;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(d)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">who would be the one to face customers complaints and enquiries on quality.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>In my judgment, those questions are pertinent to the public perception test but not the actual control test.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Turning then to public perception, ENHANOID was first introduced into the Hong Kong market in mid 2001.  I find exhibits P-4A toP-4C, the records of sale by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant (confirmed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant who signed on the same) to be a reliable records of the transactions between the parties at the material time.  Accordingto P-4B, the first lot consisting 100 bottles of ENHANOID was supplied to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on 26 July 2001.  84 bottles were subsequently returned.  Then on 10 August 2001, another 100 bottles were delivered, followedby 100 bottles on 19 September 2001.  Further quantities were sold in November and December 2001 as well as in 2002.  It would appearthat the product was quite popular as the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant kept ordering the same from the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff right up to the end of their relationship.  The last batch was an order for 300 bottles on 18 September 2002.  By then,the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff refused to sell the products to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on credit.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was so eager to have the goods that it sent a staff to bring a cashier order to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff in exchange for the goods. </p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  In the course of Tongâs evidence by way of re-examination, some sales invoices of ENHANOID by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant were produced.  They were not formally marked as an exhibit during the course of evidence as the Plaintiffs did not requirethe originals to be produced.  At the trial, this court directed parties to insert the documents into the trial bundles but somehowit was not done.  For the sake of identification and record, I marked the same as Exhibit D-25 after consultation with the partiesby correspondence.  Those records showed that between 30 August and 30 November 2001, 40 bottles of ENHANOID were sold to some individualcustomers. Further, on 29 November 2001, 60 bottles of ENHANOID were sold to Watsons.  In December 2001, 37 bottles were sold.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Tong testified that the products were sold by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in the packing of LX-26.  She said she did not like that packing and at the initial stage, when the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant sold ENHANOID by way of soft launching to individual customers, it was sold without any packing.  She said the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant also removed the label on the bottle before sale.  By the time the products were sold to Watsons, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had already repacked ENHANOID in their own packing LX-28.  The invoices in D-25 showed that the first sales to Watsonswere on 29 November 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Wong Yan Yan and CYF gave evidence for the Defendants regarding the design of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs packing for ENHANOID.  I shall discuss their evidence further in dealing with the copyright claims.  Suffice for meto state at this juncture my conclusion is that the design for LX-28 came into existence in the manner deposed to by Wong Yan Yanand LX-27 was produced afterwards with reference to LX-28. </p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  On the other hand, there are certain aspects of the evidence of Tong pertaining to the packaging and advertisement for ENHANOIDin Hong Kong that I do not accept.  First, I do not accept her evidence that the advertisements at D334 and D-1 were made by the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant at the request of Liu purely for the purpose of FERC at the trade fair in the mainland.  Judging from the fact that the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had by then already ordered a substantial quantity of ENHANOID from the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and had in fact been selling those to individual customers since 30 August 2001, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was clearly planning to promote ENHANOID in Hong Kong.  When Tong was cross-examined about this aspect, I found her tobe less than forthcoming.  She gave me an impression that she wished to downplay the fact that there had been sale of ENHANOID inHong Kong by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant before that advertisement.  It is obvious to me the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was utilizing the opportunity of the trade fair to promote ENHANOID.  The reason why they used LX-26 as product shot wasthat it was the only package available at that time. In the light of D-1, I accept that by early October 2001, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was planning to have a different package for ENHANOID in Hong Kong.  However, that does not mean that D334 and D-1 werenot advertisements for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs promotion of ENHANOID.  Insofar as Tong gave evidence to the contrary, I do not believe her.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  Second, Tong said the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had removed the package and bottle label of LX-26 when they sold ENHANOID to individual customers before LX-28 was available. I find that difficult to believe.  The evidence shows that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was not giving away ENHANOID free of charge.  They were sold at a substantial price although discounts at different rateswere given.  Some of the invoices in D-25 showed that they were sold at a price as high as $3,595.50 per bottle.  Even taking intoaccount of the prospect of changing the package, there was no absolute need to discard all the packages.  Contrary to the evidenceof Tong, I do not find the bottle label at LX-26 to be easily removable.  It would in fact be quite cumbersome to remove that labeland I do not believe this had been done when the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant sold ENHANOID to its individual customers prior to the launch of LX-28.  However, according to D-25, the number of bottlessold in such packaging is limited.           </p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  My relevant findings on the packaging of ENHANOID marketed in Hong Kong are as follows.  For a brief period, it had been sold inLX-26 but the quantity was small.  It had never been sold in Hong Kong in LX-27 packaging.  Since about the end of November 2001,it was sold in LX-28 packaging.  For the purpose of determining the ownership of goodwill, I should pay more regard to the LX-28packaging than LX-26.  In considering the LX-28 packaging, I would ignore the insert and the bottle label as I am not satisfied thatthose were part of the original packing.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  The following features at LX-28 are relevant for determination of ownership of the goodwill attached to ENHANOID and  çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The names of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant appeared at the package box at the side panel.

The earliest advertisements were D334 and D-1.  Those advertisements laid emphasis on ENHANOID asthe result of a breakthrough in the research of FERC.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, FERC and 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant were introduced as the joint manufacturers of ENHANOID.  The association with ENHANVOL was apparent by the reference tothe technology of èåæ¿æ´» and ENHANOID was introduced as a product of çåº·ç³»å.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  I have already mentioned the dispute between the parties as to the purpose of the advertisement.  In my judgment, the motive behindthe advertisement is of little moment.  What is significant is the message conveyed to the consumers by the advertisement. </p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  In later advertisements at D335 to D337, although the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs name did not appear, there were still prominent statements (although not of the same size as in D334) that ENHANOIDwas the result of the research of FERC.  Comparison with ENHANVOL was made expressly in D336 and D337.     </p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  The promotion of ENHANOID as coming from the same family as ENHANVOL is also evidenced by LX-41a.  That exhibit consisted of variousitems sold at Watsons on 29 November 2002 in one set.  By that stage, the parties had fell off with each other.  The ENHANVOL inthat set was in fact a version allegedly originated from Shanghai Second Medical University as opposed to that of FERC or the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  However, amongst the set, there was a small travellerâs pack identified as LX-41a(5). Inside that pack, there wereseveral leaflets, including a leaflet for ENHANOID.  There is no dispute by the Defendants that this was a leaflet of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  I can therefore properly infer that it was a typical example of how ENHANOID had been marketed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant before the termination of the relationship between the parties.  The content of that leaflet speaks for itself.  The associationof ENHANOID with ENHANVOL was made and the major selling point of the product was the research of the FERC.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  The importance of the technological research backing to the marketability of the products was, in my judgment, well demonstratedby the manner in which the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant announced the breakup with the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and the FERC in newspaper on 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> December 2002 (at D414 and D415).  Those advertisements, apart from the notice to the public to watch out for counterfeit products,emphasized that the production of ENHANVOL had been switched to a factory with GMP certification and the research partner had beenswitched to Shanghai Second Medical University as opposed to the FERC.  This shows that the quality control for production and thetechnological research backing were two important selling points of the product.  Although that was an advertisement for ENHANVOL,I can readily infer that the same can be said for ENHANOID.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  This accords with common sense.  We are talking about health products, more particularly lingzhi products.  The primary concernof consumers purchasing these products must be the quality and effect of the products.  Technological research backing and qualitycontrol in production are crucial.  I can see the difference in the appeal to an average informed consumer between a lingzhi productmanufactured by an unknown factory in Shenzhen and a lingzhi product manufactured by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff with the backing of the research by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  By comparison, the after-sale services provided by 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as a local distributor is relatively less important.  Although Mr Chan highlighted the fact that it was the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant who dealt with complaints from local customers, I do not think one can attach as much significance to the services by the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as that of a local dealer for electrical appliances who provides repair services or that of the defendant in <i>Scandecor</i>.   </p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  Moreover, at the beginning of the distributorship, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was not known in the market and had no knowledge or expertise in respect of lingzhi products.  It is not a case where awell-known trading firm sourced a product from an unknown supplier and then marketed the products in its own packaging without referenceto the name of the manufacturer.  Hence, to start with, the selling points must have been the quality assurance backed up by researchfrom the FERC.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  In contrast, although the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and FERC did not carry out any direct sales activities in Hong Kong, their products had been sold here under the brandname Hometown Food and to that extent had some exposure to local consumers of lingzhi products.  Further, whilst the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff might not be, in the eyes of the general public in Hong Kong, on par with top class universities in the world, the researchof FERC definitely provided some quality assurance to the products.  Lingzhi is a traditional Chinese medicinal product and it isnatural that consumers in Hong Kong attach importance to research by reputable institution in mainland China on the topic.  I haveno difficulty in appreciating the difference in marketability in Hong Kong between a lingzhi product not backed up by any researchof the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff and one with such backing.  On Tongâs evidence, after first rejected by Liu (when he was still hoping Mr Cheng wouldtake up the distributorship), the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was still keen on distributing the lingzhi products of the Plaintiffs.  This shows that they recognized the market potentialof the Plaintiffsâ products in Hong Kong.       </p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  In <i>Shanahan, Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off,</i> 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, p.42-43, a distinction was drawn between two classes of trade marks.  The first class is manufacturerâs marks, which thelearned author described as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA manufacturer who has applied a mark to goods to indicate that he or she is the âoriginâ of the goods is most unlikely tobe denied proprietorship because of the activities of some dealer in those goods.  The evidence in these cases will generally showthat in the hands of the dealer, the mark has retained its initial significance as an indication of the manufacturing source of theproduct.  The dealer does not establish proprietorship by showing only that purchasers look to the dealer as the sole supplier ofthe goods; they might well do that in recognition of the dealerâs exclusive selling right, while aware all the while that the markdenotes some manufacturing origin.  This is particularly likely where the manufacturer is actually identified by the labels or thegoods are clearly of foreign origin.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  The second class is dealerâs mark.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦[T]here is a class of case in which the mark is clearly that of the distributor or importer.  Here the dealer has âselectedâthe goods.  They have been made to the dealerâs specifications (to the dealerâs âspecial orderâ) by a manufacturer (or severalmanufacturers) who have applied the mark to the goods at the dealerâs instigation to indicate that the dealer is connected in thecourse of trade with those goods.  In such cases the dealer will usually have nominated the mark to be used; however, the dealerâsproprietorship is not based essentially on that circumstance (though it may well be relevant to the implication of some agreementaffecting proprietorship) but on what the mark symbolises, namely, that the goods have been issued under the âaegisâ of the dealer.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  Without losing sight of what I said earlier that the ownership of goodwill associated with a trade mark is ultimately a questionof fact and no single test or factor could be regarded as conclusive, I find these passages from <i>Shanahan</i> illuminating.  In the present context, bearing in mind how the names had been used (with significant references to the research ofFERC as the selling point of the products), the relationship between the parties as reflected in the agreements (in the case of ENHANVOLand ENHANTEA) and other matters I have alluded to, I consider that it is more likely that the consumer public regarded the namesas a manufacturerâs mark than a dealerâs mark.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  Although the Defendants did specify the number of capsules in one box and the quantity of ENHANVOL in one capsule, I think it isgoing too far to suggest that these specifications indicated that the products were supplied under the aegis of the Defendants asopposed to being manufactured by the Plaintiffs.  Indeed, the evidence shows that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was not the first trader with whom the Plaintiffs negotiated distributorship.  It was only after negotiation with Mr Chenghad failed that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant entered into serious negotiations with Liu for the distribution of ENHANVOL.  Further, under Clause 3(1) of the DistributorAgreement, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant could only obtain supply of ENHANVOL from FERC.  It is not a case where a trader selected a manufacturer or several manufacturersfor a product conceived by the former.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  In this connection, although Tong and CYF gave evidence about how the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant wished to have its own brand names for the products in the course of negotiation and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was to become the owner of such names, this wish was not reflected by the terms of the distributorship agreements.  Givenmy reservations as to their credibility generally and the fact that the negotiation for the terms of the agreement was conductedbetween Liu and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant (who chose not to give evidence), I do not attach much weight to the evidence of Tong and CYF in this regard.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  Further, I accept the submissions of Mr Liao in Paragraph 5.11 of his written closing submissions that insofar as Tong and CYF gaveevidence to the effect that the backing of the FERC was insignificant in the promotion of the products, such evidence should be rejected. I do not think I need to set out at length the arguments of Mr Liao on this point.  Suffice to say that based on what I have alreadysaid above and the other matters alluded to by Mr Liao, it is quite obvious to me that Tong and CYF were biased in this regard andI do not believe them. If what they said were true, I believe the packaging, promotional material and inserts in the products wouldnot be the same as they actually were.  At least, less emphasis would have been placed on the research by FERC.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  In some advertisements, certain celebrities or movie stars were engaged to promote the products. I do not think that is of muchsignificance in determining who owned the goodwill.  Surely it cannot be suggested that the goodwill belonged to the celebritiesand I do not understand Mr Chan to be suggesting the same.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  It has become fashionable in some trades to engage a celebrity as a product spokesman or spokeswoman.  It is just a marketing techniqueand from a legal point of view, there is no distinction between that and the design of a get-up or a plot for promotional audio orvideo footage.  For the purpose of ascertaining ownership of goodwill, in particular the competition for ownership between the partiesin this action, it is not a significant factor.  Nowadays, an average consumer in Hong Kong can readily appreciate that the endorsementor promotion of a product by a celebrity does not mean that he or she is the trader supplying the goods in question.  Nor does itimply that the person who arranged for such endorsement must be the owner of the goodwill.  These are all basically commercial arrangementswith regard to the marketing of the products.  An analogy can also be drawn with an advertising agent engaged by a local distributorfor the promotion of an imported product.  Even if he paid all the fees of the advertising agency, it would be wrong to suggest thatby reason of that the local distributor must be the owner of the goodwill.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  Counsel submitted that the packaging of a product could be regarded as the clothes for the product.  In my view, these endorsementsby celebrities are likewise measures adopted for enhancement of the product image.  Although the person who determined and procuredthe design of the packaging and the manner in which the products would be advertised are not necessarily the owner of the goodwillgenerated therefrom, in most of the cases the owner of the goodwill would be interested and exercised control over such matters. Hence, depending on the facts of a case, it may be possible for the court to draw an inference in an appropriate case that sucha person is more likely to be the owner of the goodwill.  However, it must be stressed that all the circumstances have to be consideredand there could be cases where a foreign owner of the goodwill is quite content to leave it to the local agent to decide these mattersfor him.  The same applies as to the coining of the product names.  Hence, whether such an inference would be drawn depends a loton how the parties have dealt with each other.    </p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  Whilst there is no dispute that it was the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant who paid for the advertising expenses in Hong Kong, it was an obligation undertaken by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant under Clauses 2(2) and 3(5) of the Distributorship Agreements.  In the latter provision, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant agreed to incur not less than $1.5 million for the promotion of the products within the first six months after the makingof the agreement.  In short, it is a price that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant agreed to pay in order to get the distributorship.  Against such background, in determining the ownership of the goodwill,little significance could be attached to the payment of advertising expenses and the arrangement for advertisement and promotionof the products (including the engagement of celebrities to endorse the products) by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  As regards the designs for the packaging of all the products that we are dealing with, for reasons given above and in my discussionon the copyright claims, my finding is that they were procured by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as opposed to the Plaintiffs.  As regards the coining of the names, subject to the question as to the timing, I acceptthe evidence of Dr Chow about the telephone conversation and reject the evidence of the Plaintiffsâ witnesses on the genesis ofthe name ENHANVOL.  There cannot be any doubt as to the integrity of Dr Chow.  He is a respectable person, being the associate deanof the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Hong Kong.  He has no interest in the Defendantsâ businesses.  He answered questionsdirectly and he was frank about matters he could not recollect.  Mr Liao fairly accepted that Dr Chow is an honest and truthful witness.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  On the timing of the conversation between Dr Chow and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant about the suffix for ENHANVOL, I think the doctor was mistaken.  He said it happened around the end of 1998 and althoughpossible, it was unlikely to be in January 1999.  But he had no specific reason to capture the recollection as to the date of thatconversation at the time of the event and he could not pinpoint any matter to assist him on that except that it happened after anexamination.  On the other hand, there are events that show objectively the conversation probably took place later. </p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">In a letter dated 17 January 1999 from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to Liu, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant said the name of the product was still being considered.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">As evidenced by the contemporaneous notes made by the assistant to Chan Chin Hung at Bundle Z, p.B2 and B15, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not give the name of the product to the designer at the initial stage in January 1999 when he was engaged.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  But the mistake of Dr Chow in that regard does not matter much.  The real significance of Dr Chowâs evidence lies in the factthat when the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant approached him, the English name was not yet completely coined and it was Dr Chow himself who contributed the finishingtouch to the name by suggesting the suffix âvolâ.  Despite his mistake as to the timing of the conversation, I find the otheraspects his evidence reliable and I accept the same.  As Mr Chan submitted, once I made a finding that the suffix âvolâ was contributedby Dr Chow, I could not accept Liuâs version as to the genesis of the name ENHANVOL.  I have already alluded to the lack of credibilityon the part of the Plaintiffsâ witnesses and I do not need to say more on the topic.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  On the other hand, I also have misgivings about Tongâs evidence as to the coining of the name çåº·æ´».  From the material producedby Chan Chin Hung, it was quite obvious that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was aware of the name çæ´» used on a product sold by another trader.  CYF testified that, some time in 1998, he had approachedthat trader to see whether the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant could distribute their products.  He said he had reported the same to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  Although it was said Tong was not involved in the business at that stage, I cannot believe that she was not aware ofthe name çæ´» when she was trying to get a new name for this product.  I therefore find that she had not told this court the wholetruth about the genesis of the name çåº·æ´».</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  Hence, whilst I reject the Plaintiffsâ case as to the coining of the product name, I cannot accept the Defendantsâ case in itsentirety.  Even so, on the balance of probability, I find that the coining of the names ENHANVOL and çåº·æ´» was by the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  Having said so, it does not mean the Plaintiffs had no part to play with regard to these names.  Since the products had to be promotedwith the support of the Plaintiffs (as references had to be made to FERCâs research in advertisements and packages), the Defendantscould not simply adopt such names without the consent of the Plaintiffs.  Hence, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant indicated in the letter of 17 January 1999 that he would inform Liu as to the name of the product when the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had decided on it and the name of FERC would be used in promotional material.  This was subsequently expressly providedfor under Clause 3(7) of the Distributorship Agreement.  In view of that, I do not think too much weight could be attached to thefact that the names were coined by the Defendants in assessing the ownership of the goodwill.   </p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  Tongâs evidence was to the effect that on the coining the names, and also on the design of the packaging, the Defendants coulddecide on their own without consulting the Plaintiffs or Liu.  Although I reject the Plaintiffsâ evidence that the names and designswere the brainchild of Liu, I do not accept that Liu was prepared to go along without being consulted on these matters.  Given thecharacter of Liu, I find it to be inherently most unlikely that he would just leave everything to the Defendants.  As I said, theagreements provided for a right to veto on the part of FERC.  It is rather unimaginable that Liu would permit the products to besold in Hong Kong under a name or in a package which he found to be objectionable.  In fact, Tong herself testified that at somestage, Liu objected to the lack of reference to the Plaintiffs in the advertisements and the Defendants took heed of that subsequently. On Tongâs case, the advertisement at D334 was made at the instigation of the Plaintiffs.  In my judgment, the Plaintiffs clearlyhad some say on these matters. </p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  Mr Chan tried to downplay the significance of that provision by contending that it was confined to literature or promotional materialrelating to FERC and its aim was to protect FERC in respect of what was said about it instead of the products.  I think that submissionfails to take into account of the underlying factual matrix.  As I said, at that point in time, the most important selling pointin the marketing of the products is the backing provided by the research of FERC.  As a matter of fact, virtually all the promotionalmaterial and packaging contained references to FERC or its technology.  The few advertisements without such references (Bundle T1,p.21 and 22) were not typical advertisements about the products.  Against such background, and also having regard to the other termsin the agreement which envisaged the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff to be the owner of the goodwill attached to the names, my conclusion is that the agreements did in effect give the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff the right to veto on the names and designs of the products to be sold in Hong Kong.  It may be that Liu did not deem itnecessary to exercise that right with regard to the names and designs actually adopted.  But this does not detract from the positionthat the Plaintiffs did have some control over the matter.    </p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  It seems that neither party continues to use the names ENHANTEAçåº·è¶ and I would not therefore lengthen this judgment by analysingthis part of the case in great details.  The Distributorship Agreements for ENHANTEAçåº·è¶ contained similar provisions with regardto the Plaintiffsâ approval for promotional items.  The promotional material and the packaging for ENHANTEAçåº·è¶ and its insertalso adopted the research of FERC as a selling point.  In view of that, it cannot be disputed that the Plaintiffs did have some sayin the brand names of the products irrespective of the initial authorship of the names and the design for packaging.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  There is a conflict of evidence between Tong and Liu on the question of authorship.  Tong claimed it to be her idea whilst Liu saidit was his.  The evidence on the topic primarily revolved around a document produced as exhibit P-8.  The defence case as specificallyput to Liu in cross-examination was that the names were decided at a meeting on 3 May 1999 when P-8 was written.  Liu said the nameshad already been decided well before that meeting as it was referred to in the Collaboration Agreement which was executed prior to3 May 1999.  Although Tong adhered to the case put to Liu in her examination in chief, she accepted in cross-examination that thenames had been communicated and understood between the parties prior to that meeting.  </p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  Given the general observations about Liuâs credibility and my reservations as to Tongâs credibility and the inconsistency inthe defence case mentioned above, I do not feel confident to act upon the evidence of either of them on this issue.  By reason ofmy conclusions as to the effect of the agreements and the Plaintiffsâ ultimate control over the names irrespective of authorshipand the discontinuance of use of the names, I do not think it is absolutely necessary to resolve the dispute on authorship of ENHANTEAand çåº·è¶.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  Turning to ENHANOID andçåº·å­¢å­æ²¹, there is no dispute that initially the Chinese name wasçåº·å (see LX-26 and D334). Whilst I find the Plaintiffsâ witnesses to be unreliable, I do not derive much help from the evidence of the Defendants as to thecoining of these names.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was said to be the author but he chose not to give evidence.  Tongâs evidence was ambivalent (based on what she was allegedlytold by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant) in this regard and for reasons already canvassed, I do not feel confident to act on her evidence alone.  On such stateof evidence, I simply cannot reach a conclusion as to the authorship of the names ENHANOID andçåº·å­¢å­æ²¹.</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  On the facts of the present case, for reasons already given, I do not think it is of vital importance to identify the author ofthe names ENHANOID andçåº·å­¢å­æ²¹.  Even assuming that the names were coined by the Defendants, this is but one factor to betaken into account in deciding ownership of the goodwill attached to them.  Taking other factors into account, I am able to concludethat the Plaintiffs are the owners even if the names were coined by the Defendants. </p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  I consider it is important that ENHANOID was marketed as a product in the same family as ENHANVOL.  It is unsatisfactory and mostunlikely that the public would perceive the owner of the goodwill of one as different from that of the other.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  Once it is concluded that the goodwill belonged to the Plaintiffs, the elements of misrepresentation (by the continued use of ENHANVOL,çåº·æ´», ENHANOID, çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹ after the break-up of the relationship) and damages are self-evident.  Therefore, I hold thatthe Plaintiffs succeed in their passing off claims in respect of these names.  As regards ENHANTEA and çåº·è¶, the evidence ofLiu himself shows that by 5 December 2002, the Defendants had changed the name to âMr Tea çµèå­¢å­è¶â (see Paragraph 84(vi)of his Affirmation of 23 August 2003 at B81).  This was confirmed by Tong in her evidence.  There is no evidence of continued useof the names ENHANTEA and çåº·è¶ by the Defendants.  The claims in respect of those could not be sustained.</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  Turning to the claims in respect of get-up, there is no evidence that the packages of ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», ENHANOID, çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹or any other elements of their get-ups were, apart from their brand names, so distinctive that consumers identified the productsby the get-ups.  Having regard to these get-ups and the way they were advertised, I am not satisfied that the get-ups are so distinctiveof the products that other trader using similar get-ups but different brand names would be successful in misappropriating the Plaintiffsâgoodwill.  As far as I could see, the get-ups were not exceptionally eye-catching and basically consisted of ordinary features forget-ups of similar kinds of products.  I therefore dismiss the passing off claims based on get-up.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  On the passing off claim in respect ofèåæ¿æ´», for reasons given under the section dealing with the registered trade mark claim,I hold that the expression did not perform the function of a trade mark as indicating the origin or distinguishing the identity ofthe source of the goods.  Hence, the claim also fails.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  Lastly, as regards the free standing passing off claims, neither party spent much time on that in the closing submissions.  Thenewspaper advertisements dated 4, 5 and 12 December 2002 and statements made at the press conference on 12 December 2002 did containmisrepresentations to the effect that the production of lingzhi products properly bearing the name ENHANVOL had been shifted fromFERC to other factories with the benefit of the same technology.  Since I conclude that the name ENHANVOL indicated to the consumersthat products bearing the name were manufactured and supervised by the Plaintiffs, it is a misrepresentation to suggest the productionhad been shifted to other factories.  However, this element of misrepresentation stemmed solely from the use of the marks ENHANVOLçåº·æ´».</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  In substance, I do not think the free standing passing off claims add anything to the passing off claim based on the marks or namesENHANVOLçåº·æ´».  I see no need to grant separate relief in connection with the passing off claim based on the advertisements orstatements made by the Defendants in early December 2002.  </p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  As regards the alleged statement on the website, on the evidence available I am not satisfied that the website had been launched. Only Liu gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiffs in respect of the webpage.  He had not explained how he found out about the websiteand when was the webpage downloaded.  On the other hand, Tong denied that the website had been launched.  The burden of proof ison the Plaintiffs and in view of my assessment of credibility, I consider the Plaintiffs failed to discharge that burden.  I thereforedismiss that head of claim as well.      </p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  Mr Liao submitted that on the facts of the present case, if the passing off claims succeeded, judgment should be entered in favourof both Plaintiffs.  Mr Chan did not advance any submission on this aspect.  Having regard to the matters alluded to in Paragraph3 of Mr Liaoâs supplemental submissions of 24 February 2005, I agree with his analysis that the goodwill is jointly owned by thePlaintiffs. </p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  Hence, the Plaintiffs are entitled to relief in respect of passing off pertaining to the names or marks ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», ENHANOIDand çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹.  There will be usual injunction as well as consequential relief including inquiry of damages or, at the optionof the Plaintiffs, account of profits.  The rest of the claims under the head of passing off are dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Breach of distributorship agreements</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  The first question is the identity of the parties to the contracts or more specifically, whether FERC is part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff.  As I said in my Reasons for Ruling of 16 September 2004, it is primarily a question of fact.  Notwithstanding the determinationof the issue by the Intermediate Peopleâs Court in Guangzhou, I should resolve the question by reference to the evidence beforeme.</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  According to a document issued by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff on 25 June 1993, a ä¸­å±±å¤§å­¸é£åå·¥ç¨ç ç©¶ä¸­å¿was set up by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff on 8 July 1991. In 1993, there was an application for converting that into FERC.  That application was approved in principleby the Ministry of Education in 1993 and subsequently further endorsed on 7 June 1995.</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  The question is whether such conversion established FERC as a separate legal entity with independent legal status on its own right. In a document ææå½ [2003] 59 è dated 5 December 2003, the Ministry of Education confirmed that notwithstanding the conversion,FERC was still attached to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff was the legal entity responsible for its affairs and undertook legal liabilities and obligations for the activities ofFERC.  There was a reorganization in 2000 which is not material for present purposes as the agreements were made in 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  The conversion in 1993 was made pursuant to åå®¶å·¥ç¨ç ç©¶ä¸­å¿ç®¡çè¾¦æ³ promulgated on 26 November 1992.  Having examinedthe provisions therein, I do not think there is any provision therein inconsistent with the view of the Ministry of Education.  Althoughthe regulation provided for the independent finance and administration of a å·¥ç¨ç ç©¶ä¸­å¿, it does not confer a status of separatelegal entity on the same.  On the contrary, Article 20 stipulated that it would be attached to or entrusted with the organizationsetting up the centre (âå·¥ç¨ç ç©¶ä¸­å¿æ¯ä¾æäºå»ºè¨­å®ä½â).</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  Insofar as it is still suggested that FERC is a different entity from ä¸­å±±å¤§å­¸é£åå·¥ç¨ç ç©¶ä¸­å¿, I reject the same asthe evidence before me did not provide any factual foundation for such suggestion. </p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  The Intermediate Peopleâs Court in Guangzhou concluded that FERC was part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff could therefore sue or be sued on the distributorship agreements.  I respectfully share the same view.</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  The second question is the subject matters of these agreements. There was no reference to ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», ENHANTEA, çåº·è¶in the Distributorship agreements (apart from the Collaboration Agreement). Instead they referred toãå¤©ç¶­çãåè£lingzhispore powder and lingzhi tea.  The only person who had given evidence before me who had personal knowledge about the negotiationsand execution of these agreements was Liu.  Although allegations were made by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, he did not give evidence.  The other defence witnesses could not shed much light about the negotiations and executionof the agreements. </p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  Liu testified that the first agreement about spore powder was made in February and the first agreement about lingzhi tea was madeon 9 May 1999.  He also said the Collaboration Agreement was made in March 1999 although on its face, the date was 13 February 1999. His evidence was based on entries in his diary.  I have already explained why I do not attach any weight to those entries.  Instead,I find the notations (which apparently is a shorthand of the dates) at the top left hand corner of the first page of each agreementto be more reliable.  On that basis, I find that the agreements were executed on or about these dates,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Agreement A</td>                <td width="75%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">19 February 1999</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Agreement B</td>                <td width="75%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">17 June 1999</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Agreement C</td>                <td width="75%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">17 June 1999</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Agreement D</td>                <td width="75%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">8 May 1999</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Agreement E</td>                <td width="75%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">17 June 1999</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Agreement F</td>                <td width="75%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">17 June 1999</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>I would not say the same for the date of execution of the Collaboration Agreement.

Based on the evidence before me (and it is significant that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant chose not to give evidence, and the court is therefore deprived of the benefit of hearing evidence from the only personin the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant who was privy to the negotiation for the terms of distributorship), I conclude that it was the common intention of theparties that ãå¤©ç¶­çãåè£ encompassed the names ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», ENHANTEA, çåº·è¶ and had dealt with each other accordinglybetween 1999 and 2002. </p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  Turning then to the legality of these agreements under PRC law, I have addressed the issue in the context of admissibility of expertopinion in my Reasons for Ruling of 16 September 2004 Paras.12 to 14.  Up to the date when I write this judgment, the appeal courtin Guangzhou has not yet delivered its judgment.  I therefore see no reason to depart from my analysis in my said Ruling.  I holdthat the agreements were valid and enforceable under PRC law.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  In the course of trial, Mr Liao indicated to this court that the Plaintiffsâ claim based on the agreements is confined to enforcingthe part of Clause 3(7) relating to products which were an imitation of or passed off as the products of FERC under the agreementsand products bearing product names or packaging designs similar to those under the agreements (see my Ruling of 16 September 2004on the application for leave to amend).</p>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  The prohibition under Clause 3(7) runs up to 3 years after the termination of the right of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to sell the products.  Mr Liao submitted that the three years period should run from September 2002 when the parties formallyterminated their relationship.  The respective durations of distributorship provided for under the agreements were,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">ENHANVOL</td>                <td width="75%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">1 February 1999 to 31 January 2002</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="75%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">ENHANTEA</td>                <td width="75%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">10 May 1999 to 9 April 2002 (there is an ambiguity here on whether the 3 years should run up to 9 May 2002)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  According to sales record at P-4-A, the last sale of spore powder by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was on 29 June 2002 whereas the last sale of lingzhi tea was on 16 April 2002.</p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  However, in a letter dated 5 October 2002, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff pointed out that the agreement for ENHANVOL had expired on 31 January 2002.  The second paragraph of that letter alludedto the restriction under Clause 3(7) although there was no express reference to the clause.</p>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a>  For reasons already given in the section dealing with passing off, I do not think there is evidence of breach in respect of ENHANTEA çåº·è¶.  The claim in respect thereof should therefore be dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a>  As regards ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», Mr Liao cited no authority to support an automatic extension of the period of restriction if partiescontinued to trade with each other after the contractual period.  It is a matter of construction of Clause 3(7).  In Para.16-096of <i>Chitty on Contracts,</i> 29<sup>th</sup> Edn., it is said that covenants in restraint of trade must be clear and definite.  Bearing in mind that the contract was draftedby the Plaintiffs, the expression âé·å®æ¬å©çµæ­¢â should be construed narrowly and taken to mean the end of right to sellunder Clause 3(1).  There is also no evidence that the parties intended such automatic extension.  Hence, it ended on 31 January2002 and this was how the matter was put by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff in the letter of 5 October 2002.  The continued sale of products supplied by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff after 31 January 2002 conferred implied licence on the Defendants to sell the goods so supplied but did not extend the3 years post distributorship restriction.  Therefore the covenant lapsed on 31 January 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a>  I would therefore refuse injunctive relief under this head of claim.  This might be academic in view of my judgment in respect ofthe passing off claim.</p>    <p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a>  However, the Plaintiffs are entitled to damages for breach of contract in respect of the breach of Clause 3(7) for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs use of  ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´» marks and packages.  Clause 3(7) provided for liquidated damages.  But the Re-amended ConsolidatedStatement of Claim did not ask for that.  The Plaintiffs are confined to general damages.</p>    <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a>  Mr Chan submitted that the Plaintiffs did not any adduce any evidence on damages and at the most should only be awarded nominaldamages.  He relied on a number of cases: <i>Born Chief v Tsai George</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20HKC%20282" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2 HKC 282</a>, <i>Excel Wood Limited v Charmed Investment Ltd</i> HCMP 4130 of 1997, <i>Century Crown Ltd v Ho Wing Chun</i> HCMP 2147 of 1998.  Mr Liao contended that this is primarily a case involving intellectual property disputes and this court shouldfollow the usual Chancery practice of ordering inquiry as to damages or alternatively, at the option of the Plaintiffs, account ofprofits.  The following cases supporting such a course were cited: <i>Auto Treasure v Noble Diamond</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20HKC%20117" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 HKC 117</a> and <i>Full Range Electronics v General Tech Industrial Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20HKC%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 HKC 541.</a></p>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  In the present instance, given the nature of the claims, the damages for breach of contract must overlap with that for passing off. Since the Plaintiffs have yet to elect whether to seek inquiry of damages or account of profits under passing off, it would be inappropriateto deal with damages for breach of contract at this stage.  I agree with Mr Liao that the Chancery practice should be followed inthis case.</p>    <p class="heading">Copyright claims</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  Liu claimed to be the author of several freehand sketches produced as exhibits P-1(A) to (J) and these were said to be the originaldrawings based on which the packages design for ENHANVOL at LX-19, LX-20 and LX-22 were created. P-1(A) is a pencil drawing of twospores, one cracked and the other broken with a droplet of oil spilling out.  It was drawn on a piece of paper under the letterheadof the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  It was marked with â97.8â which purported to show that the drawing was made in August 1997. P-1(B) to P-1(D) werephotocopies of P-1(A) with different colours added on it. </p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  Liu testified that he drew P-1(A) to P1(E) in August 1997 based on what he observed under microscope and some drawings in otherChinese books about lingzhi.  At first he drew the picture as a matter of interest to tell the story of lingzhi without any planfor it being used as a package design or other commercial purposes.  It was only in early 1998 that the drawing was used and incorporatedinto a package design.  When he drew P-1(A), he intended to show it to his colleagues, his patients and those admired him.</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  For reasons which would become apparent later on, it is significant to note that Liu testified categorically that he did not havethe benefit of photographs taken by electron microscope when he drew P-1(A).  Although he had photographs taken by ordinary microscope,he said they were of no assistance.  He explained to this court the difference between photographs taken by electron microscope andordinary microscope.  The details shown by the former are, according to Liu, many times finer than an ordinary microscope.  Ms Tamsuggested to Liu that photographs taken by ordinary microscope could not show the tiny little holes on the surface of a spore.  Liusaid only very experienced expert could see such tiny little holes by means of ordinary microscope.</p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  According to the evidence of Liu, he only took photographs together with Professor Ng Yuk Yin (å³è²è³¢) by means of electron microscopein December 1998.  Those were the photographs found on the side panel of the package design LX-20.  Further photographs of lingzhispores were taken by electron microscope in Japan in 2000 (âLX-13â).</p>    <p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a>  The Plaintiffs did not produce all the photographs taken by electron microscope in respect of lingzhi spores used in the packagingboxes.  Liu testified that he failed to retrieve some negatives.  However, the evidence showed that the Plaintiffs did use some electronmicroscope photographs other than P-11 and LX-13 for its packaging and leaflets.  For present purposes, I would identify the followingphotographs which had bearings on my assessment of the evidence,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">four photographs at Q48: they were apparently selected from photographs taken in Japan in 2000, viz. LX-13, with the exception ofthe one at the lower right hand corner.  The one at the top left hand corner of Q48 corresponds with C159, the one at top right handcorner corresponds with C160, the one at the lower left hand corner corresponds with C162 (see also V81).  The one at the lower righthand corner of Q48 is apparently C165 with another picture superimposed on it.  The picture superimposed on it was a picture of abroken spore with an oil-like droplet spilling out from it.  With colours added on it, that picture can be seen at the bottom ofQ48 although the position of the droplet was slightly different.  That broken spore picture was used as the central theme in LX-20(with a cracked spore and some broken pieces added by its side);</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">it is quite plain to me that the picture of broken spore with an oil-like droplet [âthe LX-20 broken sporeâ] was created by workingon another photograph of broken spore.  That photograph was not included in LX-13 nor P-11.  It could however be found on the leaflets,e.g. at V12 (or its original in LX-19).  Although it was a very small copy of the photograph, I have no difficulty in identifyingthe broken spore in the photograph on the right at V12 as the one used to produce the LX-20 broken spore.  It is also quite apparentthat it was a picture taken by electron microscope;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">by the side of the broken spore in LX-20, there are some broken pieces.  Again they appears to be adapted from another picture takenby electron microscope and that had been used in other designs (see LX-19, J47,Q21(f), Q45, Q46, V49, G1172, 1174-78, 1181 and 1186). That photograph had not been produced but it is clear to me that these drawings or designs were reproduced from another photographtaken by electron microscope. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a>  In his evidence in chief on 2 September 2004 (p.30N), Chan Hon Chung testified that photographs of lingzhi spores were suppliedby Liu and he added the oil like droplet to the photograph at Q48.  The four photographs were later used on the side panel of LX-26. As regards the LX-20 broken spore, Chan Hon Chungâs evidence was that it was created by reference to the sketches by Liu (P-1(A)to (J)) and some material supplied by Liu, including some photographs, see p.28T to 29O.  He admitted that the cracked spore wasdesigned by using a photograph of a cracked spore.  Although he did not quite spelt out what materials were used for creating theLX-20 broken spore, having regard to the photograph at V12, I come to the firm conclusion that the photograph was processed by ChanHon Chung to come up with the graphic design for LX-20.</p>    <p><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a>  Liu testified that no electron microscope photograph has been taken by the Plaintiffs regarding lingzhi spore prior to December1998.  Although he did not give specific evidence about the photograph at V12 and the photograph of the broken pieces, I can safelyinfer that those photographs could not have been taken prior to December 1998.  In other words, Liu could not have those photographswhen he allegedly drew P-1(A) in August 1997.  Nor could those photographs be used to create the designs by the Plaintiffs at anytime prior to December 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a>  Liu mentioned about seeing photographs of spores from a Japanese magazine.  But that was after he drew P-1(A) (X: 419R to U).  Acomparison between P-1(A), the LX-20 broken spore and the photograph on the right at V12 shows similarities between them.  Havingregard to all the electron microscope photographs placed before me, I am of the view such similarities could not be explained bymere co-incidence.  As far as the evidence shows, the shape and configuration of each broken spore is quite distinct.  Further, asLiu put it in Paragraph 34 of his First Affirmation filed in HCA 4651 of 2002 (B37), it is very rare to get photograph of brokenlingzhi spore with its wall not completely crushed into pieces.  It is most unlikely that Chan Hon Chung incidentally came acrossthe photograph at V12 and found it matching with the design of Liu perfectly when he was asked to make a computer graphic based onP-1(A) and extracted that part of the photograph for such purpose.  The more likely scenario, in my judgment, is that P-1(A) wasdrawn with reference to the photograph at V12 either directly or indirectly.  In Paragraph 49 (b) and (c) of his first affirmation(B50 and 52), Liu admitted that the sketch drawings were made with reference to some photographs.</p>    <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a>  Given the earliest point in time the Plaintiffs could have obtained the photograph at V12 was December 1998, it follows from myabove observations that P-1(A) to P-1(E) could not have been drawn in mid 1997 as suggested by Liu.  Likewise, the package boxesproduced by the Plaintiffs bearing designs derived from photographic images of spores taken by electron microscope could not existprior to December 1998. </p>    <p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a>  If the sketches were drawn in mid 1997 for leisure as claimed by Liu, it is difficult to understand why he would photocopy his owndrawing and put different colours on the same in P-1(B) to (D).  It is also difficult to see the purpose of drawing P-1(E) showingonly the LX-20 broken spore.   </p>    <p><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a>  Liu claimed that P-1(F) to (I) were drawn in January 1999 (X452 J to L, though in his evidence in chief, he claimed that P-1(I)was drawn in February 1999, see X15M). These were drawings of packaging boxes bearing the names ENHANVOL and çåº·æ´» (P-1(G) wasa drawing of the word ENHANVOL in different styles).  For reasons given above, my finding is that the names ENHANVOL and çåº·æ´»werecoined by the Defendants instead of Liu.  The letter of 17 January 1999 showed that Liu was not told of those names by the time ofthe letter.  Yet Liuâs evidence based on his diary entries at P-3 was that he had prepared the package drawings on 12 January andhad given a set of those to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant on 16 January 1999.  That cannot be true.</p>    <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  Liu claimed that P-1(J) was created in February 1999 and was handed to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant around the same time.  If that were true, it is inherently unlikely that in March 1999 the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant adopted the package design of cracked spore at D-21 even though Tong was not fully satisfied with it as it did not depictthe idea of a fully broken spore (å¨ç ´ç§), a selling point which Tong wished to emphasize.  The defenceâs case is that the designof a fully broken spore similar to P-1(J) came into existence subsequently and the packaging box had to be changed accordingly inJuly 1999 to LX-22.  A change of packaging within such a short time was not conducive to the promotion of the products.  If a copyof P-1(J) had been given to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in February 1999, I believe that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would have adopted it instead of using the D-21 design in March 1999.  </p>    <p><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a>  Liu actually had difficulties in making up his mind as to his evidence on the dates when these sketches were made.  Mr Chan referredto the wavering stance of Liu regarding the date of creation of P-1(E) in Paragraph 3.14 of his closing submissions by referenceto the evidence of Liu in his various affirmations, witness statement and his testimony in witness box.  I think the criticism isa fair one.  In addition, Liu also had problem with the date of creation of P-1(J).  On its face, it was marked â99.2â suggestingit was drawn in February 1999.  However, in exhibit LX-23 (C280), a further date was put down at the bottom, â1997.6â.  No satisfactoryexplanation had been forthcoming from the Plaintiffsâ evidence as to how this came about.  Liu merely said â1997.6â was notin the original and he had no idea who added it.  In cross-examination, he said he had drawn a similar picture in the summer of 1997for artistic purpose.  P-1(J) was, according to Liu, drawn in February 1999 specifically for the use of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  Yet quite inexplicably, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not adopt it until July 1999 and used D-21 instead in March 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a>  Liu also gave different dates as to when the package drawings were given to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  As mentioned, his diary entries suggested they were supplied on 16 January 1999.  In the copy of the freehand sketchesproduced as exhibit LX-23 to Liuâs First Affirmation [C282-283], someone put down a notation â1999.2â seemingly suggestingthat they were created in February 1999 although such notations could not be found in the original produced as P-1(H) and (I).  Liuconfirmed those dates in Paragraph 42 of his Second Affirmation filed in HCA No.A4651 of 2002 [B186].  On 23 July 2004, he testifiedin the witness box that C282 to 284, viz. copies of P-1(F), (H) and (I) were given to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in early February 1999 (X460).  In my view, it is unlikely that those drawings were made in January 1999.  These were alldrawings of package boxes bearing the name ENHANVOL.  On the Plaintiffsâ evidence, that name could not have been coined earlierthan February 1999.  Paragraph 46 of the Second Affirmation of Liu filed on 23 December 2003 suggested that at least up to the dateof the Agreement A, parties were still discussing about using å¤©ç¶­ä¸¹ as the product name.  On the face of that document, it wassigned on 13 February 1999.  Liu also said so in his testimony on 22 July 2004 (X 372F).  But the notation at the top right handcorner suggested that it was executed on 19 February 1999.  I preferred the latter and adopted that as my finding of fact.  Liu didnot have any credible explanation as to why Agreement A did not refer to the names ENHANVOL and çåº·æ´» if they were decided priorto 13 or 19 February 1999.  I do not accept Liuâs account that the lack of reference to these names in Agreement A was due to therequest of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant because he intended to export ENHANVOL to other countries and it would be too cumbersome if names in foreign languageshad to be added later.  For me, such an explanation was just too unreal to be credible.</p>    <p><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a>  As explained in the context of my discussion on passing off, my finding is that the name was coined by the Defendants.  The letterdated 17 January 1999 from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant showed that the name had yet to be determined on 17 January.  The diary entry could not be correct.  Having regard to thedate of Agreement A and the fact that the agreement still referred toå¤©ç¶­ä¸¹ as opposed to ENHANVOL or çåº·æ´», I find on balanceof probabilities that Liu was not told about the names ENHANVOL and çåº·æ´» until some time after 19 February 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a>  In making such a finding, I have taken into account of the evidence of Tong that her recollection was that Liu had been told aboutthe names prior to the signing of Agreement A.  I do not consider the evidence of Tong to be reliable in that respect.  She was notinvolved in the negotiation and signing of Agreement A.  Her recollection of the dates is not supported by any contemporaneous records. Just like Dr Chow, she was probably mistaken.  In this respect, I regard what I could infer from Agreement A to be more likely tobe the truth.  </p>    <p><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a>  Another instance of Liu embellishing his case as he went along is his evidence as to how the materials were supplied to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and BBRD.  In Paragraph 42 of his Second Affirmation in HCA No.A4651 of 2002 [B186], he said the design drawings had beensupplied to BBRD directly by him as well as indirectly through the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  He was quite specific in identifying the materials supplied by reference to LX-23, LX-27A, LX-95 and LX-96.  He saidquite specifically in Paragraph 43 that BBRD prepared the artworks by reproduction from the said design documents and instructionswith slight modifications.  Neither LX-20 nor J48 were included in those exhibits.  He did not mention about giving any materialsto the Defendants or BBRD stored in a MO.  </p>    <p><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a>  In his witness statement of 1 April 2004, Liu added more documents to support his claim of authorship by way of LX-102 and LX-103. It is not clear whether he said all these were supplied to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant or BBRD.</p>    <p><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a>  When Liu gave evidence in the witness box, he said for the first time that all the materials had been given to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and soft copies contained in MO were given as well.  Under cross-examination, Liu admitted that he did not send materialto BBRD directly.  It is difficult to see why Liu was reticence about sending materials to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant by MO in his written evidence.  </p>    <p><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a>  The confusions in the dates of creation of these sketch drawings and the manner in which they were given to the Defendants or BBRDhighlight the lack of veracity on Liuâs version of events.</p>    <p><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a>  The Plaintiffs adduced several pieces of evidence to corroborate the case of Liu that his sketch drawings were created prior tothe design of D-21 by Chan Chin Hung.  Firstly, some of the packaging boxes allegedly used by the Plaintiffs prior to March 1999bearing designs in the sketch drawings were relied upon.  These boxes included LX-19, LX-20, J47 and J48.  The manufacturing datesof LX-20, J47 and J48 as printed on the exhibits were 19 February 1999, 3 October 1998 and 5 March 1999 respectively.  LX-19 itselfbears a manufacturing date of 19 June 2001 but Liu testified that the design was first used in the second half of 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a>  Regarding the design allegedly used in 1998 (J47 and LX-19), they both had images reproduced from photographs taken from electronmicroscope at the top of the package boxes.  The images were described respectively as âGermination activating ganoderma spore(magnified by electron microscope)â and âThe ganoderma spore flakes after sporoderm micro-breaking with enzyme engineering (magnifiedby electron microscope)â.  Also the design of these two boxes incorporated the LX-20 broken spore design.  As explained, the Plaintiffsdid not have photographs taken by electron microscope prior to December 1998.  Even if allowance is given to the suggestion thatthe image of the spore used in the cracked spore picture came from the Japanese magazine, the other features in the design derivedfrom electron microscope photographs could not have been available prior to December 1998.  Therefore, insofar as it is suggestedthat J47 and LX-19 had been printed and used in 1998, I reject the same.  It is noteworthy that Liu testified that the dates printedon the boxes referred to the dates of the products instead of the dates of the boxes.  Hence, it is possible that products manufacturedon a date earlier than the boxes came into existence were packed into such boxes and the manufacturing date could be earlier thanthe date the boxes actually came into existence.  If that were so, the dates printed on these boxes had no relevance to the questionof authorship.  I also find that Chan Hon Chungâs evidence in Paragraph 7 of his first witness statement (Q28) as corrected byhis testimony in the witness box that the computer drawings for LX-19 at V2-7 were completed in December 1997 simply cannot be true.</p>    <p><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a>  Regarding LX-20 and J48, the integrity of those dates printed on the boxes is again doubtful.  Both boxes specified that the producthad a preservation period of 28 months.  However, in 1999, the Plaintiffs only had licence to sell the product in mainland Chinawith a preservation period of 24 months underç²¤è¡é£å¥å­[1997] 209 å·.  It was only on 11 August 2000 by another licenceç²¤è¡é£å¥å­[2000]393 å· that the preservation period was extended to 28 months.  I have no hesitation in rejecting Liuâs explanation that sincehe was the top expert in the field and he was on the panel of experts consulted for this sort of applications, the Plaintiffs couldstipulate a preservation period of 28 months even prior to the extension in 2000.  If that were correct, I fail to see why a preservationperiod of 24 months was specified in LX-21.</p>    <p><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a>  In addition, LX-20 as well as J48 are designs bearing the name ENHANVOL.  As explained earlier, Liu was not informed about thisname until some time after 19 February 1999.  It is therefore unlikely that LX-20 could have been produced on the date shown on thebox, viz. 19 February 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p181" class="para" id="p181">181.</a>  Moreover, it is simply inherently unlikely that the Plaintiffs adopted so many designs for its product packages under the same brandname å­¸èçµè around the same period.  If the Plaintiffsâ case were accepted, it would mean that it was using LX-19, LX-20,J-48 and LX-21 in early 1999.  This wholly defies common sense as such a practice would cause confusion in the market and diffusethe goodwill attached to the product.  I do not accept Liuâs explanation that this was done as he liked to make new designs.</p>    <p><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a>  Mr Yan made a powerful submission to defend the integrity of the dates printed on these packages based on the conduct of the partiesin the litigation.  In essence, his point is that in view of the state of evidence disclosed by the defence, there was no point forthese dates to be printed on the packages boxes if they were fabricated. LX-20 and J-48 should bear earlier dates in order to servethe interest of the Plaintiffs. </p>    <p><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a>  LX-20 was produced by Liu in his first affirmation of 23 August 2003.  At that stage, the Defence in HCA No.A4651 of 2002 only containeda general averment in Paragraph 30 that the artworks were designed and created by BBRD in or about 1999.  LX-20 bore a manufacturingdate of 19 February 1999.  J48 was produced as LX-2 to the Second Affirmation of Liu filed on 6 January 2004 in HCA No.A2802 of 2003. By that stage, the defence had filed an Affirmation of Law Fu Ming on 27 October 2003 in HCA No.A4651 of 2002.  J48 bore a manufacturingdate of 5 March 1999 In that affirmation, Law said BBRD was engaged by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to design the package in or about January 1999.  Mr Yan submitted that if the dates were fabricated, earlier dates wouldbe selected.</p>    <p><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a>  In the affirmation of 27 October 2003, Law did not actually specify the date when the design used in D-21 (viz. first generationENHANVOL packaging in Hong Kong) was created. He only said BBRD was engaged in about January 1999 and the first set of layouts (whichwere rejected) were shown to Tong about 10 days later.  Moreover, J48 used the name ENHANVOL.  As explained above, on the Plaintiffsâown evidence filed up to January 2004 when J48 was produced, that name could not have been coined prior to mid February 1999.  Dueto such constraints, J48 could not have been designed (not to mentioned produced) much earlier than March 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a>  Further, one must not assume that the Plaintiffsâ only source of information as to the date of creation of the design of D-21was from the pleadings and evidence filed by the Defendants.  The Plaintiffs were in possession of P-10, a fax dated 26 March 1999allegedly sent to Liu for his approval on the design.</p>    <p><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a>  Therefore, I do not think the ingenious argument by Mr Yan advances the Plaintiffsâ case as to the integrity of the dates thesepackage boxes insofar as they are taken as the dates when the boxes were used.</p>    <p><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a>  Another problem about J48 is that if it had ever been designed and used by the Plaintiffs as alleged by Liu and Chan Hon Chung,it should have been in the forefront of the Plaintiffsâ claim for copyright infringement as far as ENHANVOL packaging is concerned. A comparison between J48 and D-21 would make this apparent.  The designs of the two are basically the same with some very minordifferences (e.g. the crack on the spore, the Chinese name).  Yet surprisingly, it was not even pleaded in the copyright claims norwas it mentioned in the Plaintiffsâ evidence on copyright.  In the witness statements, it was not included in the material allegedto have been supplied to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and Chan Hong Chungâs witness statement omitted any reference to J48.  It was only produced in the context of the useof the expression âèåæ¿æ´»â in Paragraph 4 of the Second Affirmation of Liu filed in HCA No.A2802 of 2003. Even Plaintiffsâcounsel were taken aback by Liuâs reference to it when cross-examined by Ms Tam.</p>    <p><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a>  In view of the fact that J48 had been disclosed as part of LX-2 in January 2004, could it be just an oversight on the part of thelawyers in omitting to refer to it in respect of the copyright claims?  In my judgment, I do not think such omission can be so easilybrushed aside.  The correlation between J48 and D-21 is so clear that it could not have escaped the attention of Liu and Chan HonChung.  Although I can understand that pleadings, affirmations and witness statements were drafted by lawyers, the instructions musthave come from the clients.  It did not take a lawyer to appreciate the significance of J48 in respect of the copyright claims. IfJ48 had been used by the Plaintiffs as alleged by Liu and Chan Hon Chung and if a copy of it had been supplied by Liu to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, I am sure that the first thing they would have done was to refer to it as the source of the design for D-21.  It wouldhave been one of the first things that they told their lawyers and they would have made sure that there was no room for any mistakeor omission.  They would have ensured that the point was made in their affirmations or witness statements.  Even if the lawyers neglectedto refer to the same in the context of copyright, they would have corrected the mistake.  All along, the Plaintiffs were representedby a team of very experienced and competent lawyers and there must have been a lot of occasions where Liu or Chan Hon Chung couldhave brought up the omission. </p>    <p><a name="p189" class="para" id="p189">189.</a>  Instead of having J48 put in the forefront of their case, Liu and Chan Hon Chung were silent about it in their affirmations andwitness statements in the context of copyrights.  In his First Affirmation filed in August 2003, Liu said in Paragraph 49 that thePlaintiffsâ lingzhi spore powders were marketed in mainland China initially in the packaging as per LX-19 and later on as per LX-20. He further said it was exported to Hong Kong as per LX-21 and repackaged into LX-22.  He described how he designed LX-22. No referencewhatsoever was made to J48.</p>    <p><a name="p190" class="para" id="p190">190.</a>  There was an application by the Defendants for production of the artworks of the Plaintiffs.  Liu referred to that in Paragraph14 of his Second Affirmation filed in HCA No.A4651 of 2002 [B167-8].  In Paragraphs 42 and 43 of that affirmation, Liu describedhow he created the designs and how they were supplied to BBRD both directly and through the Defendants.  That was a golden opportunityfor J48 to be mentioned. Yet he failed to do so.  Liu was painstakingly explaining how his sketches in âLX-23â and âLX-27Aâwere reproduced by BBRD and then generated into artworks by computer.  One may ask rhetorically if J48 had been given to BBRD forreference, why would Liu forget to mention J48 as the link between D-21 and his designs in those paragraphs.     </p>    <p><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a>  Liu made a witness statement on 1 April 2004.  He referred to the materials he relied upon for the copyright claims. J48 was notamongst the drawings identified and there was no computer artwork for J48 in LX-103.  The same applies to the witness statement ofChan Hon Chung made on the same date.  </p>    <p><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a>  In his evidence in chief, Liu made no reference to J48.  It was only raised by Liu in cross-examination.  Chan Hon Chung made thecorrection in his examination in chief.  However, he was unable to give a satisfactory account as to why he omitted to refer to J48in his witness statement.  He said he had remembered about it prior to July 2004 but the lawyers told him to supplement that in thewitness box.  He had made a Second Witness Statement on 10 August 2004 but there was still no reference to J48.  I have no hesitationin rejecting the explanation by Chan Hon Chung.  If he had raised the omission with the lawyers prior to July 2004, I am sure MrLiao would mention the same in his opening and the particulars in respect of the copyright claims submitted to this court in theopening would also make reference to J48. </p>    <p><a name="p193" class="para" id="p193">193.</a>  Another piece of evidence relied on by the Plaintiffs to establish priority of Liuâs sketch drawings is P-5A.  Liu said that wasa document produced by him at a discussion with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and CYF on 6 February 1999.  He said it was supposed to be instructions to BBRD, the design firm engaged by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, for the design of the package for ENHANVOL.  Prior to the meeting, some designs had been produced by BBRD but they couldnot meet the requirements of Liu despite, according to Liu, the sketches and computer drawings produced by the Plaintiffs had beensupplied to them.  Hence, Liu felt that he needed to impress upon BBRD how the package should be designed and he made out P-5A onthe spot for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to pass on to BBRD.</p>    <p><a name="p194" class="para" id="p194">194.</a>  The first point to note about this document P-5A is that there was a reference to the nameçåº·æ´» in the first paragraph at thetop of the document.  On my finding as to the timing when Liu was told about the name as set out above, this document could not havebeen written on 6 February 1999 as alleged by Liu.</p>    <p><a name="p195" class="para" id="p195">195.</a>  The manner in which P-5A or its copies were produced by the Plaintiffs draws adverse comments from Mr Chan.  A copy was first producedas part of LX-27A in the First Affirmation of Liu dated 23 August 2003.  It was described as one of the drawings created by Liu byreference to the photographs exhibited as LX-13. LX-13 is the Japanese electron microscope photographs taken in 2000.  Liu subsequentlycorrected himself in his witness statement of 12 April 2004 that the photographs should be those taken in December 1998, viz. P-11instead of LX-13.  Although he made the correction by reference to LX-23 instead of LX-27A, I am prepared to regard that it was amere slip that no reference was made to LX-27A in that correction.  The copy of the document produced in LX-27A does not bear thechop of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  In that affirmation, Liu did not explain the circumstances under which P-5A came into existence.</p>    <p><a name="p196" class="para" id="p196">196.</a>  None of the figures in P-5A bears any resemblance to the photographs in P-11.  In fact, Liuâs testimony in the witness box didnot support his assertion in the affirmation that P-5A was created by reference to P-11.  However, he did not explain why he saidso in his affirmation.</p>    <p><a name="p197" class="para" id="p197">197.</a>  In his witness statement of 1 April 2004, Liu made a brief reference to the meeting of 6 February 1999 [Q7].  However, notably,he made no reference to P-5A in that statement.  Instead, he said in the witness statement that the drawings handed to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant at that meeting were LX-23, viz. P-1(E), (F), (H), (I) and (J).  There is no explanation by Liu as to why there was sucha discrepancy.</p>    <p><a name="p198" class="para" id="p198">198.</a>  Liu only revealed how P-5A came to be drawn by him in his evidence in chief and produced a copy of the document bearing the chopof the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant (P-5).  He explained that the chop was redacted by his colleague when copy was supplied to the lawyers for preparationof the affirmation in 2003.  He said that was out of the ill-conceived belief that the chop of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would somehow suggest that the designs were those of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  However, that colleague Tong Chin Kau was not called to give evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p199" class="para" id="p199">199.</a>  LX-27A is an exhibit to the First Affirmation of Liu.  Liu should bear the primary responsibility in ensuring proper document wasexhibited by him.  He should have noted that the chop was missing and corrected the mistake before he made the affirmation.  He didnot do so and it is not excusable for him to say it was due to the mistake of his colleague.  In my judgment, Liu had not satisfactorilyexplained about why he permitted the copy of P-5A in LX-27A to be produced to the court when he should be aware of its tampering. He also did not explain satisfactorily why he failed to correct the record until he gave his evidence in chief.  On the whole, Ido not accept that he was ignorant of the tampering, if there was any.</p>    <p><a name="p200" class="para" id="p200">200.</a>  It is a serious matter to tamper with a document intended to be used for the purposes of legal proceedings.  Putting forward a tampereddocument as evidence coupled with an intent that the tampering would place a party in better light than he otherwise would be isa grave misconduct which could lead to criminal sanction.  As I said, Tong Chin Kau was not called as a witness and the Defendantsdid not have any chance to cross-examine him about the copy of P-5A in LX-27A.  Given my misgivings on Liuâs credibility, I amnot prepared to find that Tong committed such a serious misconduct on Liuâs words alone.</p>    <p><a name="p201" class="para" id="p201">201.</a>  It was rather unusual for a Hong Kong company to place its chop on a document of this nature.  It served no useful purpose. BBRDwould probably accept the document as instructions from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant if it was given to them by Tong or the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  Liu testified that the chop was put down at his request.  But why would the Defendants oblige Liu on such a meaninglessrequest?</p>    <p><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a>  The end result is that I am faced with a discrepancy between P-5A and the copy in LX-27A and there is no credible explanation forit.  On the evidence, I am not satisfied that the chop was there when LX-27A was exhibited.  It is equally possible that the chopwas added later by someone who thought that with the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs chop placed on the document, the Plaintiffsâ case would be improved.  I do not think I need to make a finding asto what had actually happened.  On either scenario, Liuâs credibility is seriously dented.</p>    <p><a name="p203" class="para" id="p203">203.</a>  Liu put forward P-5A as his message to BBRD about how the package box was to be designed.  I agree with Mr Chan that it was a veryawkward way to achieve that objective bearing in mind that according the Liu, by that time the design drawings and packages had beensupplied to the Defendants (and through them to BBRD) by means of MO and hardcopies.  It would be much more direct and effectivefor Liu to pinpoint a particular box of the Plaintiffs (e.g. J48) for reference.  In any event, there was no need to draw so manyfigures.  If one were to examine P-5A, it is difficult to tell how BBRD was supposed to select one out of the many figures in thatdocument as the theme of the design.</p>    <p><a name="p204" class="para" id="p204">204.</a>  In the paragraph at the bottom of P-5A, Liu was apparently telling BBRD to emphasize the oil droplet filling up a broken spore. That idea was not adopted by BBRD in D-21.  Yet Liu did not appear to have complained.</p>    <p><a name="p205" class="para" id="p205">205.</a>  According to Liu, instead of giving the document to BBRD, Liu asked the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to return the original of P-5A to him the next day.  Since he had got all the original design drawings (the computer drawingsby Chan Hon Chung as well as his free hand sketches), there was simply no point for Liu to keep P-5A.  I am totally unimpressed byLiuâs explanation that his sixth sense told him the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was unreliable and dispute might arise in the future. Liuâs evidence was that he kept the original and has been keepingit since 7 February 1999 and had only showed it once to Chan Hon Chung in the interim for the design of ENHANVOID.  All these are,in my judgment, bizarre.</p>    <p><a name="p206" class="para" id="p206">206.</a>  I therefore place no weight on P-5A except the discredit to Liuâs credibility occasioned by its production.</p>    <p><a name="p207" class="para" id="p207">207.</a>  In respect of Chan Hon Chung, for the reasons given above regarding the time constraints as to the earliest possible use of theelectron microscope photographs and the name ENHANVOL in the designs, I must reject his evidence as to the circumstances and datesof creation of the package boxes.  I have also highlighted some other aspects as to his lack of credibility.</p>    <p><a name="p208" class="para" id="p208">208.</a>  After Wong Yan Yan and Chan Chin Hung had produced their computer drawings with dates of creation, Chan Hon Chung was challengedto produce his working drawings of similar nature.  He did not do so and chose to hide behind the pretext that the dates could beadjusted and such drawings were of no probative value.  He however said he had not adjusted the dates in his computer.</p>    <p><a name="p209" class="para" id="p209">209.</a>  I shall deal with the design in respect of ENHANOID later.  As regards ENHANVOL, Chan Chin Hungâs produced drawings showing thedifferent steps during the process of creation.  At Y22 (which was copied from an earlier file he worked on), the layers for differentcolouring or shading of the cracked spore used on D-21 were shown.  He also accounted for the genesis of the design of the grid byreference to Design D of the five initial lay-outs shown to Tong.  For the exploding spore used in the second generation ENHANVOLdesign, Chan Chin Hung explained the different layering at R95 to 97.  In contrast, Chan Hon Chung had not produced anything of acomparable nature.  He could not even produce the artwork for J48.  I do not accept the evidence of Liu and Chan Hon Chung that thePlaintiffs had lost many design drawings and gaps were therefore inevitable in proving their process of creation.  Chan Hon Chungand his colleagues were working on computers and even if hard copies might have been misplaced, there must be drawings that couldbe retrieved from the computer.  Unlike Chan Chin Hungâs company, the Plaintiffs had not ceased business and there is no suggestionof storage device being damaged.  It is hard to believe that the only drawings available were those produced if the Plaintiffs actuallydesigned the packaging as their witnesses testified.</p>    <p><a name="p210" class="para" id="p210">210.</a>  Chan Hon Chung is obviously a biased witness who is prepared to do whatever Liu or the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff told him to do.  One example is his role in the Guangzhou proceedings.  Another example is his execution of the assignmentin favour of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff without even checking what drawings were to be included in the assignment.  As it turned out, the drawings were not attachedat the time of execution and he did not seem to care.</p>    <p><a name="p211" class="para" id="p211">211.</a>  I agree with Mr Chan in his submissions that Chan Hon Chungâs evidence about the 8 December 1997 agreement and the 1 December2001 conference is extremely unsatisfactory and dubious.  I am not satisfied that Chan Hon Chung told me the truth with regard tothose events.  In addition to the inherent improbability of his version, the manner in which he gave evidence about those eventsdid not impress me as that of a credible witness.  He was selective in his memory and at times evasive in answering questions undercross-examination.  </p>    <p><a name="p212" class="para" id="p212">212.</a>  On the whole, I find Liu and Chan Hon Chung unreliable and I reject their evidence on the copyright claims in respect of ENHANVOL.</p>    <p><a name="p213" class="para" id="p213">213.</a>  Having reached that conclusion, I would only deal with the Defendantsâ evidence on the copyright of the ENHANVOL packaging briefly. I agree with Mr Liao that the Defendantsâ evidence had been skeletal and cagey right up to the commencement of the trial.  Oneonly has to look at the first witness statement of Chan Chin Hung to see the point.  During the course of trial, the evidence ofthe defence on copyright had been substantially expanded.  Supplemental witness statements were filed in respect of the evidenceof Chan Chin Hung and Wong Yan Yan.  Two additional bundles of documents were added in the course of Chan Chin Hungâs testimony. All these would have a bearing on the question of costs.</p>    <p><a name="p214" class="para" id="p214">214.</a>  I am however satisfied that despite that deficiencies in the preparation for trial, the Plaintiffs did not suffer any prejudicethat could not be compensated by costs as a result of such late production of documents.  I am also satisfied that such late disclosurewas not due to any intention to conceal the truth by Chan Chin Hung.  Having heard his evidence and assessed it in the light of allthe materials before me, I find Chan Chin Hung to be an honest and reliable witness and I accept his evidence as to the genesis ofthe design for D-21 and LX-22.</p>    <p><a name="p215" class="para" id="p215">215.</a>  He was so keen in letting the truth be revealed that he voluntarily produced the documents in Bundle Z which the parties had nomeans of knowing their existence.  No-one could criticize him for not producing those documents in view of the fact that he was onlyinvolved with the design of ENHANVOL in 1999 and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not engage his firm thereafter.  His firm Link Communication Limited had ceased business for quite some time.  Yethe was able to retrieve these documents after his recollection as to some records being kept was triggered by Mr Yanâs cross-examinationon a related topic.  Amongst the documents he produced voluntarily, there were in fact some documents which discredited his earliertestimony, e.g. the package of the Hometown Food at Bundle Z.  Instead of disclosing documents selectively, he readily produced thewhole stack of documents for inspection by counsel.  During cross-examination, when faced with questions which he could not givesatisfactory explanations by way of answer, he did not hesitate to say so instead of prevaricating or engaging in a debate with counsel. I regard these as indicia of his truthfulness.  </p>    <p><a name="p216" class="para" id="p216">216.</a>  Mr Liao criticized Chan Chin Hung in his closing submissions about his failure to account for certain matters in his evidence. Having regard to the fact that the scanning and collecting of raw materials were not done by him alone, I do not find it surprisingthat he was unable to account for the Hometown Food packaging and leaflet, the use of Guru packaging material in Design E and thesource of the spore photograph on which he worked out the cracked spore design.  Since my ruling of 22 July 2004, the conduct ofthe evidence had subsequently been developed in a such manner that Mr Liao no had objection to evidence being led from Tong thatLiu had given a Japanese magazine to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant which contained two spore photographs.  Liu himself gave evidence to that effect.  It is now common ground that the rawmaterial for the cracked spore design in D-21 was a photograph from the Japanese magazine.  I do not think Chan Chin Hungâs failureto account for the origins of these materials should lead this court to the conclusion that he must have copied those from the MOor other drawings allegedly supplied by Liu.</p>    <p><a name="p217" class="para" id="p217">217.</a>  The apparent replacement of photographs in the design process had been explained by him in re-examination and given the lapse oftime it is not remarkable that he might not be able to recall the exact details.  The other points made by Mr Liao and Mr Yan inclosing submissions about his credibility are peripheral and having considered those, I do not think they have any material impacton Chan Chin Hungâs credibility.    </p>    <p><a name="p218" class="para" id="p218">218.</a>  The essence of Chan Chin Hungâs evidence is that he conceived the design for D-21 and LX-22 on his own without any reference tothe drawings by Liu or the Plaintiffs and he had not seen P-5A, LX-19, LX-20, J47, J48 in his process of creation.  I have alreadystated how he had explained to this court these designs were conceived and corroborated his evidence by the computer drawings.  Itis notable that had he been simply copying from materials from the Plaintiffs like J48 and LX-20 (both soft and hard copies weresaid to have been supplied), those steps would not be necessary and drawings like Y22, R95-7 would not exist.  There is no meritin Mr Yanâs submission that Chan Chin Hung could not explain how the designs were conceived.  This also answers his speculationthat although initially Chan Chin Hung did produce some designs of his own for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, they were all unsatisfactory and in the end, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and its designers were forced to copy from the materials of the Plaintiffs.  </p>    <p><a name="p219" class="para" id="p219">219.</a>  Chan Chin Hung is an independent witness.  He was only engaged by BBRD on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant for this job and had no further engagements from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant since 1999.  Whilst he understandably felt the need to defend his reputation as a designer when he learnt of the allegationsof the Plaintiffs, he did not have any financial, economic or commercial interest in the outcome of this trial.</p>    <p><a name="p220" class="para" id="p220">220.</a>  I accept the evidence of Chan Chin Hung and find accordingly that D-21 and LX-22 were designed by him without reference to the allegedcopyright materials of the Plaintiffs.  On the contrary, given the similarities and in the absence of credible explanation from thePlaintiffsâ witnesses, I am driven to conclude that LX-20 and J48 were produced by reference to D-21.  In other words, my findingis that they were produced after Liu had seen and obtained a copy of the D-21 packaging. P-1(J) was drawn by Liu by reference toLX-22 instead of the other way round.   </p>    <p><a name="p221" class="para" id="p221">221.</a>  I should mention that Tong and Law also gave evidence relevant to the ENHANVOL packaging and I took them into account.  I wouldnot give them as much weight as the evidence of Chan Chin Hung since they were not the designer and they gave evidence before BundlesY and Z were produced.  Their evidence as to the timing of certain events may not be that accurate.  On the whole, insofar as thereare discrepancies between their versions and that of Chan Chin Hung, I prefer the evidence of Chan Chin Hung.</p>    <p><a name="p222" class="para" id="p222">222.</a>  Turning to the design of the packages for ENHANOID, Liu and Chan gave evidence for the Plaintiffs to the effect that LX-27 was designedby them earlier than LX-28.  On the other hand, the defence case is that LX-28 was designed by the in-house designer Wong Yan Yanwithout any reference to LX-27.  The defence said that the design of LX-27 came into existence much later than LX-28.</p>    <p><a name="p223" class="para" id="p223">223.</a>  According to Wong Yan Yanâs evidence, the design for LX-28 could not have been finalized before 5 November 2001.  Her evidencewas that the design for what I shall call the spheroid device at the front panel of the box did not come into existence until 5 November2001 (Para.5 of her Second Witness Statement dated 29 July 2004, adopted as evidence in chief).  This was corroborated by the computerdrawing at R66. Wong Yan Yanâs evidence was that the design process started in October 2001.  The first computer drawing producedby her was dated 11 October 2001 (R57).  Although CYF produced an invoice dated 2 November 2001 issued by R &amp; C Company to the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in respect of the production of these boxes (Exhibit D-18), he testified that the invoice could have been issued priorto the finalization of the design of the box.  The full payment of the invoice was only made on 20 December 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p224" class="para" id="p224">224.</a>  There is a dispute as to whether the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff had sold ENHANOID to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in package LX-27 prior to the design of its own package LX-28.  The Plaintiffsâ case was that it had done so whilst theDefendantsâ case was that LX-27 only came into being in 2002.  A comparison between LX-27 and LX-28 shows that the two packageswere substantially similar although there is a variation in the ring at the spheroid device.  Liu testified that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff re-designed the package for ENHANOID and came up with LX-27 in August 2001 (transcript of 15 July 2004 p.274F; Bundle X-1,p.66T, 30 August 2004).  They started using package LX-27 for products sold in the end of October or early November 2001 (BundleX-1 p.67 E to I).  Since November 2001, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff sold ENHANOID to 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in LX-27 packing (Bundle X-1, p.71S).  Liu further said he first saw the LX-28 package in January 2002 (Bundle X-1 p.74M).</p>    <p><a name="p225" class="para" id="p225">225.</a>  For reasons given in the other parts of this judgment, I do not find the Plaintiffsâ witnesses to be credible or reliable andI cannot give weight to their evidence.  On LX-27, I find the story of Liu inherently improbable.  He testified that these designswere intended for Hong Kong market, hence the Chinese characters were in the form prevailed in Hong Kong (ç¹é«).  If that wereso, I fail to see why LX-27 would have the å­¸èçGuru logo at the side panel. Liu said in his own affirmation the Defendants repackagedthe same after the goods were brought here.  I can understand that in respect of LX-26 because of Tongâs objection to the nameçåº·å in LX-26.  But I have difficulty in accepting that in respect of LX-27.  If the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff had actually supplied ENHANOID in LX-27 since November 2001, I do not think the Defendants would do any repacking.</p>    <p><a name="p226" class="para" id="p226">226.</a>  According to Liu, LX-27 was designed about one month after LX-26 because he found LX-26 unsatisfactory.  Yet the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff continued to supply ENHANOID in LX-26 packing (LX-26 itself bears a manufacturing date of 18 January 2002) despite thealleged launch of LX-27.  I have no hesitation in rejecting Liuâs feeble explanation that this was to maintain the goodwill ofENHANOID associated with LX-26.  Given the alleged short time lapse between the marketing of ENHANOID in LX-26 and LX-27, there wassimply no commercial justification for such concern.  In fact, given that at that stage, the main market for ENHANOID was in HongKong (the permit for public sale of ENHANOID in mainland had yet to be issued) and the repacking in Hong Kong, I fail to see whythe 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff could not switch to LX-27 completely after November 2001 if LX-27 had actually been designed and used for packing ENHANOIDby November 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p227" class="para" id="p227">227.</a>  The Plaintiffs relied on a certificate dated 27 February 2004 (S37) and two delivery notes dated 6 October 2001 (S38) issued bya printing company in Shenzhen to support their case that package bearing same design as LX-27 were produced in early October 2001. The document was produced by way of hearsay evidence.  The makers had not been called to give evidence at the trial.  I was nottold why the makers could not be called.  I shall assume in favour of the Plaintiffs that they were in Shenzhen.  But that by itselfis not a good reason for not calling them.  As a matter of fact, all the witnesses called by the Plaintiffs were not based in HongKong.  I have reminded myself as to the various matters set out in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s49.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 49</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a> in assessing the weight to be attached to these documents.  I would also assume in favour of the Plaintiffs that the omission tocall those makers was not a deliberate attempt to prevent cross-examination of them by the defence.</p>    <p><a name="p228" class="para" id="p228">228.</a>  The Plaintiffs submitted that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">S38</a> was unchallenged evidence and it conclusively resolved the priority of LX-27 over LX-28.  I do not accept this submission.  Whilstit is correct that the Plaintiffsâ witnesses were not specifically cross-examined in respect of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">S38</a> and the Defendants had not issued any notice disputing the authenticity of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">S38</a> pursuant to Order 27 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 4</a>, I do not think this renders the contents of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">S38</a> as conclusive evidence.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">S38</a> was item 127 in the Plaintiffsâ List of Documents filed on 12 March 2004.  It was described as âcopy of éè²¨å® issued by æ·±å³å¸ä½³ä¿¡éå°åæéå¬å¸â. The effect of Order 27 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 4</a>, in the absence of a notice disputing authenticity, in respect of a copy document is set out under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 4(1)(b).</a>  The Defendants are deemed to admit that the copy is a true copy.</p>    <p><a name="p229" class="para" id="p229">229.</a>  It is not clear whether the Plaintiffs could pray in aid of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 4(1)(a)</a> which on its face only applies when a document is described in the list as an original document.  Counsel have not addressed me onthe point and I do find it necessary to decide it.  Assuming <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 4(1)(a)</a> is applicable, there is still a distinction between an admission as to the authenticity of a document and admission as to its contents(see <i>Style &amp; Hollander, Documentary Evidence,</i> 6<sup>th</sup> Edn (1997) p.334).  At the most, the Defendants must be taken to have admitted that a delivery note as per <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">S38</a> had been issued on 6 October 2001 by this company.  As regards whether the goods were actually delivered and whether those were thepackages for LX-27, there is no admission.  The weight to be attached to such a delivery note is still a matter for this court todecide in the light of all the evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p230" class="para" id="p230">230.</a>  As regards the omission to cross-examine Liu specifically about <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">S38</a> and his evidence that it related to LX-27, I respectfully adopt the approach of the Court of Appeal in <i>Tam Ka v Lam Hung Kwong</i> CACV 75 of 1999, 6 July 1999 and Deputy Judge Reyes (as he then was) in <i>Kaiifull Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue</i> HCIA 8 of 2001, 4 April 2002.  In the present context, it is quite plain that the Defendants advanced the case that the design forLX-27 came after LX-28 had launched into the market.  By necessary implication, the Defendants did not accept Liuâs evidence that<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">S38</a> relates to LX-27.  This should have been clear to everybody at the latest by the filing of the Re-amended Defence on 7 July 2004. Liu did not refer to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">S38</a> in his affirmations or witness statements.  He only adverted to it in his examination in chief on 8 July 2004.       </p>    <p><a name="p231" class="para" id="p231">231.</a>  In view of the preponderance of the other evidence adduced before me, I am unable to attach much weight to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s37.html" class="autolink_findacts">S37</a> and S<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">38</a>.  Even though <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">S38</a> appeared to be a contemporaneous document, I am not satisfied that it relates to LX-27.  Only Liu and Chan Hon Chung gave directevidence in this respect and for reasons given elsewhere, I do not find them to be credible witnesses.  Mr Liao also highlightedthe description of the goods in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">S38</a> as âçåº·å­¢å­æ²¹åè£çâ, hence more likely to be LX-27 than LX-26.  I have taken this into account but in the end I donot find this to be irrefutable evidence that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">S38</a> must relate to LX-27.  I would not speculate the circumstances under which <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">S38</a> was issued by the printing company.  All I need to do is to take this piece of evidence into account in the overall assessment ofthe factual materials.  Having done so, I reach a firm conclusion that on balance of probabilities the defence case as to the designof LX-28 is more likely to be the truth.    </p>    <p><a name="p232" class="para" id="p232">232.</a>  Another matter which the Plaintiffs urged this court to bear in mind in determining the priority of LX-28 and LX-27 is the insertand bottle label of LX-28.  Obviously, the insert and bottle label bore the front panel design of LX-27 as opposed to that of LX-28. If this court accepts that the ENHANOID first sold by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in the package box of LX-28 on 30 November 2001 were sold with such insert and bottle label, this would go a long way inestablishing the priority of LX-27. </p>    <p><a name="p233" class="para" id="p233">233.</a>  In my Reasons for Ruling of 23 September 2004, I held that due to manner in which the Defendants had conducted the case, they shouldnot be permitted to adduce additional evidence to impinge upon LX-28.  However, I also held that the Defendants should be allowedto make submissions about the insert and bottle label on existing evidence.  In addition to the points mentioned in Paragraph 15of my said Reasons for Ruling, Mr Chan referred to the reproduction of an article in Cancer Letters at p.14 and 15 of the insert. The date of that article, as stated in the insert, was 28 August 2002.  These points are unanswerable and it is quite plain to methat the insert and the bottle label used in LX-28 could not have been part of the ENHANOID sold by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on 30 November 2001 in their own packaging.  This is also apparent from the bottle shown in the advertisement at D335. Hence, the insert and bottle label could not advance the Plaintiffsâ case as to the priority of LX-27. </p>    <p><a name="p234" class="para" id="p234">234.</a>  Chan Hon Chung also gave evidence about LX-27.  In addition to the reasons set out in other parts of this judgment, I do not findhim to be a reliable witness because I find his story as to how the spheroid device at LX-27 was derived from the design drawingsat Q49 and Q 50 to be incredible.</p>    <p><a name="p235" class="para" id="p235">235.</a>  His evidence was that he created those design drawings in the first half of 2001 with reference to the document at C293 (viz. P-5A). He said Liu showed him that document in 1999 with the instruction to produce some computer drawing by reference to it.  Then Liutook the document away.  However, he did not consider it to be a task he needed to complete in a hurry and he did not produce Q49and Q 50 until the first part of 2001.  Liu did not talk to him about this task in between 1999 and 2001.  When Liu mentioned thetask in 2001, PW3 said he could recall the document without the need of seeing the same again.  He said apart from the document atC293, the design was produced by reference to the logo of a television company (exhibit P-15) and a photo of lingzhi spore takenunder electron microscope.</p>    <p><a name="p236" class="para" id="p236">236.</a>  I wish to make several points about his evidence on this topic.  It is simply incredible that he could have a recollection of therelevant drawing at C293 after a couple of years.  There are a number of drawings on C293 and only the one at the bottom left handcorner was relevant for the design at Q49 and Q50.  In fact, as far as I can see, only two features of that drawing at C293 bearsome vague resemblance to the design at Q49 and Q50, namely the ring shaped feature and the swirling element within the ring.  Theseare not the most striking features of that drawing.</p>    <p><a name="p237" class="para" id="p237">237.</a>  Until he gave evidence in the witness box, he did not mention making reference to C293 in the course of designing Q49 and Q50 andLX-27.  He did not mention this in his witness statements.  I do not accept his explanation that he omitted to mention it becausehe could not locate C293 when he made the witness statements.  He could easily have asked Liu for it and I believe that he wouldhave naturally done so if what he testified in the witness box was the truth.</p>    <p><a name="p238" class="para" id="p238">238.</a>  Further, if Q49 and Q50 were already produced in the first part of 2001, I did not understand why they were not used in LX-26. Liu and those responsible for changing the package to LX-26 to LX-27 must have found the spheroid device in LX-27 more appealingthan the broken spore with oil droplet device in LX-26.  Otherwise they would not change it.  Hence, if Q49 and Q50 were the preliminarydesign drawings for the spheroid device in LX-27, there was no reason why they were not adopted in the first version of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs package for ENHANOID.    </p>    <p><a name="p239" class="para" id="p239">239.</a>  I have carefully compared Q49, Q50 with the spheroid device in LX-27.  I cannot accept that the latter were derived from the formers. In my judgment, there is a quantum leap between the two and the evidence of the Plaintiffs had not accounted for the same satisfactorily. Some of the drawings attached to the witness statement of Liu concerning the spheroid design in LX-27 (e.g. Q21(k), Q21(l), Q21(m))were not attached to the witness statement of Chan Hon Chung.  In his examination in chief, Chan Hon Chung said they were drawingscreated by his colleague Cheung Hiu Jet (å¼µæå). She was however not called as a witness during the trial.  Although there isa confirmatory assignment P-16, I do not find that self-serving document to be a reliable piece of evidence with regard to authorshipas to those drawings.  In any event, those drawings could not account for the quantum leap mentioned earlier.  It is difficult tosee how Q21(k) and 21(l) were derived from Q49 or Q50.     </p>    <p><a name="p240" class="para" id="p240">240.</a>  On the other hand, the similarities between the spheroid device in LX-28 and that in LX-27 inevitably lead to the conclusion thatone was derived from the other.  The only question is which one was the original and which one was copy.  I find Wong Yan Yanâsexplanation as to how she came up with the design for that device by using the Japanese material at R26 much more convincing thanChan Hon Chungâs evidence.  The similarities between the device in LX-28 and the ball shape device identified by Wong Yan Yan inD-17 (viz.R26) speak for themselves.  Notwithstanding the criticism leveled against Wong Yan Yan in the Plaintiffsâ written submissions,I find her to be a credible witness and I accept her evidence as to the design for LX-28.  Given the derivation of LX-27 from LX-28,it is not surprising that there were common features between the two.  On the other hand, I do not find any significant similaritybetween the layout of LX-26 and LX-28 such that I could draw an inference of LX-28 being copied from LX-26.</p>    <p><a name="p241" class="para" id="p241">241.</a>  There is no doubt in my mind who was telling the truth here.  I have no hesitation in rejecting the evidence of Chan Hon Chung asto the conception of the design of LX-27.  I find on the balance of probabilities LX-28 was designed in the manner as explained byWong Yan Yan in early November 2001.  The device in LX-27 came afterwards and it was derived from LX-28 with a modification at thering.</p>    <p><a name="p242" class="para" id="p242">242.</a>  Turning to the copyright claim under item (i) in the particulars supplied during the opening based on the cracked spore of the Plaintiffs,the subject matter of the claim is the drawings at S247-251, the freehand sketches by Liu.  Although it is said to have been usedin LX-19 and LX-21, the case as pleaded does not rely on the copyright subsisting in the computer drawings for the cracked sporeas opposed to that subsisting in the freehand sketches.</p>    <p><a name="p243" class="para" id="p243">243.</a>  It is quite obvious that the computer artwork for the cracked spore design of the Plaintiffs was based on the processing of a sporephotograph from the Japanese magazine.  This is also the evidence of Chan Hon Chung.  There is no claim for copyright infringementin respect of the spore photograph.  The cracks in the freehand sketches are different from those in the computer drawings and thefinal products appearing in LX-19 and LX-21.</p>    <p><a name="p244" class="para" id="p244">244.</a>  I have found in earlier part of this judgment that LX-20 and J48 were produced by reference to D-21.  Hence, insofar as the ideainvolved in the creation of the cracked spore design is concerned, it was taken from D-21 instead of Liuâs freehand sketches. With D-21 available for reference, there was no need for the Plaintiffsâ designers (whether it was Chan Hon Chung or someone else)to refer to any freehand sketches to create the Plaintiffsâ version of cracked spore.  On the evidence, I am not satisfied thatthe computer artworks of the Plaintiffsâ cracked spore were derived from the freehand sketches.  It may well be the other way round.In any event, the mere copying of the idea does not constitute infringement.</p>    <p><a name="p245" class="para" id="p245">245.</a>  There was therefore no infringement of the copyright in the drawings at S247 to 251 even though the cracked spores found in theDefendantsâ leaflet did appear to be substantially similar to the one found in LX-19 and LX-21.</p>    <p><a name="p246" class="para" id="p246">246.</a>  The last item in the copyright claims is in respect of P-11.  Mr Chan did not dispute ownership.  He contended injunctive reliefshould not be granted as the use of the photographs in the leaflet was, based on Tongâs evidence, probably a mistake and it wouldbe disproportionate to order inquiry as to damages.</p>    <p><a name="p247" class="para" id="p247">247.</a>  I am not prepared to accept that the use of the leaflet was a mistake based on Tongâs evidence alone.  She was not personallyinvolved in the packing process and no corroborative evidence had been called on behalf of the Defendants.  I do not understand whythe Defendants still kept the old leaflets after they switched to new suppliers.  Having said that, I am willing to infer on theavailable evidence that the continued use of the leaflet was limited.  The Plaintiffs have continued to monitor the activities ofthe Defendants in the market and did not produce more substantial evidence of the photographs being used.</p>    <p><a name="p248" class="para" id="p248">248.</a>  In the absence of any undertaking offered by the Defendants, I will grant an injunction in respect of P-11.  I will also order deliveryup.  However, I agree that it is disproportionate to order an inquiry of damages.  There is no evidence to suggest that the Plaintiffssuffered any loss of profits as a result of the use of photographs by the Defendants after the termination of the distributorship. Having regard to the extent the photographs had been used in the past and the limited scale of infringement, the depreciation causedby the infringement to the value of the right as a chose in action is insignificant.  I will therefore award nominal damage in thesum of $1,000 in favour of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff.     </p>    <p><a name="p249" class="para" id="p249">249.</a>  Apart from the claim arising from P-11, all the other copyright claims of the Plaintiffs are dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Infringement of registered trade markèåæ¿æ´»</p>    <p><a name="p250" class="para" id="p250">250.</a>  I now deal with the claim based on the registered trade mark èåæ¿æ´».

The following opinion of Advocate General Cosmas in <i>Windsurfing Chiemsee v Huber, Windsurfing Chiemsee v Attenberger</i> ECJ Cases C-108 and 109/97 was cited by His Lordship at p.678-9 as a useful guidance as to the general legislative purpose behindthe new trade mark law.</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">27</td>                <td width="87%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">The main purpose of the system adopted by the Community legislature is to safeguard and protect the essential function of the trademark.  That function, as set out particularly in the seventh recital in the preamble and in Articles 2, 3(1)(b) and 3(3), 5(5) and10(2)(a) of the Directive is, first, to identify an undertaking's goods and to distinguish them from other similar products (distinguishingfunction of the trade mark) and, secondly, to establish a link between them and a particular undertaking (guarantee of origin). As the Court has pointed out on more than one occasion, the essential function of the trade mark is to guarantee to the consumeror end user the identity of the trade-marked product's origin by enabling him to distinguish it without any risk of confusion fromproducts of different origin.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td width="87%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">28</td>                <td width="87%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">In my view, it is in the light of precisely that function of trade marks that Article 3(1) of the Directive makes lack of distinctivecharacter an independent ground for refusal or invalidity of a mark (paragraph (b)) but also provides for a more specific groundfor invalidity or refusal in respect of marks which consist exclusively of descriptive indications (paragraph (c)) or which havebecome customary in the current language or in the trade (paragraph (d)).</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td width="87%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">29</td>                <td width="87%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">Although in the text of the Directive, paragraphs (c) and (d) are, strictly speaking, distinct from paragraph (b), in essence theydescribe more particular or more specific or simply more typical instances of lack of distinctive character in a mark which explainand clarify the general concept of lack of distinctive character but do not introduce new or fundamentally different ideas.  Thesame conclusion follows if Article 3(1) is interpreted alongside Article 3(3), under which a trade mark is not to be refused registrationor declared invalid under paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of Article 3(1) if it has subsequently acquired a distinctive character by reasonof the use which has been made of it.  In other words, in the circumstances set out in those paragraphs, which are dealt with togetherin Article 3(3), the trade mark subsequently acquires the quality which it initially lacked and the absence of which prevented itfrom being registered or enabled it to be struck off the register - namely distinctive character.

The Advocate Generalthen alluded to the approach in making such distinction at p.338 to 339,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt seems obvious that there is no clear-cut distinction between indications which designate a characteristic and those which merelyallude suggestively to it.

Broadly speaking, they mean âgerminationâ and âactivationârespectively.  Hence, in the English version of the packaging and inserts contained in the box, the expression was translated asâgermination activationâ.  It was not an expression commonly used in Hong Kong prior to the sale of the Plaintiffsâ producthere.</p>    <p><a name="p268" class="para" id="p268">268.</a>  The application for registration was made in December 2002.  By then the expression had been used in respect of the Plaintiffsâproducts.  As stated in the cases mentioned above, such usage might have a bearing on the meaning of the expression.  In this connection,the Defendants made the following submission.  Based on the use of the expression in the advertising material and packaging box upto 24 December 2002, an average consumer (who were reasonably well informed and reasonably observant and circumspect) of lingzhiproducts would understand the expression as designating or identifying the process whereby the pollens are âactivatedâ throughor by means of âgerminationâ.  It was further submitted that even the Plaintiffs themselves had used the term in a descriptivesense in all their packaging boxes (some of which were available in the Hong Kong market), commercial and academic literature torefer to a theory or the technology of which they claim to be the author or inventor.   </p>    <p><a name="p269" class="para" id="p269">269.</a>  The Defendants cited the following dicta of Laddie J in <i>Jeryl Lynn TM</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20FSR%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] FSR 491</a>, Para.21 at p.501-2,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAlthough it is not determinative, a factor which can be taken into account in deciding whether or not a sign denotes trade originother than type is the action taken by the proprietor to teach the public that that is what the sign is meant to convey...

They reliedon the fact that the Plaintiffs were the first one to use the term "èåæ¿æ´»" as a whole to refer to their products.  Liu gaveevidence that the term "èåæ¿æ´»" had all along been used by Plaintiffs as their trademark and people understood "èåæ¿æ´»"as referring to å­¸èéè.  It was contended that if "èåæ¿æ´»" had not been used as a trade mark, the Defendants would nothave insisted on putting the English version of the term, i.e. "Germination Activation" on the packaging after being sued for trademarkinfringement.</p>    <p><a name="p271" class="para" id="p271">271.</a>  With respect, I find most of the arguments of the Plaintiffs in this respect to be self-serving and circuitous. Liuâs evidence,apart from the problems as to his overall credibility, is bare assertion on his part and cannot stand in the light of the overwhelmingevidence as to the actual use of the expression in packaging and advertising material.  For the same reason, I attach little weightto the fact that the Defendants put âGermination Activationâ in their packages after infringement action was launched by thePlaintiffs.  The fact that the Plaintiffs were the first persons to use the expression in relation to lingzhi products is neitherhere nor there.  As pointed out by Jacob J and Laddie J, evidence of use cannot be equated with evidence of distinctiveness.    </p>    <p><a name="p272" class="para" id="p272">272.</a>  In my judgment, the evidence clearly shows that the expression âèåæ¿æ´»â had been used in the packaging and advertisingmaterial (both produced by the Plaintiffs and the Defendants) as description of the technological process which enhanced the extractionof bio-active substance from lingzhi spore.  A typical example is the insert in ENHANOID at Bundle V 116.  It contained an explanationof the process of  âèåæ¿æ´»â.  Another example is the reference to this expression at the side panel of the package boxLX-22 for ENHANVOL.  It introduced the product as follows,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âãçåº·æ´»ãæ¯ééä¸çé¦åµçãèåæ¿æ´»ãççç©å·¥ç¨ç§å­¸æè¡ â¦ æåçè¶é«æ´»æ§çå¨ç ´ç§ç´éèå­¢å­ç²¾è¯â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>An English translation to the same effect can be found in the side panel of the package box for ENHAHOID,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âENHANOID is the essence of Ganoderma lucidum spores.  The scientists of the Food Engineering Research Centre of the State Ministryof Education at Zhongshan University have developed the proprietary bio-technology, âGermination Activationâ [the English renderingof the expression âèåæ¿æ´»â] on ganoderma spores, which leads to a large quantity of highly bio-active substances producingwithin the sporesâ¦.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In this connection, I find the observations of Laddie J in <i>Jeryl Lynn TM</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20FSR%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] FSR 491</a>, Para.21 (cited above) particularly apposite.</p>    <p><a name="p273" class="para" id="p273">273.</a>  The brand names of the products were clearly ENHANVOL and ENHANOID.  On the other hand, âèåæ¿æ´»â was used in these materialsto refer to one of the process by which the goods were produced.  In my view, the expression âèåæ¿æ´»â did not serve asa guarantee to the consumer or end user the identity of the product's origin.  I see no basis for suggesting that it had more significancein distinguishing the Plaintiffsâ product from other similar products as compared with the other descriptive expressions like âå¨ç ´ç§âor  âç´éèå­¢å­ç²¾è¯â. </p>    <p><a name="p274" class="para" id="p274">274.</a>  I put myself in the shoe of an average Hong Kong consumer and ask the question what did the expression  âèåæ¿æ´»â indicateas at 24 December 2002.  As I said, it was not an expression commonly used in Hong Kong although one might have some vague idea thatliterally it had something to do with germination and activation.  Considering the actual use of the expression in connection withlingzhi products prior to 24 December 2002, I find that the average consumer would understand the expression to mean the technologicalprocess by which highly bio-active substances were extracted from lingzhi spore.</p>    <p><a name="p275" class="para" id="p275">275.</a>  Based on such finding as to the meaning of the expression as at 24 December 2002, the next question is whether those words werecapable of distinguishing the goods of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff from those of the others.  In my judgment, the expression âèåæ¿æ´»â was initially capable of distinguishing thegoods of a trader when first used in Hong Kong due to its novelty.  However, by 24 December 2002, due to its continuous use in themanner mentioned above, in the context of lingzhi products, to a significant proportion of the average consumers, it came to be knownas a generic description of a technological process by which lingzhi spore products were manufactured.  As such, they would findit impossible to say that the expression identify for them the goods as originating from a particular undertaking.  The sign thereforecame within the same category as <i>Jeryl Lynn</i> and <i>Bach Flower Remedies</i> and was not registrable by reason of Section 11(1)(a).  </p>    <p><a name="p276" class="para" id="p276">276.</a>  Given that conclusion, there is no need to consider the objection under the other limbs of Section 11(1).  However, for the sakeof completeness, I would mention that even if the expression were somehow capable of distinguishing the goods of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, I would find the objection under Section 11(1)(b) and (c) established by reason of the descriptive nature of the expression. The evidence of actual use of the expression does not indicate that it had acquired a distinctive character.  Hence, Section 11(2)could not be relied upon to resist the challenge from the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p277" class="para" id="p277">277.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs claim based on infringement of trade mark therefore fails and the Defendants succeeds in their counterclaim for a declarationunder Section 53(1) of TMO.</p>    <p class="heading">Malicious falsehood</p>    <p><a name="p278" class="para" id="p278">278.</a>  Broadly speaking, a plaintiff has to prove three elements before liability for malicious falsehood is established,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">falsehood;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">malice;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">damages.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>See <i>Kaye v Robertson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%20FSR%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] FSR 62</a>; <i>Hong Kong Wing On Travel Service v Hong Thai Citizens Travel Services</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20HKLRD%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 HKLRD 481.</a></p>    <p><a name="p279" class="para" id="p279">279.</a>  On the element of falsehood, the sting of the GMP advertisements as pleaded in Paragraph 43 of the Consolidated Re-amended Statementof Claim was the statements to the effect that,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the capsules and the hologram label of the genuine ENHANVOL would bear the mark ENHANVOL;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the genuine ENHANVOL has not been sold in mainland China.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p280" class="para" id="p280">280.</a>  It is not disputed that statements to such effect were made in the GMP advertisements.

When it ordered the same from the Plaintiffs, the capsules and the hologram bore the marks âGPâ, âå¤©ç¶­â,âå¤©ç¶­å¥åº·ç¢åâ.  When it shifted to new supplier(s), the mark on the capsules and hologram changed to ENHANVOL.  To putit neutrally, such a change on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, in my judgment, must have aimed at distinguishing the goods supplied by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff from those supplied by the new supplier(s).</p>    <p><a name="p282" class="para" id="p282">282.</a>  Further, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff had been selling ENHANVOL in mainland China although the Chinese brand name used was âå­¸èçµèâ instead of  âçåº·æ´»â(see âLX-20â).  Tong admitted that the Defendants were aware of that before the GMP advertisements were placed.</p>    <p><a name="p283" class="para" id="p283">283.</a>  The combined effect of the statements was that the Plaintiffsâ products could be viewed as counterfeit by virtue of having differentcapsules or holograms and having been sold in Mainland China.</p>    <p><a name="p284" class="para" id="p284">284.</a>  When she gave evidence, Tong tried to explain that the GMP advertisement were not targeted against the Plaintiffs.  In her examinationin chief, she testified that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was taking the opportunity of changing certain aspects of the packaging to place the advertisements to remind customersto watch out for counterfeit products as they had learnt about such products in mid 2002.  Upon cross-examination, she accepted thatthey had taken into account of the Plaintiffs but she still maintained that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was also dealing with counterfeits.  She denied that they targeted against the Plaintiffs.  She said the advertisementswere placed to address the concern of the retailers about the change in packaging.</p>    <p><a name="p285" class="para" id="p285">285.</a>  She further testified that at that time, she worried that some people might purchase the old version of ENHANVOL at a lower pricein Hong Kong and sell the same in mainland China for resale back to Hong Kong.  Tong was trying to account for the statement thatthe genuine products had not been sold in mainland China.  But that seems to me to be a contrived and tenuous explanation.  I haddifficulties in seeing why someone intending to sell the old products had to be so convoluted.  On being questioned further, Tongaccepted that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant should not have any worry about such sale, if any.</p>    <p><a name="p286" class="para" id="p286">286.</a>  I find Tongâs explanation about the purpose of GMP advertisement disingenuous and I do not believe her.  I am driven by the objectivecircumstances surrounding the advertisements to conclude that they were specifically designed to guard against competition from thePlaintiffs using the name ENHANVOL.  First of all, the timing of the advertisements is telling.  It was shortly after the break-upbetween the Plaintiffs and the Defendants and more importantly after the Plaintiffs had taken serious steps to object the Defendantsâuse of the names ENHANVOL in Hong Kong, including the letter dated 5 October 2002 and the declarations published in newspaper on4 December 2002.  The Plaintiffs had also recently appointed Care &amp; Health Limited as sole distributor in Hong Kong on 1 December2002.  I do not think it coincidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant published the GMP advertisements around the same time. Judging from what happened during that part of December 2002, theparties were in substance undertaking media campaign against each other.</p>    <p><a name="p287" class="para" id="p287">287.</a>  Secondly, the GMP advertisement themselves made it abundantly clear that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant wished to convey a clear message to the public that FERC ceased to have any role in relation to ENHANVOL.  Bearing in mindthe two changes in packaging highlighted by the advertisements were the distinctions between the old version supplied by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and the new version sold by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, I cannot help inferring that the imputation as to counterfeit was intended by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to be cast against any future sale of ENHANVOL by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff or its distributor.  It is noteworthy that even on Tongâs evidence, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not obtain actual proof of any other counterfeit products at that time and she therefore had no way to tell whetherthe capsule and hologram were distinguishing features from such other counterfeit.      </p>    <p><a name="p288" class="para" id="p288">288.</a>  Thirdly, if the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant merely sought to inform the consumers about its change of packaging, the objective could be achieved by stating that thecapsule and hologram had been changed as from a particular date instead of urging the consumers to watch out for counterfeit.  Thisalso answers the submission of Mr Chan that the advertisements were only about the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs own goods as opposed to casting imputation on the goods of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p289" class="para" id="p289">289.</a>  Fourthly, there is no satisfactory explanation about the statement to the effect that genuine ENHANVOL products had not been soldin mainland China.  I mentioned about Tongâs attempt in that regard and I have rejected her evidence.  In my view, that was clearlyintended to be a reference to the goods of the Plaintiffsâ.  </p>    <p><a name="p290" class="para" id="p290">290.</a>  I therefore find that the GMP advertisements implicated that if the Plaintiffs were to sell ENHANVOL, they would be counterfeit.</p>    <p><a name="p291" class="para" id="p291">291.</a>  In the light of the Plaintiffsâ connection with ENHANVOL in the past and my conclusion as to ownership of the Hong Kong goodwillpertaining to ENHANVOL, the implications were false.</p>    <p><a name="p292" class="para" id="p292">292.</a>  I now move on to deal with malice.  As summarized by Chu J in <i>Hong Kong Wing On Travel Service v Hong Thai Citizens Travel Services</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20HKLRD%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 HKLRD 481</a> at p.491, there are two alternative limbs by which malice can be proved.  A defendant would be taken as acting maliciously if,</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">he knew when he published the words that they were false or he was reckless as to whether they were true of not; or</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">he did so for the purpose not of advancing his own interest but of injuring the plaintiff.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>It is important to note that dominant motive to injure is required for the second limb but not for the first limb (see <i>Wilts United Diaries v Thomas Robinson &amp; Sons</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1957%5d%20RPC%20220" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1957] RPC 220</a> at 237; <i>Hong Kong Wing On Travel Service v Hong Thai Citizens Travel Services</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20HKLRD%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 HKLRD 481</a> at p.407D and <i>Oriental Machinery v Choi Kin On</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%203%20HKC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 3 HKC 398</a> at p.416 Para.48).</p>    <p><a name="p293" class="para" id="p293">293.</a>  In the present context, Tong testified that at the time when the GMP advertisements were placed, she believed the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to be the owner of the goodwill pertaining to the names ENHANVOL and çåº·æ´».  In other words, she believed the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was the only person who was entitled to use these names in Hong Kong and the use of the names on other products would tantamountto counterfeit.  This clearly has a bearing on the question of malice under the first limb.</p>    <p><a name="p294" class="para" id="p294">294.</a>  The burden of proof is on the Plaintiffs to establish malice.  If they are relying on the first limb, they bear the burden of provingknowledge or recklessness on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  Have they succeeded in the light of the evidence of Tong?  In my judgment, on the totality of the evidence before me,the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had the requisite knowledge of falsity in publishing the statements.  Firstly, under the Distributorship Agreements, the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was prohibited from using these names within three years after the end of the agreements.  Although the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant disputed the scope of the agreements, I do not think it is a bona fide dispute in view of what I said above in the discussionon breach of those agreements, particularly my inference that the parties had been acting on the basis that ENHANVOL andçåº·æ´»were part of the ãå¤©ç¶­çãåè£.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant did not give evidence and therefore there is no explanation as to how he could honestly reckon in December 2002 that the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had the right to use those names in Hong Kong and to call the Plaintiffsâ goods counterfeit despite the terms of theagreements.</p>    <p><a name="p295" class="para" id="p295">295.</a>  Secondly, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had been warned by the letter dated 5 October 2002 that there would be objections from the Plaintiffs as to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant continued use of the names ENHANVOL and çåº·æ´».  At the very least, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant knew the Plaintiffs claimed to have the right to use the names.</p>    <p><a name="p296" class="para" id="p296">296.</a>  Thirdly, there was simply no justification for stating that ENHANVOL had never been sold in mainland China.  Even on Tongâs ownevidence, she knew that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff sold ENHANVOL in mainland China.  The implications that those goods sold by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff were counterfeit had no basis whatsoever.</p>    <p><a name="p297" class="para" id="p297">297.</a>  Fourthly, in view of my misgivings about Tongâs evidence mentioned in other parts of this judgment, I cannot accept her testimonyabout her belief as to ownership of goodwill in December 2002.  In any event, she was not the only director of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was also a director and he did not give evidence as to his belief in this regard.  I shall discuss later his role in the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in dealing with his personal liability.      </p>    <p><a name="p298" class="para" id="p298">298.</a>  It is therefore not necessary to consider malice under the second limb.  I note that in <i>Guangdong Foodstuffs Import &amp; Export (Group) Corp v. Tung Fook Wine (1982) Co. Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%203%20HKLRD%20545" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 3 HKLRD 545</a> at p.644I, Cheung J (as he then was) found dominant purpose established in a situation similar to the present one.  His Lordshipsaid,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is clear that Shiwan Brewery had overstepped the line of simply protecting its own interest.  The announcement that Zu MiaoBrand wines were the genuine articles and the reference to prevention of imitation is clearly for the purpose of harming GDF in respectof wine produced under the Pearl River Bridge trade mark.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The same can easily be said with regard to the GMP advertisements given my conclusion that they were targeted against the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p299" class="para" id="p299">299.</a>  I therefore hold that the element of malice was established.</p>    <p><a name="p300" class="para" id="p300">300.</a>  Turning to damages, the Plaintiffs relied on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 24(1)(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Ordinance</a>.  The GMP advertisements were in writing and the question is whether they were calculated to cause pecuniary damages in the sensethat it would be a likely result.  If the answer is yes, there is no need to prove special damages.</p>    <p><a name="p301" class="para" id="p301">301.</a>  Given the nature of the sting in the GMP advertisements, I can readily see that they were likely to cause pecuniary damages to thePlaintiffs in the normal course of trade if the Plaintiffs planned to sell its products under the names ENHANVOL or çåº·æ´» inHong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p302" class="para" id="p302">302.</a>  However, the situation is complicated by the fact that for practical reasons outlined in Paragraph 118 of first affirmation of Liufiled in HCA 4651 of 2002 (affirmed on 23 August 2003), the Plaintiffs had changed the packaging of products sold in Hong Kong toLX-70.  The new packaging used the names Lingzhimaster and å­¸èçµè.  It was said by Liu,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âBecause the Defendants are and having been using a packaging or get-up that is identical or substantially identical to that ofthe Plaintiffs to deceive and/or mislead the public into thinking that the Defendantsâ said lingzhi products were the genuine products,the Plaintiffs have recently changed the packaging of their said lingzhi products at the request of their new distributor, C &amp;H, so as to distinguish the Plaintiffsâ said lingzhi products from the Defendantsâ counterfeit products.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p303" class="para" id="p303">303.</a>  I do not think this complication could change the result.  To start with, the change of packaging on the part of the Plaintiffsdid not take place until sometime close to August 2003.  Moreover, even with the change of packaging, the Plaintiffs suffered pecuniarydamages in terms of being deprived from tapping the goodwill associated with the names ENHANVOL or çåº·æ´» whereas the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant continued to do so.  It has to be remembered that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and the Plaintiffs (through its new distributor) are now competitors in the market.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had thereby gained an unjustifiable head start in the competition.</p>    <p><a name="p304" class="para" id="p304">304.</a>  I therefore hold that damage is established.  The Plaintiffs therefore succeed in the claim for malicious falsehood.  Although MrChan submitted that there is no evidence that the wrong would be repeated once a determination is made by this court on the rightsof the parties, no undertaking has been offered.  I agree with Mr Liao that an injunction should be granted in such circumstances.

In essence, my conclusion is that the law in Hong Kong is the same as thosestated by Chadwick LJ in <i>MCA Records Inc v Charly Records Ltd (No 5)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20BCLC%2093" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 BCLC 93.</a>  Those principles have been applied in England and a recent illustration in the context of intellectual properties claims is <i>Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Princo Digital Disc GmbH</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%202%20BCLC%2050" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 2 BCLC 50.</a> </p>    <p><a name="p311" class="para" id="p311">311.</a>  For ease of reference, I respectfully set out the summary of law by Chadwick LJ below,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[47] In <i>Mentmore Manufacturing Co Ltd v National Merchandising Manufacturing Co Inc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2089%20DLR%20%283d%29%20195" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 89 DLR (3d) 195</a> the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada described the question whether, and if so in what circumstances, a director should be liablewith the company as a joint tortfeasor as "a very difficult question of policy". Le Dain J, delivering the judgment of the court,said this (at 202): "On the one hand, there is the principle that an incorporated company is separate and distinct in law from itsshareholders, directors and officers, and it is in the interests of the commercial purposes served by the incorporated enterprisethat they should as a general rule enjoy the benefit of limited liability afforded by incorporation.  On the other hand, there isthe principle that everyone should be answerable for his tortious acts." Plainly, it is necessary, in the individual case, to achievea balance between those two considerations.  Equally plainly, the judge appreciated that.  As he put it in his judgment (at para[15]): "inquiries into the matter will or may involve an 'elusive question' turning on the particular facts of the case, and whoseresolution may in turn involve the making of a policy decision as to the side of the line on which the case ought to fall."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[48] It is because there is a balance to be struck on the facts of each case that it is dangerous for an appellate court to appearto attempt a formulation of the principles which may come to be regarded as prescriptive.  But I think it can be said with some confidencethat the following propositions are supported by the authorities to which I have referred.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[49] First, a director will not be treated as liable with the company as a joint tortfeasor if he does no more than carry out hisconstitutional role in the governance of the company - that is to say, by voting at board meetings.  That, I think, is what policyrequires if a proper recognition is to be given to the identity of the company as a separate legal person.  Nor, as it seems to me,will it be right to hold a controlling shareholder liable as a joint tortfeasor if he does no more than exercise his power of controlthrough the constitutional organs of the company - for example by voting at general meetings and by exercising the powers to appointdirectors.  Aldous LJ suggested in <i>Standard Chartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping Corp (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 1 Lloyd's Rep 218</a> at 235 - in a passage to which I have referred - that there are good reasons to conclude that the carrying out of the duties of adirector would never be sufficient to make a director liable.  For my part, I would hesitate to use the word "never" in this field;but I would accept that, if all that a director is doing is carrying out the duties entrusted to him as such by the company underits constitution, the circumstances in which it would be right to hold him liable as a joint tortfeasor with the company would berare indeed.  That is not to say, of course, that he might not be liable for his own separate tort, as Aldous LJ recognised at paras[16] and [17] of his judgment in the <i>Pakistan National Shipping</i> case.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[50] Second, there is no reason why a person who happens to be a director or controlling shareholder of a company should not be liablewith the company as a joint tortfeasor if he is not exercising control through the constitutional organs of the company and the circumstancesare such that he would be so liable if he were not a director or controlling shareholder.  In other words, if, in relation to thewrongful acts which are the subject of complaint, the liability of the individual as a joint tortfeasor with the company arises fromhis participation or involvement in ways which go beyond the exercise of constitutional control, then there is no reason why theindividual should escape liability because he could have procured those same acts through the exercise of constitutional control. As I have said, it seems to me that this is the point made by Aldous J (as he then was) in <i>PLG Research Ltd v Ardon International Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20FSR%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] FSR 197.</a></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[51] Third, the question whether the individual is liable with the company as a joint tortfeasor - at least in the field of intellectualproperty - is to be determined under principles identified in <i>CBS Songs Ltd v Amstrad Consumer Electronics plc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20All%20ER%20484" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 All ER 484</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20AC%201013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] AC 1013</a> and <i>Unilever plc v Gillette (UK) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20RPC%20583" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] RPC 583.</a>  In particular, liability as a joint tortfeasor may arise where, in the words of Lord Templeman in <i>CBS Songs v Amstrad</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20All%20ER%20484" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 All ER 484</a> at 496,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20AC%201013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] AC 1013</a> at 1058 to which I have already referred, the individual "intends and procures and shares a common design that the infringement takesplace".</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[52] Fourth, whether or not there is a separate tort of procuring an infringement of a statutory right, actionable at common law,an individual who does "intend, procure and share a common design" that the infringement should take place may be liable as a jointtortfeasor.  As Mustill LJ pointed out in <i>Unilever v Gillette</i>, procurement may lead to a common design and so give rise to liability under both heads.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[53] In the light of the authorities which I have reviewed I am satisfied that no criticism can be made of the test which the judgeapplied.  But, in my view, the test can, perhaps, be expressed more accurately in these terms: in order to hold Mr Young liable asa joint tortfeasor for acts of copying, and of issuing to the public, in respect of which CRL was the primary infringer and in circumstancesin which he was not himself a person who committed or participated directly in those acts, it was necessary and sufficient to findthat he procured or induced those acts to be done by CRL or that, in some other way, he and CRL joined together in concerted actionto secure that those acts were done.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p312" class="para" id="p312">312.</a>  The liability of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant has to be determined by reference to his role in each of the tortious acts of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  Although the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant chose not to give evidence, there is evidence before me as to his role in the operation of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant generally and also specifically in relation to the media campaign in December 2002.  Further, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had filed substantial witness statements and affirmations and he was present at least during the initial part of the trial. His decision not to give evidence was only made known on 17 November 2004 and obviously took Mr Liao by surprise.  I note that inthe cross-examination of Tong, Mr Liao had proceeded on the basis he could have the chance to question the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant at a later stage about the organization and the affairs of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  Given these circumstances, the court can legitimately draw inference against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant that even if he were to give evidence, he could not displace certain conclusions that the court can derive from evidencealready placed before it (see <i>Ip Man Shan Henry v Ching Hing Construction Co Ltd (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20HKC%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 HKC 256</a> at Paras.155-6; upheld on appeal in CACV 183 of 2003, 4 Feb 2005 at Para.30).    </p>    <p><a name="p313" class="para" id="p313">313.</a>  As regards the passing off claims, the relevant acts were the sale and promotion of lingzhi products not manufactured by the Plaintiffsunder the names ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», ENHANOID and çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹.  Even on Tongâs evidence, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant played a key part in engaging the factories in mainland China.  He also took part in deciding to continue to use thesenames after breaking up with the Plaintiffs.  Further, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs personal involvement in the promotion of the products supplied by the new factories is evidenced by his participationin the press conference of 12 December 2002.  Not only did the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant personally took part in that conference as chairman of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, it is also a reasonable inference that as the only person in 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant who had some medical background, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant marshalled support from a number of medical experts from the mainland and procured their attendance at the press conference. On the evidence available, I have no difficulty in concluding that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is personally liable as a joint tortfeasor in respect of the promotion of lingzhi products supplied by other suppliersunder the names ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», ENHANOID and çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹ at that press conference.        </p>    <p><a name="p314" class="para" id="p314">314.</a>  The Plaintiffsâ passing off claims of course go beyond what happened at the press conference of 12 December 2002.  There wereother promotion activities of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant which the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant might or might not participate personally.  Also there is no evidence to show that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant directly involved himself in the sales activities of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant although he was definitely involved in procuring supply from factories in the mainland.  On promotion of the products,it is the defenceâs own evidence that some consumers identified the products sold by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as products of âæ°åé¾é«çâ.  In the absence of any explanation from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, I infer that he must have been quite involved in the advertisement and promotion of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs products to generate such a response from the consumers.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant also took part in deciding the change from âèåæ¿æ´»â to âGermination activationâ in the packaging of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs products.</p>    <p><a name="p315" class="para" id="p315">315.</a>  I agree with Mr Liao that Tong obviously tried to downplay the involvement of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in her evidence.  Tong was cross-examined by Mr Liao about the applications for registration of certain marks associatedwith ENHANVOL in September 2002 by a person called Sun Kin trading as Yue Kok Company.  Sun Kin is a sister of the sister-in-lawof the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  Tong said Sun did so without any prior consultation or consent from the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant or herself.  I find this incredible.  Those applications were clearly conceived as some sort of pre-emptive strikes onthe part of the Defendants in their anticipated battle with the Plaintiffs.  One of the applications was in respect of ENHANOID andçåº·å­¢å­æ²¹.  Neither Sun Kin nor the sister-in-law had any interest in the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and it is reasonable to infer that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant must have been involved in procuring such applications. </p>    <p><a name="p316" class="para" id="p316">316.</a>  Another instance where relatives of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was involved regarding the activities of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was the registration of certain trademarks used by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant under the name of a company called ENHANVOL International Limited.  A brother of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was the director of that company whilst the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and his wife were not.  When Mr Liao cross-examined Tong about these affairs, she said she was not clear as they were handledby the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p317" class="para" id="p317">317.</a>  At all material times, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was aware of the objection from the Plaintiffs in respect of the use of the names ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», ENHANOID and çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹by the Defendants after the termination of the distributorship.  The letter of 5 October 2002 from the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant could not have escaped his attention.  Up to December 2002, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant directly dealt with Liu in finalizing the accounts between the parties as evidenced by P-4(A) to (D).  The Plaintiffs issuedthe writ in HCA No.4651 of 2002 on 12 December 2002 and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was party to the action.  He pursued litigation with the Plaintiffs in mainland China and one of the actions was an applicationto expunge the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs registration of çåº·æ´» in the mainland (see P-6).  He lobbied the staff of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff in early January 2003 as evidenced by the telephone record produced by Yuen Kin Ping.  It is plain to me that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was much more than a mere inactive player in the affairs of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant who only interested in research as Tong would want this court to believe.</p>    <p><a name="p318" class="para" id="p318">318.</a>  The right to use the names is one of the major disputes between the parties after the breaking down of their relationship.  Themedia campaign in early December 2002 is clearly one of the early skirmishes in the battle.  As illustrated by his part in the pressconference, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was very much engaged in the manoeuvre of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  Although he might not be the actual person who instructed the salesperson or the staff in the warehouse, he certainlyplayed an important part in the crucial decision that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would continue to use these names on products not supplied by the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p319" class="para" id="p319">319.</a>  In my judgment, on the available evidence, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was acting more than exercising his constitutional function as a director of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  It was a conscious decision on his part to procure supply from other factories and apply the names ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´»,ENHANOID and çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹to these products with his eyes open as to the objections from the Plaintiffs.  He can properly be regardedas having procured the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to promote and sell products not supplied by the Plaintiffs under the names ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», ENHANOID and çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹and therefore liable for those acts as a joint tortfeasor.</p>    <p><a name="p320" class="para" id="p320">320.</a>  In respect of malicious falsehood, the relevant acts are the publication of the GMP advertisements.  Those advertisements were partof the media campaign.  For reasons given above, I find on the balance of probabilities that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was very much involved in the battle against the Plaintiffs in December 2002.  The change of the marks printed on the capsulesmust have been a strategy approved by him as he dealt with the factories on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  The GMP advertisements highlighted this and the improved standard of the factories involved in production and their GMPcertification.  It also referred to co-operation with Shanghai No.2 Medical University.  These were again matters most likely tobe handled by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  I do not believe that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant played no part in commissioning the GMP advertisements.  It was again one of the skirmishes and I infer that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had personally endorsed the same to be published.  He is also liable as a joint tortfeasor by procuring the same.</p>    <p><a name="p321" class="para" id="p321">321.</a>  In respect of the infringement of the copyright of P-11, on the evidence available, it was a relatively minor matter which couldbe part of the day-to-day operation of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  I would not infer any direct involvement or procurement by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in this instance.  Hence, he is not liable for copyright infringement.</p>    <p class="heading">Results</p>    <p><a name="p322" class="para" id="p322">322.</a>  To sum up, the Plaintiffs succeed against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants in the passing off claim regarding the names ENHANVOL, çåº·æ´», ENHANOID and çåº·å­¢å­æ²¹ and the claim for maliciousfalsehood.  The Plaintiffs succeed against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in respect of the breach of Agreement A but the remedy is confined to damages.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff also succeeds against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in respect of the copyright claim for infringement of the copyright of P-11.  There would also be an order for the rectificationof the trademark registration in respect of ENHANVOL in favour of the Plaintiffs as indicated.</p>    <p><a name="p323" class="para" id="p323">323.</a>  For reasons given, this court makes no order regarding the double actionability claim.</p>    <p><a name="p324" class="para" id="p324">324.</a>  Save as above, the Plaintiffsâ claims are dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p325" class="para" id="p325">325.</a>  The Defendantsâ counterclaim regarding the trademark registration for èåæ¿æ´» also succeed and there shall be a declarationof invalidity.</p>    <p><a name="p326" class="para" id="p326">326.</a>  Counsel should be able to settle a draft order in the light of this judgment.  I direct an agreed draft order be submitted to thiscourt for approval within 14 days.  If parties cannot reach agreement, parties should submit their respective draft within 14 daystogether with written submissions.  Unless parties ask for a hearing on the matter, I will make the order within 7 days thereafterafter considering the partiesâ written submissions and drafts.</p>    <p><a name="p327" class="para" id="p327">327.</a>  As regards costs, the Plaintiffs succeed in some causes of action but fail in others.  The Defendants succeed in the counterclaim. There are unusual features in the case.  It is fair to say a lot of evidence led in the trial was about the copyright claims.  Thelate disclosure of the defence case and late production of evidence on the part of the Defendants must have an impact on costs. Likewise I should take into account that on my findings, the Plaintiffs have tried to mislead this court not only in the testimonyof their witnesses but also in the documents produced.  If the case were confined to the passing off, registered trademarks and maliciousfalsehood claims, it might have been completed in last summer within the time originally allocated.  But that is of course said withthe benefit of hindsight.  Another unusual features in the present case is the number of interlocutory applications that I have todeal with at the trial.  I have made cost orders in respect of some applications but not all.  Taking all the circumstances intoaccount, I will make a costs order nisi that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants shall pay Â¼ of the Plaintiffsâ costs with certificate for three counsel.</p>    <p><a name="p328" class="para" id="p328">328.</a>  As between the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant and the Plaintiffs, I will make an order nisi that there be no order as to costs.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant has been represented by the same team of lawyers as the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants and not much additional costs should have been incurred as a result of the claim against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p329" class="para" id="p329">329.</a>  Last but not the least, I wish to thank counsel for their assistance in this complicated piece of litigation.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(M H Lam)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance<br />            High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center"> </p>    </blockquote>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Andrew Liao, SC, Mr John Yan, SC and Mr Philips Wong, instructed by Messrs Sit, Fung, Kwong &amp; Shum, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr Warren Chan, SC, Miss Winnie Tam and Mr C W Ling, instructed by Messrs S K Lam, Alfred Chan &amp; Co., for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2005/242.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
