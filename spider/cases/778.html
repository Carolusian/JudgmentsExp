The origins of the dispute are summarised in the letter from the plaintiff's solicitors dated 22 February 2000 tothe defendant, which is, <em>inter alia,</em> in the following terms :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"We act for Kenny Food Manufacturing Co.

(the various sums specified).</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The defendant's solicitors eventually replied on 16 March 2000 to the effect that the defendant was willing to give an amended undertaking,namely the Undertaking required by the plaintiff's solicitors but with paragraphs (c) and (d) deleted. The plaintiff's solicitors,by letter dated 28 March 2000, stated that they had instructions to initiate proceedings against the defendant, and on 30 March 2000,they served a copy of the Writ on the defendant.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> In his affirmation, Mr Lee Kam Sang, the Managing Director of the plaintiff, stated that he has been engaged in the business of manufacturingand selling a range of soya bean and flour edible products since 1980 under the name of Kenny Food Manufacturing Company ("the Company"),which business was transferred to the plaintiff in 1994. The dry bean curd sticks and dry bean curd sheets have been manufacturedby the Company since 1980. The brand name "Shan Shui" and its Chinese equivalent "å±±æ°´ç" have been substantially used by theCompany and the plaintiff in Hong Kong and overseas since 1984 or 1985. The plaintiff is one of the major companies which manufacturesand supplies such products, including dry bean curd sheets and sticks, for sale in Hong Kong and abroad, both in the retail marketas well as to various catering businesses. The sales of the plaintiff's products have totaled HK$108,203,594.00 in the last fiveyears out of which HK$36,832,720.00 was made directly from products bearing the Device Mark, the brand name "Shan Shui" and its Chineseequivalent as well as the plaintiff's Get-Up. Mr Lee estimated that approximately 5% of these takings were from the sales of drybean curd sheets and sticks. Purchase orders by people in the catering business often referred to the "Shan Shui" brand by name.The plaintiff has actively promoted its products under the trademark "Shan Shui å±±æ°´ç", the plaintiff's Get-Up and the DeviceMark through various media, including newspapers and television, having spent approximately HK$3,200,000.00 on such advertising andpromotional activities in the last five years. Mr Lee stated that he was not aware of any other traders using the same or similarGet-Up or marks to market their dry bean curd sheets and sticks. In the circumstances, the plaintiff's products sold and suppliedunder the plaintiff's trademark "Shan Shui å±±æ°´ç", the plaintiff's Get-Up and Device Mark have become distinctive of the plaintiffand the plaintiff is the owner of a substantial and valuable goodwill in Hong Kong and overseas as the seller and/or supplier ofthe products, marketed as aforesaid.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> In about September or October 1999, the plaintiff was contacted by a Mr Eddie Ho of Edward Enterprises Limited, trading as Sing FatCompany in Birmingham, England, who was interested in purchasing "Shan Shui" dry bean curd sheets and sticks from the plaintiff.He asked the plaintiff for the supply of 6 oz packs of such products, and on being informed that the plaintiff did not manufacturethem in 6 oz packs, he later returned and showed the plaintiff's staff a photocopy of the package of a 6 oz pack which he had purchasedin England. The packaging was identical to the plaintiff's packaging, even including the plaintiff's name, address, telephone andfax numbers. It was thus that the plaintiff came to know that there were counterfeits being offered for sale in England, since ithas never manufactured or sold "Shan Shui" dry bean curd sheets or sticks in 6 oz packs, but only in 7 and 8 oz packs.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The plaintiff then instructed solicitors in England, who in turn instructed private investigators. They discovered that one JK Foods(UK) Limited ("JK Foods") were selling the counterfeit dry bean curd sheets and sticks in 6 oz packs. From JK Foods, who has apparentlyco-operated completely with the plaintiff, the plaintiff ascertained that the counterfeits were supplied to JK Foods by the defendanton four occasions, namely 20 June, 11 July, 24 November 1998 and 26 March 1999 respectively.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Mr Cheung Bong Wa, a Director of the defendant, stated in his affirmation that JK Foods had approached the defendant in about June1998 inquiring about the supply of dry bean curd sheets and sticks; the defendant approached the plaintiff for the same, and on ascertainingthat it did not have sufficient stock, the defendant tried to locate the goods elsewhere, including in Macau and the PRC, and eventuallyfound a supplier in Shenzhen City in the PRC, namely one Kin Shing Hong, from whom it purchased the products and sold them straighton to JK Foods in the United Kingdom on the four occasions in question, as evidenced in the purchase orders and receipts providedby JK Foods to the plaintiff. These four occasions, which involved a total purchase price of $54,100.00, were the only occasionsupon which the defendant has dealt in the products in question.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Mr Cheung emphasised that the contracts for the purchase of the said products from Kin Shing Hong were concluded in Shenzhen in thePRC, and the goods were on each occasion shipped in a container to Hong Kong, stored in the same container during transit in HongKong, and then shipped in the same container from Hong Kong to JK Foods in the United Kingdom. In these circumstances, the defendantalleges that none of the transactions in relation to the sourcing and delivery of the products to JK Foods took place in Hong Kong.</p>    <p class="heading">The Trademark</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiff's trademark is registered in Class 30 "in respect of coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar, rice, tapioca, sago, coffee substitutes;flour, and preparations made from cereals; bread, biscuits, cakes, pastry and confectionery, ices; honey, treacle; yeast, baking-powder;salt, mustard; pepper, vinegar, sauces; spices; ice". The defendant disputes that the trademark as thus registered applies to theproducts in question.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 27</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Ordinance</a> provides, inter alia, as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"... the registration (whether before or after the commencement of this Ordinance) of a person in Part A of the register as proprietorof a trade mark (other than a certification trade mark) in respect of any goods shall, if valid, give or be deemed to have givento that person the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods and, without prejudice to the generalityof the foregoing words, that right shall be deemed to be infringed by any person who, not being the proprietor of the trade markor a registered user thereof using by way of the permitted use, uses in the course of trade a mark identical with or nearly resemblingit, in relation to any goods in respect of which it is registered, or in relation to goods of the same description where such usewould result in a likelihood of confusion, ... "</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The plaintiff's case is concisely set out by Mr Lee in his affirmation as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Under the Seventh Edition of the Nice Classification published by World Intellectual Property Organization in 1996 ('the Nice Classification'),the goods falling within Class 30 include 'bean meal' and 'soya flour'. ... The Plaintiff's dry bean curd sheets and sticks are goodsof the same description as bean meal and soya flour. Firstly, dry bean curd sheets and sticks are made from soya flour which is obtainedby grinding soya bean. They are the by-products of soya bean. The composition and nature of dry bean curd sheets and sticks, beanmeal and soya flour are therefore the same. Secondly, dry bean curd sheets and sticks are commonly used in cooking and they formpart of a meal. Beans and soya flour are similarly used for cooking and they are frequently included in one's diet. The use of drybean curd sheets and sticks, bean meal and soya flour is therefore the same. Thirdly, dry bean curd sheets and sticks, beans andsoya flour are usually sold and distributed through local markets, groceries and supermarkets. The trade channels for these productsare therefore the same. ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> I note that in <em>Kerly's Law of Trademarks</em> (12th Ed. 1986), the learned author, at paragraph 5-05, comments that the fact that certain goods may fall within the same classis not evidence that they are "of the same description". Further, it has been held that the use of a mark registered for flour ona loaf of bread is not use of the mark in relation to flour (since flour, as such, is no longer present in the loaf of bread).</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> <strong>Spillers</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1954%5d%2071%20RPC%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1954] 71 RPC 234.</a></p>    <p align="justify">In my view, a triable issue exists as to whether the dry bean curd sheets and sticks in question in these proceedings are "goods ofthe same description" as any of those listed in the registration of the plaintiff's trademark, and therefore whether the plaintiff'strademark as registered extends to them.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Since it is a requirement that any infringement of the trademark must occur within the jurisdiction of the registering authorityin order to be actionable, a further triable issue has, in my view, been raised on the facts before me as to whether any infringement,if such be established, occurred within Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> It follows from the above that the plaintiff is not, in my view, entitled to summary judgment for any relief arising out of the defendant'salleged infringement of its trademark.</p>    <p class="heading">Passing-off</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> It is common ground that the defendant supplied the 6 oz packs of dry bean curd sheets and sticks to JK Foods in England on threeoccasions in 1998 and one in March 1999. I have examined one of the counterfeit packs in question, and it is immediately clear thatthe get-up and packaging are identical to that of the plaintiff's products, including the use of the mark, the words "Shan Shui å±±æ°´ç",the colours and design of the packaging, and to clinch the matter, the packs in question all contained the plaintiff's name, addressand contact details, in the same way as on the plaintiff's own packets.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The defendant's misrepresentation in these four instances (to the effect that the goods in question were the goods of the plaintiff)was as blatant as such a misrepresentation can be. Nor can there be any doubt that the members of the public who were exposed tosuch goods would be likely to be misled into believing that the goods offered by the defendant were the goods of the plaintiff. Inthese circumstances, it is not surprising that the plaintiff acted as swiftly and as firmly as it did, once it had discovered thatthese counterfeit goods were on sale at JK Foods in England, and that it was the defendant who had supplied them to JK Foods.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Mr Kwan based the plaintiff's claim of passing-off on two alternative bases :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) the supply of instruments of deception to the United Kingdom; and/or</p>        <p align="justify">(b) passing-off the products in question in the United Kingdom.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> An essential element which the plaintiff has to prove in respect of a claim for passing-off is that it has established a goodwillin the mind of the purchasing public in relation to the products in question. On the facts before me, I am satisfied that the plaintiffhas established such a goodwill in Hong Kong. (I note that the defendant itself, when asked by JK Foods to supply dry bean curd sheetsand sticks went first to the plaintiff to source them; furthermore, Mr Cheung has affirmed that since the four transactions in question,the defendant does source the products in question exclusively from the plaintiff).</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The position is less clear in respect of the United Kingdom. The matter was dealt with only very generally by Mr Lee who affirmedthat the plaintiff has for years been selling its products, including the products in question, both in Hong Kong and abroad.</p>    <p class="heading">Supply of instruments of deception to the United Kingdom</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> As I have already found, the goods which the defendant sent to JK Foods were undoubtedly calculated to deceive both the middlemensuch as Mr Eddie Ho of Sing Fat Company in Birmingham, and the ultimate consumers into believing that they were purchasing the goodsof the plaintiff. It is not disputed that in relation to the four transactions in question, JK Foods sent its purchase orders tothe defendant in Hong Kong, the defendant sent the invoices to JK Foods from Hong Kong via the banks, and also faxed copies of theinvoices to JK Foods from its offices in Hong Kong; furthermore, the goods themselves, notwithstanding that they originated in Shenzhenin the PRC, were shipped to JK Foods via the defendant in Hong Kong. In other words, the defendant set in motion in Hong Kong a chainof events which would inevitably result in the end-user being deceived into believing that the goods supplied by the defendant werethe goods of the plaintiff. This, I am satisfied, constituted the tort of passing-off.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> <strong>Levi Strauss v.

Since the goods were supplied in a get-up which was identical to the plaintiff's in every respect, save that the packageswere 6 oz instead of the plaintiff's 7 or 8 oz packages, there can be no doubt that they were calculated to deceive purchasers inthe United Kingdom into believing that these were the plaintiff's products. The plaintiff alleges that this constituted a passing-offby the defendant of the goods in question in the United Kingdom. Mr Kwan submits that it is not necessary for the passing-off tohave taken place within Hong Kong, in order to be actionable. He referred me to the decision in <strong>John Walker v. Ost</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20RPC%20489" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] RPC 489</a> at 509, lines 25-30 as authority for the proposition that the plaintiff is entitled to restrain a passing-off committed by the defendantin a country overseas if the defendant's conduct is actionable both in the foreign country and in Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> On the facts of the present case, I am satisfied that the defendant's actions would be actionable in Hong Kong at Common Law as constitutingthe tort of passing-off.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> As far as the second element is concerned, Mr Kwan places heavy reliance upon the admission made by Mr Cheung in his first affirmationin paragraph 15(b) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"15. The Defendant further avers that :-</p>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">(a) Since no sale of the goods had ever been made within the territory of Hong Kong, there is (as advised by the Defendant's lawyers)that there is no actionable action of 'passing off' in Hong Kong.</p>            <p align="justify" class="quote">(b) In the meantime, even though there is actionable action of 'passing off' in UK, the same should not have been started in a courtof Hong Kong."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> It is quite clear, to my mind, that this "admission" cannot be relied upon as establishing that the defendant's conduct was actionablein the United Kingdom. Most importantly, whether it was or not is a question of mixed fact and law, and Mr Cheung's opinion on thematter, while possibly relevant to establishing the defendant's bona fides or otherwise, is not even admissible evidence on the questionof the actionability of the matter in the United Kingdom, let alone binding upon the defendant in any way. (In any event, the reliabilityof the "admission" is further undermined by the distinct possibility that, as confirmed by Mr Mui in his submissions, what Mr Cheungintended to say in paragraph 15(b) was "even if" as opposed to "even though", which would change the meaning substantially. Havingregard to the loose use of language in the remainder of the affirmation, this possibility cannot be discounted.)</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Whether or not the defendant's conduct in question would be actionable in the United Kingdom as passing-off, would depend, <em>inter alia,</em> upon proof that the plaintiff had established a sufficient reputation and goodwill in the products in question in the United Kingdom,a matter which I have already found has not been established in these proceedings. In the circumstances, it has not been establishedthat the defendant's passing-off in the United Kingdom is actionable in Hong Kong at Common Law.</p>    <p class="heading">Relief</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The defendant has failed to discharge the threshold onus placed upon it by the Rules of the High Court, Order 14, rule 3, to satisfyme that there are any triable issues in relation to the plaintiff's claim for passing-off, by way of the defendant having suppliedinstruments of deception to JK Foods in the United Kingdom. The plaintiff is accordingly entitled to summary judgment upon such claim.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> <strong>Tandy/Rank Video &amp; Ano v. Yee Hing Cassette Factory Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%20HKC%20136" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] HKC 136.</a></p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> <strong>The Lady Anne Tennant v. Associated Newspapers Group Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20FSR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] FSR 298.</a></p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> It remains to consider what relief the plaintiff is entitled to. The plaintiff alleges that by reason of the defendant's conduct,it has suffered loss and damage, and unless the defendant is restrained by injunction, it is likely to suffer further loss and damage,since the defendant "threatens and intends to continue the acts complained of". In support of this contention, the plaintiff relieson the fact that the defendant refused to enter into the Undertaking in the terms demanded by the plaintiff in its solicitors' letterof 22 February 2000, the defendant only being willing to give the undertaking with paragraphs (c) and (d) thereof deleted, namelywithout any undertaking that it would make delivery up of the offending materials or discovery in relation to its infringing activities.Such qualified undertaking was not acceptable to the plaintiff, who thereupon proceeded to issue the Writ herein. Mr Kwan has urgedupon me that the defendant's actions in contesting the plaintiff's present claims make good the allegation that it threatens andintends to continue the acts complained of.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> The defendant has however consistently made it clear since its solicitors' reply dated 16 March 2000 to the plaintiff's solicitors,that it was willing to enter into the undertaking, amended as aforesaid, most importantly the undertaking to immediately cease andrefrain in future from having any dealings which would infringe the plaintiff's intellectual property rights. Mr Mui reiterated thedefendant's continued willingness to give such a qualified undertaking, and submitted that in the circumstances, it was entirelyunnecessary for the plaintiff to take out the present summary judgment application.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> In these circumstances, in my view the plaintiff had no ground for alleging, or apprehending, that the defendant "threatens and intendsto continue the acts complained of". The indications are all to the contrary : the defendant has admitted the four sales in questionto JK Foods, made it clear that these were the only transactions in which it was involved, undertaken throughout not to engage inany further such transactions or dealings which would infringe the plaintiff's intellectual property rights, and has produced evidenceto support its contention that it has recently been purchasing such products directly from the plaintiff for resale purposes.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The fact nevertheless remains that to date the defendant, albeit willing to give the amended undertaking, has not in fact given anyundertaking. I note that the learned author of Kerly's Law of Trademarks and Tradenames, 12th Ed., in discussing the appropriatenessof granting injunctive relief, states that where the defendant makes an offer to give an undertaking, the plaintiff is entitled tomove the court for an order embodying the offer, and to the costs even if the costs are not offered. Furthermore :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"If an actual infringement is shown to have occurred, that is usually sufficient and the plaintiff is not bound to wait until it hasbeen frequently repeated, or until warning has been given and been disregarded, for 'the life of a trademark depends upon the promptitudewith which it is vindicated'". (page 318)</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> I also bear in mind the failure of the defendant to provide information to the plaintiff about its sales of the products in questionto JK Foods, until confronted with the facts by the plaintiff, gleaned from its own investigations. In my view, it will be appropriatein all the circumstances to grant the plaintiff the injunction it seeks to restrain the defendant from passing-off its products asthose of the plaintiff, and I accordingly grant a restraining order in terms of paragraph 2 of the summons.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The plaintiff is, in my view, entitled to relief not only in terms of the undertaking offered by the defendant, but in the full termswhich it seeks in relation to the defendant's passing-off, including delivery up of the offending materials and the provision ofall relevant information as to the identity of the persons who manufactured and/or supplied to the defendant, so as to enable theplaintiff to make its own investigations and thus satisfy itself that no further infringing activity has taken place, and that itsrights have been effectively secured.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> <strong>Norwich Pharmacal Co. v.
