The SchemeAdministrator adopted a neutral stance in this application, taking the view that whilst the administration of the Scheme is a matterfor him, there is nothing in the wording of the Scheme which would appear to oust the jurisdiction of the court to make the declarationssought in this situation, as no determination has been made by the Scheme Administrator or the Scheme Adjudicators on any of thematters which fall to be determined in this application.</p>    <p class="heading">The background</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The relevant background matters may be stated as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  By a contract dated 25 June 1996, NCC was engaged by the Airport Authority (âAAâ) as the main contractor for the constructionof the ground transportation centre at the new airport at Chek Lap Kok.  KEL was the nominated subcontractor for the provision ofthe building services for the ground transportation centre under a nominated subcontract dated 24 July 1996 (âNSC 423â).</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On 19 May 1998, KELâs employment under NSC 423 was terminated by NCC with immediate effect, with the consent of AA, on accountof the alleged defaults of KEL, which allegedly caused the non-completion of the ground transportation centre in time for the airportopening date on 6 July 1998.  KEL maintained that NSC 423 was wrongfully terminated by NCC and on 27 May 1998, KEL issued a noticeof dispute to NCC requiring that the disputes under NSC 423 be resolved by arbitration.  On 2 September 1998, NCC wrote to KEL indicatingits intention to counterclaim in the arbitration.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In October 1998, a creditor presented a petition to wind up KEL.  In January 1999, some former employees also presented a petitionto wind up KEL.  On 8 September 1999, KEL issued an originating summons seeking sanction of a scheme of arrangement.  On 17 May 2000,KEL Holdings Limited, the ultimate holding company of KEL, and Kenworth Group Limited, formerly known as UDL Kenworth Group Limited,the direct parent company, also took out an originating summons seeking sanction of a scheme of arrangement in order that a compositescheme was to be put forward for the creditors of these three companies.  NCC appeared at the hearing of the petition to object tosanction being granted insofar as the composite scheme affected KEL.  On 11 July 2000, the Scheme received the sanction of the court. It became effective on 3 August 2000.  The two petitions to wind up KEL were later dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The cut-off date for creditors bound by the Scheme to submit their claims to the Scheme Administrator was 17 October 2000.  On 16October 2000, NCC submitted its claim against KEL for the sum of HK$341,403,880.01 by way of the prescribed form for a notice ofclaim under the Scheme.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On 7 and 8 November 2000, the appeal against the sanction of the Scheme in CACV No. 280 of 2000 was heard, together with the appealagainst the sanction of a composite scheme in respect of UDL Holdings Limited and 24 subsidiaries (âthe UDL Schemeâ) in CACVNos. 157, 164, 258 to 262 of 2000.  NCC had also appeared in CACV No. 164 of 2000 and objected to the UDL Scheme, as UDL HoldingsLimited had guaranteed the liabilities of KEL and one of the 24 participating subsidiaries under their contracts with NCC.  NCC claimedto be a creditor of UDL Holdings Limited on the basis of the guarantee.  The Court of Appeal dismissed all the appeals on 7 December2000 (<i>Re UDL Holdings Ltd. &amp; Ors</i>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%204%20HKC%20778" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 4 HKC 778).</a>  Although only the UDL Scheme was discussed in the judgment, the decision covered both the Scheme and the UDL Scheme.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On 31 May 2001, NCC settled its claims against AA.  AA attributed HK$236,602,673.76 of the settlement sum to cover NCCâs claimsarising from NSC 423.  As a result, on 17 September 2001, NCC revised down its claim against KEL under the Scheme to HK$141,042,108.10,being the difference between NCCâs claim submitted to AA and the amount AA has paid to NCC under the settlement.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  I understand no progress was made in the arbitration between KEL and NCC for several years after KEL had served notice in May 1998to refer the disputes to arbitration.  It was only in 2002 that the arbitrator was appointed and pleadings were then served as directedby the arbitrator.  NCCâs claim of HK$141,042,108.10 has now been further revised in its defence and counterclaim to HK$82,772,206.00. NCC seeks to maintain this claim as a defence and only to the extent necessary to set off the claims of KEL.  The substantive hearingof the arbitration is expected to take place in October 2005.  NCCâs present estimate of the total costs for the conduct of thearbitration proceedings is in the region of HK$31 million.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  On 27 March 2003, NCC obtained an order from the arbitrator (the third interim award) that KEL should provide HK$5 million as securityfor NCCâs costs in the arbitration.  KEL has complied with the order for security for costs and there was no appeal against thatorder. </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  After KEL had issued the summons that I am concerned with, NCC applied for an increase of the amount of security for costs in thearbitration.  On 12 July 2004, the arbitrator published the twelfth interim award in which he ordered the security for costs to beincreased by HK$6 million.  By agreement between the parties, the twelfth interim award is subject to appeal pending the outcomeof the present application, which the parties expect to resolve the issue.</p>    <p

The same submissions were made in this respectin the skeleton arguments of NCC in CACV No. 164 of 2000 and in CACV No. 280 of 2000.  NCCâs complaint was that because of theoperation of, inter alia, clause 33 of the UDL Scheme (identical in all material respects to clause 18 of the Scheme), NCC wouldbe gravely disadvantaged in relation to the heavy costs of arbitration, as it would receive only a small dividend on its costs andthis would be a significant disincentive to pursuing its claims in arbitration.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  On behalf of the companies being the subject of the composite schemes, it was contended in the skeleton submissions in the appealsthat any award of costs incurred in the arbitration in favour of a successful claimant would fall to be treated as part of the âPost-SchemeCostsâ as defined in the UDL Scheme and would form a prior charge over the Scheme Funds by virtue of clause 25.  Although by thedefinition of âPost-Scheme Costsâ and clause 50, only such costs as are approved by the Committee of Inspection are so payable,it was submitted that the Committee would be bound to approve payment out of Scheme Funds to satisfy an award of costs in such arbitration. Hence, the point raised by NCC in relation to its costs in arbitration should not constitute a reason for refusing to sanction theUDL Scheme.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Unlike the UDL Scheme, there is no provision for a committee of inspection under the Scheme.  Except in this respect, there is nomaterial difference in the definition provision of âPost-Scheme Costsâ in the Scheme.  As for clause 38 of the Scheme, whichis the equivalent to clause 50 of the UDL Scheme, the only material difference is that in the former it is provided that all âreasonableâcosts necessarily and properly incurred after the Effective Date in connection with the administration and implementation of theScheme shall be paid in full out of the Scheme Funds, whereas in clause 50 of the UDL Scheme it is provided that all such costs subjectto the approval of the Committee of Inspection shall be paid in full to the extent approved by the Committee. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  In the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Seagroatt J dealt with the above submissions in respect of the costs of the arbitrationin this way:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMr Bunting [Senior Counsel for NCC] was concerned about the question of Nishimatsu's costs in the event of a successful arbitrationaward for his clients.  The definition of âclaimsâ in the scheme is âthe claims of proving creditorsâ.  <i>This must include the costs of proving such claims</i>.  It would in my view require a specific exclusion of the necessary costs to defeat any claim to include such costs.  âScheme debtsâhas a definition.  It includes âall claims of proving creditors against the company ... established in accordance with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32#p3" class="autolink_findacts">part 3</a> of the scheme ...â.  It would indeed be inequitable if, having been required to prove its claim, a potential creditor was not ableto include the costs of so doing in its claim.  In my view, <i>the word âclaimâ unarguably includes the reasonable costs of proving that claim.  The word âawardâ in clause 33 includes thecosts involved</i>.â (at 789I to 790B; emphasis supplied)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Mr. Bannister submitted that it was specifically decided that the word âawardâ in clause 33 of the UDL Scheme (equivalent toclause 18 of the Scheme) included the costs of the award.  Hence, the effect of the above dicta is that if NCC should succeed inthe arbitration, it would be entitled to add its costs to its claim.  The award, including the costs element, ranks for dividendas a âScheme Debtâ, being a âClaimâ âestablished in accordance with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> of the Schemeâ.  As the decision of the Court of Appeal is binding on NCC and KEL, this should decide the point of constructionraised in this application in favour of KEL.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr. Trower submitted that the passage in the judgment of Seagroatt J cited above does not support the proposition advanced on behalfof KEL that this should lead to the conclusion that NCC is only entitled to a dividend in respect of the costs that may be awardedin arbitration.  In any event, the UDL Scheme, although similar to the Scheme, is not the same as the scheme with which the courtis concerned with in the present application, and no submissions were made in the appeals of the differences in wording of the relevantprovisions in the two composite schemes; there can be no issue estoppel in these circumstances.  Apart from the differences I havepointed out regarding the definition of âPost-Scheme Costsâ and clause 38 in the Scheme (which were not referred to by SeagroattJ), the definition of âScheme Debtsâ (which was referred to by Seagroatt J) is different in the Scheme in that the latter isdefined as âsubject to paragraph 38â.  Further, in the UDL Scheme, there are provisions for financing the costs of recoveringthe âAccounts Receivableâ (defined as including all claims or counterclaims claimed by UDL Holdings Limited or the Scheme ParticipatingSubsidiaries in pending arbitrations) and the costs of defending arbitration claims by UDL Holdings Limited, and the reimbursementto the same to the extent of the amount incurred out of the proceeds obtained or the cost award in a successful recovery or defence. There are no provisions to similar effect in the Scheme.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In my respectful opinion, Seagroatt J did not clearly rule that costs in the arbitration do not constitute âPost-Scheme Costsâ,although this may have been implicit in his view that âScheme Debtsâ as defined in the UDL Scheme should include the costs ofthe arbitration.  The concern raised by NCCâs counsel was that by the provisions of the schemes, its costs in the arbitration wouldbe included in its claim and because of that such costs would only rank for dividend.  In coming to the view that NCC should be ableto include âthe reasonable costsâ of the arbitration in its claim, Seagroatt J did not specifically state that NCC would onlybe entitled to a dividend.  Mr. Trower made the point that it would be odd if Seagroatt J had reached that conclusion, as the judgeseemed to think that the complaint of NCC was unfounded.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  I do not think there is issue estoppel here for two reasons.  There is absence of a specific determination of the material issuethat I am concerned with in this application, namely, whether the costs of an arbitration which was pending at the Effective Dateshould only rank for dividend, and there is material difference in relevant provisions of the two composite schemes.</p>    <p class="heading">Proper approach to construction of the Scheme</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Having come to the view that the decision of the Court of Appeal does not give rise to issue estoppel, I need to approach the questionof construction afresh.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The Scheme is a contractual arrangement between the companies concerned and the creditors who are bound by it.  It does not appearcontroversial that as such, its true meaning and effect should be ascertained by applying ordinary principles of construction, withproper regard to the commercial context in which it was approved by the creditors and sanctioned by the court.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Mr. Trower pointed out that in this instance, one of the most important aspects of the matrix of fact is that at the time the Schemewas approved and sanctioned, KEL was insolvent, that the Scheme was proposed as an alternative to an insolvent liquidation, and thatthere is much within the Scheme which relates its terms to the basic principles of an insolvent winding up.  These matters shouldalso not give rise to controversy.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  What Mr. Bannister took issue with is the further submission of Mr. Trower that whilst it may be the case that creditorsâ rightsagainst a company are dealt with in a scheme of arrangement in a manner different from how they would have been dealt with in a windingup, any such differences and their consequences should be spelt out clearly in the scheme itself and the explanatory statement, andthat the court should approach the construction of the scheme accordingly.  In support of his submission, Mr. Trower referred tothe judgment of Chadwick LJ in <i>Re Hawk Insurance Co. Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20BCLC%20480" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 BCLC 480</a> at 523 to 525, in particular para.

I agree with Mr. Bannister that these statements shouldnot be regarded as support for some canon of construction that the terms of a scheme proposed as an alternative to an insolvent windingup should be approached on the basis that any divergence from the rights and practice in a liquidation regime must be clearly speltout, otherwise it would be assumed and construed that the provisions in the scheme would be no different from the parallel situationunder the liquidation regime.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  I will have regard to what would have happened in the liquidation regime as part of the factual matrix in construing the Scheme,but I do not think this should be taken further.

This essential distinction between incurring a liability and exposing oneself to the risk of liability shouldnot be undermined.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Mr. Bannister sought to distinguish <i>Glenister</i> on the basis that we are here concerned with a claim for costs in arbitration.  An arbitration is based on contract and there isan implied contractual obligation to pay costs if awarded by the arbitrator.  He submitted that unlike <i>Glenister</i>, where arbitration proceedings are pending at the commencement of winding up, there is an âidentifiable pre-liquidation obligationâon the part of the insolvent to pay such costs.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  I am unable to distinguish <i>Glenister</i> on the above basis. Notwithstanding that the obligation to pay costs, in the event that an award for costs is made by the arbitrator,is founded ultimately in the arbitration agreement, I cannot see how this could be elevated to a pre-liquidation obligation or liability. There is no difference in substance from ordinary litigation in that costs are in the discretion of the arbitrator (section 2GJof the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/341">Cap. 341</a>).  The fact that KEL is engaged in arbitration would only mean that it is exposed to the risk of a liability for costs,no obligation to pay is assumed until an award for costs is made against it.  The essential distinction drawn by Thorpe LJ betweenincurring a liability and exposing oneself to the risk of liability should not be overlooked.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Mr. Bannister further submitted that the deeming provision in clause 18 should assist in that the cost element in the award is deemeda liability of KEL at the Effective Date.  I do not think this provision would have the effect of deeming the existence of a liabilitynotwithstanding there is no actual liability in the event of a decision being made in the arbitration.  The deeming provision inclause 18 would only go to quantifying the amount of a âClaimâ, in the event that a decision is made in the arbitration.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  For the above reasons, I do not think a claim for costs in a pending arbitration would come within âScheme Debtsâ, quite apartfrom another consideration that in the Scheme, âScheme Debtsâ is defined as âsubject to paragraph 38â.  This leads to thesubmission of Mr. Trower that such costs would come within âPost-Scheme Costsâ, as defined in the definition section and furtherprovided for in clause 38.</p>    <p class="heading">Are costs in the arbitration within âPost-Scheme Costsâ</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  As defined, âPost-Scheme Costsâ are âcosts, charges, expenses and disbursements â¦ necessarily and properly incurred afterthe Effective Date, in connection with the administration and implementation of the Scheme â¦â.  Under clause 38, it is providedthat âall reasonable costs, charges, expenses and disbursements â¦ necessarily and properly incurred after the Effective Datein connection with the administration and implementation of the Scheme â¦ shall be paid in full out of the Scheme Funds in priorityto the payment of Preferential Claims and distribution to the non-preferential Scheme Creditors.â</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Mr. Trower submitted that the costs, charges, expenses and disbursements incurred by KEL in its arbitration, including any costsliability to NCC, are incurred in connection with the administration and implementation of the Scheme.  Pending arbitrations arepermitted under the Scheme to continue for the purpose of quantifying âClaimsâ and establishing entitlement to dividends underthe Scheme, such arbitration proceedings should be regarded as part of the process of administering the Scheme.  Costs awarded bythe arbitrator against KEL are âincurredâ in the process of administering the Scheme, as they are ordered to be paid by the arbitrator;they are ânecessarily and properlyâ incurred, as they arise out of the alternative process provided for in the Scheme for establishingKELâs liability in pending arbitrations.  Hence, such costs if awarded would come within âPost-Scheme Costsâ.  I agree withthis. I see no reason why âPost-Scheme Costsâ as defined should not cover an adverse costs order against KEL in arbitration. As for the provision for the priority of payment of reasonable âPost-Scheme Costsâ in clause 38, this would seem to be consistentwith the principles in winding up by which costs in litigation awarded against the insolvent would be payable in full as an expenseof the liquidation.</p>    <p class="heading">Are costs in the arbitration within âPreferential Claimâ</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Mr. Trower argued in the alternative that NCCâs costs in the arbitration are payable in priority to the claims of the generalunsecured creditors as they would come within âPreferential Claimâ, which is defined as âall claims of creditors against [KEL]â¦ which would, if a winding up of [KEL] had commenced on the Effective Date, have been payable out of the assets of [KEL] pursuantto the [Companies] Ordinance in priority to the claims of the general unsecured creditors of [KEL]â.  He accepted that the primarypurpose of the provision of âPreferential Claimsâ is to deal with the claims of KELâs preferential creditors, as that expressionis normally used, for which specific provision is made by section 265.  Nevertheless, he contended that by section 265(4), the obligationto pay liquidation preferential creditors is expressly subject to the retention of such sums as may be necessary for the costs andexpenses of the winding up, it follows that the form of words used to define âPreferential Claimsâ should encompass claims whichwould be costs and expenses of a winding up, if for whatever reason they fall outside the definition of âPost-Scheme Costsâ.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  I do not accept the alternative submission that if the costs of the arbitration ordered to be paid by KEL are not âPost-SchemeCostsâ, they should be treated as âPreferential Claimsâ as defined in the Scheme.  I am inclined to agree with Mr. Bannisterthat the definition of âPreferential Claimsâ must be read with the definition of âPreferential Creditorsâ, the latter expressionis defined as âCreditors to the extent to which they <i>have</i> Preferential Claims against â¦ [KEL]â.  These creditors are specifically listed at Appendix 3 to the Explanatory Statement ofthe Scheme.  It does not appear to me that âPreferential Creditorsâ would include someone who <i>may</i> have a claim, in other words a contingent claim.</p>    <p class="heading">If a declaration should be made in respect of an order for security for costs</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Lastly, it was submitted by Mr. Trower that the court should not make any declaration in respect of the orders for security forcosts in the arbitration.  There has been no appeal from the third interim award by which KEL was ordered to provide HK$5 millionas security for costs.  As for the twelfth interim award, the parties have reserved their rights of appeal.  Mr. Trower no longermaintained there is any issue estoppel in this situation but he submitted that the court should not grant relief where this wouldamount to interference with the arbitration process. Section 2AA(2)(b) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/341">Cap. 341</a> provides that the Ordinance is based on the principle that the Court should interfere in the arbitration of a dispute onlyas expressly provided by the Ordinance.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 23</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">24</a> provide for avenues by which the determinations made by an arbitrator may be appealed.  It is only appropriate that the arbitratorâsdecision should be challenged through the avenues provided in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/341">Cap. 341</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  I am inclined to agree with the above submission, although this does not arise as I am not minded to grant relief sought by KEL,in view of the conclusions I have reached on the points of construction raised.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  For the above reasons, I decline to make the declarations sought in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the amended summons of KEL.  I make anorder <i>nisi</i> that KEL is to pay NCCâs costs in this application, with a certificate for two counsel, and that the costs of the Scheme Administratorare to be part of the âPost-Scheme Costsâ and be dealt with in accordance with clause 38 of the Scheme.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(S Kwan)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center"> </p>    </blockquote>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr. Edward Bannister, QC and Mr. William Wong, instructed by Messrs.
