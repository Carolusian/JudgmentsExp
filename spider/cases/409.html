The prosecution was one that had been initiatedby an information laid against the plaintiff by a Mr J P F Stone, Assistant Divisional Commander, Crime, Tseung Kwan O Police Station,before a Kwun Tong Magistrate of a charge of common assault on the defendant contrary to common law and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/212/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 40</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/212" class="autolink_findacts">Offences Against the Person Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/212">Cap 212</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> In fact, three charges were laid against the plaintiff, namely, the said common assault on the defendant, another common assaulton Ms Grace Limbauan (âGraceâ), and criminal damage of a car.  The magistrate who heard the case for 24 days held that therewas no case to answer on the charge relating to the defendant, but convicted the plaintiff on the other two charges.  The plaintiffappealed against the two convictions but that appeal was dismissed on 16 May 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The facts</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> It is necessary to state the facts, albeit briefly, to put the matter in proper perspective.  The incident that gave rise to thethree charges arose at about 2 to 3 pm on 9 September 2000. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The defendant and her husband Mr Suzher Yan (âMr Yanâ) were then living with their two younger daughters at House 1A, Man KungUk Road, Clearway Bay, whereas the plaintiff and his family were living at House 3F in the same road.  They were in the same neighbourhood. The defendant had two dogs, which killed the plaintiffâs dog in June 2000.  When Grace, the defendantâs domestic helper, waswalking the two dogs on the way home, the plaintiff threw two stones at them, and drove his car towards them.  That was the basisof the assault on Grace.  One of the stones thrown by the plaintiff hit the roof of a car parked at the roadside.  That was the basisof the criminal damage charge.  Grace rushed home and the defendant, Mr Yan and a houseguest of theirs, Mr Yasheng Huang (âMr Huangâ)who was with them at the time, went outside their house and saw the plaintiff there.  It was alleged that the plaintiff assaultedthe defendant there and then.  This formed the basis of the common assault on the defendant.  The police was called, and they arrivedsoon afterwards.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The whole incident, starting from the appearance of Grace with the two dogs at the scene up to the arrival of the police, was seenby two persons who had not known the plaintiff, the defendant, Mr Yan, Mr Huang or Grace before.  They were Ms Chiu Ahmad MustaffaZara (âMs Chiuâ) and her friend Mr Jonathan Richard Martin (âMr Martinâ), who were seated on the patio at G/F, 3B in thesame road.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> As stated above, the magistrate held that there was no case to answer in respect of the charge of common assault on the defendant.

It will be noted that the prosecution was brought by the police and the Department ofJustice, while the defendant was a person who provided information and witness statements to the police and gave evidence beforethe magistrate.  The crux of the judgeâs decision was that it was impossible for the plaintiff to prove that the exercise of thediscretion by the police on the advice of the Department of Justice to lay the prosecution against plaintiff had been so affectedor compromised by the information provided by the defendant to the police so as to make the defendant responsible for the prosecution,even assuming that the defendant had told an untruth to the police or had withheld information from them and that she did that withmalice against the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The grounds of appeal</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The grounds of appeal are of very limited scope and revolve around whether the judge was correct in making the decision that he did.

On behalf of the plaintiff MrLee SC submits that insofar as the prosecution would not have been brought but for the defendantâs lies provided to the prosecutingauthorities, the defendant must be treated as the prosecutor.  I do not agree.  It is necessary for the court to examine all theevidence and the circumstances of the case to decide whether the nexus had been broken.  The defendantâs lies might well have beena factor considered by the prosecuting authorities in reaching their decision to prosecute, but it does not necessarily follow thatthe decision could not have been made independently of the lies after investigation and appraisal of all the materials before them,so as to constitute a breaking of the nexus between the lies and the decision.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The judgeâs decision</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The foundation of the judgeâs decision was that it was the police on the advice of the Department of Justice that took the decisionto prosecute the plaintiff.  There was nothing to show that the decision to prosecute was not independent or competent, which wasbased on the independent and detailed investigation made by the police and the advice of the Department of Justice.  Whatever liestold by the defendant to the police, assuming they were lies for the purposes of the application to strike out, so the judge held,could not have compromised or influenced the decision of the police and the Department of Justice in bringing the prosecution.  Whilethere were allegations made by the plaintiff that the police was duped by what the defendant had told them and that the police waslazy, incompetent, gullible, and not independent etc, no concrete evidence of any sort in support was alluded to in the plaintiffâslengthy affidavit consisting of 71 pages. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The judge refused to accept that insofar as the defendant had lied to the police, which was assumed for the present purposes, sheshould be regarded as the person who brought the prosecution in a suit of malicious prosecution.

Such a test can be met in respect of almost every statement furnished by awitness.  The threshold must be much higher.

It would be verbose to reiterate those facts here.

In short, the nexus between the defendant and the prosecution of the plaintiff was severed by the intervention of the police andthe Department of Justice.  It is in my view not reasonably arguable that the defendantâs lie has somehow made it âvirtuallyimpossibleâ for the independent exercise of discretion or judgment by the prosecuting authorities in the present case.â</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> I wish only to mention the significant fact that there were at least six persons, namely, the defendant, Mr Yan, Mr Huang, Grace,Ms Chu and Mr Martin, who had provided statements to the police about the incident.  Ms Chu and Mr Martin were witnesses who weretotally independent of the plaintiff and the defendant and their respective families.  Apart from Grace, the remaining four persons,excluding the defendant, bore witness to the alleged assault on the defendant.  In fact, the statements of Mr Yan and Mr Huang allegedthat they were also assaulted by the plaintiff.  However, only the three charges, mainly based on the evidence of the six persons,were laid against the plaintiff who had also told the police his own version of the incident and alleged that he was assaulted andfalsely imprisoned.  The police were aware of the animosity between the families of the plaintiff and the defendant.  These circumstances,coupled with the fact that the plaintiff had on several occasions maintained in his affidavit that he had witnesses of his own andthere were many people who saw the incident, make it plain that the police and the Department of Justice must have made their decisionto prosecute after critically considering all the materials, and not merely relying on what the defendant had told them.  This isonly resonant of what the plaintiff had himself apparently accepted in para 65 of his affidavit, where he stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="100%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">âI verily believe that the police would not have prosecuted solely based on the story given by her [the defendantâs] closely connectedpeople, i.e. Yan, Huang and Limbauan [Grace].â</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The plaintiff also attempted to show that the defendant was the prosecutor through his allegation repeated many times that she hadprocured or suborned independent witnesses to tell lies to implicate him of the charge of common assault on her.  I have examinedthe plaintiffâs affidavit and agree with the judge that there is not a scintilla of evidence in support of this bare allegation. It is plain that this alleged nexus between the defendantâs acts or omissions and the prosecution of the plaintiff for establishingthe necessary ingredient of the claim that the defendant was the prosecutor cannot be proved at trial. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> For the above reasons, I consider that none of the grounds of appeal has any substance.  I agree with the judge and Ma CJHC thatthe plaintiffâs claim is doomed to failure.  I would dismiss the appeal with an order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiff pay the defendantâs costs, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">Hon Le Pichon JA:</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> I agree that this appeal falls to be dismissed for the reasons given in the judgment of Woo VP.  I should however like to add a fewobservations on the main argument advanced by Mr Lee SC on behalf of the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> As I understand it, the crux of Mr Lee SCâs submissions was that at the striking out stage, the defendant cannot show that it wouldbe impossible for the plaintiff to discharge his burden at trial that she was the prosecutor.  It was said that the extent to whichthe lie led to the prosecution was fact-sensitive as was the related question, namely, whether the prosecuting authorities exercisedan independent judgment in deciding to prosecute so as to sever the nexus between the lie and the prosecution.  The argument advancedwas that those are questions of fact and therefore cannot be resolved at the striking out stage but only at trial.  Mr Lee was atpains to emphasize that âindependentâ in that context must mean ânot dependent on the defendantâs lieâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Whilst in general questions of fact cannot normally be resolved at an interlocutory stage, it is not a rigid and immutable rule. Ultimately, each case must turn on its own individual facts.  If the case were a âone on oneâ situation as in <i>Martin v Watson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20AC%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 AC 74</a> where in practical terms the information supplied compelled the bringing of the prosecution, I would agree that an application tostrike out would not succeed.  But the present case is not within <i>Martin v Watson</i>.  The question which arises in the present case is whether it would be impossible for the plaintiff to demonstrate at trial thatâthe intelligent exerciseâ by the police and the Department of Justice âof the discretion to prosecute was impossibleâ. This test I derive from the following passage in the judgment of Richardson J in <i>Commercial Union Assurance Co of New Zealand Ltd v Lamont</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%203%20NZLR%20187" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 3 NZLR 187</a> at 199, ll. 9-13:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="100%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">âTo proceed on the premise that whenever it emerges that false information was given to the police the intelligent exercise of thediscretion to prosecute was impossible, does not reflect the ordinary performance of the New Zealand police of their important responsibilities.â</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Richardson J went on to say this (at ll. 31-32):</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="100%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">âOne should never assume that tainted evidence persuaded the police to prosecute.â</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">I would observe that there is nothing in Richardson Jâs judgment to suggest that there could not have been an intelligent exerciseof the discretion to prosecute if the prosecution happened to fail.  They are separate issues.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> It is convenient to summarize what the plaintiff needs to establish at trial to succeed in his claim for malicious prosecution. The fact that the prosecution would not have been brought but for the defendantâs lies is not a sufficient basis in law for treatingthe defendant as prosecutor.  See <i>Commercial Union</i> at 196, ll. 24-25.  Nor is it sufficient simply to show that the defendant had lied or supplied false information to the police. The correct test is set out in the judgment of Brooke LJ in <i>Mahon &amp; Anor v Rahn &amp; Ors (No.2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%201%20WLR%202150" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 1 WLR 2150</a> at para 269:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="100%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">âIn a simple case it may be possible to determine the issue quite easily by asking these questions.

(3)Â Has A procured the institution of proceedingsby the professional prosecutor, either by furnishing information which he knew to be false, or by withholding information which heknew to be true, or both?â</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">I therefore agree with Ma CJHC at para 21of his judgment that it is not sufficient for the plaintiff to satisfy one or more of thethree situations postulated by McMullin J in <i>Commercial Union</i> at 207-208 in order to succeed in his claim.  The three situations posited by McMullin J are not to be read disjunctively as is clearfrom test adumbrated in the <i>Mahon</i> case cited above.  It follows that at the trial it would be incumbent on the plaintiff to show that it was virtually impossible forthe professional prosecutor to exercise any independent discretion or judgment.  So, for the purposes of the striking out, the defendanthas to show that it would be impossible for the plaintiff so to do.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> It is important to bear in mind the circumstances of the present case.  In each of the leading cases on the subject of maliciousprosecution reviewed in the judgment below as well as the judgments of Ma CJHC and Cheung JA, the subject matter of the relevantinvestigation was a single incident or matter.  The present case is markedly different.  The events that occurred between 2pm to3pm on 5 September 2000 gave rise to no less than 7 complaints.  Those comprised the assault on the maid, criminal damage to thecar, alleged assaults by the plaintiff on the defendant, her husband and Mr Huang, an alleged assault on the plaintiff and a claimby the plaintiff that he had been falsely imprisoned.  Whilst each complaint had to be investigated, they arose out of the same sequenceof events and each complaint involved the plaintiff.  In reality, there was an investigation into the events that gave rise to theseveral complaints rather than 7 separate and unrelated investigations.  Put differently, the investigation into the alleged assaulton the defendant was part of a larger investigation and at the conclusion of that investigation which, by all accounts, was detailedand extensive, a view was taken as to whether prosecutions should be brought and, if so, in respect of which complaints.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Against such a backdrop, it would be wrong and artificial to view the decision to prosecute the plaintiff in respect of the allegedassault on the defendant in isolation.  The fact that prosecutions were brought in respect of only 3 of the 7 complaints is telling:it speaks to the exercise of a discretion by the authorities.  Of the 5 alleged instances of assault, prosecutions were brought onlyin respect of the alleged assaults on the maid and on the defendant.  It can hardly be coincidental that charges were laid in respectof those where there were independent witnesses (Ms Chiu and Mr Martin) and not in respect of the other three where there were nosuch witnesses.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Both Ms Chiu and Mr Martin were unrelated to the maid, the plaintiff and the defendant and their respective families.  Absent evidencethat they had been suborned to give false evidence, there is no basis upon which a court could proceed other than that they weretruly independent witnesses.  Whilst the plaintiffâs affidavit contains allegations that the defendant had suborned independentwitnesses to support her complaint, as the Vice-President observed in paragraph 26 of his judgment, they are but bare allegationsunsupported by any evidence.  As such, those allegations must be ignored in the present exercise.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> True it is that at the trial both Ms Chiu and Mr Martin accepted that the defendant had her back to them and in that sense theirview of the actual physical contact between the plaintiff and the defendant was blocked.  But a distinction needs to be made betweenan investigation that in one critical respect was deficient or one that could have been more thorough and the intelligent exerciseof the discretion to prosecute based on what with the benefit of hindsight was an imperfect investigation.  The fact that a prosecutionfails at the end of the day does not mean that there had not been and could not have been an intelligent exercise of the discretionto prosecute. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> I would add that I do not agree with Mr Lee that âindependentâ must mean ânot dependant on the defendantâs lieâ.  Sucha definition is unhelpful because in reality it is the âbut forâ test in another guise.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b>Hon Chung J:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> I agree with the judgments of Woo VP and Le Pichon JA.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">		<tr>			<td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(K H Woo)<br>            Vice-President</td>			<td width="34%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(D Le Pichon)<br>            Justice of Appeal</td>			<td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(A Chung)<br>            Judge of Court of First Instance</td>		</tr>		</table>	<!--sino section representation --><representation>	<p style="text-align:left"> </p>	<p style="text-align:left">Mr Martin Lee SC and Mr Jeremy S K Chan, on the instructions of Messrs Simmons &amp; Simmons, for the Plaintiff (Appellant)</p>    <p style="text-align:left">Mr Charles Sussex SC and Miss Lisa Jane Cruden, on the instructions of Messrs Deacons, for the Defendant (Respondent)</p>	</representation><!--sino section text -->    <p style="text-align: left"> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2005/374.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
