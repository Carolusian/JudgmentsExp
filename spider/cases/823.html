It is common ground thatthe Plaintiff was a supplier of watches in Hong Kong. It had a customer by the name of M &amp; M Jewelers &amp; Co. (hereinaftercalled M &amp; M) which was a corporation carrying on business in Los Angeles. U.S.A. M &amp; M purchased watches from the Plaintiffon C &amp; 1 terms. The business between the Plaintiff and M &amp; M commenced sometime in April 1993. According to Mr. Chong ofthe Plaintiff. The first shipment was a test shipment and it was made by the Plaintiff using its own air forwarders. After the goodswere received by M &amp; M, the parties decided to do business on a regular basis. There were subsequently about 29 shipments ofwatches by the Plaintiff to M &amp; M. and all these 29 shipments were effected through the Defendant and the 12 shipments, the subjectmatter of this action, were the last 12 of the 29 shipments.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Mr. Chong of the Plaintiff told me and I accept his evidence that all the sales made by the Plaintiff to M &amp; M were on D/P terms.There was the possible exception of one shipment which was orignally shipped on D/P terms. However the shipment was returned owingto some problems with the United States customs. The goods were re-shipped to another person acting as the Plaintiff's agent in NewYork who transmitted the same to M &amp; M in Los Angeles on open account basis. This shipment had been paid and did not form thesubject matter of this action. For the purpose of deciding the issues in this action, I am of the view that this shipment could beignored.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Before the first of the 29 shipments was effected, M &amp; M had given the Plaintiff shipping instructions that the M &amp; M's bankerwas the Bank of America of Transamerica Centre, 1155 S. Hill Street, Los Angeles and that the forwarder for the cargo should be theDefendant in Hong Kong and one Air Cargo Systems Inc. (hereinafter called "ACS") in Los Angeles. The shipping arrangement for thefirst of the 29 shipments was arranged by M &amp; M in that M &amp; M either themselves or through ACS informed the Defendant tocollect the goods from the Plaintiff. An Air Waybill No. ACS-185389 was duly issued by the Defendant naming the Plaintiff as theConsignor, The Bank of America as the Consignee and the freight was to be "freight collect".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> It is common ground that since the first consignment, a practice had gradually been established that the Defendant was no longerinformed by M &amp; M or ACS to approach the Plaintiff to collect goods for shipment. Instead the practice had developed that wheneverthere were goods to be shipped by the Plaintiff to M &amp; M, the Plaintiff would contact the Defendant and asked the Defendant tocome to collect the goods. It is not entirely clear as to when this practice had finally become established and in particular, thereis no specific evidence as to whether any of the 12 consignments now sued upon by the Plaintiff was effected as a result of the initiativeon the part of M &amp; M or the Plaintiff. What is clear from the documents put before me is that since the 4th shipment made on25th May, 1993, in respect of each subsequent shipments (including all the 12 shipments now sued upon), the Plaintiff had signeda shipper's instruction form addressed to the Defendant to ask the Defendant to receive the goods for shipment. I will have to revertto these shipper's instructions later. It is common ground that for each of the shipments, the Defendant issued an air waybill andgave the shipper's copy thereof to the Plaintiff. Each of the air waybills named the Plaintiff as the consignor, the Bank of Americaas the consignee and M &amp; Mas the notified party. Each of the air waybills contained inter alia the following clause:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(9) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this contract, delivery of the goods will be made only to the consignee named onthe face hereof, unless such consignee is one of the Carriers participating in the carriage, in which event, delivery shall be madeto the person indicated on the face hereof as the person to be notified. Notice of arrival of the goods will, in the absence of otherinstructions, be sent to the Consignee, or the person to be notified, by ordinary methods. Carrier is not liable for non-receiptor delay in receipt of such notice."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> As the sales by the Plaintiff to M &amp; M were on D/P basis, in each instance, the Plaintiff made out a commercial invoice, a custominvoice, a packing list and a bill of exchange drawn on M &amp; M at sight for the amount of the invoice. The Plaintiff presentedthese documents together with the shipper's copy of the air waybill and an insurance certificate to its bank, the Daiwa Bank, foronward transmission to Bank of America, the banker of M &amp; M. In the ordinary course of events, the Bank of America would notrelease the air waybill or the goods to M &amp; M without M &amp; M's acceptance and payment of the bill of exchange.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> All the shipments arrived at Los Angeles safely. The person handling the release of the goods at Los Angeles was ACS. When the goodsarrived, the goods would be put into the custody of the U.S. Customs at the air port. The documents which accompanied the shipmentsuch as the consignee's copy of the air waybill would be delivered to ACS. ACS would inform both the Bank of America and M &amp;M of the arrival of the goods. The persons who wanted to take delivery of the goods would have to approach ACS who would be responsiblefor releasing the documents required for taking delivery. It is not in dispute that in all shipments, including the 12 shipmentsnow under dispute, the release documents were given by ACS to M &amp; M's customs brokers who were the agents for M &amp; M to obtainrelease of the goods from the U.S. customs. It is also common ground that in fact all the goods were delivered to M &amp; M. It isclear from the evidence of Mr. Kenny Nakagawa, the President of ACS, that the goods were so released to M &amp; M without any consentor authorisation from the Bank of America, the consignee named on the air waybills.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> For all except the last 12 shipments, M &amp; M paid the Plaintiff although in nearly all instances, payments were only made aftermore than 30 days from the date of the arrival of the goods. A summary of the dates of the payments are set out in exhibit D-1 producedby the Defendant. It would appear that at least for one shipment under air waybill No. ACS 186307 dated 3rd August, 1993, the Plaintiffwas aware that the goods had been received by M &amp; M sometime by 10th August, 1993 and yet no payment was made until 10th December,1993. The explanation for allowing M &amp; M to delay in making payments was that there were some communication gaps between thevarious departments within the Plaintiff so that those making decisions for the supply of the goods were not kept up to date on thepayments outstanding and that often the Plaintiff agreed to ship further goods on the strength of the verbal assurances from M &amp;M that they had already paid or they would pay the outstanding bills shortly. The Plaintiff had however never enquired of M &amp;M as to how they could have obtained the goods without paying Bank of America. The Defendant contended that the only explanationfor this was that the Plaintiff had agreed to extend credit to M &amp; M and that the Plaintiff had agreed to allow M &amp; M totake delivery of the goods without payment. The Plaintiff denied ever agreeing to grant credit to M &amp; M and insisted that alldealings with M &amp; M were on D/P basis although the Plaintiff agreed that for business reasons, the Plaintiff often toleratedlate payments. Having heard the evidence from Mr. Chong of the Plaintiff and on all the circumstances of this case, I do not considerthat the Plaintiff had agreed to extend credit to M &amp; M. If the Plaintiff had done so, it would be very surprising that the Plaintiffwould continue to cause the Bank of America to be named as the consignee on the air waybills. Further if any credit was granted,the most natural thing to do was that the terms of dealing would be changed from D/P to D/A so that M &amp; M could legitimatelyobtain the documents for the delivery of the goods by accepting a bill of exchange payable on the date of the expiration of the creditperiod. Yet in the present case, M &amp; M had not accepted any bill of exchange drawn on it by the Plaintiff whether in respectof the shipments sued upon or otherwise. I find that although the Plaintiff knew that the goods in one of the shipments made in August1993 had been received by M &amp; M without payment, the Plaintiff had not appreciated that Defendant and ACS had adopted a practiceof just releasing goods to ACS without any authorisation from the Bank of America.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The 12 consignments, the subject matter of this proceeding, were shipped between 13th November, 1993 and 1st February, 1994. Thereis no dispute that the Plaintiff had not been paid by M &amp; M or any one in respect of these goods. There was no evidence thatthe Plaintiff was aware that these goods were released to M &amp; M until well after 21st February, 1994 when the Plaintiff wroteformally to M &amp; M to demand payment of outstanding bills threatening to ask the Defendant to return the goods if the bills shouldremain unpaid.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The Plaintiff's causes of action</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In the present case the Plaintiff brought this proceeding to recover from the Defendant the invoice value of the 12 shipments. ThePlaintiff sued in contract and also in tort as the owner of the goods. The Statement of Claim was not as clear and precise as itshould be. It is not very clear as to whether the Plaintiff claimed that there was a contract of carriage between the Plaintiff andthe Defendant and whether the Plaintiff was also making a claim against the Defendant for conversion of the goods. However as bothparties were not legally represented before me although the pleadings would appear to have been drawn up by solicitors there wasrelatively little point for me to seek clarifications from the parties and accordingly I decide to approach this case with the mostbenevolent interpretation of the pleadings giving the parties the full benefit of their legal rights as the evidence before me wouldsupport.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The Defence</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The Defendant's defences were (1) a general denial of the Plaintiff's right and title to claim. (2) the Defendant was merely agentfor ACS who was the carrier undertaking all liabilities and responsibilities of the carrier, (3) the Plaintiff was estopped fromclaiming in that the Plaintiff had informed the Defendant after the 1st shipment was made that the goods may be delivered to M &amp;M without the consent of the Bank of America and that the Plaintiff had agreed to grant M &amp; M credit, (4) certain exemption andlimitation clauses contained in the shipper's Instruction and (5) the Plaintiff was somehow not entitled to claim against the Defendantbecause the Plaintiff had since the commencement of this, proceeding also commenced proceedings in U.S.A. against M &amp; M ACS,the Defendant and other persons although the action against the Defendant in the U.S.A. had since been discontinued.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The Warsaw Convention and the right to sue</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The carriage of goods by air from Hong Kong to the United States is governed by the unamended Warsaw Convention of 1929 and the GuadalajaraConvention 1961. This is the result of a combination of the effects of a number of Acts of Parliament in the U.K. and Orders in Councilthe details of which were discussed by Trainor J. in Cordial Manufacturing Co. Ltd. &amp; another-v- Hong Kong - America Air TransportLtd.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20HKLR%20555" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] H.K.L.R. 555</a> at pages 561 to 567. The relevant provisions of the conventions are set out in Schedule 4 to the Caniage By Air Acts (Applicationof Provisions) (Overseas Territories) Order 1967. In Cordial's Case, the first plaintiff sold goods to the second plaintiff on f.o.b.terms and payment was to be made by letter of credit. The defendant was the carrier nominated by the second plaintiff. The defendantcollected the goods from the first plaintiff and issued an air waybill naming the first plaintiff as consignor and the second defendant'sbank as the consignee. Upon the arrival of the goods, the goods were delivered to some one who presented a set of forged documentsto obtain delivery. Trainor J. held that on the facts before him, neither the first plaintiff, the seller of the goods, nor the secondplaintiff, the buyer of the goods was entitled to claim against the carrier. The buyer's claim failed because Trainor J. took theview that under the Warsaw Convention only the consignor or the consignee named in the air waybill could bring an action againstthe carrier for loss and damage of the goods. The buyer, not being named as a consignor or consignee could not bring any action eventhough it had property in the goods. I shall revert to this part of his decision later. The seller's claim failed because if didnot have property in the goods at the time of the loss and that it was not a party to the contract of carriage. Trainor J. held thatthis would be so notwithstanding that in the air waybill, there was a term that the shipper (seller) guaranteed the payment or (sic)air charges and advances (see page 561,584). Although the seller was named as the consignor in the air waybill and as such was entitledto bring an action under the War saw Convention without showing any interest in the goods, such right to sue was only conferred byArticle 14 of the Convention and was limited to enforcing the rights conferred by Article 12. Article 14 of the Warsaw Conventionprovides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i><u>"Article14</u></i> The consignor and the consignee can respectively enforce all the rights given them by Articles 12 and 13, each in his own name, whetherhe is acting in his interest or in the interest of another, provided that he carries out the obligations imposed by the contract."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Articles 12 and 13 in turn provide:</p>    <p align="left" class="quote">          <i>"<u>Article 12</u></i></p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(1)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">Subject to his liability to carry out all his obligations under the contract of carriage, the consignor has the right to dispose ofthe cargo by withdrawing it at the aerodrome of departure or destination, or by stopping it in the course of the journey on any landing,or by calling for it to be delivered at the place of destination or in the course of the journey to a person other than the consigneenamed in the air waybill, or by requiring it to be returned to the aerodrome of departure.

The right of the consignor to sue arose when the carriage by air as defined commenced and ceased when the rightof the consignee came into existence. The right to sue would remain in the consignor no matter where the goods were lost or damagedif he had taken the necessary steps under Article 12 to retain it and had complied with the provisions of the Article. This rightto sue would exist despite any common law inhibition. However once the rights of the consignees had arisen those of the consignorwould cease. As the goods had arrived at the destination and the seller had not exercised any of the rights under Article 12. theright of the consignee had arisen and the consignor could no longer sue under the convention.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The decision of Trainor J. in <strong>Cordial's</strong> <strong>case</strong> was surprising and had given rise to great inconvenience in cases where the goods were consigned to the banks in pursuance of lettersof credit or D/A or D/P arrangements as this would effectively mean that in cases of mis-delivery at the port of destination, theconsignee bank who may not have any interest in the goods whatsoever would have to be the party to sue.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Three years after <strong>Cordial's</strong> case, the problem of the locus to sue in the case of air carriage arose again in <strong>Manchu Gems Ltd. and JP. Knight Co. -v- Pan American World Airways Inc.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20HKLR%20109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] H.K.L.R. 109.</a> In Manchu's case the first plaintiff sold goods to the second plaintiff and the arrangement was that the seller would arrange toship the goods to Cincinnati by air and the buyer would in due course reimburse the seller for the freight and insurance charges.It would appear that the goods had been fully paid before shipment in Hong Kong. The seller arranged to have a forwarding agent tocome to collect the goods and the agent duly sent the same to the Defendant for carriage. However as the defendant did not have anyflight to Cincinnati, the defendant merely carried the goods to San Francisco and there handed over the goods to another carrierfor onward carriage to Cincinnati. The goods were lost after the same were so handed over to the second carrier. It would appearthat the air waybill issued by the defendant named the seller as consignor and. the buyer as consignee. The claim by the buyer (whowas the owner of the goods at all material times) failed because as consignee he could only sued the last carrier and the carrierin whose hand the goods were lost under Article 30(3) of the Warsaw Convention. The defendant was not the last carrier nor were thegoods lost when the same were being carried by the defendant. This does not necessarily mean that Cons J. had implicitly endorsedthe views of Trainor J. In <strong>Cordial's</strong> case that the right to sue was limited to only the consignor or the consignee by excluding an onwer of the goods who was neithera consignor nor a consignee to sue as the owner had not brought any action against the carrier in whose possession the goods werelost. Cons J. however held that the seller's claim succeeded on the ground that although the seller did not have any property inthe goods and had not exercised its rights under Article 12 of the Warsaw Convention, it could sue in common law as being the personwho made a special contract of carriage with the defendant under the well known common law principles established in a series ofcases like <strong>Dunlop -v- Lambert</strong> (1839) 6 CI. &amp; F. 600 and <strong>The Albazero</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20AC%20774" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] A.C. 774.</a> Cons J. found that there was a special contract of carriage made between the seller and the carrier because the carrier was specificallychosen by the seller's forwarding agent and the seller was directly responsible to the carrier for the freight although there wasa right of reimbursement of the freight from the buyer.</p>    <p align="left"><u>Was there a special contract of carriage between the Plaintiff and the Defendant?</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The evidence in this case was that at the beginning of their business relationship M &amp; M had nominated the Defendant to be the"forwarding agent" for carriage of the goods to the Defendant. The evidence did establish that for the first shipment, the contractualarrangement was made by M &amp; M who either itself or through its agent ACS informed the Defendant to collect the goods from thePlaintiff for shipment. However as I have set out earlier in this judgment, since the 4<sup>th</sup> shipment on 25<sup>th</sup> May, 1993, the Plaintiff had issued to the Defendant shippers' instruction forms in respect of each shipment. For all but the first2 consignments sued upon in this action (i.e. air waybills nos. ACS-187111 and ACS-187171) the shipper's instruction forms were inthe printed forms supplied by the Defendant. The material part of the form contained the following terms:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">"Please receive the undermentioned cargo for delivery by air in accordance with the terms and conditions and provisions stated orreferred to on the air waybill form of the Carriers."</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">"We hereby guarantee payment of all freight collect charges due to the forwarders or to the carrier if the shipment is abandoned,refused by the consignee, returned at our request, confiscated by the customs or for any other reason cannot be delivered withina reasonable time.

ACS 187111 and ACS 187171 instead of using the forms supplied by theDefendant, the Plaintiff instructed the Defendant by using a shipper's instruction form of another air carrier or forwarder TransAm Air Freight (H.K.) Ltd. In this form, the Plaintiff agreed that "the customer (i.e. the Plaintiff) declared that pursuant to Condition15 of the Conditions of Contract overleaf, if (i.e. the Plaintiff) shall be responsible for all charges and expenses relating tothe goods whether or not the charges and expenses are to be prepaid or collected."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> In his evidence before me, Mr Chong of the Plaintiff told me that all freights were in fact paid by M &amp; M. However there wereother charges on the part of the Defendant which were all paid by the Plaintiff. Mr. Cheng of the Defendant also confirmed this inevidence. Further more he told me that it was clearly the understanding of the parties that although all these consignments wereon freight collect basis, the Plaintiff would have to pay the full freight in the event that the same was not paid by the personsat the destination. It was patent that neither the Plaintiff nor the Defendant had paid much attention to the detailed wordings ofthe clauses contained in the shipper's instruction. It is common ground that in pursuance of the shipper's instructions the Defendantwent to the Plaintiff's premises to collect the goods for shipment and in due course, the Defendant also issued an air waybill inrespect of the carriage. The air waybill was made out in accordance with the terms and directions set out in the shipper's instruction.In these circumstances the question is whether there was any special contract of carriage between the Plaintiff and the Defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> On the facts before me I am of the view that there was such a contract of carriage between the Plaintiff and the Defendant in respectof each of the 12 consignments the subject matter of this action. Although the Defendant was initially nominated by M &amp; M atthe beginning of the business relationship between the Plaintiff and M &amp; M there was no suggestion that in any one of the 12consignments in this action, It was M &amp; M who instructed the Defendant to collect the goods for shipment. There was not evenany suggestion that after the initial instruction to use the Defendant, M &amp; M had ever instructed the Plaintiff to use the Defendantin any of the subsequent sales to it. it would appear to me that as the Defendant was a carrier acceptable to M &amp; M the Plaintifffound it suitable to continue to use the Defendant to effect shipments to M &amp; M. As evidenced by the shipper's instruction forms,it was rather the Plaintiff who took the initiative to contact the Defendant to ask the Defendant to ship the goods. Likewise itwas the Plaintiff who decided what goods he would like the Defendant to carry and the person to whom the delivery was to be madeand also the place of destination. Of course one would have expected that the Plaintiff would only ask the Defendant to carry somuch of the goods as were to be sold by the Plaintiff to M &amp; M. However as between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, the Defendantwas in no way concerned with whether the goods it was asked to carry were those required or wanted by M &amp; M. The fact that theDefendant was the carrier which M &amp; M would like or even insist on the Plaintiff to use does not mean that the contract of carriagewould necessarily be between the Defendant and M &amp; M. 1 see no objection to some one saying to his vendor that if you want tosell me goods, you have to make a contract with Mr. X for him to carry the goods to me.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Of course, it is possible to argue that in dealing with the Defendant, the Plaintiff did so as the agent for M &amp; M. This analysiswould receive support from the fact that as between the Plaintiff and M &amp; M, it was M &amp; M who was primarily responsible forthe freight and that even as between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, the Defendant would first look to the person collecting goodsat the destination to pay the freight. However this does not mean that the Defendant would first look to M &amp; M to pay the freight.In cases such as the present where the goods were in fact consigned to a bank, a consignment on freight collect would mean that theDefendant would expect the back, the person who is entitled to take delivery of the goods to pay the freight. Further more, I amof the view that it was wholly artificial to consider that the Plaintiff was dealing with the Defendant as agent for M &amp; M. Underthe arrangement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant the Plaintiff was directly responsible for the payment of a lot of othercharges for which M &amp; M was not responsible. It would be wholly artificial to say that in entering into the deal to undertaketo forward or deliver the goods to M &amp; M or its bank, the Defendant had in fact entered into 2 contracts, one with the Plaintifffor the collection of the goods from the Plaintiff's premises and another with M &amp; M for the carriage by air of the goods fromHong Kong to Los Angeles for delivery to the order of the Bank of America. To adopt this analysis, one would have to overcome thedifficulty of deciding the precise scope of the contract with the Plaintiff. Surely the contract could not be just for the receiptof the goods from the Plaintiff only. It must be the receipt of the goods for delivery to someone somewhere. Inevitably the nextquestions are who was this someone and where was this somewhere? The only sensible answers were that the delivery was to be madeto the Bank of America or its order and the goods were to be delivered at Los Angeles as stated in the shipper's instruction forms.The Plaintiff had given no instruction to the Defendant otherwise than in the shipper's instruction forms. This would in fact meanthat the whole contract for carriage by air between the Defendant and M &amp; M would then be wholly subsumed into this collateralcontract with the Plaintiff. This is a situation which I found it difficult to accept.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> I appreciate that in <strong>Cordial's case</strong>, on the facts before him Trainor J. held that in effect there were 2 contracts, one between the seller and the carrier and the otherbetween the carrier and either the purchaser or the consignee and it was the latter which was the contract of carriage by air. TrainorJ. said (at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20HKLR%20555" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] H.K.L.R. 555</a> AT 584):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The instant case is an example of a very ordinary situation when goods were given to a carrier for delivery to a named consignee,the freight to be paid by someone other than the first plaintiff. In this case there do not exist circumstances which would evensuggest that the first plaintiff was acting as an agent for the second. plaintiff to make a contract with the defendant. It merelydelivered the goods to the carrier stipulated by the second plaintiff and thereby put in train circumstances which gave rise to acontract between the carrier and another, be it Irving Trust Inc., the consignee or the second plaintiff. The first plaintiff wasnot a party to the contract; there was no privity of contract between it and the defendant. There was a contract, perhaps, betweenthe first plaintiff and the defendant to take the goods from the first plaintiff's factory or warehouse in consideration of whichthe first plaintiff paid cartage and some "local payment" but that contract was fulfilled when the goods were transported to America.I am aware that the first plaintiff guaranteed the payment of the air charges and advances but that does not make him a party tothe contract of carriage; it is a separate and distinct contract."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> With all respects to Trainor J. if there were to be a separate contract made between the carrier and the seller of the goods at all,I find it surprising that this contract would only be fulfilled when the goods had reached America, the destination of the goodsunder the air carriage contract. At any rate the present case was distinguishable from the <strong>Cordial's case</strong>. First this was not a case that goods were merely delivered to a carrier so as to put in train circumstances which gave rise to acontract of carriage between the carrier and the consignee bank or M &amp; M. The Defendant was directed by the shipper's instructionto deliver the goods to the consignee bank at Los Angeles specifically. This is a matter of importance to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiffconsigned the goods to the Bank as part of the D/P arrangement in order to make sure that the property in the goods and the rightof disposal of the same would not pass to M &amp; M without payment of the price by M &amp; M. The Plaintiff would not have leftthe goods with the Defendant if someone else was entitled to direct the Defendant to deliver the goods to another person withoutpayment of the price. Having received the goods in pursuance to the terms of the shipper's instruction, the Defendant would haveto comply with the direction in the instruction and there was little room for any separate contract of carriage between the Defendantand M &amp; M or the bank. The matter could be tested this way. If there was to be a separate contract of carriage between the Defendantand either M &amp; M or the bank, it must be open to the Defendant and M &amp; M or the bank to agree to change the place of destinationor the name of the consignee under this contract of carriage. Thus assuming that after the Plaintiff had delivered the goods to theDefendant in pursuance of the shipper's instruction, the Defendant and M &amp; M or the bank were to agree that the goods shouldbe delivered to someone else. and at some other place, common sense would dictate that this would be a wholly unacceptable proposition.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Secondly I do not agree that the undertaking to pay freight on the part of the Plaintiff should only give rise to a separate contractof guarantee. No doubt the word used in the relevant clause in the shipper's instruction was the word "guarantee" which suggestedthat someone else was the party primarily liable for the freight. I see no conceptual difficulty in having a contract of carriagebetween A and B whereby in consideration of A agreeing to carry the goods for delivery to C and to ask C for the payment of the freightbefore the goods are to be released to C. B would agree to pay A the freight in event that C would not pay the freight to take deliveryof the goods. On the facts before me, it would appear that the only means for which the Defendant could enforce payment of the freightfrom M &amp; M or the Bank of America was to refuse to release the goods unless the freight was paid. If there was in fact a separatecontract of air carriage between the Defendant and M &amp; M or the Bank of America surely it would have been open to the Defendantto sue either M &amp; M or the Bank of America for the freight whether they want to take delivery of the goods or not. In so faras the Bank of America is concerned, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the Bank of America would be liable for the freight whenthere was not even a shred of evidence to show that it had given any prior approval to any arrangement that it should be named asthe consignee. In so far as M &amp; M is concerned, there was no evidence to suggest that it had ever agreed with the Defendant topay any freight as there was no contact between the Defendant and M &amp; M whatsoever before the arrival of the goods. If therewas any undertaking on the part of M &amp; M to pay the freight, it must be founded on the basis that the Plaintiff as agent forM &amp; M in arranging the shipment of the goods had given an implied undertaking to pay the freight on M &amp; M's behalf. But whyshould it be necessary to infer such agency relationship between the Plaintiff and M &amp; M when the whole arrangement was perfectlyworkable and would make commercial sense without such agency relationship? Further more given that the Plaintiff had given an undertakingto pay the freight in the event that the same was not paid by some one at the port of destination to secure the delivery of the goods,if the Plaintiff was not a party to the contract of carriage, the question would be what was the consideration given by the Defendantto support such guarantee? The answer could only be that the consideration was the Defendant's agreeing to enter into a contractof carriage with M &amp; M or the Bank of America and did so upon the issuance of the air waybill. I would consider that this isa wholly artificial analysis of the factual situation. The reality of the situation was that the Defendant did not care who was theconsignee named and who was the notifying party and certainly the Defendant would not have thought of the fact that in taking goodsfrom the Plaintiff in pursuance of the shipper's instruction, the Defendant had in fact agreed that it would enter into a contractto carry the goods on the terms of the instruction with someone else.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> As I have come to the conclusion that on the evidence before me there was a special contract of carriage made between the Plaintiffand the Defendant in respect of each of the 12 consignments, the subject matter of this action, the Plaintiff had a good cause ofaction against the Defendant at common law. (see Manchu's case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20HKLR%20109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] H.K.L.R. 109)</a> whether it had property in the goods at the time of loss or not.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The property in the goods</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> All 12 shipments were made on D/P basis. In respect of each of the shipments the Plaintiff had caused a bill of exchange to be drawnon M &amp; M. M &amp; M did not accept the bill of exchange in respect of any of the shipments. The Bank of America had subsequentlyreturned the sets of documents it received to the Plaintiff. Although in the hearing before me the Plaintiff was only able to producethe originals of 9 sets of documents which were so returned by the Bank of America. I am satisfied that the remaining 3 shipmentswere handled in the same manner. In this respect I accept the evidence from the Plaintiff that the original of the remaining 3 setswere misplaced and could no be found. In the circumstances of this case, the question is whether any property in the goods wouldhave passed to M &amp; M upon shipment of the same.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> I am of the view that by sending the air waybill naming the Bank of America as the consignee together with the bill of exchange forthe price drawn on the Defendant to the Bank of America, the Plaintiff had reserved the property in the goods. This is a situationwhich was governed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 21(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26" class="autolink_findacts">Sale of Goods Ordinance</a> which provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(3) Where the seller of goods draws on the buyer for the price, and transmits the bill of exchange and bill of lading to the buyertogether to secure acceptance or payment of the bill of exchange, the buyer is bound to return the bill of lading if he does nothonour the bill of exchange, and if he wrongfully retains the bill of lading the property in the goods does not pass to him."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Although <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 21(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26" class="autolink_findacts">Sale of Goods Ordinance</a> speaks of the bill of lading, I am of the view that the same must also apply to cases such as the present when an air waybill naminga bank as the consignee is used.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> The Defendant however contended that in fact the Plaintiff had extended credit to M &amp; M. If this was so, of course, the propertyin the goods would have passed to M &amp; M.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Mr. Cheng of the Defendant gave evidence before me. He told me in evidence that after the second or the third of the 29 shipmentshe had a telephone conversation with Mr. Chong of the Plaintiff about releasing the goods to M &amp; M. In his witness statementwhich he adopted as part of his examination in chief, he said that in or about the end of May, 1993 he received a telephone callfrom Mr. Chong who told him to release the goods to the buyer without securing consent of the consignee bank. According to his statement,Mr. Chong had further told him that the Plaintiff had agreed to grant M &amp; M credit terms of 90 days in this and future sales.I have also asked him to further elaborate this conversation he had with Mr. Chong. He told me that he could not be sure as to thebackground of this conversation. He thought that this conversation was probably prompted by the fact that M &amp; M had informedthe Plaintiff that it was not going to take delivery of the goods. He said that Mr. Chong told him to release the goods and to changethe name of the consignee from the Bank of America to M &amp; M. Thereupon he informed ACS by phone to release the goods to M &amp;M. He told me that he only told ACS to release the goods for that consignment and he had not gone on to say that ACS could do thesame in the future. In cross examination, he admitted that he did not know Mr. Chong of the Plaintiff and he had only got this onesingle telephone conversation with him until the Plaintiff made a claim against the Defendant in 1994. He agreed that normally aftersuch a direction for release of the goods, he would expect the shipper to follow up with a written confirmation letter. However headmitted that he did not have any such written confirmation. He also admitted that apart from the very shipment in or about May 1993in relation to which Mr. Chong had phoned to tell him to change the name of the consignee to M &amp; M, he did not know at the timethat ACS had also released the goods to M &amp; M without the consent or endorsement of the Bank of America for all subsequent shipments.He left it to the people in ACS in Los Angeles to handle the release of the goods.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Mr. Chong of the Plaintiff denied that he had ever had any such conversation with Mr. Cheng. He further said that at no time hadthe Plaintiff ever agreed to give credit to M &amp; M and that all along, the Plaintiff dealt with M &amp; M on D/P basis. He toldme that at all material times, the Plaintiff dealt with one Mr. Lee of the Defendant and it was Miss Rita Lam of the Plaintiff whodid the liaison work. Miss Lam confirmed what he said.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> It is also interesting to compare Mr. Cheng's evidence with that of Mr. Kenny Nakagawa, the President of ACS. Mr. Nakagawa told methat the practice adopted by ACS was that when the goods arrived, the documents which accompanied shipment including the consignee'scopy of the air waybill would be given by the air line to ACS would then notified both the consignee, Bank of America and also thenotified party, M &amp; M of the arrival of the goods. When the first of the 29 shipments arrived, he took instruction from the Bankof America and he was told to contact M &amp; M direct for the release of the goods. He then spoke to one Benny whose full name wasMohammed Ibrahim, the proprietor of M &amp; M. He was told by Benny that the Plaintiff had granted M &amp; M credit. He then soughtand obtained verification of what he was told from Mr. Cheng of the Defendant. Accordingly he released the goods to M &amp; M withoutany consent or authorisation from the Bank of America. He said that the same exercise was repeated in relation to the second shipment.In relation to the 3rd shipment, he said that instead of himself speaking to Mr. Cheng of the Defendant to seek verification thatthe shipper would agree to release the goods to M &amp; M he asked a staff of his company to do so. The feed back from his staffwas that the goods could be so released and there was no need to ask in the future. Accordingly ACS did not ask for any further verificationor instruction from the Defendant since and had proceeded to release all subsequent shipments to M &amp; M without any consent, endorsementor authorisation from the Bank of America.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> The evidence of what the staff of ACS might have told Mr. Nakagawa was obviously inadmissible hearsay. That version of the storywas not even supported by Mr. Cheng of the Defendant. Having heard the evidence of Mr. Nakagawa I do not think that Mr. Nakagawawas a credible witness. I am unable to accept his evidence as to what he was told by Mr. Cheng and certainly his evidence as to whathis staff was supposed to have been informed by the Defendant was hardly credible. In so far as Mr. Cheng's evidence is concerned,I do not accept his evidence that either Mr. Chong or any one from the Plaintiff had told him that the Plaintiff had agreed to grantcredit to M &amp; M in a particular sale and I do not think that Mr. Chong would have told him that the Plaintiff had agreed to grantM &amp; M credit on the future sales as suggested in his witness statement. I see no reason for any one from the Plaintiff to informthe Defendant any credit or financial arrangement between the Plaintiff and its customer M &amp; M. Indeed if after shipment of thegoods, the Plaintiff should like M &amp; M to get the goods of that shipment without requiring M &amp; M to make any immediate payment,the natural thing to do was to instruct the Bank of America through the Plaintiff's own bank that they may release the air waybillto M &amp; M without requiring the latter to accept and pay the bill of exchange. I see no reason for the Plaintiff to want to instructthe carrier to release the goods in defiance of the terms of the air waybill. As I have pointed out earlier, the Defendant had alsorelied on the fact that M &amp; M had been in great delay in the payment of the goods and it was suggested that this could only beexplained on the basis that the Plaintiff had agreed to grant credit to M &amp; M. I have already given my view on this suggestionearlier. I do not think the documentation adopted by the parties was consistent with the suggestion that the Plaintiff had agreedto grant credit to M &amp; M.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Accordingly I am of the view that the Plaintiff was still the owner of the goods at the time of the delivery of the same by ACS toM &amp; M</p>    <p align="left"><u>The right to sue as owner</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> In <strong>Cordial's case</strong> Trainor J. held that under the Warsaw Convention only one person could sue the carrier and that person must be either the consignoror the consignee. In the case of the consignor unless he had exercised his right under Article 12 before the right of the consigneeunder Article 13 had arisen, he could not sue once the right of the consignee under Article 13 had arisen. This would effectivelymean that unless the Plaintiff had exercised the right under Article 12 (which the Plaintiff had not), once the goods had arrivedat Los Angeles, the Plaintiff had lost the right to sue. The fact that the Plaintiff was the owner of the goods did not entitle himto bring any action against the carrier. In so deciding that the owner of the goods per se had no locus to sue the carrier for lossof cargo in respect of carriage by air governed by the Warsaw Convention, Trainor J. had in fact followed the precedent of a numberoff decisions of the Courts in the United States and the decision of <strong>Bart -v- British West Indian Airways Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20239" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 1 Lloyd's Rep 239</a>, a decision of the Guyana Court of Appeal.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> The proposition that the owner of the goods could not bring an action against the carrier for loss and damage to his cargo duringthe course of carriage is a startling proposition. In the case where goods are consigned to a banker under D/P arrangement but arewrongfully released to someone else, usually the consignee banker would have no real interest in the goods. In the present case,the Bank of America would not even have any interest in the goods as security as his customer got the goods without any payment andhence the overwhelming probabilities would be that the Bank of America had not even lent the price against the security of the goods.In this situation, it is understandable that the consignee banker would have little incentive to be involved in any litigation againstthe carrier. It is also understandable that the Plaintiff could not get the Bank of America to join as a Co-Plaintiff as the Bankof America was basically the banker of M &amp; M.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Although I am not bound by the decision of Trainor J. in <strong>Cordial's case</strong>, that decision is of very persuasive authority and it would be my duty to follow that decision unless there are strong reasons tothe contrary. I am not persuaded that this part of the decision is correct. As I have pointed out ealier, the decision gave riseto a most startling proposition and in my view, the decision could only be justified if there are some plain provisions in the WarsawConvention which expressly exclude the right of any one other than the consignor or the consignee to sue. In 1988, the point wasraised in England in <strong>Gatewhite Ltd. and another -v- Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana S.A.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20QB%20326" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 Q.B. 326</a> where goods were carried by the defendant by air from Las Palmas to London. The consignor was the seller of the goods and the consigneewas the customs clearing agents of the buyer to whom the property in the goods had passed. The goods arrived damaged owing to anunaccountable delay. The action was brought against the carrier by both the shipper and also the buyer. In an application for summaryjudgment by the buyer to which the shipper had taken no part, it was agreed by the parties to the summons to treat the hearing ofthe summons as the trial of the action. It was not in dispute that the carriage was governed by the amended Warsaw Convention thetext of which could be found in the First Annex to Schedule 1 of the Carriage By Air (Overseas Territories) Order 1967. The carriercontended that as the buyer was merely the owner of the goods and was not the consignor or the consignee, the action could not succeed.In his judgment. Gatehouse J. reviewed the provisions in the amended Warsaw Convention including in particular articles 12, 13, 14,15(3) 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, &amp; 30 and also the long chains of decisions of the Courts in the United States and other jurisdictionssuch as <strong>Manhattan Novelty Corporation -v- Seaboard &amp; Western Airlines Inc</strong>.

A.C.L.R. No. 468 and also the decision of Trainor J. in <strong>Cordial's case</strong>. In all these cases, the courts had all come to the view that the only person who could sue the carrier of an air carriage coveredby the Warsaw Convention was only the consignor or the consignee. Apart from following the precedent of the previous cases, the reasonsgiven in all these decisions was that such was the result of the combination effects of Articles 12 to 15 of the Convention. It hadalso been suggested that the result was justified on the policy ground that it was reasonable that the carrier be subject to suitonly by those whom it knowingly dealt with viz. the consignor and the consignee and that it was not unreasonable that the identitiesof consignor and consignee be disclosed in the air waybill and that others be not permitted to sue. Gatehouse J. was not convincedthat the articles relied upon have any effect of excluding persons other than the consignor and the consignee to sue. Further therewould appear to be no reason why the air carrier should only be made liable to parties with whom it knowingly dealt when the carrierby sea was not so protected. (see [1990] 1 Q.B. at 332F). In the end Gatehouse J. was impressed by views to the contrary expressedin the dissenting judgment of Steyn C.J. in the <strong>Pan American World Airway's</strong> case and also the decision of Prichard J. in the New Zealand High Court in <strong>Tasman Pulp &amp; Paper Co.

As the Convention does not expressly deal with the position by excluding the owner'sright of action (though it could so easily have done so) the lex fori, as it seems to me, can fill the gap. While bearing in mindthe need to guard against the parochial view of the common lawyer, I see no good reason why the civil lawyer's approach to the constructionof the Convention, based on the importance of contract, should be of overriding importance. The fact is that the convention is silentwhere it could easily have made simple and clear provision excluding the rights of the "real party in interest," had that been theframers' intention.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">It would be a curious and unfortunate situation if the right to sue had to depend on the ability and willingness of the consigneealone to take action against the carrier, when the consignee may be - and no doubt frequently is - merely a customs clearing agent,a forwarding agent or the buyer's bank.

I do not think that there is anything in either the Warsaw Convention or the amended Warsaw Convention which limits theright to sue to only the consignor or the consignee. Approaching the matter as a matter of principle and public policy, I have nodoubt that there is no justification to limit the right to sue only to the consignor or the consignee.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> I would add that no doubt the articles in the Warsaw Convention have granted certain rights to the consignor and the consignee andhave imposed certain obligations on the carrier. The articles do not expressly say that these rights and obligations are exhausive.In my view <strong>Manchu's case</strong> would indicate that Cons J. did not consider that the right to sue in cases governed by the Warsaw Convention must necessarily berestricted to enforcing those rights expressly granted by the articles of the Convention. Although the views of Trainor J. in <strong>Cordial's case</strong> on the right to sue being restricted to either the consignor or the consignee had been noted by Cons J. without any comment (see <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20HKLR%20109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] H.K.L.R. 109</a> at 111), the very decision in <strong>Manchu's case</strong> would indicate that Cons J. was prepared to hold that a person was entitled to enforce against a carrier his common law right asbeing a party to a spcial contract which was not a right granted by the Warsaw Convention at all. If a person could enforce his "nonconvention" common law right under a special contract against the carrier, I see no reason why a person should not be allowed toenforce his common law rights as the owner of the goods. In my view, in <strong>Manchu's case</strong> it was a matter of fortuity that the person who made the special contract happened to be also named as the consignor on the air waybill.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> I would therefore not follow the decision of Trainor J. in Cordial's case and I would hold that the Plaintiff had a good cause ofaction against the Defendant based on the Plaintiff's ownership of the goods and this would be so even if the Plaintiff was not aparty to the contract of carriage.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The agency defence</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> This defence was raised in paragraph 3 of the Amended Defence where the Defendant pleaded that in fact the Defendant was merely theHong Kong agent of ACS who was the carrier. If this defence was made out, it would mean that even thought the Plaintiff was a partyto a special contract of air carriage, he could only sue ACS who was the carrier with whom the Plaintiff had contracted. Likewiseany claim in tort or bailment based on the ownership of the goods would also fail as the goods were wrongfully given away by ACSwho, on this scenario, would not be the Defendant's agent. In my view this defence fails on the facts. I can see no evidence to showthat ACS was the Defendant's principal in relation to any one of the 12 contracts contained in or evidenced by the 12 air waybillsin this case. All the evidence would point to the other direction - that ACS was the Defendant's agent in handling the delivery ofthe goods at the Los Angeles end.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The estoppel defence</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Again in my view, this defence fails as I am not satisfied that the Plaintiff had made any representation that the goods might bedelivered to M &amp; M without the consent, endorsement or authority of the Bank of America, the consignee named in the air waybills.Even if which I do not so find, the Plaintiff had on one occasion in May 1993 informed the Defendant that the goods could be releasedto M &amp; M without any air waybill or without the consent, endorsement or approval of the named consignee, I do not think thatthat would justify the delivery of all the 12 consignments of the goods, the subject matter of this action, to M &amp; M in the samemanner. After all, each of the air waybills would form the subject matter of a separate contract and under each of the air waybills,there was a fresh and separate undertaking on the part of the Defendant as carrier to deliver only to the consignee (see clause 9of the air waybill). Even if at some point of time in the past, the Plaintiff had informed the Defendant that delivery could be madeto M &amp; M, I could not see how this could affect the terms of the contracts subsequently entered into between the parties. FurtherI could not see how it could be said that the Plaintiff had agreed to give any credit to M &amp; M would give rise to the defenceof estoppel. I could not see how the Defendant or ACS could take advantage of the contractual arrangement between the Plaintiff andM &amp; M. as a justification for the non performance of its own obligations under the contracts of carriage. In any event, my viewis that the Plaintiff had not agreed to grant any credit to M &amp; M nor had the Plaintiff ever informed the Defendant that it hadgranted credit to M &amp; M.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The exemption clause defence</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> As the carriage was governed by the Warsaw Convention, the Defendant would not be entitled to rely on any exemption clause or anylimitation of liability clause which gave the Defendant wider protections than what are laid down in the Convention. This is theresult of Article 23 of the Convention which provides:</p>    <p align="left" class="quote">          <u>"Article 23</u></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lower limit than that which is laid down in this schedule shallbe null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subjectto the provisions of this schedule."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Under the Warsaw Convention, the Plaintiff would have 2 years from the date of arrival of the goods at the destination to bring anaction (see Article 29) and the Plaintiff had brought this action within the 2 years period. Any provisions relied upon by the Defendantto provide for a shorter period to bring action would thus be void. In so far as the limitation of liability is concerned, underthe Warsaw Convention, the limitation provided would be 250 francs (equivalent to HK$135) per kilogram (see Article 22(2) &amp; Carriageby Air (Overseas Territories) (Hong Kong dollar equivalents) Order 1984) which would appear to be higher than the limitation of $200per package relied upon by the Defendant. However the Plaintiff contended that the Defendant was not entitled to rely on any limitationof liability at all because of Article 25 of the Convention which says:</p>    <p align="left" class="quote">          <u>"Article 25</u></p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(1)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">The carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of this schedule which exclude or limit his liability, if thedamage is caused by his wilful misconduct or by such default on his part as, in accordance with the law of the court seized of thecase, is considered to be equivalent to wilful misconduct.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(2)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">Similarly the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the said provisions.

And others -v- South African Airways and others</strong> [1977]1 Lloyd's Rep 564 at 569 Ackner J. held that "wilful misconduct" went far beyond any negligence, even gross or culpable negligence,and involved a person doing or omitting to do that which was not only negligent but which he knew and appreciated was wrong, andwas done or omitted regardless of the consequences, not caring what the result of his carelessness might be. On the facts of the<strong>Rustenbury's case</strong>, both Ackner J. and the Court of Appeal (see  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%2019" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 Lloyd's Rep 19</a>,24) held that the act on the part of the loaders employed by the carrier amounted to wilful misconduct because the loaders had actedin concert with some other persons to steal the goods. In this case, the goods were simply delivered to M &amp; M in blatant disregardof the contractual obligation imposed by the terms of the air waybill by ACS, the agent of the Defendant. I am of the view that suchconduct on the part of ACS would amount to wiful misconduct. As I do not accept the evidence that there was any representation fromthe Plaintiff or from the Defendant to ACS that all shipments might be delivered to M &amp; M without the consent, endorsement orauthorisation of the consignee bank, what ACS did would simply amount to acting in concert with M &amp; M to give away the goodsto M &amp; M. Whether ACS had received any assurances from M &amp; M that it was entitled to delivery of the goods without paymentas the Plaintiff had agreed to grant it credit was immaterial. I do not consider that any reasonable person in the position of ACScould simply act on such representation of the person who wanted to take delivery of the goods.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Accordingly I am of the view that the Defendant was not entitled to rely on any exemption or limitation of liability under the WarsawConvention. To this extent and for this reason, any exemption or limitation clause in the shipper's instruction would be renderednull and void by Article 23 and could not be relied on.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The U.S. proceedings defence</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> The Plaintiff admitted that it had brought proceedings in the United States against ACS, M &amp; M and a number of other personsincluding the Defendant for the recovery of the value of the 12 shipments. I was told that the cause of action there was conspiracy.The action against the Defendant was withdrawn. However there was as yet no trial of the action in the United States and the Plaintiffhad not obtained any judgment not to say satisfaction of any judgment against any one yet. In these circumstances I do not thinkthe mere existence of the U.S. proceedings on a related cause of action would be a defence to the Plaintiff's claim in this case.</p>    <p align="left"><u>Quantum</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> The Plaintiff claimed the total invoice value of the goods for the 12 consignments. In the ordinary case I would consider that wouldbe the appropriate measure of the damages. However in the present case, it is clear that each of the invoice was inflated by a sumrepresenting US$0.2 per piece of the watches shipped. This added amount was for the purpose of repayment by M &amp; M of an old debtdue to Continental Watch Company which was owned by the brother of Mr. Chong of the Plaintiff. In these circumstances I do not thinkthe Plaintiff is entitled to claim this extra sum of money. After deducting the element of old debts from the 12 invoices, the amountof the claim is reduced to US$177,293.45.</p>    <p align="left"><u>Conclusion</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> The Plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the sum of US$177,293.45. In exercise of my discretion I will hold that the Plaintiff shouldbe entitled to be paid interest. Interest will normally be awarded at the rate of certain percentage above the prime rate. Howeveras the claim was in U.S. dollars and unlike the situation in Hong Kong different banks in the United States may have different primerates, to avoid any uncertainty I will direct that the Plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 8% from the date of the writ.</p>    <p align="left">  </p>    <p align="left">  </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">Edward Chan Q.C.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Recorder)</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">  </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">The Plaintiff in person represented by Madam Lin, its director, in pursuance of leave granted under Order 5 rule 6(3)</p>        <p align="left">The Defendant in person represented by Mr. Cheng, its director, in pursuance of leave granted under Order 5 rule 6(3)</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/1996/351.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
