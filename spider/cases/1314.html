Similarly, clause 10 of PTA provides thatshould Fenton (as landlord) fail to let the Property to Jungle in the manner contained in PTA, Fenton shall compensate Jungle witha sum equivalent to the amount of the deposit together with a refund of the deposit paid and Jungle shall not take any further actionfor specific performance or damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The protagonists in this case are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">a.

Cabirol signed EAA [Bundle 3, pp.296-299] on 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003.  (There is some dispute between Jungle and Centaline as to the circumstances of the signing of EAA by Cabirol, which willbe dealt with below.)</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">c.

For the present purpose, it may be noted that Cheung took the Cabirolsto the Property for inspection for the first time in July 2003 and in the absence of anyone from Fenton.  (There is in fact somedispute between Jungle and Centaline as to when exactly in July did Cheung take the Cabirols to inspect the Property for the firsttime.  This will be further discussed.) </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">d.

She says that Cheung laterconfirmed with her on 4<sup>th</sup> August 2003 by phone that the formal tenancy agreement would indeed be signed at the Property on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Essentially, Jungleâs case is that the Cabirols had attended the Property on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003 for the signing of the formal tenancy agreement in accordance with PTA but no one from either Fenton or Centaline turnedup.  Hence, Jungle says, Fenton and Centaline were in breach of PTA, and Centaline failed in its duties as Jungleâs agent.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> According to the Cabirols, they began waiting outside the Property on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003 from about 5 pm.

According to Fu, she called Cheung 2 to 3 timeswith the public phone at the supermarket but the calls were all diverted to the voicemail.  She left a message in Cheungâs voicemailto the effect that the Cabirols had been waiting outside the Property and asked Cheung to call her back.  Fu also called Centalineâsbranch office in which Cheung worked but was informed that Cheung was out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The couple waited outside the Property until about 7:30 pm.

Ward further instructed her that the venue for the execution of the formal tenancy agreement would also beFenton's office.  Cheung informed Fu of the result as well as the arrangement to sign the formal tenancy agreement at Fentonâsoffice.  This, according to Cheung, was accepted by Fu. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> On 2<sup>nd</sup> August 2003, Cheung took PTA to Fentonâs office for Ward to sign.  Later, Cheung arranged her colleague Ms. Leona Wong to takethe Cabirols to the Property again for them to take some measurements. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> In the evening of 4<sup>th</sup> August 2003, Cheung received a telephone call from Fu who demanded a deferment of the commencement of the tenancy for 5-6 monthsfor <i>fung shui</i> reasons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> On 5<sup>th</sup> August 2003, Cheung called Ward and A-Kusters to discuss Jungleâs request for deferring the commencement of the tenancy.  Thiswas rejected.  Fu later requested a shorter deferment, which was also rejected by Fenton.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> At about 1 pm on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003, Fu called Cheung and said that Jungle would not execute any formal tenancy agreement in respect of the Property.  Cheungcommunicated Jungleâs stance to Fenton.  Cheung later called Fu again to try to persuade her to change her mind but without success.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Meanwhile, Ward and A-Kusters made themselves available at Fentonâs office for the execution of the formal tenancy agreement notwithstandingJungleâs stance.  R-Kusters also stood by in his office in Ningbo.  No one from Jungle turned up at Fentonâs office on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(c) Discussion</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Having considered all the evidence, I find Fenton/Centaline's case more believable.  I consider the Cabirols' testimony to be highlyartificial.  Indeed, I agree with the observation of Fenton's counsel that the Cabirols have tailored their evidence and the casenow put forward by them is the best possible case given the undisputable evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Let me analyze the respective case of Jungle and Fenton/Centaline from the following perspectives:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">a. The agreed venue for execution of the formal tenancy agreement.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">b. The events between 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">c. The events on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">d. The events after 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(c1) The agreed venue for execution of the formal tenancy agreement</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Fu is adamant in court that she had instructed Cheung as early as 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003 that the formal tenancy agreement would be signed at the Property.  Curiously, however, she has failed to mention thisimportant fact in any of her witness statements.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> On the other hand, it is not correct for Jungle/Cabirol's counsel to observe in his closing submission that Cheung has similarlyomitted to mention the fact that the venue for execution of the formal tenancy agreement had been agreed on 1<sup>st</sup> August 2003 in her witness statements.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Cheung was cross-examined by Fenton's counsel on this very issue and she referred to paragraphs 12-15 of her witness statement [Bundle2, pp.96-97] to refute any suggestion of recent fabrication.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Jungle/Cabirolâs counsel has also gone into considerable lengths in his closing submission to challenge the underlying reason(s)for Fenton to elect Fentonâs office as the venue for signing the formal tenancy agreement. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> There may be many reasons for Ward and R-Kusters respectively to want to sign the formal tenancy agreement at Fenton's office.  Someof these reasons may be common to them.  I do not find a microscopic scrutiny of each of these reasons helpful.  The fact that noone from Fenton attended the two inspections of the Property by the Cabirols and the fact that Ward executed PTA as well as the amendmentsthereto at Fenton's office go some way, in my view, to confirm Fenton's election (for whatever reason(s)) to execute the formal tenancyagreement at Fenton's office. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> What's more, Ward was about 84 years old at the time of the transaction.  As R-Kusters was away in Ningbo at the time, Ward was apparentlythe only director of Fenton in Hong Kong to execute the formal tenancy agreement for and on behalf of Fenton [Bundle 3, p.279]. It would be quite reasonable for her to want to sign at her own residence.  This is all the more so as Fenton was served by its agentCentaline and all the necessities of completion could be attended to by Centaline.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> It has also been submitted on behalf of Jungle that Fentonâs office would be an unusual venue for completion when no arrangementwas made for the Cabirols to check the Property, to test the keys and to verify the utilities meter readings before signing the formaltenancy agreement. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> In my view, the absence of any arrangement for the Cabirols to finally inspect the Property must be viewed in its proper context. It is Fenton/Centalineâs case that Jungle had refused to sign the formal tenancy agreement.  Had Jungle elected to proceed withthe transaction and requested for a final inspection, it could easily have been arranged and done through Centaline.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(c2) The events between 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> According to the Cabirols, nothing eventful happened after the second inspection of the Property on 2<sup>nd</sup> August 2003.  The parties had agreed on the improvements to be done on the Property.  The Cabirols were happily shopping for lightingsand furniture for their new home.  On 4<sup>th</sup> August 2003, Cheung further reminded Fu by telephone of the appointment to sign the formal tenancy agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> According to Cheung, Ward, A-Kusters and R-Kusters, however, there had been frantic exchange of telephone calls between the partiesbetween 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003 prompted by Fu's requests for deferment of the commencement of the tenancy and subsequent refusal to sign the formaltenancy agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The record of calls logged by Cheungâs mobile phone, which is summarized below with part of the telephone number obliterated topreserve privacy, is more consistent with

telephone calls between 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003 cannot be explained by the simple case put forward by Jungle, even if one takes into account Cheungâs call to Fu (andpossibly to Fenton) to confirm the appointment to sign the formal tenancy agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Jungle/Cabirol's counsel has submitted that Cheungâs detailed recollection of the calls is implausible and self-serving.

Jungle/Cabirolâs counsel has apparently accepted, no doubt with the Cabirols in mind,that given the length of time which has elapsed since the relevant events it is entirely understandable for any witness to have difficultyrecollecting with precision the details of the calls.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> It must also be noted that Cheung has in fact made a statement to the Small Claims Tribunal sometime in January 2004 detailing thecalls [Bundle 3, pp.220-223].  This was apparently done when the conversations were still fresh in her mind.  Given this earlierstatement, it is not surprising that Cheung is able to recall the calls at trial but not other details.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(c3) The events on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> First, it is the Cabirols' testimony in court that they had waited outside the Property from about 5 pm to 6:30 pm on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003 (i.e. some 1Â½ hours).  This is to be contrasted with the contents of his earlier written statements. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> In his statement to the police dated 13<sup>th</sup> August 2003 (i.e. just 1 week after the incident) [Bundle 3, p.353], Cabirol stated that the couple had waited from 1700 to 1930hours (i.e. some 2Â½ hours).  In another statement prepared for the Small Claims Tribunal, Cabirol stated that they had waited from5 pm for more than 2 hours [Bundle 3, p.231]. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> Cabirol recognizes the discrepancies under cross-examination.He attributes such discrepancies to typographical errors.

As to the other 2 calls at 1904 and 1933 hours, the Cabirols say theyhad already reached home by then.  Fu was then recharging her mobile phone and, hence, was able to make those calls with her mobilephone.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Had the Cabirols maintained their original time estimates of 2 or even 2Â½ hours from 5 pm, they would have to explain not just 3calls but 5 calls.  This may turn out to be problematic as the last 2 calls lastedalmost half of the total airtime of 4 minutes. Moreover, the Cabirols say it took them about 20 minutes to reach home from the Property on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003.  Hence, it is not open to them to claim that they had left earlier in view of the time of calls logged.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> The Cabirols only âcorrectedâ their initial time estimate in their respective witness statements dated 7<sup>th</sup> October 2004  [Bundle 3, pp.108 and 119].  That was more than 1 year after the incident.  By then, the detail call list of Fuâsmobile phone was available to them.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> Secondly, it is Jungle's case that Cabirol was also waiting outside the Property with Fu.  Cabirol has admitted in court that hehad his own mobile phone with him at all times when the couple was waiting outside the Property.  Why did the couple not use Cabirolâsmobile phone to call Cheung?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> The explanations offered by the Cabirols for not using Cabirolâs mobile phone are not entirely consistent.  On the one hand, Cabirolclaims he was then waiting for important overseas business calls and so he did not allow his wife to use his phone.  On the otherhand, Fu claims that her husband was wearing a long face during the wait and she dared not ask for the use of his phone.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Thirdly, it is common ground that there was in fact a telephone available at the security guard post at the entrance of the Property. Why did the Cabirols not use that phone but instead walked up to Wellcome Supermarket to use the public telephone there? </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Cabirol explains that the security guard was asleep at the time and he did not want to disturb him.  Given the couple's testimonythat they had at least waited 1Â½ hours, I find it rather unlikely that the security guard on duty there would have slept throughthe whole period of time. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> I have carefully observed the demeanor of Fu when she testifies in court.  She has impressed me to be a lady with strong character. She does not appear to me to be someone who would allow herself and her husband to wait for 1Â½ hours in the August heat and walkup and down the slope to use a public phone when there was one right under their nose at the security guard post. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Fourthly, the Cabirols have not been consistent regarding the frequency of their visits to Wellcome Supermarket on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003.  Cabirol says the couple had gone there 2 to 3 times, while it is 6 to 8 times by Fuâs count!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> Fifthly, the fact that the couple went repeatedly to Wellcome Supermarket to use the public phone is, in my view, a material fact. It is rather unlikely that the Cabirols would have omitted to mention it when they recount the frustrating events that happenedon 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003.  Be that as it may, this was never mentioned in any of their statements made prior to their respective witness statementdated 7<sup>th</sup> October 2004. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> Cabirol did not mention this material fact in his police statement [Bundle 3, p.353] and his three statements to the Small ClaimsTribunal [Bundle 3, pp.231-235; pp.251-259; and 274].  Fu has similarly omitted to mention it in her three statements to the tribunal[Bundle 3, pp.236-238; 263-268; and 275].  This is so notwithstanding the fact that Cheung has put the telephone conversations inissue during the proceedings in the tribunal [Bundle 3, pp.220-228].</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> Their witness statements dated 7<sup>th</sup> October 2004 were apparently prepared after the detail call lists of Fuâs mobile phone have become available.

In my view, the fact that the same call time (i.e. 1812 hours) and the same duration of call(i.e. 1.7 minutes) is logged in the records of both phones is very persuasive evidence that there was in fact such a call and ofsuch a duration.  Indeed, both Cabirol and Fu dare not deny such a call under cross-examination.  They merely put up the excuse thatthe call was not received properly (due to low battery) and Fu had to repeatedly say âweiâ and asked who it was calling.  Inmy view, it is rather unlikely that anyone would have done that for 1.7 minutes in those circumstances!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Seventhly, it is Fu's testimony that she had left messages at Cheungâs voicemail asking Cheung to call back.  What was the purposeof asking Cheung to call her back when she knew her mobile phone was low in battery to the extent that she could not receive anycall properly?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> Eighthly, Fenton's office was merely 10 minutes away from the Property by car.  The Cabirols have gone there before on 2<sup>nd</sup> August 2003 when Ms. Leona Wong took PTA there to be amended.  It is only reasonable to assume that the Cabirols had PTA with themwhen they attended the Property to sign the formal tenancy agreement.  After all, the terms of formal tenancy agreement would haveto be subject to the terms of PTA (see clause 2 of PTA) and no draft formal tenancy agreement had been supplied to the Cabirols beforehand. Fentonâs address is clearly stated on PTA [Bundle 3, p.294].  The fact that the Cabirols had chosen to wait in the heat for atleast 1Â½ hourswithoutattempting to contact Fenton is unconvincing.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> On the other hand, I find it reasonable for Ward (and A-Kusters) to wait at Fenton's office on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003 notwithstanding Jungleâs stance not to sign the formal tenancy agreement.  After all, it had been agreed under PTAthat a formal tenancy agreement would be signed on that day.  It was open to Fenton as a matter of law to refuse to accept Jungleâsanticipatory breach and continued to press for performance (see Chitty on Contracts, 29<sup>th</sup> edition (2004), para.24-021).  Moreover, given the fact that Jungle had been willing to compromise in terms of the improvements tothe Property, there was always the possibility that the Cabirols would change their mind.  It was also reasonable for R-Kusters tostandby at his office in Ningbo just in case anything concerning the transaction came up.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(c4) The events after 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> I also find Jungle's case concerning what happened after 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003 to be suspicious.  According to Fu, she tried to contact Cheung by calling Centaline's number on 7<sup>th</sup> August 2003.  A male staff of Centaline answered the call and muttered slander to her and accused the Cabirols of failing to executethe formal tenancy agreement in respect of the Property. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> Thereafter, the Cabirols located another property on the same street as the Property through another estate agent.  Cabirol enteredinto a provisional tenancy agreement in respect of this other property on 11<sup>th</sup> August 2003 and a tenancy agreement [Bundle 3, pp.363-368] was executed by Jungle as tenant on 11<sup>th</sup> September 2003.  This tenancy commenced on 28<sup>th</sup> September 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> Fu conducted searches against Fenton at the business registration office of the Inland Revenue Department, the Companies Registryand the Land Registry.  On 11<sup>th</sup> August 2003, Jungle filed its claim in the Small Claims Tribunal under SCTC 77352/2003 initially against Fenton only.  The Cabirolsalso reported the matter to the police on 13<sup>th</sup> August 2003.  On 23<sup>rd</sup> September 2003, Jungle joined Centaline into SCTC 77352/2003 as a defendant.  Eventually, SCTC 77352/2003 was transferred to theDistrict Court and became DCCJ 1099/2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> The Cabirols say there was no communication between them and Fenton or Cheung between 7<sup>th</sup> August 2003 (after Fuâs alleged call to Centaline) and 13<sup>th</sup> August 2003 (when they reported the matter to the police).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> The allegation of the Cabirols that there was no communication between them and Cheung is contradicted by the following call recordsin Cheung's mobile phone detail call list [Bundle 3, pp.348-349]:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="1" width="80%">            <tr>                <td width="15%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:center"><span>Call Date</span></p>                </td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:center"><span>Time</span></p>                </td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:center"><span>Call Information</span></p>                </td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:center"><span>Minute(s) Used</span></p>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="15%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:center"><span>9/8/03</span></p>                </td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:center"><span>1053</span></p>                </td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:center"><span>9483XXXX</span></p>                </td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:center"><span>3.3</span></p>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="15%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:center"><span>9/8/03</span></p>                </td>                <td width="15%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:center"><span>1516</span></p>                </td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:center"><span>9483XXXX</span></p>                </td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:center"><span>0.3</span></p>                </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> According to Cheung, Fu arranged with her over the phone in the morning of 9<sup>th</sup> August 2003 to view other premises and an appointment was made for flat viewing at 3 pm on that day.  The Cabirols were late forthe appointment and so Cheung called Fu again at 1516 hours.  Cheung brought up the issue of Centalineâs commission in respectof the failed leasing transaction regarding the Property with Fu after flat viewing.  Fu became agitated and accused Fenton of failingto turn up at the Property on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> Cheung's testimony is consistent with the call records.  The fact of an appointment for flat viewing is also evidenced by an entryin the logbook kept by Centaline [Bundle 3, p.248 or Exhibit B] and Cheungâs own handwritten record [Bundle 3, p.285]. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> Indeed, if Cheung had deliberately failed to turn up at the Property for completion, why did she call Fu on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003 and 9<sup>th</sup> August 2003?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> In any event, I consider the Cabirols' testimony that they had not contacted Cheung or Fenton unconvincing.  The Cabirols say theyhad been eager to find a new home closer to where their daughters would be attending school and the Property suited their requirements. They had already signed PTA and paid $27,000 deposit for the leasing of the Property.  They, according to Jungle's case, attendedthe Property on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003 with a view to complete the transaction but no one from Fenton or Centaline turned up.  Given the fact that they shouldstill be eager to complete the transaction, it would have been reasonable for them to contact Cheung to find out why Cheung and Fentondid not turn up.  There was nothing for them to rule out the possibility of some misunderstanding between Jungle and Fenton and/orCentaline. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> However, the Cabirols did not bother to call Cheung after the couple had reached home on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003 and had access to functioning telephones to ascertain why she (and Fenton) did not turn up at the Property earlier. They allegedly waited until the next day and only to call Centaline.  The alleged conversation with someone from Centaline on 7<sup>th</sup> August 2003 must have further underlined the need to clarify with Cheung.  After all, Cheung had beena trusted agent according toCabirol.  Yet, there is simply no attempt to contact Cheung to find out what hasgone wrong.  This is, in my view, not consistentwith their case that they were very eager to complete the deal for the sake of their daughtersâ schooling.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> Fu has emphasized in her testimony how she found out through searches at the Inland Revenue Department, the Companies Registry, theLand Registry that Fenton is not a company registered in Hong Kong.  This, according to her, has confirmed the existence of a plotto defraud Jungle.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> The Cabirols appeared to harbour no doubt that Fenton and Centaline were in the wrong and there was a conspiracy between them againstJungle.  They simply assumed the deal was off and did not clarify further with Cheung or Fenton.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> Yet, when Jungle filed its claim in the Small Claims Tribunal on 11<sup>th</sup> August 2003, only Fenton was sued [Bundle 3, pp.180-182].  This was so notwithstanding the fact that the Cabirols were apparentlybeing chased by Centaline for commission [Bundle 3, p.353].  The Cabirols only applied to join Centaline as a defendant on 23<sup>rd</sup> September 2003.  This was apparently after Centalineâs ultimatum to Jungle dated 28<sup>th</sup> August 2003 demanding for payment of commission under clause 12 of PTA within 7 days failing which legal proceedings would be instituted[Bundle 3, p.356].</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(d) Conclusion</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> Jungle's case is essentially premised upon a conspiracy between Fenton and Centaline to defraud Jungle (although Jungle/Cabirolâscounsel has tried to play down this aspect in his closing submission).  However, there is simply no evidence of any other offer availableto Fenton (let alone a better offer) on or before 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003, so as to provide an incentive to Fenton not to complete the leasing transaction with Jungle.  The testimony of Wardand Mr. Paul P.C. Fok (an estate agent from Hong Kong Property Services (Agency) Limited) that Fenton had withdrawn the Propertyfrom the market after executing PTA shows quite the opposite.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> The fact that Fenton had offered the Property for sale for quite some long time prior to August 2003 but without success suggeststhat Fenton should also be eager to complete the leasing transaction with Jungle.  This is confirmed by the fact that Ward and A-Kusterschose to wait at Fentonâs office on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003 (and R-Kusters at his office in Ningbo) for completion.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> The evidence concerning the subsequent sale of the Property by Fenton shows that the transaction only came about after the leasingtransaction between Jungle and Fenton had fallen through.  According to Mr. Leon Chu (an estate agent from Ricacorp Properties Limited),he only introduced the Property to the subsequent buyer in the morning of 30<sup>th</sup> August 2003.  The provisional agreement for sale and purchase of the Property was signed on 17<sup>th</sup> September 2003 [Bundle 3, pp.371-371], which was followed by the formal agreement dated 8<sup>th</sup> October 2003 [Bundle 3, pp.373-393].  There is nothing to suggest that this subsequent sale was already in the horizon on or before6<sup>th</sup> August 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> Fenton has been criticized for not disclosing the fact of the subsequent sale earlier during the proceedings in the Small ClaimsTribunal.  I agree with Fentonâs counsel that it was not strictly necessary for Fenton to disclose what has actually become ofthe Property, at least not until it has become an issue.  First, Jungle was not claiming for specific performance in the Small ClaimsTribunal.  Secondly, Fenton was entitled to dispose of the Property under clause 9 of PTA after the leasing transaction with Junglehad fallen through.  In the premises, Fenton cannot be criticized for not volunteering such information in the first place.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> Centaline would have earned a commission in the total sum of $27,000 under clause 11 of PTA if the leasing transaction between Jungleand Fenton had completed.  According to Cheung, she would have personally received $13,500.  This was the incentive for Cheung andCentaline to want to complete the transaction.  Cheung and Mr. Leon Chu (the estate agent acting for Fenton in the subsequent saleof the Property) have been thoroughly cross-examined as to whether Cheung and Centaline have received âback commissionâ in thesubsequent sale.  There is simply no evidence of Centaline and/or Cheung benefiting from that subsequent sale.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> Parties have also spent a lot of effort arguing whether the circumstantial evidence in this case is consistent with <i>fung shui</i> being the underlying reason for the Cabirols to back out from the transaction.  In my view, this is a complete red herring.  Theabsence of any prior reference to <i>fung shui</i>by the Cabirols in the transaction does not exclude the possibility of it being the underlying reason for them not to complete.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> For the above reasons, I find Fenton/Centalineâs case on the failure to complete the leasing transaction more believable.  I acceptthe testimony of Ward, A-Kusters, R-Kusters and Cheung and find that the agreed venue for execution of the formal tenancy agreementwas Fentonâs office.  Jungle did propose deferments of the commencement of the tenancy and, after such proposals had been rejectedby Fenton, indicated that Jungle would not be signing the formal tenancy agreement after all.  The Cabirols did not turn up at Fentonâsoffice on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003 to sign the formal tenancy agreement and Jungle was therefore was in breach of PTA.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Whether Centaline failed in its duties as</u> <u>Jungle's estate agent in the transaction?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> Jungleâs claim against Centaline for breach of estate agentâs duties is pleaded in paragraph 16 of the Re-Amended Statement ofClaim as follows [Bundle 1, p.17]:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><span>â</span></p>                </td>                <td width="75%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><span>Further, wrongfully and in breach of its duty, [Centaline] had failed to take all reasonable or proper steps to ensure the transactionwas successfully completed or to exercise all due diligence in that regard.</span></p>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" align="left"></td>                <td width="75%" valign="top" align="left"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" align="left"></td>                <td width="75%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:center" class="quote"><u><span>Particulars of Breach of Duty</span></u></p>                </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" align="left"></td>                <td width="75%" valign="top" align="left"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" align="left"></td>                <td width="75%" valign="top" align="left">                    <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><span>After [Fenton] and [Centaline] had failed to turned up at the [Property] to sign the formal tenancy agreement, [Jungle] tried to contact[Cheung] of [Centaline] on various occasions but without success.

Quite to the contrary, the detail call list of Cheung' mobile phone evidences telephone conversations on 9<sup>th</sup> August 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> In any event, given my above finding that it isthe Cabirols who failed to turn up at Fentonâs office on 6<sup>th</sup> August 2003 to sign the formal tenancy agreement, there is no question of Centaline failing to take all reasonable or proper stepsto ensure the transaction was successfully completed or to exercise all due diligence in that regard.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> I am not satisfied that Centaline has failed in its duties as estate agent of Jungle in the transaction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Whether Cabirol is liable to Centaline under EAA or PTA</u> <u>in the circumstances of this case?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  I shall now turn to the main issue in DCCJ 1100/2004, namely, whether Cabirol is liable to Centaline under EAA or PTA in the circumstancesof this case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(a) Admissibility of extrinsic evidence</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> In his opening, Jungle/Cabirolâs counsel identifies one of the primary issues to be whether Cabirol signed EAA in his own capacityand therefore should be held personally liable thereon.  He opens his case to the effect that there was an understanding betweenthe parties to EAA (i.e. Cabirol and Centaline) that Cabirol was signing as the appointed agent of Jungle.  He submits that to theextent necessary the Court is entitled in its discretion to admit extrinsic evidence which demonstrates that Cabirol did enter intoEAA as the disclosed agent of Jungle. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> The extrinsic evidence sought to be adduced is pleaded in paragraph 2(ii) of Cabirolâs Amended Defence in DCCJ 1100/2004 [Bundle4, p.8] as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âBefore the signing of [EAA], [Cabirol] had made known to [Centaline] that Jungle was to be the intended tenant of the [Property]to be rented.

She relies onthe following passage from <i>Shogun Finance v.

Jungleâs name is not mentioned anywherein the agreement.  There is no indication from the face of EAA that Cabirol was signing as an agent for anyone.  The space for âBusinessRegistration Certificate number of the Tenantâ and âPosition of the Signatoryâ in the signature section have been left blank.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> Under clause 1, it was Cabirol who appointed Centaline as his agent in respect of the intended leasing transaction.

Having personally constituted the definition of âTenantâ under clause 1, Cabirol has assumedpersonal liability to pay the commission under EAA.

He prays in aid Chitty on Contracts, 29<sup>th</sup> edition (2004), Vol.1, para.12-114, <i>Young v.

Seea similar statement of law at Article 78(3) of Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency, 17<sup>th</sup> edition (2001).  This is not the issue under discussion here.  Neither Jungle nor Centaline is claiming against each other on thebasis of EAA.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> The cases of <i>Young v.

They do not, in my view, advance Cabirolâs cause any further.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> Jungle/Cabirolâs counsel further submits, on the authority of <i>Danziger v.

Thompson</i> is another example of application of the aforementioned legal proposition.  The plaintiff in that case resorted to extrinsic evidencein order to charge the principal (i.e. RJ Thompson) on the tenancy agreement which was entered into in the name of the agent (i.e.Dulcie Thompson).  The issue before Lawrence J was whether such evidence would contradict the description of Dulcie Thompson in thetenancy agreement as the âtenantâ of the premises.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> I have already set out above why I consider it clear from the terms of EAA that Cabirol has contracted personally.  The fact thatCabirol (who has personally constituted the definition of âTenantâ in EAA) may be acting as agent for Jungle does not mean thathe is not liable for his own engagements.  We have gone full circle and back at where we started, namely, the observation of LordScarman in <strong><i>Yeung Kai Yung v Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation</i></strong> <strong>quoted above.</strong></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> For the above reasons, I find it clear from the terms of EAA made by Cabirol that he contracted personally.  Extrinsic evidence istherefore not admissible to show that, notwithstanding the terms of the EAA, it was the intention of Cabirol and Centaline that Cabirolshould not be personally liable on it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(b) In any event, Cabirol's case</u> <u>is not prefer</u><u>red</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> Even if I am wrong and should have allowed such extrinsic evidence to be adduced, I would not have believed it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(b1) Cabirol's case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> It is the Cabirols' testimony that the first inspection of the Property was in mid-July 2003.  EAA and PTA were both signed at Jungleâsoffice in the evening of 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003.  When Cabirol was cross-examined by Centalineâs counsel, he says that he had told Cheung he would be signing in thename of Jungle.  He did not realize that Cheung had prepared EAA in his own name and he simply signed it as he trusted Cheung.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(b2) Centaline's case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> It is Centaline's case that EAA and PTA were signed on different occasions.  According to Cheung, EAA was signed after the Cabirolsinspected the Property on 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003 and PTA was signed later in the evening at Jungle's office. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> After the inspection on 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003, Fu told Cheung that Cabirol would be the one to sign EAA.  Cheung then requested for Cabirol's identity card to fill inEAA.  Cheung then explained the contents of EAA to the couple before Cabirol executed the same.  She denies that she had been toldat the time of EAA that Cabirol was a director of Jungle and that Jungle would be the intended tenant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(b3) Discussion</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> To start with, Cabirol's testimony in court is not consistent with his witness statement.  He stated in his witness statement thathe told Cheung before signing EAA that he was a director of Jungle and had been authorized to appoint Centaline as the estate agentof Jungle to rent a property in Hong Kong and it was Cheung who told him to sign EAA in his own name.  He simply signed it in thebelief that he was signing for and on behalf of Jungle [Bundle 2, p.104].</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> Cabirol is an experienced businessman and he admits under cross-examination that he appreciates the difference between signing forand on behalf of a principal (thus binding the principal on the contract) and signing in his own capacity (thus incurring personalliability thereon).  His testimony that he failed to notice when he signed EAA that he was not in fact signing for and on behalfof Jungle is simply incredible.  That should have been quite obvious to him given the fact that Cheung expressly executed EAA forand on behalf of Centaline [Bundle 3, p.299] and he himself executed PTA as Jungle's agent with Jungle's chop on the same occasion[Bundle 3, p.295]! </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> When he was cross-examined on this, he said he simply trusted Cheung.  Jungle is unable to put forward any advantage to be gainedby Cheung, Centaline or Jungle for Cheung to want Cabirol to sign EAA in his personal capacity when he was executing PTA for andon behalf of Jungle.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> Fu was also present when Cabirol executed EAA and PTA.  Fu has apparently betrayed the truth when she was first asked by Jungle/Cabirol'scounsel during examination-in-chief about this matter.  Fu initially confirmed that Cabirol was signing for himself.  She even wenton to explain that Cabirol must have signed for himself because his own identity card number was put in EAA but not Jungleâs chop. On realizing that her answer was inconsistent with Cabirolâs case in DCCJ 1100/2004, she retracts and maintains that Cabirol shouldbe signing for Jungle as he is a director and shareholder of the company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> Turning to Centaline's case, Cheung says EAA was signed after the Cabirols inspected the Property on 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003.  The fact that the inspection was carried out on 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003 (as opposed to mid-July 2003 as alleged by the Cabirols) is confirmed by:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">a. Cabirol's own signature confirming in Schedule 1 of EAA [Bundle 3, p.297] that the date of inspection was 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">b. Wardâs testimony that Cheung had borrowed the keys to the Property on 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003 for viewing by prospective tenant.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a> Cheung has apparently mistaken the approximate time of inspection on 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003 in her statement to the police [Bundle 5, pp.102] and her statement to the Small Claims Tribunal [Bundle 3, p.217].  Shethen stated that the inspection was in the morning or at about 11:15 am.  This has prompted Cabirol to produce the email messageshe sent out in the morning of 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003 [Bundle 5, pp.147-173] to confirm that he was at his desk in the office for the whole morning. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> Cheung has since realized that the time references in her previous statements are incorrect.  She has recounted in court how shehas come to discover that the actual time of inspection should be sometime after noon by referring to the logbook kept by Centaline[Bundle 3, p.248a or Exhibit B] which was only available to her recently.  I accept her explanation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> Cheung has also clarified in court that what she really meant in her police statement [Bundle 5, p.102] was that the Cabirols hadnot signed any provisional tenancy agreement (as opposed to any document) after the inspection.  This explanation is consistent withwhat she later states in paragraph 2 of her statement for the Small Claims Tribunal [Bundle 3, p.217].  This ambiguity in the wayCheung expressed herself has not caused me to doubt Cheung's testimony.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> Jungle/Cabirol's counsel has submitted that it is unbelievable that Cheung was unaware at the time of EAA that Cabirol was the agentfor Jungle.  However, it is not Cabirol's testimony that he handed over his name card to Cheung upon their first meeting as is contended. Moreover, Ward has clarified in court that she is not certain whether she had been informed by Cheung before PTA that the intendedtenant is Jungle (as opposed to a family).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(b4) Conclusion</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> For the above reasons, I consider Cheung's testimony more believable.  I find that EAA was signed by Cabirol sometime after noonon 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003 after the inspection of the Property and PTA was signed by Cabirol later in the evening at Jungle's office.  No one toldCheung prior to Cabirol executing EAA that Cabirol was a director of Jungle and that Jungle was the intended tenant of the Property.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(c) Cabirol's liability</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> Cabirol signed PTA âfor and on behalf ofâ Jungle.  The legal position of Cabirol vis-Ã -vis PTA is clear.  âIn the absenceof other indications, when an agent makes a contract, purporting to act solely on behalf of a disclosed principal, whether namedor unnamed, he is not liable to the third party on it.  Nor can he sue the third party on it.â (at Article 99 of Bowstead and Reynoldson Agency, 17<sup>th</sup> edition (2001))</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a> There is nothing in the terms of PTA to indicate that Cabirol intended to bind himself.  Cabirol is therefore not personally liableon PTA.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> It is common ground that Jungle was in fact the principal of Cabirol in the leasing transaction.  I have already found that it hadnot been made known to Cheung at the time of EAA that Cabirol was acting as an agent for Jungle.  As such, Jungle may be regardedas Cabirolâs undisclosed principal at the time of EAA.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> Under clause 5 in Schedule 3 to EAA, Cabirol is to pay commission to Centaline if, <i>inter alia</i>, his undisclosed principal enters into a binding lease with the landlord. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> I do not accept Jungle/Cabirol's counsel's submission that PTA is in the nature of an agreement to enter into a lease but not a bindinglease.  To start with, the submission is not consistent with paragraph 8 of Cabirol's Amended Defence in DCCJ 1100/2004 [Bundle 4,p.9].  In any event, clause 1 of PTA specifically provides that Fenton shall let and Jungle shall take the tenancy of the Propertycommencing from 1<sup>st</sup> September 2003.  The formal tenancy agreement to be executed is subject to the terms of PTA (see clause 2 of PTA) and all essentialterms of a valid lease hadalready been agreed upon in PTA.  The then obligation on Jungle and Fenton was to sign a formal tenancyagreement to implement the lease for which agreement had already been reached in terms of EAA.  This is further confirmed by clauses9 and 10 of PTA, which provide for the situation when one if them fail to complete the transaction in accordance with their agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> I therefore hold that PTA is a binding lease and Cabirol is liable to Centaline in the sum of $13,500 (being half a month's rent)under clause 5 in Schedule 3 of EAA.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> I agree with Jungle/Cabirol's counsel that the obligation to remunerate Centaline provided in the express terms of EAA should notbe further widened by imposing an implied duty to not deprive Centaline of the opportunity to earn commission under a wider set ofcircumstances. I do not see why the implied term suggested by Centaline needs to be read into EAA.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Conclusion</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a> There are other minor points taken by Jungle/Cabirol's counsel.  Suffice it for me to say that I have considered them all in reachingmy conclusion. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> For the above reasons:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">a. Jungle's claim in DCCJ 1099/2003 against Fenton is dismissed.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">b.
