The export of foodstuffs was vested in the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and ExportCorporation (ä¸­åç³§æ²¹é£ååºå£ç¸½å¬å¸) ("CNC"). CNC set up branches in the provinces which handled the import and exportof foodstuffs of the provinces. In May 1954 GDF was formed as a state corporation under the name "Chinese Foodstuffs Export CorporationGuangzhou Branch Corporation" (ä¸­åé£ååºå£å¬å¸å»£å·åå¬å¸). The name had changed many times since 1954. In 1979, itwas re-named "China Cereals Oils Foods Import Export Head Corporation Guangdong Province Foods Branch Corporation" (ä¸­åç³§æ²¹é£åé²åºå£ç¸½å¬å¸å»£æ±çé£ååå¬å¸).In 1990, it was re-named "Guangdong Province Foods Import Export Corporation" (å»£æ±çé£åé²åºå£å¬å¸). Its current namewas adopted in March 1993. At some stage, the original provincial company was divided into two, namely GDF and Guangdong Cerealsand Oils Import &amp; Export Corporation ("GCO") (å»£æ±çç³§æ²¹é²å£å¬å¸). As its name shows, GCO is engaged in the cereal andoil products. GDF and GCO were engaged in a series of mergers and separation before their eventual separation.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p13" name="p13">13.</a> GDF commenced export business immediately upon its formation. It also began to organize the establishment of sub-branch companies(æ¯å¬å¸). One of these companies was Foshan Foods. Its former name was China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import andExport Corporation Kwangtung Branch Fatsan District Office (ä¸­åç²®æ²¹é£åé²åºå£å¬å¸å»£æ±çé£ååå¬å¸ä½å±±å°åæ¯å¬å¸).Its present name of Foshan Foods Import &amp; Export Company of Guangdong (å»£æ±çä½å±±é£åé²åºå£å¬å¸) was adopted in 1988.Not all sub-branch companies would be engaged in the export trade. Those engaged in the export trade were known as coastal companies(å£å²¸æ¯å¬å¸). Foshan Foods was a coastal company.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Relationship between CNC and GDF</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p14" name="p14">14.</a> Under the planned economy, GDF had to comply with the export plans prepared by CNC. This means that GDF had to earn the requiredlevel of foreign currency from the export trade and the earning had to be remitted to CNC. CNC would in turn provide the resources,both in terms of finance and raw material, to enable GDF to fulfill the target. The Mainland introduced the open door policy on economicmatters in the 1980s. However, the lifting of export control of foodstuffs only came about in 1993. Before 1993, export of foodstuffswas tightly controlled by the state. One reason was that the export of foodstuff was a loss-making business.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) Changes in 1988</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p15" name="p15">15.</a> In 1988, there was a severance of relationship between GDF and CNC. The financial control by CNC on provincial companies such asGDF was severed. Instead, the provincial companies, such as GDF would be responsible to the provincial authorities the financialtarget they had to meet. The system was known as the "contract system" ("æ¿åå¶åº¦"). The local authority in this regard was theProvincial Foreign Trade Bureau which in turn was responsible to the Ministry of Foreign Economy Relationship and Trade ("MOFERT")in Beijing. This system lasted from 1988, 1989 and 1990.</p>    <p class="heading">(4) Changes in 1991</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p16" name="p16">16.</a> In 1991, there was a further change in that the provincial companies had to be self-sufficient in four respects :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) management of their organization;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) profit and loss in their trading;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) control of their organization; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) development of their business.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Whereas under the "contract system" ("æ¿åå¶åº¦"), the provincial authority would still reimburse the provincial company deficitin the business operation, this was cancelled in 1991.</p>    <p class="heading">Export of rice wine : GDF's case</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p17" name="p17">17.</a> I will set out GDF's case on the export of rice wine and the roles played by it, Foshan Foods and Shiwan Brewery. During the exportcontrol period, GDF was the only company which could export the rice wine and decide on :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) the kinds of rice wine, the quantity and the overseas markets they were to be exported;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b) which person or company was to be engaged as distributor for a particular product in a given market;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c) the supply and price of product;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d) which of GDF's trade marks was to be used;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(e) which sub-branch companies should be appointed as the coastal company to carry out supply and shipment under sales contracts signedwith overseas distributors; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(f) which factory should be appointed to make the products.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Furthermore, during this period, GDF had the sole power to :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) introduce a new product in any market;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b) terminate an existing product in any market;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c) terminate a particular overseas distributor;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d) terminate the assignment of a coastal company; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(e) terminate appointment of a factory as a maker of its product.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(1) Signing of sales contracts</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p18" name="p18">18.</a> Sales contracts with overseas buyers were signed by GDF in the two bi-annual Trade Fairs held in Guangzhou every Spring (15th Aprilto 15th May) and Autumn (15th October to 15th November). The duration of the contract signed at each Trade Fair was six months. Priorto the Fair, GDF would decide which customer it would sign the contract with, the type of goods and the quantity involved. Contractswould be signed by representatives designated by GDF.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Execution of sales contracts</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p19" name="p19">19.</a> GDF carried out the sales contracts by assigning the supply and shipment of its products to one or more of the coastal companies.These coastal company would establish direct contact with the factory appointed on matters such as costs and quality control. Thecoastal company would arrange for shipment and custom clearance of the goods to be shipped to the distributors who had signed thesales contract with GDF. The distributors would issue documentary credit in favour of the coastal company which would issue invoicesfor the goods and present shipping and commercial documents for negotiation of the documentary credit. The coastal company wouldreceive the credit proceeds and pay the factory on invoices issued to the coastal company. The surplus, if any, were held by thecoastal company for GDF. If a loss was made, it would be made good by GDF eventually.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) Relationship of GDF and Foshan Foods</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p20" name="p20">20.</a> Mr Hu Chang Fu, who until 1996 was the General Manager and the representative of GDF, stated that the relationship between GDF andits sub-branch companies was one of parent and sons. In two major areas, GDF and the sub-branch companies were said to be 'pegged'(æå¾), namely, planning and finance. In terms of planning, GDF received the annual plans from CNC. GDF would then seek to accomplishthese plans by co-ordinating its sub-branch companies. They would have to achieve the plans transmitted by GDF. They would have tosubmit to GDF their annual targets of production. GDF would then allocate the resources to the sub-branch companies. In terms offinance, the sub-branch companies had to report to GDF its financial position on a regular basis by monthly, quarterly and yearlyreports. It had to send to GDF profits made in a given year, and where losses were sustained, GDF would make good such losses. Thesub-branch companies could not and had no right to decide on their own finance and expenditures.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p21" name="p21">21.</a> The financial and planning peg was removed in 1993 and 1994 respectively. After 1994, the sub-branch companies were no longer requiredto submit their annual production targets to GDF or comply with the plans of GDF. Further, after 1993 they would no longer be financiallydependent on GDF. The sub-branch companies could carry out business on their own subject to possible control of the local exportauthorities in their district.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p22" name="p22">22.</a> After the severance with its former sub-branch companies, GDF was re-grouped and was later called Guangdong Foodstuffs Import &amp;Export (Group) Corporation. Certain previous departments within GDF were incorporated as companies under GDF's direct control. Howeverlinks with the former sub-branch companies are still maintained. About 40 of them, including Foshan Foods, voluntarily joined GuangdongFoodstuffs Import &amp; Export Enterprise Group ("GDF Enterprise Group"). This group is headed by GDF. According to Mr Hu, this servedas some kind of chamber of commerce for the various former sub-branch companies. GDF would provide co-ordination among the membersof this group and assistance to expand the export market on foodstuff.</p>    <p class="heading">(4) Pearl River Bridge marks</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p23" name="p23">23.</a> Since the late 1950s, the products of GDF were marketed in the overseas countries under one or more of its trade marks. In the caseof rice wine and soy sauce, the name and mark Pearl River Bridge (ç æ±æ©ç) and an oval shaped logo depicting a bridge (the PearlRiver Bridge marks) have been used from the late 1950s to the present in Hong Kong and in other countries. Originally, the bridgedepicted on the logo was that of the Sea Pearl Bridge (æµ·ç æ©) in Guangzhou. In the late 60's it was substituted by the People'sBridge (äººæ°æ©) in Guangzhou.</p>    <p>The new mark :</p>    <table border="1" width="70%">        <tr>            <td width="100%">                <p><u>N.B.</u></p>                <p>New mark of the Sea Pearl Bridge in Guangzhou</p>                <p>Please see word document</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p>The old mark :</p>    <table border="1" width="70%">        <tr>            <td width="100%">                <p><u>N.B.</u></p>                <p>Old mark of the Sea Pearl Bridge in Guangzhou</p>                <p>Please see word document</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p24" name="p24">24.</a> In 1957 CNC was registered in the Mainland as the owner of the Pearl River Bridge trade mark in respect of canned food. From 1979onwards, GDF was registered in the Mainland as the owners of the Pearl River Bridge trade mark of wine, soy sauce and other products.CNC still retains ownership of the trade mark in relation to canned foods. It was decided by CNC to hold the trade mark on cannedfoods for the time being. The reason for retaining the ownership of the trade mark was to take into account changes in the administrativestructure of Hainan Island and Guangzhou City which ceased to be under the administrative control of the Guangdong Province.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p25" name="p25">25.</a> In Hong Kong, CNC was registered as the owner of the Pearl River Bridge trade mark on wine on 3rd November 1970. On 19th November1991, CNC assigned the trade mark and related goodwill in respect of wine, spirits and liquor to GDF (Bundle J/17). The assignmentwas accepted by the Trade Mark Office on 26th May 1996 (Bundle D11/486).</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p26" name="p26">26.</a> CNC was also the owner of the Pearl River Bridge trade mark in 11 foreign countries. In 1990 to 1991 it transferred the ownershipof the trade marks to GDF.</p>    <p class="heading">(5) Production base</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p27" name="p27">27.</a> GDF would provide the sub-branch companies with the necessary finance to build factories for the production of articles destinedfor export purposes. The raw material used in the production would be provided by GDF to the sub-branch companies which in turn wouldprovide the same to the factories. When the sub-branch companies purchased articles from the factories, it would be conducted onthe basis of a purchase and sale with the sub-branch companies paying the factories the price of the goods in RMB.</p>    <p class="heading">(6) Transportation of goods</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p28" name="p28">28.</a> The actual transportation of goods would be carried out by the sub-branch companies. However, GDF would provide trucks and shipsto the sub-branch companies and GDF would also assist the sub-branch companies to build piers. When a sub-branch company was unableto carry out the transportation, GDF would assist it in arranging transportation.</p>    <p class="heading">(7) Quality control</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p29" name="p29">29.</a> Quality control of products was exercised by the sub-branch companies. However, GDF also exercised control by carrying out inspectionof products and sending heads of department or trade representatives to inspect the production together with the representativesof the sub-branch companies. There would be regular meetings between GDF and the sub-branch on matters of production and qualitycontrol. GDF could stop the production export and cancel the right of the sub-branch companies to purchase the goods from the factories.</p>    <p class="heading">(8) Local factories</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p30" name="p30">30.</a> The factories belonged to the local authorities, the relationship between the factories and the sub-branch was simply that of a sellerand buyer.</p>    <p class="heading">History of Shiwan Mijiu (ç³ç£ç±³é)</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Plaintiffs' evidence</p>    <p class="heading">A. Mr Lor Kwok Tsam</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p31" name="p31">31.</a> Mr Lor Kwok Tsam (ç¾åå) was the Deputy Head and later Head of the Processed Foods Department (ç³éç§) of GDF between 1969-1984.He said that in about 1973/1974, there were only a few bottled rice wine in the Hong Kong market, namely, "ä¹æ±éè¸" (Jiu JiangShuang Jin), "éèä¸è¸" (Shun Jiu Shan Jin) and "çå°ç" (Yu Bing Shiao). The sale of these wine was on the decline. Havingconsulted Wu Fung Hong (äºè±è¡), which was GDF's Hong Kong agent, Mr Lor considered that there was room for expansion of the ricewine market in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p32" name="p32">32.</a> With this in mind, at a meeting held at GDF in 1974 by the Processed Foods Department and attended by the staff involved in the winetrade of the sub-branch companies, Mr Lor informed those present that GDF had decided to introduce new rice wine in Hong Kong andinvited their views on the subject. Having listened to the views, it was decided that GDF would introduce four new products intothe Hong Kong market as part of the Pearl River Bridge rice wine range. GDF named these four products as "ä¸­å±±ç±³é" (ZhongshanMijiu), "ç³ç£ç±³é" (Shiwan Mijiu), "ç³å²ç±³é" "(Shiqi Mijiu) and "ç´çéè¸" (Red Label Shuang Jin).

Mr Lor consulted his colleaguesand later decided to terminate all the four new wine and introduce instead a single new rice wine. This decision was later implementedand the new wine was introduced in or about 1977 and was named "å»£æ±ç±³é" (Guangdong Mijiu). Production and export of ZhongshanMijiu, Shiwan Mijiu, Shiqi Mijiu and Red Label Shuang Jin were then terminated.

Mr Chiu Kong</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p40" name="p40">40.</a> DW14 Chiu Kong (è¶å´) ("Mr Chiu") was a vice manager in Foshan Foods. He joined Foshan Foods in 1961 and retired in 1993. He becamethe éåè¡è¡é·in 1975.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p41" name="p41">41.</a> Mr Chiu said that the Shiwan Brewery had asked him to raise at the Guangzhou Trade Fair whether a new wine could be introduced intothe market because the sale of the traditional wine of çå°ç had dropped. At the Trade Fair, Mr Chiu talked to Mr Sik Bei Chung(èåå¿ ) of Wu Fung Hong on this issue. Mr Sik suggested introducing a new wine which might suit the Hong Kong market. Mr Chiuwas happy with the decision. Mr Lor of GDF was also there. He also supported Mr Sik's idea.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p42" name="p42">42.</a> Mr Chiu then informed Mr Chen Bing Hao and others of the Shiwan Brewery of the decision. Mr Chiu told them to prepare the samplesand also design the label of the wine. When the samples were ready, he took the samples to the Trade Fair. The samples were shownto Mr Cheung Shing Hung (also known as Mr Cheung Loy Chun) of Chung Tai which later became the distributor of Shiwan Mijiu. ChungTai was introduced to Foshan Foods by Wu Fung Hong. Mr Chiu said that the distributor was decided by Wu Fung Hong, neither GDF norFoshan Foods could decide on the distributor.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p43" name="p43">43.</a> Mr Chiu said that a few designs on the label were prepared by Shiwan Brewery, the one that was chosen was the label now being usedon the Shiwan Mijiu. The design he saw was in colour but without the Pearl River Bridge trade mark or the name of the company. Thedesign was also shown to Mr Lor. The samples of wine were taken back to Hong Kong for tasting by representatives of Chung Tai. Theyalso saw the design.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p44" name="p44">44.</a> The first contract for the Shiwan Mijiu was signed in the Autumn Trade Fair of 1975. The contract was signed by Mr Tang Tak Kwan(é§å¾·ç(å¤)) since he was the leader of the wine group (éçµçµé·) at the Trade Fair.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p45" name="p45">45.</a> Mr Chiu denied that he had attended a conference in 1974 in Guangzhou organized by GDF which discussed the new wine to be producedby the coastal companies. Mr Chiu said that at that time ç´çéè¸ had already been produced and there was no point in discussingthis wine. He also said that he did not know of discussions on ä¸­å±±ç±³é and ç³å²ç±³é at that time. He was only aware of thesetwo wine after they were produced.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p46" name="p46">46.</a> Mr Chiu further denied that Mr Lor had asked the sub-branch companies to design the labels for the four new wine and present thelabels for GDF's approval. He said that the labels need not be approved by GDF. He said that there were many products and their labelswere not subject to GDF's approval. The concept of copyright did not exist at that time. Mr Chiu could not recall when was the nameShiwan Mijiu being decided. He said that the label was taken to Foshan Foods and shown to Mr Yau Koon Wah of GDF who was in FoshanFoods at that time. He denied that Mr Yau Koon Wah had supplied him with the Pearl River Bridge standard design which was to be usedon the new label.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p47" name="p47">47.</a> Mr Chiu further said that he took the samples of wine to the 1975 Trade Fair. He also showed to Mr Sik of Wu Fung Hong two identicallabels which were not yet printed. He said that he had taken six to seven bottles of sample to the Trade Fair, but only three tofour bottles were given to Chung Tai. In respect of the name Shiwan Mijiu, he said that the words "ç±³é" (rice wine) were suggestedby Mr Sik. This was to solve the problems with the çå°ç. The word "ç" means meat which was used in the production of the wine.</p>    <p class="heading">B. Mr Chen Bing Hao</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p48" name="p48">48.</a> Mr Chen Bing Hao (é³ç³è±ª) ("Mr Chen") of Shiwan Brewery said that the predecessor of the Shiwan Brewery was é³å¤ªåéå» whichhad a long history of producing quality wine. In 1973, he attended a conference on trade and industry organised by Foshan Foods.Mr Chiu of Foshan Foods suggested in the conference that a new product should be introduced to meet the young market. A few dayslater, representatives from Foshan Foods and Foshan City Food Company (ä½å±±å¸é£ç©å¬å¸) came to the Shiwan Brewery and askedit to produce the new wine. The brewery then started developing the new wine.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p49" name="p49">49.</a> By April/May 1974, a product was selected. In June/July 1974, the Foshan City Light Industry Bureau (ä½å±±å¸è¼å·¥å±) approvedthe new product and it was sent to Foshan Foods. This Bureau controlled the operation of the Shiwan Brewery. When the idea of thenew wine was conceived, the idea was to develop a wine with the local flavour. The Brewery wished to call the new product "ç³ç£ç±³é"(Shiwan Mijiu) because wine-drinkers knew of ç³ç£ (Shiwan). The new product was intended for both export and import purposes.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p50" name="p50">50.</a> In July, Mr Chen instructed the colour printing factory in Foshan City to design the label for the new wine. He told the designerthat the product was intended for both export and internal sale. Hence, the space in the middle part of the label was left blankfor the trade mark to be inserted. Afterwards a number of designs were produced by the designer. By February/March 1975, the basicdesign was agreed upon. The design was required to be approved by the local Revolutionary Committee to see if the content was politicallyacceptable. The original colour design was lost but the draft at Exhibit D11 was the draft prepared for the purpose of preparationof colour scheme. Mr Chiu of Foshan Foods was shown the design and was happy with it. Mr Chen said in June/July 1975, productionof the Shiwan Mijiu began for export purposes. By 1978, there was internal sale of the wine. He denied that he had knowledge thatfour new wine were introduced in Hong Kong between 1975 to 1978.</p>    <p class="heading">C.

He said that at the beginning of 1975,Mr Chen of Shiwan Brewery took two to three designs of the Shiwan Mijiu label to him. The designs were in colour and were hand-drawn.At that time, there was a soy sauce conference and Mr Wah Chi Yee (è¯æ¢å®) of Wu Fung Hong was also there. Mr Wah was shown thedesign and said that the words ç³ç£ç±³é (Shiwan Mijiu) were outstanding and clear (çªåºï¼ä¸ç®äºç¶). The design did nothave the Pearl River Bridge trade mark or the words "ä¸­è¯äººæ°å±åå" People's Republic of China on the label. There was alsoa neck label as well, these labels are the same as the labels now appearing on the Shiwan Mijiu.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p52" name="p52">52.</a> Mr Chan instructed the printing factory to produce the labels. He told the factory that the products were for export and asked itto produce the labels quickly.

Cancellation of the Shiwan Mijiu</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p53" name="p53">53.</a> Mr Chiu said that during a Trade Fair, a visit was made to the ä¹æ±éå»  by Mr Kwok Kan Kei (é­é¡æºª) of Wu Fung Hong and otherrepresentatives of CNC. During the visit Mr Kwok said that there were too many rice wine in Guangdong and suggested that all ricewine in Guangdong should be called Guangdong Mijiu (å»£æ±ç±³é). Mr Chiu who was also present objected to this proposal but itwas decided that other than éè¸, ä¸è¸ and çå°ç, all rice wine would be called Guangdong Mijiu. Mr Chiu maintained his objectionbecause Guangdong Mijiu was selling at a lower price, whereas Shiwan Mijiu was selling at a higher price. Eventually, the decisionto introduce Guangdong Mijiu was made. Mr Chiu did not know how the decision was made, he said that Wu Fung Hong notified GDF ofthe change and GDF issued notice to change the wine to Guangdong Mijiu. After the change, representations were made to higher authoritiesto revive the Shiwan Mijiu and the wine was revived about a year later. Mr Chiu said that Chung Tai had done a lot of work in thisregard.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p54" name="p54">54.</a> Mr Chen Bing Hao said that in 1978 at a conference organized by Foshan Foods on industry and trade, the Shiwan Brewery learned thatthe export of the Shiwan Mijiu was to be cancelled and instead, the Shiwan Brewery together with other breweries would export a winecalled the Guangdong Mijiu. It objected and had, by letter dated 25th March 1978 and another letter of 8th May 1979, asked the authorityfor the retention of the Shiwan Mijiu. The letters were addressed to the local units and Foshan Foods but not to GDF. The ShiwanMijiu was revived in October 1979, but at the meantime, the Shiwan Brewery continued to sell Shiwan Brand Shiwan Mijiu ("ç³ç£çç³ç£ç±³é")in the Mainland.</p>    <p class="heading">History of Super Mellow Mijiu</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Plaintiffs' evidence</p>    <p class="heading">A. PW2 Mr Chung Hau Yuen (é¾åæº<em>)</em></p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p55" name="p55">55.</a> Chung Hau Yuen joined Tung Fook Liqueur Dealer (åç¦éè¡) ("Tung Fook") in 1971 at the insistence of his father, Mr Chung Cheong(é¾æ), who was its sole proprietor. He worked in Tung Fook until 1981 which was shortly after his father passed away. Initially,Tung Fook did not have any sole distribution right of rice wine. It co-operated with Luk Hop Company (å­åå¬å¸) ("Luk Hop") whichwas one of the Chinese wine distributors.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p56" name="p56">56.</a> From 1977/1978 onwards, Chung Hau Yuen was asked by his father to take a more active role in the management of the business. ChungHau Yuen managed to convince Wu Fung Hong to let Tung Fook to become a distributor of a Chinese wine. This took place in 1977 whenMr Lor of GDF allowed Tung Fook to distribute the Pearl River Bridge Brand Shi Yen Bao Jiu (ç æ±æ©çç³çè£é). Although thiswine did not do well, in 1978, Tung Fook was given the distributorship of the smaller jars of "éè¸" and "ä¸è¸" rice wine. TungFook and Luk Hop were the joint distributors of these wine.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p57" name="p57">57.</a> Chung Hau Yuen later conceived of the idea of producing a rice wine of a higher quality. He conceived the idea of the Super MellowMijiu to be sold in a glass cup. Throughout 1978 he had repeatedly persuaded Mr Kwok Kan Kei (é­é¡æºª) of Wu Fung Hong on the newproduct. In turn, Mr Kwok persuaded his manager Mr Lau Cheong Sei (åæç½) to introduce this new product. This took about eightto nine months. Then at the end of 1978, Mr Kwok informed Chung Hau Yuen that the matter should be all right and arranged for ChungHau Yuen to go to GDF in February 1979.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p58" name="p58">58.</a> In February 1979, Chung Hau Yuen went to Guangzhou and met Mr Lor of GDF and also Miss Kuk Bor ("æ²æ³¢"), the sales representativeof GDF. He also met Mr Chiu of Foshan Foods. At the meeting, it was decided that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) the sale of the Pearl River Bridge Super Mellow Mijiu would be handled by Tung Fook;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) Tung Fook would provide the packaging material for the wine which would be deducted from the cost of the price of the wine;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) Tung Fook would design the label for the wine in Hong Kong, Tung Fook would pay the design fees which would be later deductedfrom the price of the goods. The right to the label belonged to GDF;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) Foshan Food was to be the coastal company (å£å²¸å¬å¸) and Shiwan Brewery was to be the producer of the wine. Shiwan Brewerywas chosen because it had produced the "éè¸" and it produced good quality wine.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The packaging material supplied by Tung Fook included the PVC cap for the cup, the front and neck labels and the machines for installingthe cap. At this meeting Mr Lor also specified that the Pearl River Bridge trade mark must be in the middle of the label and thelabel must state that the production of the wine was under the supervision of GDF. Mr Lor also said that the label would belong toGDF.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p59" name="p59">59.</a> After this meeting, there were a number of further meetings, but Shiwan Brewery did not take part in these meetings. Chung Hau Yuenasked Mr Chiu of Foshan Foods to prepare a number of samples of the rice wine. When the samples were ready, Mr Chung took his fatherto Shiwan Brewery for tasting.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p60" name="p60">60.</a> After Chung Hau Yuen returned to Hong Kong from the meeting with GDF, he discussed the design with Mr Ngai (é­ç¾½ä¸­) of China AdvertisingAgency (ä¸­åå»£åå¬å¸). At that time, he had already agreed with GDF and Mr Kwok of the name Super Mellow Mijiu (ç¹éç±³é).He said the name Super Mellow Mijiu was decided before he went to the Mainland in February 1979. As a matter of fact, the name ofSuper Mellow Mijiu was discussed with Mr Kwok in 1978 and they also discussed the use of a chop shape design for the label. However,he also thought of the name ç¹è³ªç±³é (Super Quality Mijiu) and he had a discussion with Mr Ngai on this name. Eventually Mr Ngaidesigned the label for the Super Mellow Mijiu and Chung Hau Yuen took the design to Mr Kwok of Wu Fung Hong. He also showed the designto his father, Mr Chung Cheong, who had no views on the matter.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p61" name="p61">61.</a> After the label was approved by Wu Fung Hong, Mr Chung showed the label to Mr Lor of GDF at the Spring Trade Fair of 1979. The designfee was about $1,000 odd and was deducted from the price of the wine. The labels were printed in Hong Kong and paid for by Tung Fook,the cost was again deducted from the price of the wine. The label of the Super Mellow Mijiu was as follows :</p>    <table border="1" width="70%">        <tr>            <td width="100%">                <p><u>N.B.</u></p>                <p>Label of the Super Mellow Mijiu</p>                <p>Please see word document</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p62" name="p62">62.</a> In the Trade Fair, Mr Kwok told Mr Lor that a memorandum needed to be issued to Tung Fook. Mr Lor then asked Mr Tang Tak Kwan ("MrTang") to prepare the memorandum. The memorandum was dated 12th May 1979 (Defendants' Core Bundle 34-1).

He conceived of the idea of promoting the wine as the "XO"of the rice wine (ç±³éä¸­çXO). The Super Mellow Mijiu was introduced in Hong Kong in November 1979. In respect of the advertisingfee, GDF allowed 15% of the contract sum for advertising and the rest would be contributed by Tung Fook. When Tung Fook issued theletter of credit for the purchase, 15% would be deducted from purchase price. The 15% advertising fees would be paid to GDF's agentin Hong Kong. The agent was initially Wu Fung Hong, and later Guangnam Hong (å»£åè¡).

Mr Kwok told Chung Hau Yuen that in principle GDF agreed to let him handle Super Mellow Mijiu and heasked Chung Hau Yuen to set up a new company for this purpose. Chung Hau Yuen signed the sales contract with GDF at the Autumn TradeFair of 1981 and in the early part of 1982, at the "æ±éå°äº¤æ" (Kong Mun Small Trade Fair). Mr Hu who was the wine group leadersigned the contract with Chung Hau Yuen in æ±é.</p>    <p class="heading">(iv) Tung Fook taking back the distributorship</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p67" name="p67">67.</a> Before the Autumn Trade Fair of 1982, Chung Hau Yuen was informed by Guangnam Hong that there might be changes in the distributorshipand the distributorship might be given back to Tung Fook. At the Trade Fair, Chung Hau Yuen saw Mr Tang who was the leader of thewine group and Mr Chiu. Mr Tang told Chung Hau Yuen that he could not sign the contract for the wine with him and he was asked tosee GDF.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p68" name="p68">68.</a> A meeting was arranged with Mr Lau Hung Man (åæ´ªæ), the manager of GDF. Mr Lau told Chung Hau Yuen that his mother wanted tohandle the business and there would be two distributors. Despite Chung Hau Yuen's objection, Mr Lau told him that the matter wasalready decided by GDF. Chung Hau Yuen had previously been advised by Guangnam Hong not to sign any contract in case he was not giventhe sole distributorship. He did not sign any contract and returned to Hong Kong. He approached Guangnam Hong and Wu Fung Hong forassistance.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p69" name="p69">69.</a> Mr Wong Shuang Kong (é»æ¹æ±) of Guangnam Hong asked Chung Hau Yuen to prepare two quotations. The first was on the basis of onlyone distributor and the second on the basis of two distributors. Chung Hau Yuen accordingly prepared two purchase orders and gavethem to Mr Wong. After the closing of the Trade Fair, Mr Wong asked Chung Hau Yuen to open the letters of credit in favour of FoshanFoods. A few days later, Mr Wong told him that despite his efforts, he was not able to ask GDF to give the sole distributorship tohim. The Super Mellow Mijiu had to be handled by two distributors. Chung Hau Yuen was also asked to sign on a contract which hadalready been signed by Mr Tang and stamped with a chop. He had no alternative but to sign on the contract. He did not notice thedate that was placed on the contract. The contract was dated 1st November 1982.</p>    <p class="heading">(v) Termination of the distributorship</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p70" name="p70">70.</a> There were price competitions by Bo Man Hong and Tung Fook (1982) which took over from Tung Fook. This affected other types of ricewine. As a result, Guangnam Hong and GDF told Foshan Foods to stop the supply of Super Mellow Mijiu to the two distributors. In 1982,a team from Foshan Foods came to Hong Kong. Mr Lor Qing Qin (ç¾æ¶ç§) and Mr Chiu of Foshan Foods told Chung Hau Yuen and ChungWho Cheung not to continue in this manner.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p71" name="p71">71.</a> Chung Hau Yuen said that the termination of the distributorship was related to the supply of another new product calledé³å¹´çå°ç.It was a new wine developed by him and distributed by Bo Man Hong. The wine had the same content as the Super Mellow Mijiu.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p72" name="p72">72.</a> The sale of the é³å¹´çå°ç caused dissatisfaction of the distributor of çå°ç. This distributor tried to stop others frombuying from Bo Man Hong. Chung Hau Yuen sought the help of Foshan Foods and GDF, but Mr Lor of GDF merely said that he would lookinto the problem. Chung Hau Yuen felt that GDF was not trustworthy and he had lost interest in the business. He sold the whole ofthe wine stock to a company called City Mineral Water åå·¿è¸æºæ°´ ("City"). City in turn sold the wine to retailers at very lowprice. In 1985 GDF sent a telex to Chung Hau Yuen informing him that the supply of the Super Mellow Mijiu would be stopped. He thenemigrated to Canada in 1986. Since 1994, Mr Chung had become the East Canada distributor of GDF for the Pearl River Bridge Brandsoy sauce.</p>    <p class="heading">(vi) Cross-examination of Chung Hau Yuen</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p73" name="p73">73.</a> Chung Hau Yuen was cross-examined at great length. The purpose was to show that he was not a credible witness. It was suggested thatthe events described by him did not take place, namely, the design of the label was not conceived by him but by Mr Ngai and the meetingin February 1979 on the Super Mellow Mijiu did not take place. The Defendants' case was that there never was a meeting in February1979 in which decision was made by GDF on the Super Mellow Mijiu. Chung Hau Yuen said that the tasting of samples was held sometimebetween the meeting in February 1979 and the Autumn Trade Fair of 1979. He could not give the exact date of the tasting. He deniedthat samples were provided to him in Hong Kong on the new product. In a letter dated 12th June 1979, (Bundle D(2), p.916) sent byFoshan Foodstuff to Tung Fook, it referred to Tung Fook's request to send further samples of the rice wine. He said he did make suchrequest but he had never received the samples in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p74" name="p74">74.</a> He was referred to a draft designs of the words of Super Mellow Mijiu. They were dated 2nd July 1978 and 25th July 1978 respectively.He said that he did not know whether the dates were correct or not, but if they were the correct dates, then Mr Kwok must have alreadyby then agreed to his proposal and had asked the advertising agency to prepare the design. As to the design of the label, it wassketched by Mr Ngai in front of him in his office. He agreed that he and Mr Kwok had jointly raised the idea of using the shape ofa Chinese chop as part of the label. The chop was quite similar to the logo of the Independent Commission Against Corruption andthis idea was conceived by him. The diamond shape of the logo was also conceived by him. He denied that the chop shape and the diamondshape of the label were conceived by Mr Ngai. He denied that the words "ç³ç£ä½³é" on the neck label was suggested by Shiwan Brewery.He said that the characters were meant to state the product came from ç³ç£ (Shiwan) but it was not an emphasis. He denied it wasShiwan Brewery's idea to have the design made in Hong Kong. He said that the idea was raised by GDF. Chung Hau Yuen denied that itwas Tung Fook who paid for the design fees and Tung Fook had not sought the reimbursement of the fees.</p>    <p class="heading">(vii) 1995 Visit of Foshan Foods and subsequent events</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p75" name="p75">75.</a> He was also cross-examined about his visit to Foshan in 1995 and a letter he wrote to Foshan Foods in November 1995. The partiesagreed that I need not be concerned with these matters.</p>    <p class="heading">B. PW3, Tang Tak Kwan (é§å¾·ç<em>) (å¤</em><em>)</em></p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p76" name="p76">76.</a> PW3, Tang Tak Kwan, gave evidence for the Plaintiffs on the history of the two wine. He formally worked in the Shiqi sub-branch companybetween 1969 and 1988. He belonged to the wine group of the Trade Fair in Guangzhou. He was either the Group Leader (çµé·) or DeputyGroup Leader (å¯çµé·) in the wine group. His duty at the Trade Fair was to negotiate with the distributors and sign contractswith them.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p77" name="p77">77.</a> Mr Tang confirmed Chung Hau Yuen's evidence. He knew Mr Chung Cheong of Tung Fook since 1959. In 1969, Mr Chung Cheong took ChungHau Yuen with him to the Trade Fair. From 1977 to 1978 onwards, Mr Chung Cheong stopped going to the Trade Fair and Chung Hau Yuencame to the Trade Fair instead. He confirmed that he had signed contracts on the ç³çè£é with Chung Hau Yuen. Before the SuperMellow Mijiu was exported, he was told by Mr Lor that the labels, caps for the bottle and machines for inserting the caps would beprovided by Chung Hau Yuen, and that the memorandum dated 12th May 1979 was signed. He also introduced Chung Hau Yuen to the glassfactory in Shiqi to make the glass cups for the Super Mellow Mijiu.</p>    <p class="heading">C. Mr Lor</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p78" name="p78">78.</a> Mr Lor confirmed the evidence of Chung Hau Yuen on how the Super Mellow Mijiu came into being.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Defendants' evidence</p>    <p class="heading">A. Mr Chen Bing Hao</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p79" name="p79">79.</a> Mr Chen Bing Hao said that in June 1978, Mr Chiu and Mr Lee Wan Fung (æé²å³°) of Foshan Foods came to Shiwan Brewery to see himand others. They said that Mr Chung Cheong from Hong Kong wanted to develop a new product and they asked the Shiwan Brewery to developthe Super Mellow Mijiu.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p80" name="p80">80.</a> In July or August of 1978, representatives from Foshan Foods including its Manager, Mr Lor Qing Qin (ç¾æ¶ç§), Mr Chiu, Mr Chan(é³éè¼)ï¼Mr Lee (æé²å³°) and Mr Fei Hau Chung (è²»å­å¿ ) came to the Shiwan Brewery and discussed the new product. Mr ChungCheong and his wife also came. Although Mr Chen initially said he could not recall whether Chung Hau Yuen came as well, eventuallyhe agreed that Chung Hau Yuen also came. By that time the Brewery had developed six to seven samples; they were tasted but foundnot acceptable. The request was to develop a product with a alcoholic content above that of Shiwan Mijiu but below theä¸è¸. MrChung Cheong had taken two bottles of wine from Hong Kong, one was fromææºéå» ï¼and the other one was fromé³å¤ªåéå» .In the same meeting, the question of who should design the label was raised. Mr Chung Cheong said that Shiwan Brewery was to dealwith the wine while Tung Fook was to deal with the design in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p81" name="p81">81.</a> After the visit, the Shiwan Brewery continued to develop the new wine. By September/October 1978, Shiwan Brewery had decided on thenew wine. In February/March 1979, the basic product was produced and six samples were provided to Foshan Foods. Some time later,Foshan Foods told them that the wine was good but asked for the bitterness in the taste to be removed. Mr Chen then decided to mixthe product with old wine from the Shiwan Brewery. The alcoholic content of the product was adjusted. Six new samples were deliveredto Foshan Foods for tasting. These samples were delivered to Tung Fook by Foshan Foods. About 10 days later, the Shiwan Brewery wastold to produce the wine.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p82" name="p82">82.</a> In about April/May 1979, Chung Cheong, his wife and Chung Hau Yuen came to the Shiwan Brewery together with Mr Chiu of Foshan Foods,Kuk-Bor of GDF, Mr Kwok of Wu Fung Hong and representatives from the Foshan Light Industrial Bureau. The new wine was highly praisedat this meeting and the alcoholic content was agreed upon. The parties then decided on the name of the wine. The visitors broughta draft design which was similar to the present Super Mellow Mijiu label. On the main label two names appeared, namely, "ç¹è³ªç±³é"(Super Quality Mijiu) and "ç¹ç´ç±³é" (Super Class Mijiu). Mr Chen then consulted an employee of the Brewery, Mr Lam Chun (ææ¯)who said these two names could not be used and new wine should be called Super Mellow Mijiu "ç¹éç±³é". Chung Cheong and ChungHau Yuen agreed to the name.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p83" name="p83">83.</a> The neck label was also discussed. Mr Chen suggested using the words "ç³ç£ä½³é" in the middle of the neck label. This was objectedby Foshan Foods. Chung Cheong, however, said that the idea was good because this would show that the product came from his nativevillage. Mr So (èå±é·) of the Foshan Light Industry Bureau stated that unless the words "ç³ç£ä½³é" were used, they wouldnot produce the wine. Mr Chen also suggested adding a back label to the bottle. Mr So (èå±é·) said that the back label wouldnot be added for the time being.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p84" name="p84">84.</a> Mr Chen gave the order to produce the new wine in June 1979. The raw material for the production was provided by Foshan Foods. Theglass bottles were provided by glass bottle factories in the Mainland. The Super Mellow Mijiu labels were supplied by Tung Fook fromHong Kong. The first contract on the Super Mellow Mijiu was dated 11th October 1979 (Bundle D12/74) and the first batch of wine wasdelivered to Foshan Foods in October 1979.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p85" name="p85">85.</a> From 1980 onwards, there was also internal sale of the Super Mellow Mijiu. The internal sale increased each year.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p86" name="p86">86.</a> Mr Chen denied that before the tasting in April and May 1979, the name "Super Mellow Mijiu" was already decided. He further deniedthat the Shiwan Brewery was not required to be consulted on the name of the new wine and he denied that his evidence of the discussionon the name of the Super Mellow Mijiu was for the purpose of raising the level of involvement by Shiwan Brewery in this litigation.</p>    <p class="heading">B. Mr Chan Wan Fai</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p87" name="p87">87.</a> Mr Chan Wan Fai confirmed Mr Chen Bing Hao's evidence on the two tastings in Shiwan Brewery in 1978 and 1979 and also the discussionon the name of Super Mellow Mijiu. Mr Chan further mentioned that Mr So (èå±é·) stated that Foshan had suffered a set back beforein relation to soy sauce. It was said that the Pearl River Bridge soy sauce (çæ½ç) was developed by Foshan, and the words åµå¶(develop) that appeared in the label of the çæ½ç was such an indication. However, because Foshan did not emphasize that theproduct belonged to it, other factories in the Guangdong Province also produced products with the same name.</p>    <p class="heading">C. Mr Chiu Kong</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p88" name="p88">88.</a> Mr Chiu also said that Mr Chung Cheong of Tung Fook suggested the idea of producing the new wine. Mr Chung Cheong was a native inthe Foshan area and he suggested the Shiwan Brewery to produce a better quality wine. On an occasion in which the "long-an" fruit(é¾ç¼) was in season, Chung Cheong and his wife, Chung Hau Yuen, Luk Chou, Kuk-Bor (æ²æ³¢) and Mr Kwok came to Foshan Foods todiscuss the wine. Mr Chung Cheong suggested how the wine could be improved. The party also went to the Shiwan Brewery which was ashort distance away and met Mr Chen and the others. Mr Chiu could not recall how many tastings were made or where the tastings wereconducted.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p89" name="p89">89.</a> Although Mr Chiu in his evidence-in-chief said that it was Mr Chung Cheong who mentioned about the new wine, he said, in his cross-examination,that before Mr Chung Cheong came, he had already heard from Chung Hau Yuen in the Trade Fair that Tung Fook wanted the new wine inthe market. Mr Kwok was also present.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p90" name="p90">90.</a> Mr Chiu denied that there was a discussion on the Super Mellow Mijiu in the office of GDF in February 1979. He also said that hecould not recall such a meeting and if there were such a meeting, he should have remembered it.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p91" name="p91">91.</a> In his evidence-in-chief, Mr Chiu seemed to say that Mr Chung Cheong and the parties had visited the Shiwan Brewery twice. However,in cross-examination, Mr Chiu admitted that he was not present in the second visit. He also said Mr Chung Cheong only brought alongthe two wine on the second visit. While Mr Chiu was initially assertive that the first contract of the Super Mellow Mijiu was discussedbetween him and Mr Chung Cheong and Chung Hau Yuen, he somehow relented in cross-examination when it was put to him that Mr ChungCheong was not present in the Autumn Trade Fair of 1979.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p92" name="p92">92.</a> Mr Chiu said in the Autumn Trade Fair of 1981, Chung Hau Yuen informed him that his father had died and his mother did not want tohandle the Super Mellow Mijiu. Chung Hau Yuen wanted to set up Bo Man Hong to handle the Super Mellow Mijiu. Mr Chiu told him thatthere was no problem. He said that the decision to give the distributorship to Bo Man Hong was not made by him alone. It was alsonot made by Mr Lor alone. He denied that the change required GDF's approval. He said that the decision vested with Wu Fung Hong.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p93" name="p93">93.</a> The contract on the supply of the Supper Mellow Mijiu was signed again with Tung Fook in the Autumn Trade Fair of 1982. Since ChungHau Yuen had done a lot of work for the wine, he could not be excluded totally from the distributorship of the Super Mellow Mijiu.Mr Chiu said that he had suggested to Mr Lau Hung Man of GDF that both Tung Fook and Bo Man Hong should handle the wine but he didnot know who made the actual decision.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p94" name="p94">94.</a> Mr Chiu stated that because of the difference in price offered by Tung Fook (1982) and Bo Man Hong on the Super Mellow Mijiu, MrYuan had a discussion with them on the matter. He said the meeting with Tung Fook (1982) and Bo Man Hong was chaired by Mr Yuan.Mr Chiu did not take part in the meeting. The agreement dated 29th March 1985 was prepared and drafted by Mr Yuan.</p>    <p class="heading">D.

He took over the operation of Tung Fook after the death of his father.A limited company, namely Tung Fook (1982) was established. Although in his witness statement he stated that his father developedthe Super Mellow Mijiu, obviously he was not in a position to give personal knowledge on this matter. He gave evidence on how hewas refused the distribution contract of Super Mellow Mijiu in the Trade Fair and his attempts to get back the distributorship throughthe assistance of his acquaintances in various Chinese government departments.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p96" name="p96">96.</a> He said he was refused the contract in the Autumn Trade Fair 1981, he eventually met Mr Lau Hung Man (åæ´ªæ), the manager ofGDF and Mr Hu. He was told by Mr Lau that he would be given back the distributorship at the next trade fair and Mr Hu was asked byMr Lau to follow up the matter. In the Spring Trade Fair of 1982 he met Mr Lau again. At the meeting, Mr Hu was also present. MrLau told Chung Who Cheung that he should set up a limited company and hire Chung Hau Yuen as the manager. Bo Man Hong should be allowedto carry on trading for six months. After the meeting, Chung Who Cheung was asked by his acquaintance in the Mainland to preparea record of the meeting and the copies were to be sent to the relevant organizations. Chung Who Cheung prepared the record (BundleC4/97). His acquaintance told him that he would send the copies of the record to the organizations.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p97" name="p97">97.</a> By a letter dated 10th September 1982, Tung Fook offered Chung Hau Yuen to be the manager of the sales department of Tung Fook from1st December 1982.

He met Ms Kuk and Mr Chiu and placed the orders with them. However, no contractwas signed and it was only after ten days that a meeting was set up in which he met Mr Hu, Ms Kuk, Mr Tang and Mr Chiu. Mr Hu announcedthat the Super Mellow Mijiu distributorship would be given to Tung Fook. He also stated that all contracts signed outside the TradeFair was illegal. Chung Who Cheung, however, did not know what Mr Hu meant by that. Later, Chung Who Cheung gave the order to MrChiu who confirmed that the terms of sale would be the same as before.</p>    <p class="heading">E.

Mr Yuan said that Bo Man Hong did not have a warehouseof its own and it distributed the wine at the pier after they arrived in Hong Kong by boat. There was price difference between BoMan Hong and Tung Fook (1982) in the same product. Foshan Foods had warned both Tung Fook (1982) and Bo Man Hong to comply with thecontract terms, otherwise it would cancel the contracts with them (telex dated 28th November 1984, D12/58). In a meeting in HongKong in March 1985, Mr Yuan met the representative of both companies. He drafted an agreement requesting both companies to sign.The agreement dated 29th March 1985 (D5/2313) was signed by Tung Fook (1982). Mr Yuan said that Chung Hau Yuen should have signeda similar agreement, otherwise he would not have continued to supply the wine to Bo Man Hong. After the meeting in March 1985, BoMan Hong was still distributing the wine in the pier and shortly thereafter Foshan Foods cancelled the contract with Bo Man Hong.The agreement of 29th March 1985 was signed within the authority of Mr Yuan. He did not inform GDF of this. Further the decisionto stop the supply to Bo Man Hong was also not made known to GDF.</p>    <p class="heading">F. DW9 Mr Ngai Yue Chung (é­ç¾½ä¸­<em>) ("Mr Ngai") : Design of the Super Mellow Mijiu Label</em></p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p100" name="p100">100.</a> Mr Ngai formally worked in China Advertising Company (ä¸­åå»£åå¬å¸). He joined the company in 1975 and retired in 1990. Initially,he worked in the Production Department and subsequently joined the Business Department and retired in 1990 as the Assistant Managerof Customers' Service. Before he joined China Advertising, he worked in Wu Fung Hong. He knew Mr Chung Cheong very well in the variousbusiness promotion activities of Chinese products.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p101" name="p101">101.</a> In relation to the design of the Super Mellow Mijiu label, he said that he was asked by Mr Kwok of Wu Fung Hong to prepare a designfor a new rice wine. He was told that the design should not be similar to other rice wine already in the market. At that time, therewere in the market ä¸­å±±ç±³éï¼ç³å²ç±³é and ç³ç£ç±³é. In his discussion with Mr Kwok, he learned that the new rice winewould be handled by Tung Fook. He thought of using the style of a Chinese New Year paper decoration (æ®æ¥) for the design. Theword "å" ("Tung") is squarish, it would be put in the centre of the design. The names of other wine were usually placed horizontallyfrom left to right. He thought of the design of a Chinese seal or chop and the words would begin from top to bottom. During the discussion,he made sketches of his design in front of Mr Kwok. Then he asked his production unit to prepare a layout (èå) for Mr Kwok whichwas later accepted by Mr Kwok. In the discussion with Mr Kwok, the name of rice wine was discussed. The name ç¹è³ª (Super Quality)was suggested but since it was difficult to pronounce, it was agreed to use the name ç¹é (Super Mellow) instead. Mr Ngai chosethe type of the Chinese characters used. He suggested that the characters should have some feeling of stone carving (éç³å³é).The words were prepared by the production unit and were eventually given to Mr Kwok. Later on, the final draft (in black and white)was supplied to Mr Kwok. Mr Ngai, however, was not given back the final draft for the purpose of printing. Mr Ngai also said thatthe idea of two dragons on the main label and the colouring all came from him.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p102" name="p102">102.</a> Afterwards, when Mr Ngai visited Tung Fook he asked Mr Chung Cheong about the draft label and whether the business of the new winewas finalized. Mr Chung Cheong asked him to talk to Chung Hau Yuen on the matter. About a year later, Chung Hau Yuen told Mr Ngaithat the new wine would soon be arriving in Hong Kong and asked him to design posters for the Super Mellow Mijiu. The matter wasthen handled by an assistant of Mr Ngai. Mr Ngai said that China Advertising received a design fee for the label, this was includedin the charge for supplying the poster to Chung Hau Yuen.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p103" name="p103">103.</a> The gist of Mr Ngai's evidence is that the design of the Super Mellow Mijiu label was discussed between him and Mr Kwok. It was afterhe had prepared the design that he talked to Chung Hau Yuen. Mr Ngai had previously signed three written documents for this case,the first was in the form of a statement in Chinese while the other two were affirmations.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p104" name="p104">104.</a> The first statement was dated 16th September 1995. He said he was asked by a former colleague of China Advertising to meet Mr Dongof GDF and a solicitor. The solicitor prepared the statement for him to sign. In this statement, he said that it was Chung Hau Yuenwho instructed him to prepare the Super Mellow Mijiu label. It was stated that in 1979, Chung Hau Yuen of Tung Fook telephoned himand asked him to prepare a design for the label of a wine. He then went to Chung Hau Yuen's office. On arrival in Tung Fook, Mr ChungCheong told him that the matter of the design would be handled by Chung Hau Yuen and he could discuss the matter with Chung Hau Yuen.Chung Hau Yuen told him that Tung Fook would introduce a rice wine and he hoped that it would be distinctive from the other wineof Tung Fook. Chung Hau Yuen had also asked him about the names of the wine and the names mentioned were ç¹è³ªç±³é and ç¹éç±³ébut the matter was not concluded then. Afterwards, there were further discussions. He told Chung Hau Yuen that as the name of hiscompany had the word "Fook" "ç¦", the design should use the idea of the Chinese New Year paper decoration (æ®æ¥). The idea ofdragons and the shape of a Chinese seal chop were also mentioned. It was decided to use the åé­å­é« for the words Super MellowMijiu, ç¹éç±³é. Thereafter, Chung Hau Yuen took him to see Mr Kwok of Wu Fung Hong to consult his views.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p105" name="p105">105.</a> On 18th September 1995, Mr Ngai made an affirmation ("the first affirmation"). He was told by the lawyer that it was a matter ofprocedure to sign the document. Apart from some minor aspects, the content of the affirmation was the same as the Chinese statement.Mr Ngai said that the contents of these two documents were different from what he had told the lawyer. Nonetheless, he was askedby the lawyer to sign these two documents. When he was asked to prepare to sign the affirmation, he told the lawyer that it was inEnglish and he did not understand English and the lawyer orally explained to him in Cantonese about the content.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p106" name="p106">106.</a> Apart from these two documents, Mr Ngai had given a further affirmation ("the second affirmation") to the Defendants' solicitors.In it he stated that part of the content of the first affirmation was not what he had said and he made the second affirmation toclarify the position. In the second affirmation, he said that he had informed the Plaintiffs' lawyer and Mr Dong that it was ChungHau Yuen of Tung Fook who contacted him for the design of the labels. He also stated that he did not tell the lawyer that Mr ChungCheong had retired at that time and that the business of Tung Fook was handled by Chung Hau Yuen. Further, Chung Hau Yuen did notmention about rice wine from Guangdong. In the first affirmation, it was stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"5. ....

During the design process, Mr ChungHau Yuen gave me some indication about how he wanted the label to be, and after getting an understanding of what he wanted I startedto design the labels by expressing the ideas on paper and preparing drafts. Mr Chung Hau Yuen, and other people like Mr Kwok KangKai of Ng Fung Hong, gave their comments and after several exchange of ideas and several amendments by the design staff of ChinaAdvertising, the final version of the labels for the 'Super Mellow Mijiu' were finalized."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr Ngai also denied that Chung Hau Yuen took him to see Mr Kwok.

He had also prepared an affidavit about the meeting. Mr Kwong said that he explainedto Mr Ngai the purpose of the meeting and that he had to ask him the facts surrounding the design of the label of the Super MellowMijiu. He then asked Mr Ngai on the history of the design and told him specifically that he was required to tell the truth no moreand no less. Mr Ngai then gave him an account of what had happened. Mr Kwong also asked him some questions on matters specificallywhich he answered. After Mr Ngai had finished, he reduced the information into a Chinese written statement. He asked Mr Ngai to readthe statement. He read and confirmed the statement by signing his name and initialing the amendments on the statement. He then toldMr Ngai that he would be preparing an affirmation based on what he had said and Mr Ngai would be asked to sign the affirmation inthe next few days.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p108" name="p108">108.</a> A few days later, when the affirmation (i.e. the first affirmation) was ready, he asked Mr Ngai to come to his office so that hecould bring him to another solicitor to have the affirmation affirmed. Mr Ngai, however, told him that he could not leave his office.He then arranged Mr Eddy Wong of Messrs Anthony Kwan &amp; Co. to go with him to meet Mr Ngai in order to administer the oath. Arrivingat Mr Ngai's office, he introduced Mr Ngai to Mr Wong and explained to him that Mr Wong's role was to administer his oath on theaffirmation. He then explained to Mr Ngai in Chinese the contents of the first affirmation paragraph by paragraph. After he finished,he asked Mr Ngai whether he agreed with the contents. Mr Ngai said he agreed. Mr Wong also asked Mr Ngai whether he understood theaffirmation and Mr Ngai answered in the affirmative. Mr Wong then asked Mr Ngai to sign the affirmation.

By a letter dated 4th December 1993 to GDF, Foshan Foods accepted the criticism madeby GDF. It also requested GDF to sign a new trade mark licence with Foshan Foods.

Mr Tang signedthe contract with Chung Tai for the Shiwan Mijiu in the Autumn Trade Fair 1975. In my view one of the best evidence which supportedthe decision to introduce four new wine in 1975 was the contract signed in the same Trade Fair by Mr Tang for the ä¸­å±±ç±³é (BundleD(11a)/493). The Defendants' allegation that the ç´çéè¸ was already in the market when the Shiwan Mijiu was introduced wasnot put to the Plaintiffs' witnesses.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Assessment of Mr Chiu</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p130" name="p130">130.</a> I do not accept Mr Chiu's evidence on the Shiwan Mijiu. I find him to be selective in his memory. His denial of attending the conferencewhich discussed the introduction of four new wine (he also denied attending the conference in February 1979 in which the Super MellowMijiu was agreed to be introduced) was a deliberate attempt of not telling the truth. I do not accept that a new wine could be introducedafter discussion between a sub-branch company and the brewery. It would be too much of an co-incidence that at some time, three othertypes of new wine were also introduced without GDF agreeing to their production. Although Mr Chiu denied that the production of thenew wine would require the approval of GDF because he said that Wu Fung Hong had already given its approval, his view was differentfrom that of Mr Yuan who said that the approval of GDF, Foshan Foods and Wu Fung Hong must all be obtained first.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) Assessment of Mr Chen</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p131" name="p131">131.</a> During the planned economy, Shiwan Brewery was only a production unit. It was not engaged in the export trade. I do not accept thatin relation to a decision which introduced four new wine to the Hong Kong market, the name of the wine would be left to the productionunit. I find that the names of the four new wine were already decided at an earlier stage at the conference of the Processed FoodSection before Shiwan Brewery was instructed to produce the wine. As it was only involved in the actual production of the wine, itwould not know many of the decisions reached earlier or how the export was to be carried out.</p>    <p class="heading">(4) Assessment of Mr Cheung's evidence</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p132" name="p132">132.</a> Mr Cheung Loy Chun of Chung Tai also gave evidence on how Chung Tai became the distributor of the Shiwan Mijiu and his efforts intrying to revive the Shiwan Mijiu after its cancellation. His evidence does not advance the Defendants' case further. The Plaintiffs'case as disclosed by Mr Tang is that Mr Tang was introduced to Mr Cheung in the Autumn Trade Fair of 1975 and the contract for theShiwan Mijiu was signed at that Trade Fair. Mr Cheung's evidence was that he was promised by Mr Sik of Wu Fung Hong before the SpringTrade Fair that Chung Tai would be given the distributorship. Mr Cheung and another person from Chung Tai, namely, Mr Kung Shui Chianhad attended the Spring Trade Fair of 1975. At this Trade Fair, they were introduced to Mr Chiu and they were given samples of theShiwan Mijiu and labels of the Shiwan Mijiu.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p133" name="p133">133.</a> The episode of the Spring Trade Fair was not even put to the Plaintiffs' witnesses. It is apparent from the evidence adduced in thiscase that the Defendants are trying to boost the role played by Foshan Foods and minimize the importance of GDF. Mr Cheung and MrKung's evidence are not reliable. The labels for the Shiwan Mijiu could not possibly have been given to them at the Spring TradeFair of 1975. Even according to Mr Chen, the draft label was only shown to Chiu Kong in the Spring Trade Fair of 1975 who returnedit to him two or three days later and printing of the labels only started in June or July of that year.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings on Super Mellow Mijiu</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Assessment of Chung Hau Yuen</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p134" name="p134">134.</a> In my view, Chung Hau Yuen is a truthful witness. The impression that comes out from his two and a half days of evidence is thathe is a man with an acute business sense. I have no doubt whatsoever that he conceived the idea of the Super Mellow Mijiu and itwas through his efforts that this product came to the market and became a success. He obviously, after so many years, still tookgreat pride in what he had achieved in this regard. I accept his evidence relating to the meeting with GDF in February 1979 and thewine tasting in Shiwan Brewery that took place on an occasion between February and May 1979. I accept his evidence that he also conceivedof the label design of the Super Mellow Mijiu. He accepted that Mr Kwok might have discussed with Mr Ngai in 1978 about the nameand design of the Super Mellow Mijiu.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p135" name="p135">135.</a> Mr Tang S.C., Counsel for the Defendants, submitted that Chung Hau Yuen had deliberately minimized the role of Mr Chung Cheong inthe development of the Super Mellow Mijiu. He stated that Mr Chung Cheong was a well-established wine merchant; he was the representativeof the Chambers of Commerce, and he had been received by the Mainland as a State guest. None of these, in my view, casts doubt onthe credibility of Chung Hau Yuen's evidence. By the time the Super Mellow Mijiu was developed, I find as a fact that Mr Chung Cheonghad let his younger son taking over the operation of the wine business. Even according to Mr Ngai, he was told by Mr Chung Cheongto discuss the matter of the Super Mellow Mijiu label with Chung Hau Yuen. Mr Tang Tak Kwan further stated that from 1977 to 1978onwards, Mr Chung Cheong had stopped going to the Trade Fair.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p136" name="p136">136.</a> I accept Chung Hau Yuen's evidence that the reason why he set up Bo Man Hong was not because he deliberately left Tung Fook and setup a rival business. Bo Man was the alias of his father. Obviously, there was sibling rivalry and discord within the family and hewas not the favourite son of his mother. For someone who had to give up his studies to comply with the wishes of his father to workin Tung Fook, it would be very difficult indeed to accept the sudden intrusion at the scene of his elder brother Chung Who Cheungwho obviously was the favoured son of the mother.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p137" name="p137">137.</a> I further accept his evidence that after the meeting with the Foshan Foods' representatives in Hong Kong in March 1985, he did notsign the written agreement drafted by Mr Yuan. Had he done so, one would expect a copy or the original of the document to be in thepossession of Foshan Foods. I further accept his evidence as to why he had eventually lost interest in the wine business. Obviouslyhe was disillusioned with the approach of GDF in first granting him the distributorship of the Super Mellow Mijiu and then allowedTung Fook (1982) to be a co-distributor. The problem with GDF failing to actively assist him when he encountered problems from thedistributor of çå°ç, contributed to his decision to sell the stock of wine to City Mineral Water. I accept that it was GDF whichdetermined Bo Man Hong's distributorship although the actual telex of termination was not produced in evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Assessment of Mr Lor's evidence</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p138" name="p138">138.</a> It was suggested that Mr Lor had mishandled the distributorship of the Super Mellow Mijiu and was thus side-stepped by GDF in laterdealings of the wine. The evidence showed that Mr Lor was in fact promoted in GDF and his lack of knowledge on subsequent dealingsof the wine was not attributable to his being reprimanded for not handling the distributorship properly.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) Assessment of Mr Ngai's evidence</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p139" name="p139">139.</a> I do not find Mr Ngai to be a credible witness, he is now 70 years of age and he was dealing with a matter that took place 20 yearsago. Although he maintained that he remembered the Super Mellow Mijiu design because it was his design, obviously, his evidence onthe circumstances in which the design came into being was faulted. He repeatedly said in his evidence that he had done many designsbefore. In my view, either he was deliberately lying or he was totally confused and could not remember what had actually transpired.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p140" name="p140">140.</a> The Plaintiffs accepted that Mr Ngai might have some contact with Mr Kwok in 1978 and Mr Ngai might have done some work before, butthe idea all came from Chung Hau Yuen. I accept the evidence of Chung Hau Yuen that it was he who had suggested how the design shouldbe like. I accept what the two solicitors said regarding the taking of the Chinese statement and the first affirmation of Mr Ngai.I find that no pressure was brought on Mr Ngai when he signed these two documents. There are differences in the contents of the firstand second documents. But in the main, they confirmed that it was Chung Hau Yuen who had contacted Mr Ngai and discussed the SuperMellow Mijiu design.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p141" name="p141">141.</a> While there may be minor disputes to the contents of the first affirmation, the overall impression one gets from reading Mr Ngai'ssecond affirmation is that it was Chung Hau Yuen who first contacted him and discussed with him about the design. This is totallycontrary to his evidence in Court which suggested that Chung Hau Yuen only came into the picture after the design was finalized.</p>    <p class="heading">(4) Assessment of Mr Chen Bing Hao's evidence</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p142" name="p142">142.</a> I do not find Mr Chen Bing Hao to be a credible witness. The impression of his evidence is that he attempted to raise the role ofShiwan Brewery in the Super Mellow Mijiu episode. I do not accept Mr Chen's evidence that the name of the Super Mellow Mijiu wasdiscussed in April/May 1979 in Shiwan Brewery. By that time, the name of the wine had already been decided. Mr Chen said that inApril/May 1979, the label that was brought to Shiwan Brewery was blank in the middle and there were two names of ç¹è³ªç±³é andç¹ç´ç±³é. This is simply not believable. By that time, I find that the label had been finalized and the name that appeared onthe label was the Super Mellow Mijiu. Mr Chen's witness statements made no reference to Mr Lam Chun, who allegedly advised on thename of Super Mellow Mijiu. This was not something that was put to the Plaintiffs' witnesses. I do not accept that such an eventhad occurred. On the Defendants' own case, if the dates inserted on the draft design of the words and logo of Super Mellow Mijiuwere correct, then the name of Super Mellow Mijiu must have been decided before April and May 1979 which Mr Ngai said was the timethe name was decided. This is inherently improbable.</p>    <p class="heading">(5) Assessment of Chan Wan Fai's evidence</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p143" name="p143">143.</a> I also do not find Mr Chan Wan Fai's (é³éè¼) evidence on the question of Super Mellow Mijiu to be convincing. He said that atthe second visit, the design was shown but he could not recall the name of the wine on the label. I find that the name of the winehad clearly appeared on the label and Mr Chan's evidence was a concerted attempt together with Mr Chen and Mr Chiu to minimize therole of Chung Hau Yuen in this regard. I find that the name of the Super Mellow Mijiu had been chosen before the tasting in the Brewery.I have given due consideration to the fact that as the events took place many years ago, the memory of the witnesses might not beas factually accurate as one is dealing with recent events. But even with this consideration, the overall impression is that theinaccuracy is due to more than merely lapses in memory.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p144" name="p144">144.</a> Although Mr Chan said that Mr Chung Cheong was the one who raised the matters such as the use of the glass cups for the wine, heconceded that he referred to the role played by Mr Chung Cheong because he was the head of Tung Fook.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p145" name="p145">145.</a> Mr Chan also said that it was Shiwan Brewery who suggested the name Super Mellow Mijiu. In his written declaration dated 15th August1995, he stated that it was Tung Fook who decided on the name "ç¶ææ¯åç¦éè¡å®åå" (Bundle D2/927). Although initiallyin his evidence he denied that he had said Tung Fook named the wine, he conceded after seeing his declaration that he had. He explainedthat the name was suggested by Shiwan Brewery and later when the label was printed, the name was mentioned by Tung Fook. His statement,however, did not mention about Shiwan Brewery suggesting the name. He explained that the statement did not give details of the discussionbetween the parties. I find it difficult to accept his explanation. I consider this to be an afterthought. There had been a longhistory of litigation between GDF and the Shiwan Brewery, and the matter regarding the discussion of the name of Super Mellow Mijiuought to have been raised by the Defendants earlier.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p146" name="p146">146.</a> The evidence of what Mr So said was clearly hearsay in nature. Mr So had in fact attended court but chosen not to give evidence.The explanation given was that he was ill. I would attach no weight to what Mr So had allegedly said. I do not accept the evidenceof the Defendants' witnesses who deposed to what Mr So had said. I do not accept that in the discussions in 1979, the question oflocal flavour was raised.</p>    <p class="heading">(6) Assessment of Mr Chiu's evidence</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p147" name="p147">147.</a> Obviously, Mr Chiu was selective in his evidence. While he could give detail account of the names of persons who attended certainmeetings, he could not recall important event such as the 1974 conference in which the four types of new wine were to be introducedby GDF in the market, nor could he recall the important meeting on the Super Mellow Mijiu in February 1979. Although he said he was65 years of age, I do not accept that his lack of memory on these important issues was due to his age. It was rather a deliberateattempt not to reveal the truth of the development in these two wine. Another example of this is his evidence regarding the labelof the Super Mellow Mijiu. While he praised the design of the label, he said that he could not recall whether the name of the winewas placed on the label. Similar evidence came from DW15 Chan Wan Fai.</p>    <p class="heading">(7) Contract with Bo Man Hong</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p148" name="p148">148.</a> I accept what Mr Tang said regarding the signing of the contract dated 1st November 1982 with Bo Man Hong. What he had disclosedin his evidence earlier did not contradict with what he subsequently said on this matter. His earlier evidence merely stated thathe did not know whether after the contract with Tung Fook (1982) signed in the Autumn Trade Fair of 1982, there was further supplyof products to Bo Man Hong.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p149" name="p149">149.</a> Chung Hau Yuen was not cross-examined on the contract with Bo Man Hong dated 1st November 1982 when his evidence was taken in Canada.He also prepared a written witness statement dealing with this contract which I had referred to earlier. The admissibility of thestatement was not contested but the content was. There really is no evidence to contradict what Mr Tang and Chung Hau Yuen said onthe contract with Bo Man Hong.</p>    <p class="heading">(8) Assessment of Chung Who Cheung's evidence</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p150" name="p150">150.</a> The record of the meeting between Mr Lau and Chung Who Cheung in the Spring Trade Fair of 1982 was not sent to GDF. It is the Plaintiffs'case that only Mr Hu and Ms Kuk were present at this meeting. During the cross-examination of Chung Who Cheung, he said that theoriginal photocopy of the record of meeting was still with Tung Fook (1982). He was asked to locate the document. On the followingday, he said he was unable to find the original photocopy. He said that the photocopy, together with other documents, were givento his solicitors and they had not returned the documents to him. Mr Tang, S.C., informed the Court that Hastings &amp; Co. had conducteda search of their office and could not find the original photocopy. Then on the next day, Chung Who Cheung said that he had foundthe original photocopy. He said that the document was given back to him by Hastings &amp; Co. together with other documents but hedid not realise the document was in that bundle of documents. The bundle was with the representatives of Shiwan Brewery who werestaying in a hotel in Hong Kong. He only discovered the document after he tried to look for it again.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p151" name="p151">151.</a> The Plaintiffs had contested the authenticity of the document at the opening of the case and suggested that the record was not acontemporary document. This document was only disclosed on 11th May 1998, a few days into the trial. Chung Who Cheung said that hehad the original photocopy for a long time. The original photocopy in fact was found by him two to three months before the trial.Although he said that he did not know whether the document was important or not, he also said that he was reluctant to reveal hisdocuments to the Plaintiffs. His explanation was not credible. He must have realised the importance of the document, otherwise therewas no reason for him to withhold the disclosure earlier.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p152" name="p152">152.</a> He had given two witness statements. The first was given in 1997, it did not mention the meeting. Among the odd things of this recordis the name of GDF. The name used by him was å»£æ±çé£åé²åºå£å¬å¸. This name was only changed in 1988. Mr Chung said thathe always used the name é²åºå£å¬å¸. However, on the first page of the record, the name he used was å»£æ±çé£åå¬å¸ andon the second page, he also used the name å»£æ±çé£åå¬å¸.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p153" name="p153">153.</a> I am not satisfied with the authenticity of the record of the meeting. In my view, the only explanation for Chung Who Cheung's reluctanceto produce the original photocopy is that he was concerned with the challenge to the authenticity of the document by the Plaintiffs.I find his explanation on how he was unable to locate the document suspicious. Mr Lau of GDF had since died and was of course unableto give evidence. Mr Tang, S.C., submitted that the contemporary evidence supported Chung Who Cheung's case that there was such ameeting with Mr Lau and Mr Hu. He referred, for example, to the reference letter by Mr Lin Gwun (é£è²«ååé¢ååè¾¦å¬å®¤å¯ä¸»ä»»),the offer of employment by Tung Fook (1982) to Chung Hau Yuen and his rejection of the offer. He also referred to Chung Hau Yuen'sevidence that Mr Lau had informed him that the distributorship would be given to Tung Fook (1982) and Bo Man Hong.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p154" name="p154">154.</a> None of these, in my view, casts doubt on Mr Hu's evidence in this regard. He was adamant that he did not know how Bo Man Hong becamethe distributor again. In my view, it may well be that Mr Lau had separately dealt with this matter with Chung Who Cheung and withChung Hau Yuen. It is not necessary to speculate on the matter. But as far as Mr Hu was concerned, his role was merely to tell ChungWho Cheung that Tung Fook would be given back the distributorship. I accept Mr Hu's evidence that it was he who informed Chung WhoCheung that he would be given the distributorship.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p155" name="p155">155.</a> I do not accept Chung Who Cheung to be a credible witness. What he said regarding the meeting of May 1982 was inherently incredible.If what he said was true, GDF would hand back the distributorship to him in the Autumn Trade Fair of 1982. GDF had also suggestedthe elaborate arrangement of inviting Chung Hau Yuen to be a director of Tung Fook (1982). Yet, when he subsequently met those whohe had sought help, such as Mr Lin Gwun and Mr Yim Sheung Man (å´å°æ°) of "ç²µæµ·æè³æéå¬å¸" which is a company of theGuangdong Province in Hong Kong, he did not tell them that an agreement had been reached with GDF on the change of distributorship.The impression one gets from his evidence is that he did not treat the agreement as something of importance or significance. Yetit was important for him to reduce the agreement into writing so as to bind GDF. He had further gone so far as to obtain a letterfrom Mr Lin in which Mr Lin asked his friend to intervene in the matter because the question of the distributorship with Tung Fookhad not been satisfactorily resolved. The letter was dated 26th August 1982, which was three months after the alleged meeting. Ina further letter dated 30th September 1982, written by Chung Who Cheung to GDF, regarding Guangnam Hong's refusal to take the ordersof Tung Fook, he merely asked GDF to deal with the matter fairly (ç§å¬è¾¦ç) and to provide reasonable arrangements (åçå®æ).If GDF had indeed agreed to give back the distributorship to Tung Fook, one would expect Chung Who Cheung to say this in the letterinstead of merely asking GDF to deal with the matter fairly. This is totally inconsistent with the terms of the alleged meeting.On the other hand, the letter of 30th September 1982 was consistent with Mr Hu telling him and his mother that GDF would considertheir request to be given back the distributorship. At the Autumn Trade Fair of 1982, Chung Who Cheung had to wait for ten days beforethe distributorship was given back to him. This is consistent with the Plaintiffs' case that the decision to give the distributorshipto Tung Fook (1982) was only reached at the Trade Fair.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p156" name="p156">156.</a> Likewise, Chung Who Cheung's evidence that in the Autumn Trade Fair 1981, Mr Lau had promised to give him back the distributorshipat the next trade fair was equally incredible. Mr Hu must be a bold person and acted contrary to the instructions of his superiorif, notwithstanding the clear direction of Mr Lau, he chose to give the contract to Bo Man Hong at the æ±éå°äº¤æ. All thesematters lead me to accept the evidence of Mr Hu that it was he who dealt with Chung Who Cheung and his mother when they requestedfor the return of the distributorship. Some Government officials might have intervened in the matter, but I find that the ultimatedecision rested with GDF on the change of distributorship. Chung Who Cheung must have realized that this was the case, otherwise,he would not have taken all the steps of securing supports from his acquaintances.</p>    <p class="heading">Part III</p>    <p class="heading">Passing-off</p>    <p class="heading">(1) The Law</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p157" name="p157">157.</a> Passing-off is concerned with misrepresentations made by one trader which damage the goodwill of another.

Ltd. an exclusive licenceto manufacture and sell the machines in Great Britain, and to use the Trade Mark "Turmix" which OAG had registered in Great Britain.The licence was informally transferred from P. Ltd. to B. Ltd. with the knowledge and consent of OAG. B. Ltd. manufactured and soldthe machines under the name of "Turmix" but neither on the machines nor their containers, nor on their stationery, etc., was thereany reference to OAG. After the licence was terminated, B. Ltd. continued to sell the machine under this name but then commencedto manufacture and sell a machine called "Magimix" which they stated was an improvement on their former machine. OAG then commencedan action alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that B. Ltd. had passed-off their goods as the goods of OAG. Jenkins, L.J. held that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">".... It is, of course, essential to the success of any claim in respect of passing-off based on the use of a given mark or get-upthat the plaintiff should be able to show that the disputed mark or get-up has become by user in this country distinctive of theplaintiff's goods so that the use in relation to any goods of the kind dealt in by the plaintiff or that mark or get-up will be understoodby the trade and the public in this country as meaning that the goods are the plaintiff's goods. The gist of the action is that theplaintiff, by using and making known the mark or get-up in relation to his goods, and thus causing it to be associated or identifiedwith those goods, has acquired a quasi-proprietary right to the exclusive use of the mark or get-up in relation to goods of thatkind, which right is invaded by any person who, by using the same or some deceptively similar mark or get-up in relation to goodsnot of the plaintiff's manufacture, induces customers to buy from him goods not of the plaintiff's manufacture as goods of the plaintiff'smanufacture, thereby diverting to himself orders intended for and rightfully belonging to the plaintiff. But, as appears from 'Kerlyon Trade Marks', 7th Edition, at page 521,</p>        <p class="quote">'.... it is not, however, necessary to show that the customers who knew the goods of the plaintiff's firm by a particular name orget-up knew anything whatever about the plaintiff. It is immaterial that they did not even know his name; for it is sufficient toprove that purchasers of his goods recognized, by the use of the marks in question in connection with them, that they were goodsof a particular class, and to show that such class is, in fact, constituted by his goods.'

X sold the article just as it was made and gotup by the manufacturer. Nothing in the "get-up" of the article as sold by it indicated any association of it or its business withthat article. It sued a company for passing-off when that company manufactured and sold articles of the same kind with a get-up similarto the article supplied by the US manufacturer. The court rejected the sole agent's action, Fletcher Moulton L.J. held that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">".... But in this case it is clear that in no proper sense of the word were these goods ever regarded by the public as, nor were theyin truth, De Trey &amp; Co.'s (i.e. the sole agent's) goods, and there never was any representation on the part of the plaintiffsthat the alleged infringing articles were De Trey &amp; Co.'s goods."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Buckley L.J. held that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">".... The plaintiff's goods need not be goods manufactured by the plaintiff. They may be goods which he purchases, or which he imports,or otherwise acquires, and which he sells under some "get-up" which conveys that they are goods which, whether made, imported, orsold by him, carry with them the advantage of the reputation that the plaintiff's well-known firm are responsible for their qualityor their character."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>A further illustration of this principle is the case of <strong>J. Defries &amp; Sons Ltd. and Another v. Electric and Ordnance Accessories Company Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1906%5d%2023%20RPC%20341" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1906] 23 RPC 341.</a> The Plaintiffs were the American manufacturers of, and their English agents for, the sale of electrical lamps and other accessories.In 1896, an English Syndicate called the "Stewart Electrical Syndicate Ld." began to sell in England lamps made to their order bythe American Company, and sold by them under the name "Stewart Arc Lamps." In 1903 the Syndicate was wound up, and in 1904 the Receiversold its goodwill and its rights to the use of the word "Stewart" in connection with the goods by auction to the Defendants, whocontinued the sale of the goods under that name. The Plaintiffs having commenced to sell similar goods under the name "Stewart" soughtan injunction to restrain the Defendants from selling them under that name; the Defendants thereupon counterclaimed for similar relief.The plaintiff's claim was dismissed, the defendants obtained the injunction against the plaintiff. Joyce J. held that the word "Stewart"as associated with lamps and other wares had only one meaning and that was that those wares were wares vended by the "Stewart" syndicate.The position is to be contrasted with <strong>Hirsch v. Jonas</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1876%5d%203%20Ch%20D%20584" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1876] 3 Ch.

The manufacturer affixed the labelwith his own name as manufacturer to all the boxes so consigned. The plaintiff subsequently discovered that the manufacturer wassupplying cigars of the same description and with the same label to the defendants who were the manufacturer's agent. The plaintiff'sapplication for an interlocutory injunction against the defendants were refused, the Court held that the only representation on thebox was that the cigars were those of the manufacturer.</p>    <p class="heading">(6) Foreign businesses and their representatives</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p166" name="p166">166.</a> Wadlow at para.2.57 stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" A foreign business may have a goodwill in the jurisdiction even though it may not trade here in its own right. It is sufficientthat customers for its goods are to be found here, whether or not the foreign business is in direct contractual relations with them.In particular, if the foreign business is represented by a legally distinct person of whatever capacity then the goodwill will ingeneral belong to the foreign business rather than its local representative provided that the foreign business is recognised as theultimate source of the goods. It is not necessary, or common, for the relationship to be one of agency in the strict legal sense."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... The relevant English goodwill most clearly belongs to the foreign business if the foreign business is in fact predominantly responsiblefor the character or quality of the goods and the English business is held out as representing the foreign one, either expresslyor by implication.</p>        <p class="quote">            On general principles <em>it is unnecessary for the foreign business to be known by name provided its existence is known or assumed. The most important factorwould appear to be the state of the public mind, so that if the public attributes the goods to the foreign business then it may notmatter that the foreign business does not manufacture them, and may exercise less control over the local business or the goods themselvesthan the public may suppose</em>." (<em>emphasis added</em>)</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(7) Importers, dealers and retailers</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p167" name="p167">167.</a> Wadlow at para.2.60 stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" It is possible for a business which imports to have a goodwill in its capacity as an importer, and likewise for any business whichis known to obtain its goods from third parties to have a goodwill which reflects public trust in its ability to select or handlegoods to a particular standard. This goodwill can co-exist with the goodwill of another business such as that of a manufacturer inthe sense that the public may prefer goods manufactured by A and imported or otherwise handled by B to goods known to be manufacturedby A but handled by another. This, however, is rare."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(8) Licensor and licensee</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p168" name="p168">168.</a> If a valid licence of a name or mark is in operation, then the goodwill in respect of the business so carried on accrues to the licensorrather than to the licensee : Wadlow para.2.62. The licensee acquires no interest in the name or mark, and must cease using it ontermination of the licence. Provided the licence is a valid one, it does not matter that the licensee may be held out as the providerof the goods in question, and may in fact be primarily responsible for their character or quality.</p>    <p class="heading">Ownership of the Goodwill of Shiwan Mijiu and Super Mellow Mijiu</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p169" name="p169">169.</a> There is no dispute between the parties that goodwill subsists in the Pearl River Bridge Shiwan Mijiu and the Super Mellow Mijiuwhich was acquired by years of sale and marketing. There is a likelihood of confusion among the purchasing public if the same labelsare to be used but with the different trade marks. There is likely to be damage occasioned to the goodwill and reputation by thelikelihood of confusion. The real dispute is on the ownership of the goodwill.</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Economic structure</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p170" name="p170">170.</a> The Plaintiffs' case is that GDF has the goodwill to the Shiwan Mijiu and the Super Mellow Mijiu. The Defendants disputed this andcontended that Foshan Foods was instrumental in obtaining the wine from the Shiwan Brewery and selling them to Hong Kong throughthe Hong Kong distributors. Both parties have called evidence on the economic structure of the Mainland during the planned economyand the period afterwards. The Plaintiffs' evidence came from Mr Hu and Mr Lor while the Defendants' evidence came from Mr Yuan,and to a certain extent from Mr Cheung Loy Chun. The relevance of the evidence is to establish the control of GDF over Foshan Foodsand hence over the two wine resulting in GDF having the goodwill of the two wine.

It would be dangerous and confusingto go into their evidence without a clear framework of the relationship of the parties. The starting point is to look at the constitutionsof these enterprises.

It would be odd that the imposition of the nameof GDF in the full title of the sub-branches would carry no significant meaning. Under Article 1, the sub-branch was clearly describedas GDF's subordinate company. Although the sub-branches were legal entities and independent accounting units, Article 5 clearly statedthat they were subject to the administrative leadership and management of the local Foreign Trade Bureau, while the business leadershipbelonged to that of GDF. The food export functions of the sub-branches under Clause 6(1) of the Articles were clearly subject tothe earlier Article 5 which dealt with the business leadership of GDF. Clause 13 stated that the sub-branches' finance was peggedto GDF and had to pay profit to GDF and loss would be reimbursed from GDF.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p176" name="p176">176.</a> In my view the Standard Articles formalized the position of the parties in the past.

The name of Foshan Foods was onlychanged in 1988. Mr Yuan explained that in 1996 when Foshan Foods upgraded its record office, the staff in charge was not aware ofthe history of Foshan Foods and had wrongly put down "February 1987" on the New Articles.</p>    <p class="heading">(10) Foshan Foods using the Standard Articles</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p181" name="p181">181.</a> I find Foshan Foods had been using the Standard Articles until the unpegging of the financial and planning pegs. It could not haveused either the Handwritten Articles or the New Articles before that time. In the 1988 business registration of Foshan Foods lodgedwith the å»£æ±çå°å¤ç¶æ¿è²¿æå§å¡æ, it was clearly stated that the approved articles of association was that of the StandardArticles. The 1988 business registration certificate, apart from referring to the business leadership of GDF also referred to thatof GCO. This does not lessen the control of GDF over Foshan Foods. GDF was involved with foodstuffs while GCO was involved with cerealand oil. The leadership of these two enterprises over Foshan Foods was not mutually exclusive.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p182" name="p182">182.</a> Once this basic premises is ascertained, then the evidence regarding the economic structure of the Mainland will fall into place.The evidence points towards one conclusion only, namely the goodwill of the two wine established in Hong Kong through these yearsbelongs to GDF.</p>    <p class="heading">(11) Administrative role of Foshan Foods</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p183" name="p183">183.</a> Mr Yuan emphasized the importance of the status of Foshan Foods by referring to the administrative functions it exercised over othersub-branch companies in the area. There is no doubt at some period of time Foshan Foods was responsible for the management and coordinationof some sub-branch companies in the Foshan area. These included å°å±±ï¼éå¹³ï¼æ©å¹³ï¼æéï¼ç æµ·ï¼æ°æï¼æ±éï¼ä¸­å±±ï¼é å¾·ï¼é¶´å±±ï¼åæµ·ï¼ä¸æ°´and ä½å±±å·¿. At some stage, these companies also reported their finance and planning to Foshan Foods. Mr Yuan said that the reasonwhy Foshan Foods was established was because the Foshan area had a large export of livestocks and agricultural products to Hong Kongand Macao and an organ was required to coordinate and manage these activities.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p184" name="p184">184.</a> Mr Yuan said that the decision to form Foshan Foods was not by GDF but by the å»£æ±çå°å¤è²¿æå±. The approval of å»£æ±çå°å¤è²¿æå±mightbe required but clearly GDF had played an important role in Foshan Foods' formation, otherwise GDF would not have been specifiedin the document of 21st June 1961 to be its business leader.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p185" name="p185">185.</a> In paragraph 2 of the document of 21st June 1961, it is stated that the sub-branch companies could not carry out foreign trade activities.Mr Yuan said that by 1975 when he joined Foshan Foods, the sub-branch companies had already carried out export activities. Apartfrom this change, there is no evidence that there was a fundamental change in the status of Foshan Foods towards GDF.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p186" name="p186">186.</a> It was suggested that in the business registration certificate of GDF of 16th April 1982, the listed subsidiary units of GDF didnot include Foshan Foods. Also GDF's own Articles referred only to its subsidiary units. From the evidence it is clear that GDF hadits own subsidiary companies, which did not include Foshan Foods. But at the same time Foshan Foods was a sub-branch company of GDFunder the hierarchy of the foreign trade enterprises. This is clear from the constitutional documents. It is a bold argument thatbecause Foshan Foods was not a subsidiary of GDF, it was accordingly not a sub-branch company of GDF.</p>    <p class="heading">(12) GDF : business leadership</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p187" name="p187">187.</a> Mr Yuan said that Foshan Foods is a State enterprise. Before 1988, it was a central enterprise (ä¸­å¤®ä¼æ¥­), like CNC and GDF.After 1988, Foshan Foods became a local enterprise (å°æ¹ä¼æ¥­). In my view, these descriptions of the nature of these companiesare not helpful and do not advance the Defendants' case on the role of the enterprises.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p188" name="p188">188.</a> Mr Yuan said in his evidence in chief that in relation to the sub-branches, GDF exercised administrative management only. It didnot exercise any business management over them. In cross-examination, he conceded that the administrative management by GDF was businessin nature. In fact the very example given by Mr Yuan on the administrative management of GDF, namely, the coordination of the competinginterest of the various sub-branches wishing to export the same product must be in the nature of the business operation of the exporttrade. In any event, what Mr Yuan said about the administrative management of GDF on Foshan Foods and other sub-branches cannot becorrect. If it was merely exercising an administrative function, it would be superfluous to involve the local authorities such asthe local ç¶è²¿é¨, è¨åå§å¡æ in the foreign trade. In terms of the actual business activities, GDF might carry out very fewtrading activities on its own, the reality is that GDF's trading activities were executed by the sub-branches including Foshan Foods.The Shiwan Mijiu and the Super Mellow Mijiu are the best examples of the business leadership of GDF over Foshan Foods.</p>    <p class="heading">(13) Other sub-branches</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p189" name="p189">189.</a> Mr Yuan further denied that GDF set up other sub-branches. He said the setting up of the sub-branch companies was decided by thelocal authorities and it was not the wish of GDF to have these companies established. He gave the example of Zhongshan Foods (ä¸­å±±æ¯å¬å¸)which was later divided into four sub-branches. This was against the wish of GDF, but, nonetheless, the local authorities approvedthe setting up of the four sub-branch companies. Another example was the Ting Woo Company (é¼æ¹æ¯å¬å¸). GDF was against thesetting up of this company, but again the local authorities asked the Provincial Government to set up this company. Mr Yuan saidthat Foshan Foods assisted in the setting up of the sub-branch companies by sending out working teams there and by organizing thefirst exports from these companies.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p190" name="p190">190.</a> In respect of the examples given by Mr Yuan on the setting up of sub-branches which GDF disapproved, he really was not in a positionto give evidence as to what had actually transpired in the setting up of these companies. Afterall, witnesses from GDF were not cross-examinedon those matters. I accept Mr Hu's evidence that GDF established the sub-branch companies.</p>    <p class="heading">(14) Planning peg</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p191" name="p191">191.</a> The Plaintiffs' case is that until 1988 business plans were transmitted from CNC to GDF which in turn transmitted the plans to thesub-branch companies in the Guangdong Province. From 1988 until 1993, GDF continued to transmit plans to the sub-branches. Theseplans had to be complied with by the sub-branch companies.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p192" name="p192">192.</a> Mr Yuan said that parallel to the hierarchy of enterprises engaged in foreign trade was a line of government bodies dealing withforeign trade and planning. These bodies existed from the local area to the provincial level and onto the central level. The economicplans were prepared by the planning unit of the government. Before the plans were transmitted from above, they were firstly formulatedfrom below and reported to a higher level. In other words, the sub-branch companies in the counties and towns (å·¿ç¸£å¬å¸) would,first of all, formulate their purchase and export plans together with the planning unit (è¨åå§å¡æ) and the foreign trade bureau(å¤è²¿å±) in that particular level of government. The planning unit would then refer the plan higher to the area level. The tworelevant units of that level would discuss the plans with Foshan Foods. After the plans had been formulated, they would be referredto the provincial level. At the provincial level, the two similar units would discuss the plans with GDF. After the plans were discussed,they would be referred to the Central Government where the planning unit, the foreign trade unit and CNC would discuss and approveof the plans.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p193" name="p193">193.</a> CNC would transmit the plan to GDF which would in turn transmit the plans to the various sub-branch companies. At the same time,the central foreign trade unit would transmit the plans to the same unit on the provincial level which in turn would transmit themto the same unit in the local area. The foreign trade unit would also transmit the plans to the enterprises engaged in foreign tradein the hierarchy. Thus Foshan Foods received plans from the Foshan Area Foreign Trade Bureau (ä½å±±å°åå¤è²¿å±). Mr Yuan saidthat the plans transmitted to Foshan Foods by this unit was in the nature of commands (æä»¤æ§) which must be complied with. MrYuan produced a number of plans transmitted to Foshan Foods by the Foshan Foreign Trade Bureau.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p194" name="p194">194.</a> Mr Yuan disagreed with Mr Hu's comment that GDF could decide whether to transmit the plans to Foshan Foods or not. Mr Yuan said thatin the planned economy, plans were decided by the planning authority and were based on the history and quantity of production ofthe area. GDF's plans were to meet (éæ¥) the plans of the planning authority. Thus it was wrong for GDF to say it could "give"or "not to give" the plans to Foshan Foods. The documents also showed that GDF transmitted the plans to the sub-branches from theplans it received from above.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p195" name="p195">195.</a> Mr Yuan said that Foshan Foods had to co-ordinate the activities of the companies under its management so that the plans could bemet (éæ¥). Mr Yuan said that the plans transmitted by the foreign trade bureau to the sub-branch companies were purchase plansand export plans, whereas GDF only transmitted the export plans to the sub-branches. The two plans, however, matched with each other.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p196" name="p196">196.</a> Evidence was given of "vertical control or management" (æ¢æ¢ç®¡ç), i.e. control of a lower unit by a higher level unit in a verticalhierarchy and "horizontal management or control" (å¡å¡ç®¡ç). An example of the latter is the control and management of FoshanFoods by the Foshan Foreign Trade Bureau. Another concept that was discussed was double track transmission of plans to the lowerunits (éè»ä¸é).</p>    <p class="heading">(15) Parallel transmission of plans</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p197" name="p197">197.</a> In my view, under the economic structure of the Mainland during the planned economy, the economic plans were transmitted from twolines. In relation to the CNC line of companies, they came from CNC to GDF and then to the various sub-branch companies. At the sametime the local authorities also provided the plans to the sub-branch companies. In my view, the Defendants' case is not advancedany further by saying the plans transmitted from the local government were more important than those from CNC and GDF. These twolines of transmission were part of the system at that time. The Defendants admitted that the two plans were consistent and GDF hadthe right to adjust the plan in a minor manner (å¾®èª¿). Likewise the reference in some of GDF's plans to plans transmitted fromthe provincial planning unit is not an indication that there was lesser control by GDF on the sub-branch companies.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p198" name="p198">198.</a> In any event, according to the document entitled "ä½å±±è¡ç½²å¤è²¿å±æä»¶" dated 23rd January 1985, it was stated that the plantransmitted from the province to Foshan City was a plan in the nature of instructions ("æå°æ§è¨å"). According to Mr Yuan,in respect of these plans, the units should try their best to complete the plan but it was not mandatory to do so. Even if this documentwas only intended to be used from 1988 onwards when the contract system was introduced, it showed that plans from the local governmentswere instructive in nature only. The actual carrying out of the business activities was obviously done by the CNC line of companies.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p199" name="p199">199.</a> The local authorities no doubt also played a role in the administration of Foshan Foods because the personnel working in Foshan Foodswere appointed by the Foshan area local authorities and GDF had no right to remove them. But it is clear from the Standard Articlesthe Foshan Foreign Trade Bureau was exercising administrative leadership of Foshan Foods. This unit also had to ensure that FoshanFoods in performing the export plan was able to purchase (æ¶è³¼) the necessary products from the local area in accordance with thepurchase plan. This does not in any way detract from the fact that GDF was the business leader of Foshan Foods during the plannedeconomy. What is more important is that trading loss of Foshan Foods was reimbursed by CNC through GDF. The local authorities werenot responsible to reimburse Foshan Foods of the trading loss. Mr Yuan was reluctant to agree that the plans formulated by FoshanFoods would have to be transmitted to GDF. It is clear that such plans would have to be transmitted. This is clear from the documententitled : "å°å¤è²¿æä¼æ¥­åºæ¬æ¥­å ç»ä¸æè¨å¶åº¦ : ç¶è²¿é¨ãè²¡æ¿é¨å¶å®ä¸ä¹ä¹Îå¹´ä¸æ". The sub-branchcompanies have to inform GDF the raw materials they would require in order to complete the purchase plan. This is another indicationthat Foshan Foods was pegged to GDF in terms of planning and subject to its control.</p>    <p class="heading">(16) Financial peg</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p200" name="p200">200.</a> Mr Yuan said that the system from the early stage of the planned economy until 1988 was that of çµ±æ¶çµ±æ¯ï¼çµ±è² çè§. Thismeans that profit earned by the sub-branches would be reported to CNC and whatever loss it incurred would be reimbursed from CNC.From 1988 to 1990, the system was one of contract system. This means the provincial governments were required to fulfill the targetof foreign currency earning with the Central Government. To achieve this goal, GDF, like other State business enterprises in theprovince, had to fulfill a target of foreign currency earnings for the provincial government. GDF would sub-contract the task tothe various sub-branches. The first round of contract system was in 1988, 1989 and 1990. The second stage of the contract systemoccurred in 1991 and 1992. In January 1993, the sub-branches were unpegged financially from GDF.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p201" name="p201">201.</a> Mr Yuan disagreed that Foshan Foods was pegged to GDF in terms of finance (and also planning). He said that this is contrary to theState Council Document of 1988, which stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... ååé¢æ±ºå®å¨é¢æ¨è¡å°å¤è²¿ææ¿åç¶çè²¬ä»»å¶ï¼é²ä¸æ­¥å å¿«åæ·±åå°å¤è²¿æé«å¶æ¹é©ã</p>        <p class="quote">            å å¿«åæ·±åå°å¤è²¿æé«å¶æ¹é©çåºæ¬å§å®¹æ¯ï¼å¨é¢æ¨è¡å°å¤è²¿ææ¿åç¶çè²¬ä»»å¶ï¼ä¸»è¦ç±åçãèªæ²»åãç´è½å¸ãè¨åå®åå¸äººæ°æ¿åºï¼ä»¥ä¸ç°¡ç¨±åå°æ¹ï¼ååå®¶æ¿ååºå£æ¶å¯åºæ¸ãä¸ç¹³å¤å¯é¡åº¦åºæ¸ãåºå£æ¶å¯åºæ¸å§äººæ°å¹£è£è²¼åºæ¸ãå¤å¯é¡åº¦æå¸³æ¸é¡ï¼è¶éåºå£æ¶å¯åºæ¸çå¤å¯æ¶å¥å¯¦è¡åæãèªè² çè§ï¼å°æ¸ååç±å¤è²¿åå·¥è²¿é²åºå£ç¸½å¬å¸æ¿åä¸¦çµ±ä¸ç¶çï¼ä¸ä¸æ¾çé¨åå·¥è²¿ç¸½å¬å¸ä»ç±å¶æ¿åç¶çãåå¤è²¿é²åºå£ç¸½å¬å¸åé¨åå·¥è²¿é²åºå£ç¸½å¬å¸çå°æ¹åæ¯æ©æ§ï¼ç¶çåå®¶çµ±ä¸ç¶çåºå£ååçæéä¼æ¥­é¤å¤ï¼èç¸½å¬å¸è«éï¼ä½çºä¼æ¥­æ³äººï¼ä¸æ¾å°æ¹ç®¡çï¼è²¡åä¸èå°æ¹è²¡æ¿æéã"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p202" name="p202">202.</a> Mr Yuan said that from 1988 onwards, the profit and loss of Foshan Foods was a matter for Foshan Foods, and GDF could not give itany money since each of them were responsible for its own operation. Mr Yuan said that under the contract system, the policy wasè¶è§ä¸è£ãæ¸è§çç¨. In other words loss that exceeded the target would not be reimbursed while the enterprise could retainprofit for its business operation. In the first year of the contract system, Foshan Foods had actually incurred a loss of $300,000and this amount was not reimbursed. It had to bear this loss itself.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p203" name="p203">203.</a> The statement by Mr Yuan that Foshan Foods was not pegged to GDF financially and in terms of planning was a bold one. It certainlywas incorrect in respect of the situation before 1988. Even after 1988, I find that Foshan Foods was still pegged to GDF financiallyand in terms of planning. What had changed from 1988 until 1993 was that instead of GDF being responsible to CNC, it became responsibleto the provincial authorities. I do not accept Mr Yuan's evidence that from 1988 to 1993, the situation had changed so drasticallythat what had taken place in the past in terms of financial and planning peg was completely removed. On the contrary, the documentdated 15th April 1993 from å»£æ±çå°å¤ç¶æ¿è²¿æå§å¡æ and å»£æ±çè¨åå§å¡æ, stated that it was only from 1st January1994 that the planning peg of GDF and the sub-branches were severed.

From that time onwards, the enterpriseshad to adopt four practices, namely : "èªä¸»ç¶ç" (independent trading), "èªè² çè§" (self-responsible for profit and loss),"èªæç´æ" (self-control) and "èªæç¼å±" (self-development). The allegation of Foshan Foods not being reimbursed the sumof $300,000 was something not put to the Plaintiffs' witnesses. This may well be an isolated incident and the occurrence does notsupport Mr Yuan's suggestion that from 1988 to 1993, Foshan Foods was financially and in terms of planning independent from GDF.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p206" name="p206">206.</a> The Defendants further argued that the pegging of Foshan Foods to GDF did not mean that GDF owned the goodwill to the two wine. Idisagree. The financial pegging of Foshan Foods to GDF, viewed in the context that Foshan Foods was the executing unit of GDF, mustbe the strongest indication that GDF owned the goodwill of the two wine.</p>    <p class="heading">(17) Trading loss</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p207" name="p207">207.</a> One prominent feature of the export of foodstuffs from the Mainland up to 1993 is the question of loss which would be invariablyincurred. The foreign trade enterprises were given targets such as "å¤æ»ææ¨", "ææ»ææ¬" and "è§æææ¨". The "å¤æ»ææ½"was the foreign income target that the enterprises had to achieve for that year. It was based on US dollar. The "ææ»ææ¬" wasalso in US dollar. Because of the use of different exchange rates, a loss would arise by reason of the difference between "ææ»ææ¬"and the converted income. The State would reimburse the enterprise for the loss. The figure chosen for the "ææ»ææ¬" would havea direct effect on the loss sustained by an enterprise. When asked whether the "ææ»ææ¬" was decided by GDF, Mr Yuan could onlysay that the decision was based on the historical performance of a product, the condition of trade, the market condition and theimport price.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p208" name="p208">208.</a> Mr Yuan denied that the "è§æææ¨" was allotted by GDF to the sub-branch. He said that the "è§æææ¨" was based on reportssubmitted to GDF by the sub-branches. He further denied that GDF audited the permitted level of loss. He said that the ä¸­å¤®ä¼æ¥­å¯©è¨çµ(Central Enterprises Auditing Unit) carried out the audit.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p209" name="p209">209.</a> Although the "ææ»ææ¨" and the "è§æææ¨" had to be decided on a rational basis, the fundamental question is that the figureshad to be decided, and the task was vested with GDF. This is another illustration of the leading role and the control of GDF towardsFoshan Foods.</p>    <p class="heading">(18) Reimbursement of trading loss</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p210" name="p210">210.</a> Mr Hu said that GDF could decide how much to reimburse the branch companies which had suffered trading loss. As have been seen earliertrading loss would inevitably incur in the export trade in the planned economy. Mr Yuan said that the total amount of reimbursementtransmitted from CNC was based on the loss incurred by the sub-branches. The reimbursement would be based on the actual loss incurredby the branch companies. GDF did not have the power to decide how much reimbursement would be given to them. Mr Yuan, however, agreedthat if GDF managed to obtain more reimbursement from CNC, then it could use the excess to assist those companies which were in financialdifficulties.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p211" name="p211">211.</a> In terms of Clause 13 of the Standard Articles, Mr Yuan said that the income received by the export companies would be transmittedto CNC. The profit and loss belonged to CNC. The role of GDF was to coordinate the reports of the sub-branches and then report toCNC. CNC would then transmit the money to GDF and GCO. The money did not belong to GDF.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p212" name="p212">212.</a> The important issue in this regard is that in the foreign trade hierarchy, GDF was directly responsible to deal with the tradingloss of Foshan Foods. This confirmed the subordinate role of Foshan Foods in the economic structure of export trade and the controlof GDF over Foshan Foods.</p>    <p class="heading">(19) Loans</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p213" name="p213">213.</a> Mr Yuan said that under the planned economy, money required for trading was provided to Foshan Foods in two ways : First by way ofloan from the Central Government. This was the State's support of foreign trade, the money would be transmitted from the Bank ofChina in Beijing to its branch in Foshan and Foshan Foods would borrow from the bank. The second was also the State's assistanceof export trade. Money and raw material would be supplied from CNC to GDF to Foshan Foods.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p214" name="p214">214.</a> Mr Yuan disagreed with Mr Hu's evidence that GDF and the bank agreed on the limit of the loans that might be obtained by the sub-branches.Mr Yuan said that the foreign trade bureau had a foreign trade capital and it was allotted to the Bank of China in Guangdong whichin turn allotted a portion of the capital to each area. The amount to be lent to Foshan Foods was based on the trading activitiesof Foshan Foods.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p215" name="p215">215.</a> I accept Mr Hu's evidence that GDF in fact discussed with the bank on the limit of the loans to be allowed to the sub-branches. MrYuan was certainly not in a position to give evidence on the allotments of loans between GDF and the bank.</p>    <p class="heading">(20) Export quota</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p216" name="p216">216.</a> Mr Yuan disputed Mr Hu's evidence that any export that exceeded or outside the plan must have the approval of GDF first. Mr Yuansaid that if the activities were carried out in accordance with the plan, GDF could not interfere with Foshan Foods. In relationto exports that would exceed the plan, Foshan Foods would make the request to the Quota Office of the Guangdong Foreign Trade Bureau("the Quota Office") (çå¤è²¿å±éé¡è¾¦å¬å®¤). If there was an available quota, this office would approve the application. Ifnot, the matter would be referred to the Guangdong Office of the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the Central Government (ç¶è²¿è¾¦é§å»£å·ç¹æ´¾è¾¦å¬å®¤).Mr Yuan said that the Quota Office was based in the office of GDF and Mr Hu had mistaken that the authority to grant the extra quotalied with GDF. Mr Yuan, however, accepted that Foshan Foods would first approach GDF to see if the quota could be given.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p217" name="p217">217.</a> Mr Yuan said that the function of GFD was to manage and coordinate, but it could not disallow Foshan Foods from engaging in exportactivities. An example he gave was of pigs. That was a profitable export and every coastal companies were competing to export andthe role of GDF was to carry out minor co-ordination (å¾®èª¿). It was the Quota Office which adjusted the competitive requests ofthe various sub-branches.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p218" name="p218">218.</a> Mr Yuan also disputed Mr Hu's evidence that GDF could refuse Foshan Foods from exporting rice wine. He said that under the plannedeconomy, if GDF refused, Foshan Foods could go to CNC because the export of rice wine was Foshan Foods' traditional export.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p219" name="p219">219.</a> One handicap faced by Mr Yuan is his position in the economic structure. He was, after all, only concerned with the activities inthe Foshan area. The Foshan area is only part of the Guangdong province. Without a doubt, because of its strategic position in thePearl River Delta, Foshan is blessed with fertile soil and it produces an abundance of agricultural, fishery and poultry products.It has been described as é­ç±³ä¹é (the place of fish and rice). Foshan Foods also plays a very important role in the food exportsfrom the Guangdong province. However, it remains the case that Mr Yuan is unable to give evidence on the role of GDF on the provinciallevel. In any event, even based on Mr Yuan's own evidence, if GDF was authorised to co-ordinate the activities of the sub-branchcompanies in the whole of the province, then clearly it had to adjust their competitive claims resulting in their not being ableto export as much as they liked. The Shiwan Mijiu is clearly an example that GDF could discontinue the export of a particular product.Furthermore, there were certain products the sub-branches could not export, for example, sugar. They were handled exclusively byGDF. This re-affirmed the dominant position of GDF.</p>    <p class="heading">(21) Packagings/Raw materials/distributor/price</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p220" name="p220">220.</a> Although the packaging for the products were provided by GDF to the sub-branches, they were ultimately provided by CNC. Likewise,although the raw materials were provided by GDF to the sub-branches, ultimately the raw materials were provided by CNC. This is shownin a document entitled : ãçé£åé²åºå£å¬å¸ç³»çµ±å·¥æ¥­é£åææèª¿æ¥ç®¡çæ ¸é·çµç®æ«è¡è¾¦æ³ã (Bundle D10/24)in which it was stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" 2. çå¬å¸æ ¹æçå¤è²¿å±ä¸éçæ¶è³¼è¨åãæä¸ç´ä¸æ¥çåææï¼åæåæ¹ä¸èª¿çµ¦åæ¯å¬å¸ãçãæ¯å¬å¸åæå»ºç«åææç¼ï¼æ¶ç»è¨å¸³ç®ï¼å®ææ ¸å°ã"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p221" name="p221">221.</a> In relation to the purchase of raw material for the production of rice wine, Mr Yuan stated that Foshan Foods had to pay for thepurchase. Based on the result of export, Foshan Foods would be allotted a foreign currency quota (å¤æ»é¡åº¦), the raw materialwas purchased by the use of this quota, although the purchase price was paid by way of Reminbi. An illustration was the contractfor the sale of rice between åæµ·ç¸£ç³§æ²¹é£åå¬å¸ and GDF and Foshan Foods dated 11th December 1980 (Bundle D11/395).</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p222" name="p222">222.</a> I find that as a general rule, the raw material and packagings were provided by GDF to the branch companies. This again reflectsthe importance of GDF in this regard. The raw material and packaging of course came from CNC but it was GDF which co-ordinated theallocation of the materials. There might be circumstances in which raw materials had to be acquired other than from CNC. I find thisto be the exception rather than the rule. Even in such a situation, GDF was still a party to the purchase of the raw material asillustrated by the contract dated 11th December 1980.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p223" name="p223">223.</a> Mr Yuan said that decisions on the distributor, price and packaging were reached after discussions by GDF, Foshan Foods and GDF'sagent in Hong Kong, namely, either Wu Fung Hong or Guangnam Hong. Wu Fung Hong formerly represented GDF as its agent in Hong Kong,later on Guangnam Hong took over. It represents the interest of the Guangdong Provincial Government in Hong Kong. Wu Fung Hong isa State organisation and wielded considerable power but again, Mr Yuan is not in a position to tell the role of GDF in its dealingswith these two organisations. Despite his initial position, he conceded that GDF had to be consulted on the appointment of distributors.I find that GDF decided on the distributors, price and labels for the two wine. No doubt GDF would take heed of the views of theagents, after all, they were more familiar with the market situation in Hong Kong, but the final decision on these matters clearlylaid with GDF. The change of distributorship of the Super Mellow Mijiu initially from Tung Fook to Bo Man Hong then later to bothof them was clearly the best illustration of GDF's authority in this regard. One can find a further example of the deciding roleof GDF in the appointment of Hong Kong Rice Merchants Enterprises Co. Ltd. and Tai Wah Chinese Sauce Co. Ltd. as distributors insoy sauce : Notice dated 29th October 1981.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p224" name="p224">224.</a> By a letter dated 25th April 1984 Bo Man Hong announced that it was appointed by CNC, GDF and Foshan Foods as the distributor ofé³å¹´çå°ç. Mr Tang S.C. submitted that this shows Bo Man Hong recognized it was the distributor of Foshan Foods and this confirmsthe leading role of Foshan Foods in the export trade. In my view, the status of Foshan Foods can only be determined by referenceto the constitutional documents and the activities that are outlined in this part of the judgment. What Bo Man Hong said cannot bedeterminative of the issue. In any event, the letter did not refer exclusively to Foshan Foods.</p>    <p class="heading">(22) Assets</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p225" name="p225">225.</a> Mr Hu had at one stage categorically stated that the assets of Foshan Foods belonged to GDF. Mr Yuan said that before 1988, the assetsof Foshan Foods and GDF belonged to CNC but he vehemently denied that GDF owned the assets of Foshan Foods.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p226" name="p226">226.</a> It is a difficult question as to who owned the assets of Foshan Foods and GDF. It is not appropriate to make a general ruling aboutthe ownership of the different types of assets of these two companies. In any event it is not necessary to do so for the purposeof this case. Passing-off is concerned with the question of goodwill, which is a form of legal property. The point is best understoodby reference to Wadlow at para. 2.05 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" Although the passages cited above speak in terms of damage being caused either to the plaintiff's business or to his goodwill, thetwo are not strictly speaking comparable. Goodwill is undoubtedly legal property and its nature is reasonably well understood. Abusiness, however, is something rather broader and would not normally be thought of as a form of property at all. This may accountfor Lord Parker's caution in accepting that passing-off necessarily protects a proprietary right. English law has tended to understandpassing-off primarily in terms of damage to goodwill, partly because goodwill has not always been distinguished from the plaintiff'sreputation in the indicia taken by the defendant.</p>        <p class="quote">            It is sometimes said that goodwill itself is the essential basis of the action for passing-off. This is an attractivepoint of view. First, it deals with the question of why damages for passing-off are not recoverable by every business in the chainof distribution from manufacturer to retailer. In general, only one business in the chain is likely to have any relevant goodwillwith the consuming public and it is only that business which can complain of passing-off. However, if damage to business generallywere sufficient, then each party from manufacturer to retailer would apparently be able to sue, since an order lost is a loss toall. Secondly, goodwill is undoubtedly a form of legal property. It has a clearly understood meaning, and is particularly liableto be damaged by the misrepresentations recognised in passing-off. The concept of 'business' is wide and indeterminate in comparison."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In so far as the goodwill of these two wine is concerned, it belonged to GDF. The business activities of these two wine were carriedout by GDF through Foshan Foods. The goodwill of the two wine did not belong to CNC because from 1988 onwards, GDF was no longerpegged to CNC and the goodwill acquired from 1988 onwards belonged to GDF. Even before 1988, the goodwill of the two wine did notbelong to CNC because the actual business of the two wine was controlled by GDF. I will deal with the position of Shiwan Breweryand Tung Fook (1982) in the later part of the judgment.</p>    <p class="heading">(23) Meaning of "èªçåºå£<em>" (self-trading export)</em></p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p227" name="p227">227.</a> The Defendants relied on the term of "èªçåºå£" (self-trading export) to prove that Foshan Foods had the right to export on itsown. This term appeared in many documents including the accounts and reports from Foshan Foods to GDF and from GDF's reports to CNC.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p228" name="p228">228.</a> I accept the evidence of Mr Lor on the meaning of this term. Mr Lor said that this item had two meanings. First, it was an item relatingto statistics and accounting and second it was a method of trade. On the first aspect, it is clear from the document entitled "å°å¤è²¿æä¼æ¥­åºæ¬æ¥­åçµ±ä¸æè¨å¶åº¦: ç¶è²¿é¨ãè²¡æ¿é¨å¶å®ä¸ä¹ä¹Îå¹´ä¸æ", the term "èªçåºå£" was an accounting term. This was one of the items inthe standard form financial report. On the second aspect, both GDF and the sub-branch companies had the right of "èªçåºå£" (self-tradingexport). The term means that GDF or the sub-branches would purchase the products, export them and receive payment for the sale. However,the difference between GDF and the sub-branches in this aspect is that while GDF could carry out this activity on its own, the self-tradingexport of the sub-branches was under the plan transmitted by GDF to the sub-branches and the control of GDF. The sub-branches mustaccount the profit and loss of such activities to GDF which would reimburse the loss to the sub-branches. As the Shiwan Mijiu andthe Super Mellow Mijiu were produced in the locality of Foshan Foods, they were Foshan Foods' self-trading export under the planstransmitted by GDF. It is incorrect simply to refer to the literal meaning of the term and conclude that Foshan Foods was engagedin independent trading activities.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p229" name="p229">229.</a> Foshan Foods' right of self-trading export was confined to Hong Kong and Macau. It had no right to "é æ´èªçåºå£" (overseastrade). In such circumstances, Foshan Foods would transfer the goods to GDF for export. Two methods were adopted in this respect.The first method was by way of "èª¿æ¥åºå£". Mr Lor said that in relation to "èª¿æ¥åºå£", there was no question of loss sustainedby the sub-branch companies, the principle at that time was that èª¿æ¥å®ä½ä¸èä¸è³º, i.e. no loss or gain would be attributedto the unit which transferred the goods. Foshan Foods would transfer the products to GDF and receive payment of the price of thegoods and expenses. GDF would then export the goods and receive the payment for the goods. The profit and loss would be treated asthat of GDF . The second method was called "ä»£çåºå£". The sub-branches would transfer the products to GDF. After GDF had exportedthe goods and received the earning, it would account the foreign currency quota ("å¤å¯é¡åº¦") to the sub-branches so that theycould complete the plans. In relation to overseas trade, the method initially adopted was the "èª¿æ¥åºå£", then later the "ä»£çåºå£".Mr Lor said that while he was at the Processed Food Section, the second method, namely "ä»£çåºå£" was already adopted. GDF merelyrecovered the disbursements, such as expenses incurred in telexes, from the sub-branches when it handled the overseas trade for them.</p>    <p>Mr Lor said that there were practical differences between these two methods but ultimately at the end of the year, irrespective ofwhat method was adopted, the accounts would be that of GDF's accounts. Where products had been transferred (èª¿æ¥) to GDF, it wouldbe GDF's self-trading export because GDF would receive the foreign currency from the export. As to the question whether it was GDF'sself-trading export in relation to the second method of "ä»£çåºå£", Mr Lor explained that it would depend on who received theprice in foreign currency. Whoever received the price would be engaged in self-trading export. Mr Lor disagreed that if the "èª¿æ¥"or the "ä»£çåºå£" was adopted, the business would be treated as the self-trading export of the sub-branches.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p230" name="p230">230.</a> I accept Mr Lor's evidence. One fundamental principle that has to be borne in mind is that until 1993, with the exception of Guangzhou,GDF was the only entity in Guangdong which could carry out trade in foodstuff with foreign traders. This covered all overseas marketsincluding Hong Kong and Macau. Guangzhou was an exception because since the 1980s it became a specially listed city with direct linksto Beijing (å®ååå¸) and was severed from GDF. In my view, it would be odd under the planned economy, notwithstanding the controlby the State on exports, the coastal companies such as Foshan Foods could engage in export activities independent of any restrictionand control. It is clear from the constitution documents of Foshan Foods that ever since 1961, there was no reference to any independentself-trading right. The foreign trade activities of Foshan Foods was clearly within the responsibilities given to it by GDF. As atrading arm or executing unit of GDF, it would be natural for Foshan Foods to be given export right so that, for example, customrequirements could be met. This, however, does not mean that the export activities of Foshan Foods was carried out independentlyand distinct from its responsibility as a trading arm of GDF.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p231" name="p231">231.</a> Mr Tang S.C. argued that the distinction between Foshan Foods being entitled to deal with the Hong Kong and Macau market and GDFhandling all other overseas markets showed that Foshan Foods had the independent trading right. He referred to GDF's ç®¡çå¶åº¦(è¾¦æ³å¯ç·¨) at p. 62 which stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"ä¸ãå£å²¸ç¶çç®¡ç</p>        <p class="quote">ååç¶çåå·¥ï¼æåæç¶çåå·¥ä¸è®ãå¢å ç¾æç¶çç¯åä»¥å¤çåååç¨®ï¼è¦å ±ç¶çå¬å¸åæã</p>        <p class="quote">            å£å²¸åå·¥ï¼å¨ä¸ç´æªææ°è¦å®åï¼ä»ç¶­æåè¦å®ä¸è®ãå³ï¼æ±é ­å¬å¸å¯å°æ¸¯æ¾³ãæ°é¦¬å©ãé æ´åºå£ï¼å»£å·ãæ±éå¬å¸å¯å°æ¸¯æ¾³ãæ°é¦¬å©åºå£ï¼å¶é¤å¸ãç¸£å¬å¸åªå°æ¸¯æ¾³åºå£ãä½é¬æ²¹åºå£çåå·¥ä»æåè¦å®ï¼å³ï¼æ±é ­é£åºå¬å¸ç¶ççéæ¨ãéæ¨é¬æ²¹ãèæ½çå¯å°é¦æ¸¯ãæ°é¦¬å©ãé æ´åºå£ï¼å°æ¾³éï¼çæ½çãèæ½çç±ç³æ­§å¬å¸åºå£ï¼èèèæ½ç±ä½å±±å¬å¸åºå£ï¼éæ¨çæ½çç±æ±éå¬å¸åºå£ï¼å°æ°é¦¬å©çæ½çãèèæ½ç±æ±éå¬å¸åºå£ï¼å°é¦æ¸¯ï¼ç±ç¾æç¶ççé¬æ²¹çç¾æåç¨®çå¸ãç¸£å¬å¸åºå£ï¼å°é æ´å°åçåºå£ï¼é¤æ±é ­å¤ï¼ä»ç±çå¬å¸çµ±ä¸ç¶çï¼å¦å°ä¾æ¢ä»¶è¨±å¯ï¼å¯æ¹çºç±çå¬å¸ä»£çåºå£ï¼ç±ç¶ççå¸ãç¸£å¬å¸çµ±ä¸æ ¸ç®çè§ã"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p232" name="p232">232.</a> In my view, the division of the trading activities is a historical fact. Mr Hu's evidence, which I accept, is that GDF took up theoverseas export because the sub-branches were not familiar with international trade practice and lack proficiency in English. GDF'soverseas export does not assist the Defendants that Foshan Foods was engaged in independent trading activities. If anything, theoverseas trade demonstrated that Foshan Foods was not free to carry out export trading activities as it wished. The 1987 report submittedby GDF to CNC (Exhibit P21) is the clearest indication that Foshan Foods was not engaged in any independent trading activities. Inthis report the self-trading exports of the sub-branches were grouped under the self-trading export of GDF. Mr Yuan said that theduty of GDF was merely to collect and report (æ»ç¸½ä¸å ±). However, it is clear from the report that the self-trading export ofthe sub-branches were not individually listed in the report. If these activities were indeed carried out independent from the plansof GDF, one would expect individual items to appear in the report. The restriction on the trading activities of Foshan Foods continuedto at least January 1993 when the financial peg was severed or January 1994 when the planning peg was severed.</p>    <p class="heading">(24) Trade Fairs/Contracts</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p233" name="p233">233.</a> Before 1993, when Foshan Foods was unpegged from GDF, its name appeared in the sales contracts signed at Trade Fairs. In my view,this did not make it a seller of these products. I accept the evidence of the Plaintiffs that the name of Foshan Foods appeared inthe contracts because it was the coastal company responsible for the export of the goods.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p234" name="p234">235.</a> The Defendants' witnesses such as Chung Who Cheung and Mr Cheung said that at the Trade Fairs they would discuss the purchase ofwine directly with Mr Chiu, the representative of Foshan Foods. It may be, as a matter of convenience, the distributors and the HongKong merchants would discuss with Mr Chiu on products which Foshan Foods would eventually ship to them. After all, it was not disputedthat the purchasers would open letters of credit directly in favour of Foshan Foods. However, this does not mean that the contractsthat were eventually signed were the contracts between Foshan Foods and the distributors. From the evidence, Mr Chiu had only signedcontracts in the Trade Fair in 1983. He could not recall whether he was the group leader of the wine group in that year. In my view,it was likely that he was the wine group leader of that year.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p235" name="p235">235.</a> The notice given by CNC in respect of the 1991 Autumn Trade Fair (Bundle D(1)/476-489) is a good indication as to the function ofGDF. At p.489 one can see the number of representatives from each province attending the Trade Fair. In respect of Guangdong, representativescame from GDF and GCO. In respect of the wine group, there were 26 members. The group leader and deputy group leader were appointedfrom the provincial food companies and the sales representatives would also come from the provinces engaged in wine trade. Obviously,GDF had to decide who from the various coastal companies would be attending the Trade Fair as representatives of Guangdong in thewine group.</p>    <p class="heading">(25) Others</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p236" name="p236">236.</a> I accept the majority of the quality inspection of the products was carried out by the sub-branches which acquired the products fromthe factories, but Mr Yuan agreed that GDF also carried out quality inspection. This is another indication of the business leadershipof GDF and its control over the products.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p237" name="p237">237.</a> Export permits were required for certain products including wine between 1986 and 1993. Mr Yuan accepted that GDF applied for thepermits on behalf of the sub-branches. Evidence was adduced as to the description of the supplying or applying units in the permits.In my view, it is not necessary to deal with these matters in detail. The business leadership of GDF is shown by the fact that ithad to apply for the export permits on behalf of the sub-branches.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p238" name="p238">238.</a> On advertising fees, Mr Yuan said that the distributors would report to Foshan Foods on the advertising fees because the fees wouldhave to be deducted from the cost of production. I do not rule out that this had happened, but it must be borne in mind that theadvertising fees were dealt with by the Hong Kong distributors with GDF's agents in Hong Kong, namely, Guangnam Hong and Wu FungHong.</p>    <p class="heading">(26) Mr Cheung's evidence</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p239" name="p239">239.</a> One of the Defendants' witnesses, namely Mr Cheung, attempted to give some evidence on the functions of GDF and its relationshipwith the sub-branches. He said that the function of GDF was to manage the whole of the food export in Guangdong. It was an administrativeunit. Although it was a superior unit, it had no substantial trading activities. He also said that Foshan Foods was also an administrativeunit but at a lower level.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p240" name="p240">240.</a> Although Mr Cheung has years of trading activities with the Mainland, he obviously was not in a position to give any useful evidenceon the economic structure of the Mainland during the planned economy. Certainly Mr Tang, S.C., did not tender him as an expert witnessin this regard. Mr Cheung was not aware of the provisions of the Articles of Association of GDF and the sub-branches. When he statedthat GDF had no trading activities, he was not aware that GDF had in fact engaged directly in the export of sugar. His comment thatFoshan Foods was also an administrative unit is equally off the mark. While Foshan Food may at one stage managed some of the sub-branchesin the local areas, it was ultimately an unit subject to the control of GDF in terms of planning, finance and business. He said thatGDF was an administrative management unit because it only acquired and purchased the products from the local areas. But that washow the system operated. He was not in a position to tell the structure and function of the enterprises that dealt with foreign trade.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p241" name="p241">241.</a> Mr Cheung said that the distributorship of the Shiwan Mijiu was given to Chung Tai by Wu Fung Hong. The decisions to regroup thefour wine into one and the later revival of the Shiwan Mijiu were all made by Wu Fung Hong. He said that as Wu Fung Hong was basedin Hong Kong, it exercised a lot of power, it was the only arm of the Mainland Government which was aware of the demands of the customersin Hong Kong. Evidence of the same vein was given by Mr Chiu. The role of Wu Fung Hong should clearly be recognized but obviouslyMr Cheung and Mr Chiu were trying to play down the importance of GDF. What Mr Cheung said about the decision of Wu Fung Hong on theShiwan Mijiu flies in the face of what he had written to the Mayor of the Guangdong Province in his letter dated 10th May 1995. Inthis letter, he stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...ç¾ç¹åçé·ç³è¨¢ä¸å®ç±å»£æ±é£åé²åºå£å¬å¸ä¸ææèµ·åè£½é çååç³¾ç´ï¼....</p>        <p class="quote">...ä¸å«å¹´æ¥äº¤æå¾ï¼çé£åºå¬å¸ç«å°ä¸åå¨ç­ç­å©å¹´åï¼å°é·éç±é¶å¢å å°æ¯å¹´å­è¬å¤ç®±çåçç¢åï¼âç³ç£ç±³éâåé·åºå£é¦æ¸¯ï¼èå°ä¸åçç¢é¢¨æ ¼çååå°æ¹éå» çç¢çç±³éï¼åç¨âå»£æ±ç±³éâéä¸çå­æ¨åºé¦æ¸¯å·¿å ´ï¼..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>According to this letter, it was GDF which cancelled this popular wine.

However, passing-off is not confined to misuse of household names. <em>All that is necessary for a mark to be capable of being protected is that the public should rely on the mark as denoting that thequality or character of the goods so marked is the responsibility of some one trader.

Mr Yong is a Director of the Hong Kong Rice MerchantEnterprises Limited ("Rice Merchant"). The Rice Merchant is the distributor of the bottled Pearl River Bridge soy sauce. There aredifferent types of Pearl River Bridge soy sauce. Apart from one particular type, the seller of the Pearl River Bridge soy sauce isGDF. Pearl River Bridge soy sauce has a large market in Hong Kong, although in recent years there has been a decline in the salesfigures. In the 1970's, according to a survey of the domestic households, the Pearl River Bridge soy sauce captured 70% of the market.In recent years the percentage is between 30 to 40%. Mr Yong accounted the drop to the competition in the soy sauce market by otherbrands such as Amoy, Lee Kam Kee, Tung Chun and Kam Lan. There is also supply of other brands of soy sauce in recent years from otherparts of the Guangdong province such as ä½å±±ï¼åæµ·ï¼ä¸­å±±ï¼éå¹³ and å»£å·.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p254" name="p254">254.</a> Another example of the popularity of the Pearl River Bridge soy sauce is found in the evidence of Mr Yuan.

The trade mark was held by CNC on behalf of GDF. I accept this to be correct. The subsequent transfer ofthe trade mark registration to GDF in Hong Kong and in foreign countries clearly indicated that CNC was holding the trade mark forand on behalf of GDF. The assignment in Hong Kong was for the consideration of $10. It covered both the trade mark and the goodwillgenerated from the use of the labels. The transfer of the trade mark from CNC to GDF in some foreign countries had not been carriedout. I accept the Plaintiffs' evidence this was due to the problem created by associated trade mark. As CNC was still the owner ofthe trade mark in respect of the canned food, it could not sign the associated trade mark in respect of wine to GDF. I further acceptMr Hu's evidence that the reason why CNC retained the canned food trade mark registration was because of the matters relating tothe changes in the administrative structure of Hai Nan Island and Guangzhou City which ceased to be under the administrative controlof Guangdong.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p258" name="p258">258.</a> Mr Yan Guo Shan (å´åå±±), the Vice General Manager of Foshan Foods said that during the planned economy, the Pearl River Bridgetrade mark was a çµ±ä¸å±ç¨åæ¨ (uniform and common used trade mark). He explained the meaning of uniform trade mark ("çµ±ä¸åæ¨")as follows : during the planned economy, the State did not encourage competition among products exported from the Mainland in overseasmarkets. Hence, an uniform trade mark was used on products. This would discourage competition in price and supply.

Likewise, products from Beijing (åäº¬) should use the "é·å" trade mark,"æ¢æ" trade mark was for products from Shanghai (ä¸æµ·) and "æ°´ä»è±" trade mark was for products from Fujian (ç¦å»º).</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p262" name="p262">262.</a> Mr Cheung was simply not in a position to give a comprehensive answer. It is a generalization that all products from Guangdong shouldbear the Pearl River Bridge trade mark. As can be seen in the publication of GDF, there are other trade marks used in export productsfrom GDF. They are the å¤©å£çãæ¨è±çãéæ±ç. There are also trade marks such as ä¸é¹¿çãç¾å©çãææ¡¿ãéçãå¸è¹ãæµ·å¤©ãæµ·å°ãå¿ç¾é½ãå¼ºåçand é·æ¥ç. Furtherï¼Beijing products also bear the trade mark of è±æ¶ç and å¤åæ¯ç. Shanghai products also bear thetrade mark of ä½æé½å». Mr Cheung's comment that at the early stage, including 1975, only the Pearl River Bridge trade mark wasused could not be right because many of the other trade marks of GDF were registered much earlier than 1975.</p>    <p class="heading">(7) The source of the Pearl River Bridge products</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p263" name="p263">263.</a> The Defendants' contention that the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark merely indicated products using that trade mark came from Guangdongcannot be right. It is clear from the labels of the wine that the trade origin of the products is specified.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p264" name="p264">264.</a> In respect of the Shiwan Mijiu main label, from 1975 to 1991, it bore the words in Chinese :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="center" class="quote">"People's Republic of China"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="center" class="quote">"Production under the supervision of CNC, Guangdong"</p>    <p align="center" class="quote">"ä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååä¸­åç³§æ²¹é£åé²åºå£å¬å¸ç£è£½å»£æ±".</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p265" name="p265">265.</a> From 1991 onwards to the present, the words that appeared are "Production under the supervision of GDF" ("å»£æ±é£åé²åºå£å¬å¸ç£è£½").In respect of the Super Mellow Mijiu, from 1979 to 1991, the main label also bore the words "ä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååç³§æ²¹é£åé²åºå£å¬å¸ç£è£½å»£æ±".From 1991 onwards to the present, the words are also "å»£æ±é£åé²åºå£å¬å¸ç£è£½". The Plaintiffs' case is that in the formerdescription, the words "Guangdong" ("å»£æ±") meant GDF. This can be found from the evidence of Chung Hau Yuen, Mr Lor and Mr Leungof Yau Shing Hong. On the other hand, the Defendants' witnesses, for example, Mr Cheung, stated that the words "å»£æ±" in the formerdescription meant that the product was produced in the coast of Guangdong (å»£æ±å£å²¸).</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p266" name="p266">266.</a> I accept that the words "å»£æ±" in the label is capable of referring to GDF. However, for the ordinary consumer, the words may bearno such connotation. In my view, the Plaintiffs' case on the ownership of the goodwill does not need to be decided on such a narrowbasis. As shown from Powell, <strong>T Oertli</strong> and <em>Wadlow</em>, it is sufficient if the public rely on the mark as denoting that the quality and character of the goods so marked is the responsibilityof some trader. The public need not be able to identify him by a name. The public witnesses of both sides had heard of the PearlRiver Bridge brand (some for many years) and they could identify products such as wine and soy sauce produced with this brand. Thesource of the products is clearly identified by the words on the label : it was a company in the Guangdong province. This companycould only be GDF who is the owner of the trade mark and ultimately responsible for the products produced with the trade mark. Itwould be absurd, if despite the singular company named on the label, different products bearing the same label would be consideredby the public to be produced by different companies. In my view, GDF has also fulfilled the public perception test in proving theownership of the goodwill of the two wine. In any event, after 1991, the full name of GDF appears on the main label. The goodwillgenerated from 1991 to 1995 by reference to the name of GDF on the main label would certainly belong to GDF.</p>    <p class="heading">(8) Trade mark licences</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p267" name="p267">267.</a> Furthermore, irrespective of the past position, from 1987 onwards, the sub-branches were using the Pearl River Bridge Trade Markon licence from GDF. This must be the best indication that the concept of an uniform trade mark was no longer applicable after thattime. The mark was used only with the permission of GDF. Foshan Foods had been using the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark under licencefrom GDF since 1987. The first licence was dated 30th April 1987 in relation to wine (D2/904) and soy sauce (D11/353), the secondlicence agreement was dated 30th December 1993 and was on wine. The second licence was part of the documents introduced after theTrade Mark Conference organised by GDF in 1993. Representatives of CNC and the former sub-branches attended as well. The other documentsinclude the Trade Mark and Bar Code Regulations which clearly stated that the Pearl River Bridge trade mark was registered in thename of GDF and could only be used with the permission of GDF. It further provided that the labels of the export products could notbe altered and the licensees could not imitate the trade mark, get up and design of GDF's products.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p268" name="p268">268.</a> Mr Yuan said that even though Foshan Foods had used a lot of effort in relation to the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark, because themark was registered in the name of GDF, it decided to sign the licence agreements. It complied with the law on trade mark.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p269" name="p269">269.</a> Mr Yan said that the 1987 trade mark licence agreement with GDF was signed because at that time Foshan Foods was still pegged tothe Central Government in terms of finance. The second licence agreement dated 30th December 1993 was signed because this followedthe 1987 agreement and there was no problem in signing. At that time, the trade mark law was introduced and money would be requiredto manage the trade marks.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p270" name="p270">270.</a> The explanation of Mr Yuan and Mr Yan on why Foshan Foods signed the two licence agreements does not in any way detract from theposition that Foshan Foods used the Pearl River Bridge trade mark under licence from GDF. The fact that no charge was payable underthe first licence agreement, and that under the second licence agreement, the licence fee was to be used for the administration ofthe trade mark ("å°æ¬¾å°ç¨") does not detract from the position that GDF was permitting the sub-branch companies to the use ofthe Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark. This is contrary to any suggestion that the trade mark continued to be a uniform trade mark tobe used commonly by all the sub-branches.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p271" name="p271">271.</a> Once it has been established that GDF is the owner of the Pearl River Bridge trade mark, it is an inevitable conclusion that thegoodwill acquired on the two wine belong to GDF as well. Because the reputation of the two wine was built on the reputation of thePearl River Bridge Trade Mark, and the trade mark is so inextricably linked to the products and the labels, that it is not possibleto consider the goodwill of the two wine without regard to the reputation of the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark. The reputation acquiredthrough the use of the trade mark by licences would also belong to GDF.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p272" name="p272">272.</a> Mr Tang S.C. relied on the <strong>Scandecor Development AB v. Scandecor Marketing AB and Others</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20FSR%20500" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] FSR 500</a> in which it was held that there was no general principle that all goodwill generated by use of a mark under licence should accrueto the licensor on termination of the licence. It was a question of fact as to whether the name was distinctive of a particular party'sgoods, not of fiction or equitable doctrine.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p273" name="p273">273.</a> It may well be what <em>Wadlow</em> said at para. 2.62 needs to be reconsidered in the light of <strong>Scandecor</strong>. However, as far as the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark is concerned, the goodwill generated by the use of the trade mark under licencecan only be accrued to GDF. GDF had already built up a long reputation with this mark and I just cannot see how a licensee couldhave acquired the goodwill from the use of the mark.</p>    <p class="heading">(9) Payment of fees for use of trade mark</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p274" name="p274">274.</a> A question was raised whether the licence fees were paid by Foshan Foods to GDF or to CNC. By a notice dated 11th March 1994 (BundleD9/252), GDF requested Foshan Foods to pay the 1993 fees for the use of the Pearl River Bridge trade mark. In the notice, FoshanFoods was asked to remit the money to the account of the CNC, Guangzhou Trade Mark Management Office. Mr Dong explained that CNChad a Trade Mark Management Office in the office of GDF, the staff was from GDF as well. Since the Pearl River Bridge trade markon canned food belonged to CNC, CNC established a Trade Mark Management Office in order to facilitate the collection of trade markfees and trade mark management. Mr Dong was also the Deputy Secretary of the Trade Mark Office. After the unpegging of GDF and thesub-branch companies in January 1993, GDF used the CNC account to collect fees from the sub-branch companies. The CNC account wasused for three reasons : (1) it was the first time GDF collected fees from the sub-branch companies; (2) GDF had no separate account;and (3) the fees were to be used on trade mark management and not for other purpose. In fact there were separate entries in thisaccount, one entry was for CNC's trade mark fees on canned food and the other entry was for the GDF trade mark fees on processedfood. The fees were used for trade mark management and expenses in relation to the trade mark and they were not intended to be profits.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p275" name="p275">275.</a> After 1993 the trade mark fees were remitted to the separate account of GDF. GDF continued to collect fees separately for CNC untilthe Autumn Trade Fair of 1997. On 7th March 1995, Foshan Foods remitted to GDF money for the use of the Pearl River Bridge trademark in 1994 (Bundle B1b/435).</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p276" name="p276">276.</a> I accept the evidence of Mr Dong. I am satisfied that the fees were collected by GDF for itself.</p>    <p class="heading">(10) The Production Agreementç æ±æ©çç±³éçç¢å§è¨æ¸ï¼<em>Bundle D2/899ï¼</em></p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p277" name="p277">277.</a> In April 1994, the Shiwan Brewery signed a Production Agreement with GDF. By this document GDF entrusted Shiwan Brewery to producethe Pearl River Bridge çå°çï¼éè¸ï¼and ä¸è¸. GDF had signed similar documents with other factories.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p278" name="p278">278.</a> Mr Chen explained that at the beginning of 1994, Shiwan Brewery was informed by Foshan Foods that from 1994 onwards, GDF would purchasefrom Shiwan Breweryçå°çï¼éè¸andä¸è¸ and this was agreeable to Foshan Foods. Later on, Mr Dong and Mr Leung of GDF cameto see him at the Brewery. Mr Dong said that they had discussed with Foshan Foods, and because of the change in the foreign trade,GDF needed to find its own products (æ¾ç±³ä¸é). Between January and February 1994, Shiwan Brewery received plans from GDF onthe production of the three wine. On 20th April 1994, Mr Dong came to Shiwan Brewery and said that GDF had registered the Pearl RiverBridge Trade Mark and in order to strengthen the trade mark management, GDF asked Shiwan Brewery to sign the Production Agreement.After consulting the Factory Manager, the document was signed. After the Production Agreement was signed with GDF, Shiwan Brewerysuggested to Foshan Foods that a similar agreement should be signed with it as well so as to ensure the Brewery receive protectionin the use of the trade mark. The Production Agreement with Foshan Foods was then signed (Exhibit D9).</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p279" name="p279">279.</a> In the Production Agreement signed with GDF, it was clearly stated that GDF was the lawful owner of the Pearl River Bridge TradeMark. What Mr Chen said about the circumstances in which these documents were signed does not diminish Shiwan Brewery or Foshan Foods'recognition of the right of GDF of the trade mark. The Production Agreement with Foshan Foods merely stated that Foshan Foods wasthe lawful user of the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark. This document clearly is not sufficient to support the Defendants' case thatthe Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark was a uniform trade mark.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p280" name="p280">280.</a> In the Production Agreement with Shiwan Brewery, it was stated that GDF agreed to Foshan Foods acquiring from Shiwan Brewery theSuper Mellow Mijiu and the Shiwan Mijiu. An issue arises that GDF recognized the Super Mellow Mijiu and the Shiwan Mijiu belongedto Foshan Foods and hence GDF only asked the Brewery to produce other types of wine.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p281" name="p281">281.</a> Mr Dong denied that GDF did not take back Super Mellow Mijiu and Shiwan Mijiu because it knew that they were products of Foshan Foodswhereas the other three types of wine, namely, çå°çãéè¸ and ä¸è¸ were traditional wine. He agreed that from an economicpoint of view, the more products GDF could export on its own, the more profit it would make. However the decision of not handlingthe Super Mellow Mijiu and Shiwan Mijiu at that stage was because if GDF recovered all the products from the sub-branches, then theywould not have any business to conduct and it might cause unemployment to the workers. It was not possible to carry out too drastican action in a socialist system. After all from 1954 to 1992, GDF had been responsible for the loss of the sub-branch companies.After considering the business activities that the sub-branch companies had carried out for GDF, the welfare of the employees ofthese companies, GDF decided not to take back all the export products from the sub-branches.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p282" name="p282">282.</a> I accept what Mr Dong said regarding the reason for only taking back three of the wine. The decision was not a recognition of thepropriety interest of Foshan Foods in the Super Mellow Mijiu and the Shiwan Mijiu.</p>    <p class="heading">(11) Use of the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark in advertisement</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p283" name="p283">283.</a> The Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark was used in the advertising campaigns. The Defendants' witnesses again played down the importanceof the trade mark. Mr Cheung said that the emphasis of the advertisements was on Shiwan Mijiu. Certainly from the advertisements,the words "Shiwan Mijiu" were featured most prominently. However, in the advertisement in 1976 when the Shiwan Mijiu was first introducedand in the advertisement in 1979 when Shiwan Mijiu was reintroduced in the market, the Pearl River Bridge trade mark was also featuredseparately and prominently in the advertisements. Similarly in the advertisement on buses, even in the 1990s, there was a separatefeature of the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark. Likewise, in respect of the Super Mellow Mijiu, the Pearl River Bridge trade mark wasfeatured prominently in the advertisements. Similarly the same trade mark was applied, again prominently, throughout the years inadvertisements of other rice wine such as éè¸ï¼å»£æ±ç±³éï¼ä¸­å±±ç±³éï¼çå°çï¼ä¹æ±ç±³éç. The indication is clearlythat the Shiwan Mijiu and Super Mellow Mijiu are part of the Pearl River Bridge brand line of wine.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p284" name="p284">284.</a> Mr Cheung said that the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark had a certain use or value ("ä½ç¨"), but he said the emphasis was still onthe Shiwan Mijiu. He played down the importance of the trade mark by saying the Guangdong Mijiu which also bear the Pearl River BridgeTrade Mark did not sell well. He further said that the use of Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark was not the deciding factor in the qualityof the product. Before 1979, quality control on products with the trade mark in the Mainland was good but after that the controlwas less effective.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p285" name="p285">285.</a> In my view, the product may not sell well for a number of reasons such as quality and the amount of promotion involved. However thereis no denial that the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark helped to sell products. Certainly in the consumer market in Hong Kong, the PearlRiver Bridge Trade Mark has acquired a general reputation of quality. A goodwill has certainly been built up on products of the PearlRiver Bridge Trade Mark such as soy sauce and other types of rice wine. The use by the two wine of the Pearl River Bridge Trade Markin labels and advertisements was to ride on the goodwill already generated by the trade mark so as to give recognition to the newproducts.</p>    <p class="heading">(12) Period from 1993-1995</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p286" name="p286">286.</a> From the time of their introduction in 1975 and 1979 respectively until January 1995 when the Zu Miao brand of wine were introduced,the goodwill generated by the Super Mellow Mijiu and the Shiwan Mijiu clearly belonged to GDF. After the financial peg was removedin January 1993, Foshan Foods used the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark under licence from GDF. The earlier licence was extended to1993 and licence fees for that year was paid. This was followed by the new licence Agreement signed by Foshan Foods in early 1994.</p>    <p class="heading">Public perception : Reference to the parties on wine labels</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Main label</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p287" name="p287">287.</a> I have already dealt with the question of public perception on the ownership of the goodwill in relation to the main label. The activitiesof GDF which I have dealt with extensively in the earlier part of the judgment clearly indicated that it was engaged in a trade whichwould entitle it to sue for passing-off. The public perception test in proving ownership of the goodwill has clearly been satisfiedby GDF.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Neck label : Use of the words "ç³ç£ä½³é<em>"</em></p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p288" name="p288">288.</a> The original neck label contained the words "ç³ç£ä½³é" (Shiwan Fine Brew). This neck label was used for a very short period oftime. The new neck label had the larger letters "XO" at the center and the words "ç³ç£ä½³é" was reduced in size and appearedon the top. The Defendants argued that the words "ç³ç£" referred to Shiwan Brewery.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p289" name="p289">289.</a> Mr Dong denied that it was misleading to the consumers to use the words "ç³ç£ä½³é" on products not produced by Shiwan Brewerybut by the Namhai Xianhua Brewery which now produces the Shiwan Mijiu and Super Mellow Mijiu for GDF. He said that the words hadbeen used on the Pearl River Bridge trade mark wine for many years. He said the words Shiwan Mijiu ("ç³ç£ç±³é") represent thename of the product, consumers did not identify the wine with the Shiwan Brewery but rather with the Pearl River Bridge trade mark.He said that there are two places in Guangdong with the name of "ç³ç£" and in a town called "åç¾", there was another wine factorycalled "ç³ç£éå» ". Mr Dong further gave the example of the "ç´¹æ¶é" produced in æµæ±. He said ç´¹æ¶ is the name of an area,there are many different brands of ç´¹æ¶è±éé, for example, "å¡ç" and "å¤æç".</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p290" name="p290">290.</a> From the second half of 1995, GDF stopped using the words "ç³ç£ä½³é" on its Super Mellow Mijiu because in May or June 1995, ä½å±±å·¿å·¥åè¡æ¿ç®¡çå±informed GDF that the words "ç³ç£" had been registered by Foshan Foods, GDF's decision to stop using "ç³ç£ä½³é" from that pointonwards was to respect the law of the State. For a short period, Super Mellow Mijiu was exported in bottles without any label. Itthen decided to print a simplified label which is shown as an annexure to the letter dated 30th October 1996 from GDF to the FoshanCity Middle Court (Bundle D10/203-207). He said that the label was used when GDF exported the wine and when the wine arrived in HongKong, the diamond shape label would be imposed in replacement of the simplified label. This step was confirmed by Mr Leung of YauShing Hong, the new distributor in Hong Kong of the Pearl River Bridge Super Mellow Mijiu.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) Public perception of Shiwan Brewery</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p291" name="p291">291.</a> In a letter dated 7th June1995 from GDF to ä½å±±å·¿å·¥åå±, GDF did recognize the words "ç³ç£" refers to the special productsof the area, it was stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" éæ¼æç´ä½¿ç¨åé¡ï¼æåæ­·å²çæåµï¼åæçå¤è²¿é«å¶æ¯ç±çå¬å¸çµ±ä¸çµç¹åºå£ï¼å®æå·¥å» çç¢ãå èï¼æç´æ¯ç±çå¬å¸è¨­è¨æä¾ï¼å·¥å» åªè² è²¬è²¼æãç±æ¼ç¹éç±³éå¨ç³ç£çç¢ï¼å¾å¸¸å¨æç´ä¸å ä»¥'ç³ç£'å©å­ï¼è¡¨ç¤ºæ¯å°æ¹ç¹ç¢ã"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p292" name="p292">292.</a> In my view, "ç³ç£" refers to a geographical location. However, it would be a quantum leap to say that the words "ç³ç£" wouldmean Shiwan Brewery or that consumers would know of this connotation.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p293" name="p293">293.</a> The Defendants argued that in the promotional articles written on the Super Mellow Mijiu in 1979 and in the beginning of 1980s, therewere extensive reference to the Shiwan Brewery. Further, there was a popular television programme in 1980 which featured the ShiwanBrewery as well. It was submitted that the consumers would associate the Super Mellow Mijiu and Shiwan Mijiu with the Shiwan Brewerywhich was formerly the é³å¤ªåéå» .</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p294" name="p294">294.</a> It is clear that although the promotional articles (they were published in November and December 1979 and May and June of 1980) referredto the Shiwan Brewery, the actual advertisements of the two wine made no reference at all to the Shiwan Brewery. The evidence showedthat there is also a é³å¤ªåéå»  in Hong Kong but it is a distinct and separate entity from the one in the Mainland. Furthermore,the actual evidence including those adduced by the Defendants on public perception just does not support the contention of the Defendants.</p>    <p class="heading">(i) DW7æ¹å®æ</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p295" name="p295">295.</a> DW7, æ¹å®æ, whose family operated a Chinese product emporium, said that he only learned of the name Shiwan Brewery when he visitedit in March 1995.</p>    <p class="heading">(ii) DW8æå»ºæ¦®</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p296" name="p296">296.</a> DW8, æå»ºæ¦®, whose family operated a provisional store, said that there was a brewery in Shiwan.

He said the words Shiwan Mijiu represents products of Shiwan Brewery. He had seen the quality approvalcertificates but the words Shiwan Brewery only appeared in the past seven to eight years. The customers would not be given the certificateswhen they buy the wine.</p>    <p class="heading">(v) DW13æå¾·å¦</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p299" name="p299">299.</a> DW13, æå¾·å¦, did not know which brewery produced the Shiwan Mijiu.

In cross-examination he said that he guessed ç³ç£ (Shiwan)is the name of a place, it is a å°æ¹éå» å (the name of the brewery in the area), but he did not know if there is a breweryin Shiwan and he did not know how many Shiwan are there in Guangdong. As to the name Shiwan Mijiu, Mr Lam said that he did not knowwhat it means. He did not know the meaning of Shiwan.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p300" name="p300">300.</a> Based on the evidence I have heard, I do not find that the words "ç³ç£ä½³é" on the neck label affects the Plaintiffs' case thatGDF had the goodwill to the product.</p>    <p class="heading">(4) Back label</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p301" name="p301">301.</a> The Defendants relied on a back label on the Super Mellow Mijiu which stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"ç¹éç±³éæ¯ä½å±±ç³ç£éå» çççï¼ç±ç¶é©è±å¯çç³ç£èª¿éå¸«ï¼æ¡ç¨åç¨®æä»½çç±³éï¼æ··åèª¿å¶ï¼åå¶éç²¾æ¿åº¦é©ä¸­ï¼é¦éæº«åï¼è±å³éé¦ï¼éè²æ¶ç©æ¾æ¾èèæ¼å¹´ä»£ä¹é çéé²ï¼èä¸èèå¹´æç¹å¥é·å ªç¨±ç±³éä¸­çXO"(p.7 of Bundle F).</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The relevance is that this label referred to the Shiwan Brewery.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p302" name="p302">302.</a> Chung Hau Yuen had never seen such a back label. He recalled that he might have seen one with the words "ç±³éä¸­åXO" (XO amongthe rice wine). Mr Lor had never seen such a back label. His evidence was that during the planned economy, the name of the factorywhich produced the product would not appear, and in fact was not allowed to appear, on labels of products destined for the exportmarket. Mr Tang had never seen any back label. Mr Leung of Yau Shing Hong had not seen any back label. Mr Chiu said that initiallythere was a back label attached to the Super Mellow Mijiu. It was a white colour label describing the quality of the wine. It waslater cancelled because of problems of sticking the label to the bottle. He, however, had not seen the back label now relied uponby the Defendants.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p303" name="p303">303.</a> The two witnesses who said there was a back label to the Super Mellow Mijiu were Mr Chen and Chung Who Cheung. Mr Chen claimed thathe had a discussion with Mr Chan Wan Fai of Foshan Foods on the back label. Mr Chan was not asked in his evidence about the backlabel. Chung Who Cheung also said that the back label was used in mid-1983 to 1986/87. The original case of the Defendants, as evidencedby Chung Who Cheung's affirmation in support of the Defendants' application for interlocutory injunction, is that the back labelwas used since the first bottle of the Super Mellow Mijiu was produced in 1979. Chung Who Cheung said that the idea of the back labelwas suggested by Leo Burnett. The back label ceased to be used when Shiwan Brewery changed the bottling of wine into an automaticsystem. In support of the Defendants' case that the back label was used, he relied on the promotional proposal by Leo Burnett, theadvertising agency, (D3/1050) and a document dated 5th May 1983 (D9/151) in which the wording of the back label was specified. Apartfrom minor differences, they matched the label now relied by the Defendants. He further relied on delivery notes dated 15th August1983 and 28th February 1984 (D3/1393-1414) in which the back label was included in the description of the goods delivered by TungFook (1982) to Shiwan Brewery.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p304" name="p304">304.</a> Mr Chen stated that in 1983, a representative from Leo Burnett visited the Brewery, and he informed the representative that the Brewerywanted a better promotion of the special feature of their products (ç¢åç¹é») and suggested the use of a back label. In the newspaperadvertisements in 1979 and 1980, there were already reference to theç³ç£éå» . The back label was used from September/October1983 until 1986 when the new automatic label sticking machine could not arrange the front and back labels on a straight line withoutcausing delays in the production. After discussion with the Hong Kong merchant (which I took it to beåç¦ï¼ï¼the back label wasstopped being used from 1987 onwards.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p305" name="p305">305.</a> I do not find Chung Who Cheung and Mr Chen to be credible witnesses on the back label. Chung Who Cheung had given evidence on manyissues which were not within his knowledge. He explained that he said the back label was used since 1979 because his staff had toldhim that there were a back label to the wine. He then said that Leo Burnett suggested the use of the back label in a proposal preparedby it. Then he said that the original proposal did not contain any reference to the back label. The idea only came from Leo Burnettsome time later in 1983. Mr Chen conceded that in 1983 the name of the Brewery could not appear on the products, but he tried toexplain that the restriction only apply to the main labels but not the back labels.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p306" name="p306">306.</a> I find that GDF had not approved of the use of a back label. Tung Fook (1982) might have supplied some back labels, but I acceptMr Liao S.C.'s submissions that if they were used, they were being used secretly and only for a short period of time, or they wereused on bottles destined for the domestic market. The Defendants relied on shipping documents, invoices and printing orders in whichthe back labels were included in the description of the goods. From these documents it appeared that the labels, together with otherlabels, were delivered on two occasions in 1983. The labels were, according to the documents, consigned to Foshan Foods. It is extremelyodd that Foshan Foods was not able to say that there was the back label on the Super Mellow Mijiu. In any event, I find the backlabel had no effect on consumers or had any bearings on the question of goodwill. The size of the back label was so small, and asMr Liao, S.C., said, the words could only be discerned by the use of a magnifying device. When the back label is compared with themain label, it dwarfed into total insignificance.</p>    <p class="heading">(5) Bar Code</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p307" name="p307">307.</a> As requested by the supermarkets in Hong Kong, GDF started to use bar codes on its products. This started in June 1990. It is notnecessary to base my finding on the ownership of goodwill on the use of the Bar Codes.</p>    <p class="heading">(6) Name of Shiwan Brewery in the cartons</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p308" name="p308">308.</a> Mr Chen said that Shiwan Brewery would put a quality inspection certificate in the cartons containing the wine. The certificate referredto Shiwan Brewery and gave a description of Shiwan Brewery.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p309" name="p309">309.</a> As these certificates were found only in the cartons, the ordinary consumers of the two types of wine would not be provided withsuch inspection certificates.</p>    <p class="heading">(7) The manufacturer as owner of the goodwill</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p310" name="p310">310.</a> Mr Tang S.C., referred to <em>Passing Off Law and Practice</em> 2nd Edition by Drysdale and Silverleaf at para.3.13 in which it was said that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...Disputes not infrequently arise between the manufacturer and importer over who is entitled to the reputation in England. At commonlaw as a general rule the owner of the reputation is the foreign manufacturer and not the importer even if the importer is the soleagent or distributor in this country of the goods in question."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p311" name="p311">311.</a> In <strong>Van Zeller v. Mason, Cattley and Co.</strong> [1907] 25 Reports of Patent, Design and Trade Mark Cases 37, a wine vineyard known as the Quinta de Roriz and a wine shipping businesswere originally in the same hands but belonged to different owners at a later date. After the severance, the successors of the wineshipping business registered Kopke Roriz as a trade mark for wine. The owner of the vineyard applied to restrain the owners of theKopke business of this mark. The defendant shipped to the English market wine of the Kopke Roriz brand although such wine did notcontain the products of the vineyard. The Court held that the defendants passed off the goods of the defendant as and for the goodsof the vineyard.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p312" name="p312">312.</a> Many of the cases in this area arose as a result of the dispute between the manufacturer and the importer. However, the conflictingclaim of the manufacturer and the importer is not the only situation when one considers the ownership of the goodwill. Hence, I donot find it helpful to rely, as a principle of law, that the goodwill or reputation belongs to that of the manufacturer. Mr TangS.C. is of course right when he said that the mere fact that there was a trade connection between the product and its owner is notsufficient to establish an ownership of goodwill. The trade connection cases relied by the Plaintiffs are illustrations of the controlexercised by a trade mark proprietor who himself is not the manufacturer. In this case, GDF has clearly satisfied the control testin establishing the ownership of goodwill in the two wine and is successful in its claim based on passing off.</p>    <p class="heading">(8) Tung Fook (1982)</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p313" name="p313">313.</a> The status of Tung Fook (1982) was merely the distributor of the Pearl River Bridge Super Mellow Mijiu. This is clearly spelt outin some of the advertisements of this product. It cannot satisfy either of the tests in proving the ownership of the goodwill.</p>    <p class="heading">Trade Mark</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Registration of trade mark by Tung Fook (1982)</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p314" name="p314">314.</a> The Plaintiffs seek rectification of Trade Mark No.2010/95, registered by Tung Fook (1982) by substituting GDF's name as the proprietoror by expunging the registration from the Trade Mark Registry.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p315" name="p315">315.</a> Tung Fook (1982) applied for registration of the Super Mellow Mijiu trade mark in 1993 and the application was approved in 1995.Chung Who Cheung stated that as early as 1989 he had asked Samuel Yeung &amp; Co., Solicitors, to apply for the registration of theSuper Mellow Mijiu trade mark. He wanted the registration because in the market there were other types of Super Mellow Mijiu producedin the Mainland with similar labels. In his evidence-in-chief, he stated that GDF and Foshan Foods also suggested to him to registerthe trade mark. He stated that during the 1992 Trade Fair he had invited Mr Ching Yau Yau of GDF and Mr Yuan of Foshan Foods to lunch.During the conversation, they asked him to register the trade mark quickly so as to protect himself from imitation products. Lateron, it was discovered that Samuel Yeung &amp; Co. had not proceeded with the trade mark application. He was then referred to Hastings&amp; Co. to apply for the registration. The application was made on 10th June 1993.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p316" name="p316">316.</a> At the end of 1993, during a meeting with the representatives of GDF, namely Mr Leung (æ¢åé´»), Mr Chu (æ±è¯) and Mr Dong, ChungWho Cheung informed them that he had already applied to register the Super Mellow Mijiu label when Mr Leung informed him that GDFintended to supply Super Mellow Mijiu in Hong Kong. At this meeting Mr Leung took out a label which was similar to the Super MellowMijiu label. In another Trade Fair, either in 1993 or 1994, in the presence of Mr Chu and Mr Fung, who was a manager of GDF, ChungWho Cheung further informed them that he had registered the Super Mellow Mijiu label.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p317" name="p317">317.</a> The Defendants' case as pleaded and as contained in Chung Who Cheung's affirmation in support of the Defendants' application forinjunction against GDF was that Tung Fook did not and was not required to inform GDF of the registration of the Super Mellow Mijiulabel because GDF had no interest in the label. Chung Who Cheung's affirmation expressly dealt with Mr Dong's contention that GDFhad never been informed of the application by Tung Fook (1982). However, Chung Who Cheung changed his approach in his evidence.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p318" name="p318">318.</a> I do not accept that he had informed GDF either in casual conversations or in meetings that he had applied for the registration ofthe Super Mellow Mijiu label. GDF had previously wanted to register the Super Mellow Mijiu label and was advised by Wu Fung Hongthat it was not possible to do so. Had Chung Who Cheung informed GDF of what he had done, I have no doubt that GDF would have takenaction on this matter. Furthermore, what Chung Who Cheung said regarding the reason for registering the label was unconvincing. Inparagraph 35 of his first witness statement, he stated that in 1993, Shiwan Brewery, Foshan Foods and Tung Fook (1982) decided toapply to register the label. No reason was given why this decision was made. Chung Who Cheung now said that he decided to registerthe label earlier and he tried to explain paragraph 35 by saying that after GDF and Foshan Foods suggested that he should registerthe label, he pressed Mr Samuel Yeung on the matter.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p319" name="p319">319.</a> Mr Samuel Yeung is no longer practising in Hong Kong. Mr Ching had left GDF in 1991. I find too much of an coincidence that the applicationfor registration of the Super Mellow Mijiu Trade Mark was lodged by Tung Fook (1982) on 10th June 1993 when during the same yearGDF and Foshan Foods became unpegged and the requirement of export licence was cancelled.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p320" name="p320">320.</a> Mr Yuan also said that he had suggested to Chung Who Cheung to register the Super Mellow Mijiu trade mark in order to protect theproduct because of imitations in the market. He said that someone from GDF was also present at the discussion. He said that the personmight be Mr Ching Yau-yau. I find his evidence to be extremely odd and not credible. Foshan Foods had already registered the Zu MiaoTrade Mark in the Mainland in 1986 to 1988. The Zu Miao Trade Mark was also registered in Hong Kong on 5th October 1993 by a subsidiarycompany of Foshan Foods in Hong Kong. Foshan Foods regarded the Super Mellow Mijiu to be its own product. In the ordinary cause ofevents, it would be extremely odd for Foshan Foods to ask or allow Tung Fook (1982) to register the Super Mellow Mijiu Trade Markto protect against other imitators. In my view, it was part of the concerted effort by Foshan Foods and Tung Fook (1982) to havethe Super Mellow Mijiu Trade Mark registered behind the back of GDF. I find that Tung Fook (1982) clearly did not have any permissionfrom GDF to register the Super Mellow Mijiu Trade Mark.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Rectification</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p321" name="p321">321.</a> The power to rectify entries in the register is governed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48</a> of the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/43">Cap.43</a></em> which provides that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(1) Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance -</p>        <p class="quote">(a) any person aggrieved by the non-insertion in or omission from the register of any entry, or by any entry made in the registerwithout sufficient cause, or by any entry wrongly remaining on the register, or by any error or defect in any entry in the register,may apply in the prescribed manner to the Court or, at the option of the applicant and subject to the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 80</a>, to the Registrar, and the tribunal may make such order for making, expunging or varying the entry as the tribunal may think fit;"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I am satisfied that the grounds for rectification have been proved by the Plaintiffs :-</p>    <p>(i) The registration was applied for and obtained by Tung Fook (1982) in fraud of GDF's right in the label in that the goodwill inthe label has been vested with GDF.

Tung Fook (1982) secured the registrationof the trade mark with full knowledge that the mark had been used before the application in a manner contrary to the condition andwould be used after registration in breach of the condition. The trade mark has always been used with matters not of a wholly descriptiveand non-trade mark character.

For example, a work may have been created by a partnership or by adirector of a company or by an employee in circumstances where it would be inequitable for him to claim rights in the work as againstthe partnership or the company and he will be regarded as a constructive trustee of the copyright. Or a copyright work may have beenbrought into existence at the request of or on the instructions of the intended owner who has paid for the making of the work.</p>        <p class="quote"><em>Illustration</em> (1) In <em>Massine v de Basil</em> [1936-45] MCC223, Massine, the choreographer, agreed with the director of the Russian Ballet at Covent Garden that he would composeand arrange suitable dances for the ballet.

Where the outside draftsman was merely commissioned to produce engineering or production drawingsfrom rough sketches supplied by the manufacturer the case for saying that the manufacturer is the owner in equity is very strongindeed.

The Plaintiffs' pleaded caseis that there was an express agreement that the Shiwan Mijiu label was to belong to GDF and that there was a similar understandingin this regard. Mr Tang S.C. referred to the contemporary documents which he said reflected the political climate at that time. Slogansof political class struggles can be found in the reports submitted by the sub-branches, Shiwan Brewery and the Foshan Foreign TradeBureau. Mr Tang S.C. submitted that in such a climate, it would be highly improbable that the parties would consider intellectualproperty issues such as labels on the wine. These are capitalistic ideas not in vogue at that time.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p335" name="p335">335.</a> In my view, looking at Mr Lor's evidence, the Plaintiffs' case that the label belonged to GDF was one of understanding and not ofan express agreement. The reason why the label belonged to GDF was because of the use of the GDF's Pearl River Bridge Trade Markon the label. It was only when being pressed by Mr Tang S.C. in his cross-examination that Mr Lor seemed to suggest that there wasa discussion on this matter as well. This, however, does not cast doubt on the credibility of Mr Lor. The Shiwan Mijiu was a productdeveloped with the authority of GDF. I find that the label belonged to GDF. Certainly, at the time when the wine was developed, therewas no contrary indication that the label would somehow belong either to a brewery which produced the wine or to Foshan Foods, whichwas merely executing the business activities of GDF. I find that Mr Chiu and Mr Chen must have understood and accepted that the labelbelonged to GDF. In <strong>John Richardson Computers Ltd v. Handers and Anr.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20FSR%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] FSR 497</a>, where R engaged two computer programmes W and H to refine and improve a programme.

The design fees were not separately charged but were included in the cost of the printing of the labels for the ShiwanMijiu. The fees were accounted for and included as part of the cost of the Shiwan Mijiu for export. It is significant that afterthe cancellation of the four rice wine, the label that was being used for the new Guangdong Mijiu was the same label as the ShiwanMijiu. The Guangdong Mijiu was produced by different breweries, the decision by GDF to use the Shiwan Mijiu label for the new productcan only point to one conclusion, namely, the Shiwan Brewery was merely a production unit and the label belonged to GDF. I acceptthat GDF was the owner in equity of the copyright in the Shiwan Mijiu label.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p337" name="p337">337.</a> In a letter dated 12th March 1992, GDF's Trade Mark Department requested Foshan Foods to provide information on the following matter:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" è«æä¾ç³ç£ç¹éï¼ç³ç£ç±³éææ©ä½¿ç¨è¨¼æï¼åæ¬åæ¡çè®é·ï¼é¡è²æ·±æ·ºè®åï¼å­é«è®åç­ç­ï¼ææ©é·å®æå½¢ï¼å¤è²¿å¬å¸åå·¥å» å¨æ¹é©éæ¾åçåå·¥ååæ³ï¼çµè«æ¯ç æ±æ©åæ¨çä½¿ç¨èåæ¡çä½¿ç¨æ¯åä¸éçã"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr Dong said that at that time GDF was still pegged with Foshan Foods, the request was a normal request and this was not an indicationthat the label did not belong to GDF even though it had paid for the design. I accept what he said. The ownership of the label hasto be determined by reference to all the evidence and not simply on this letter.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p338" name="p338">338.</a> There was clearly an infringement of the copyright when in February 1995 the Shiwan Mijiu produced by Shiwan Brewery, supplied byFoshan Foods and distributed by Chung Tai used the same design with the substitution of the Zu Miao trade mark instead of the PearlRiver Bridge trade mark. This was done without GDF's permission.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) Copyright of the Super Mellow Mijiu main label</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p339" name="p339">339.</a> It cannot be disputed that Chung Hau Yuen was acting on behalf of GDF when he instructed Ngai Chung to prepare the main label ofthe Super Mellow Mijiu. The contract was entered on behalf of GDF. This is clear from the evidence of Chung Hau Yuen and Mr Lor.Tung Fook did not have any beneficial interest in the copyright. The beneficial ownership belonged to GDF. I find that there wasan express agreement between Mr Lor and Chung Hau Yuen that the label belonged to GDF. This was not the usual arrangement in whichthe label was designed and printed in the Mainland. On the contrary it was to be dealt with by Chung Hau Yuen in Hong Kong. It wasreasonable for the parties to have expressly agreed on the ownership of the label.</p>    <p class="heading">(4) Domestic sales</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p340" name="p340">340.</a> The Defendants relied on the domestic sale of the two wine, although the purpose of this is not clear. Certainly it has no bearingon the question of goodwill of the two wine in Hong Kong. The Defendants seemed to suggest that GDF, by reason of the domestic sale,must have knowledge of the use of the two labels by Shiwan Brewery in the Mainland. This constituted acknowledgement of Shiwan Brewery'srights in the two labels.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p341" name="p341">341.</a> The Plaintiffs accepted that there might have been some domestic sale of the Shiwan brand (ç³ç£ç) Shiwan Mijiu and Super MellowMijiu in the late 1980s, but there could not have been any domestic sale of the Shiwan Mijiu in the 1970s. The evidence adduced bythe Plaintiffs' witnesses such as Mr Lor, Mr Tang and Mr Hu is that in the 1970s, there was still a shortage of food supplies inthe Mainland, and Shiwan Brewery just could not obtain the raw material, namely, rice, for the production of wine in the domesticmarket. The raw material must be supplied by GDF. Furthermore, there was shortage of packaging material, namely bottles and paperfor printing labels. I accept their evidence. The witnesses from Foshan Foods did not deal with the question of domestic sale. Theonly evidence came from Mr Chen of Shiwan Brewery. I do not find Mr Chen to be a credible witness. He referred to tables showingthe figures of domestic sale. The tables were only prepared in the course of the trial and no discovery was made of the documentson which the figures were based. In my view, in the 1970s, if there had been sale of the Super Mellow Mijiu and the Shiwan Mijiuin the domestic market, they would be under the Pearl River Bridge brand and of very small quantity.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p342" name="p342">342.</a> Shiwan Brewery had applied for quality awards of their wine. The applications showed that the Shiwan brand of products were onlymentioned from the 1980s onwards. Mr Chen attempted to boost up his case on domestic sale by saying that he had told the designerof the Shiwan Mijiu label that the wine was for both export and domestic sale. His evidence is not credible. I do not accept thatMr Chen had informed the designer that the same design for Shiwan Mijiu label was to be used for both export purpose and internalsale. The new product was introduced by organizations engaged in export trade and was intended for export. I do not accept that in1973/1974, when Mr Chen instructed the designer to prepare the design for the label, he would at the same time inform the designerthat the product was to be used for internal sale. Attached to the draft label design for Shiwan Mijiu was a white sticker. Mr Chenseemed to rely on the wording on the sticker to support his contention that he had instructed the designer that the design was tobe used for both export and internal sale. He said that the phrase "ä¸ç¾ååºå£ãå§é·æå" indicated that these two matterswere discussed at the same time. I find this to be unlikely. There is no evidence as to when the sticker was put onto the design.In any event, if the label was intended for both purposes, it would not be necessary to put the words "export type" ("åºå£è£")on the sticker.</p>    <p class="heading">(5) No enforcement</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p343" name="p343">343.</a> Even if the copyright of the label design of the two wine is not vested in GDF but in Shiwan Brewery or Tung Fook (1982), such copyrightis not enforceable by either of them because GDF is the owner of the reputation and goodwill associated with these two labels inHong Kong. As pointed out in Copinger at paragraph 2-38 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... there are a variety of cases where a claim of copyright in a work has not been enforced because the court has considered thework to be libellous, immoral, obscene, scandalous or irreligious, or to involve deception of the public."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In <strong>Wright v. Tallis</strong> [1845] I CB 893, a plaintiff failed in an action against the defendant for pirating a work of a devotional character, on the groundthat the plaintiff's work falsely professed to be a translation from the German of an author who had a high reputation for writingsof this kind, and that this had been done to deceive purchases and to give the work a value which it would not otherwise have had.Tindal CJ held that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The cases in which a copyright has been held not to subsist where the work is subversive of good order, morality, or religion, donot, indeed, bear directly on the case before us; but they have this analogy with the present inquiry - that they prove that therule which denies the existence of copyright in those cases, is a rule established for the benefit and protection of the public.And we think the best protection that the law can afford to the public against such a fraud as that laid open by this plea, is, tomake the practice of it unprofitable to its author."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Other cases illustrating this principle are <strong>Slingsby v.

It was accepted by Tung Fook (1982) that the assignment wasmade for the purpose of the litigation.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p346" name="p346">346.</a> Mr Lau Kar Yee (åå®¶å) was the former Assistant General Manager of the China Advertising and Exhibition Limited Company. He joinedin 1963 when it was known as the China Advertising Agency (ä¸­åå»£åå¬å¸). He had a deep impression that the Super Mellow labelwas handled by Mr Ngai who drafted the layout (èå). In 1995, Chung Who Cheung and Mr Ngai asked him to execute the Assignmentof the copyright. He considered it reasonable because Tung Fook (1982) had instructed his company to prepare the design and theyhad received the design fees. The copyright was no longer of use to his company and he agreed to the assignment.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p347" name="p347">347.</a> In my view, China Advertising held the legal title to the copyright of the design on trust for GDF and owed a fiduciary duty towardsGDF. As part of the business operation engaged in the promotion of the Mainland export products, China Advertising must be awareof the significance of the Pearl River Bridge trade mark and the words on the label of CNC, Guangdong supervising the production.By reason of the incorporation of these two items, China Advertising just could not say that the copyright of the main label belongedto Tung Fook (1982). This is so irrespective of whether Tung Fook (1982) is a successor of Tung Fook.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p348" name="p348">348.</a> By assigning the copyright to Tung Fook (1982), China Advertising had clearly acted in breach of trust and its fiduciary duties towardsGDF. The breach was knowingly and intentionally induced by Tung Fook (1982). By misappropriating the trust property belonging toGDF, Tung Fook (1982) became a constructive trustee of the copyright in the works of GDF.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p349" name="p349">349.</a> Furthermore, China Advertising had acted in breach of contract with GDF by assigning the copyright to Tung Fook (1982) and Tung Fook(1982) had induced and procured the breach.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p350" name="p350">350.</a> Shiwan Brewery produced the two wine, Chung Tai and Tung Fook (1982) distributed them by using the same main labels as before butwith the substitution of the Zu Miao trade mark. This clearly constituted a copyright infringement on the part of these Defendants.It should be pointed out that the Plaintiffs have not sought relief against Shiwan Brewery for infringing the Super Mellow Mijiulabel.</p>    <p class="heading">Injurious falsehood</p>    <p class="heading">(1) The Law</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p351" name="p351">351.</a> In <em>Gatley on Libel and Slander</em> at para.301, it is stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"There are dicta from which it might be inferred that an action will lie for any words, whether they are defamatory or not, whichare followed by special damage."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"But if the plaintiff can prove (i) that the words are false; (ii) that they were published maliciously, and (iii) that special damagehas followed as the direct and natural result of their publication, an action on the case will lie at common law <em>Ratcliffe v.

The production was under the appointment, directionor control of GDF. The Pearl River Bridge trade marks were used on these wine under the licence of GDF. Neither Foshan Foods norShiwan Brewery had any right in the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark and they were not entitled to replace the Pearl River Bridge TradeMark on these wine with another trade mark. The announcements stated that products with the Zu Miao Trade Mark were genuine articles.This impliedly suggested that the Super Mellow Mijiu, Shiwan Mijiu, Yu Bing Shiao of the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark were falsearticles. The newspaper announcement also referred to éè¸ and ä¸è¸ rice wine. The Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark was also usedin the éè¸ andä¸è¸ produced by another brewery. The announcement further implied that éè¸ and ä¸è¸ rice wine of the PearlRiver Bridge Trade Mark were also not genuine articles.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p354" name="p354">354.</a> The newspaper announcement on 29th - 31st May 1995 further stated that only the Zu Miao Super Mellow Mijiu was the genuine article.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) Chung Who Cheung's evidence</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p355" name="p355">355.</a> Chung Who Cheung said that he did not know GDF is the holder of the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark but he knew the mark is registeredin Hong Kong by CNC. In January 1985, Foshan Foods asked him to go to Shenzhen. He went with a representative of Chung Tai. FoshanFoods informed him that it would not use the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark but the Zu Miao Trade Mark. He said that Tung Fook (1982)would continue to buy the wine if there was no change of the brewery, the quality and the label of the wine.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p356" name="p356">356.</a> In March 1995, Tung Fook (1982) organized 60 wine merchants in Hong Kong to visit the Shiwan Brewery.</p>    <p class="heading">(4) Cheung Loy Chun's evidence</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p357" name="p357">357.</a> Regarding the advertisement of 28th January 1995, Mr Cheung Loy Chun (å¼µä¾é®) said that he had read the advertisement but he didnot know of it before the publication. After the publication, Chung Tai continued to sell the Pearl River Bridge Shiwan Mijiu fora while. Mr Cheung said that Chung Tai decided to change to the Zu Miao Shiwan Mijiu because it did not matter whether Zu Miao orPearl River Bridge brand was used, the most important thing is the Shiwan Mijiu. He denied that he had participated in discussionswith Foshan Foods to change to the Zu Miao brand but others in Chung Tai might have discussed it. He further said that Chung Taiagreed to the change because Foshan Foods and GDF had arguments on the trade mark and the situation in the 1992 and 1993 Trade Fairhad changed, and GDF wanted to get back some products and produce them on its own. Mr Cheung denied that the reason why the Zu MiaoTrade Mark was adopted was because Chung Tai and Foshan Foods wished to set up a "separate stove" to exclude GDF from the business.He also denied that the new trade mark was adopted so that Chung Tai, Foshan Foods and Shiwan Brewery could use it to take over thegoodwill of the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark products.</p>    <p class="heading">(5) Change of Trade Mark</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p358" name="p358">358.</a> It is unbelievable that for such a drastic measure of changing the trade mark of the wine from Pearl River Bridge to Zu Miao, thetwo distributors would only be notified in January 1995. Both of them were extremely reticent in disclosing their knowledge of thechange. The true picture only came at the end of the Defendants' evidence when Mr Yan gave evidence. Mr Yan said that the idea ofusing the Zu Miao trade mark was first conceived by Foshan Foods in 1993. At that time, the Government encouraged the enterprisesto develop their own brand (åµåç). The decision to change to Zu Miao was reached around the Spring Trade Fair of 1994. He saidShiwan Brewery and the distributors were also notified of Foshan Foods' decision around that time and at the end of 1994, there wasa business meeting in Shenzhen with the distributors and Shiwan Brewery in which Foshan Foods informed them that the Zu Miao wouldbe used.</p>    <p class="heading">(6) The decision to change the brewery</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p359" name="p359">359.</a> I accept Mr Dong's evidence that GDF's decision to instruct a new brewery to produce the rice wine including Super Mellow Mijiu andShiwan Mijiu was because of the newspaper announcement in January 1995. Mr Chen seemed to suggest that even before the newspaperannouncement, GDF had instructed other breweries to produce wine including Super Mellow Mijiu. He said that in November and December1994, the staff from the Shiwan Brewery was visiting the Namhai Xianhua Brewery and they discovered a few bottles of Super MellowMijiu in its laboratory. He further said that GDF had stopped placing orders for the çå°ç since July 1994. And there was a discoverythat large quantities of çå°ç were exported to Hong Kong with a different taste and without the certificate of quality inspection.What Mr Chen said regarding the discovery of Super Mellow Mijiu in the Namhai Xianhua Brewery was not put to any of the Plaintiffs'witnesses. I do not accept his evidence. I further accept Mr Dong's evidence that the reason why GDF stopped placing further orderswith Shiwan Brewery for other types of wine was because Shiwan Brewery had delayed in the production.</p>    <p class="heading">(7) Malice established</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p360" name="p360">360.</a> Stable J. in <strong>Wilts United Dairies, Ld. v. Thomas Robinson Sons &amp; Coy., Ld.</strong> [1957] Reports Of Patent, Design, And Trade Mark Cases 220 held that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"....

The third proposition which I derive from the cases is this, that if you publish an injurious falsehood which you know to be false,albeit that your only object is your own advantage and with no intention or desire to injure the person in relation to whose goodsthe falsehood is published, then provided that it is clear from the nature of the falsehood that it is intrinsically injurious Isay 'intrinsically', meaning not deliberately aimed with intent to injure but as being inherent in the statement itself, the defendantis responsible, the malice consisting in the fact that what he published he knew to be false."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>For ease of reading, I have numbered the three tests in the judgment.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p361" name="p361">361.</a> The issue is whether Shiwan Brewery had acted maliciously in causing the newspaper announcement to be published on 28th January 1995.Although Shiwan Brewery said that it was only responsible for its part of the announcement, it is clear that the wording of the twoannouncements was very similar. It is inconceivable that the newspaper announcements were prepared by each of them without consultingeach other and later inserted as one piece of publication. The heading of the announcement must be applicable to both of these announcements.I think the reality is that Shiwan Brewery and Foshan Foods must have discussed the matter beforehand before the newspaper announcementwas published.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p362" name="p362">362.</a> The heading referred to two other types of rice wine, namely, the Pearl River Bridge éè¸ and ä¸è¸. They were produced not onlyby the Shiwan Brewery but by other breweries as well. Whatever right Shiwan Brewery or Foshan Foods might consider to have in SuperMellow Mijiu and Shiwan Mijiu, clearly the announcement that only the Zu Miao Brand éè¸ and ä¸è¸ were genuine articles mustbe false. They must know that this announcement was false. In my view malice is established under the third proposition of StableJ. in <strong>Wilts United Dairies Limited</strong>.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p363" name="p363">363.</a> Malice is also established under the second proposition as well. It is clear that Shiwan Brewery had overstepped the line of simplyprotecting its own interest. The announcement that Zu Miao Brand wine were the genuine articles and the reference to prevention ofimitation is clearly for the purpose of harming GDF in respect of wine produced under the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p364" name="p364">364.</a> Likewise, the newspaper announcements by Tung Fook (1982) on 29th - 31st May 1995 clearly constituted the tort of injurious falsehood.Tung Fook (1982) just could not have any <em>bona fide</em> belief that it was entitled to register the Super Mellow Mijiu Trade Mark. The only other Super Mellow Mijiu available in the marketat that time was the Pearl River Bridge brand by GDF. The reference to the counterfeit products and infringing articles were clearlyintended to injure GDF.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p365" name="p365">365.</a> The series of letters written by Hastings and Co. to Yau Shing Hong (8th June 1995), Sun Fung Lin Trading Co. Ltd. (28th June 1995)and Park'n Shop (11th July 1995 after GDF adopted the new label) could only have been written under the instruction of Tung Fook(1982). These letters repeated the newspaper announcement of Tung Fook (1982) issued on 29th - 31st May 1995. These letters wentbeyond merely protecting the rights of Tung Fook (1982), but were clearly intended to cause harm to GDF.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p366" name="p366">366.</a> The newspaper article in Tin Tin Daily News on 2nd June 1995 appeared almost immediately after the newspaper announcements on theprevious three days. It is inconceivable that the writer of the article had not obtained information from either Shiwan Brewery orTung Fook (1982). However, it is not necessary for me to deal with this matter further.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p367" name="p367">367.</a> In considering the question of malice, it is relevant to consider the background in which these newspaper announcements and letterscame into being.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) On 5th November 1992, GDF notified Tung Fook (1982) that in future GDF would directly sign and carry out sales contracts in respectof the Super Mellow Mijiu.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) On 10th June 1993, Tung Fook (1982) applied to register the pictorial part of the Super Mellow Mijiu label when it was still thedistributor without notice to GDF.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) At the beginning of 1994, Shiwan Brewery signed the Production Agreement with GDF to produce for GDF the Pearl River Bridge lineof rice wine.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) At the beginning of 1994, Foshan Foods signed a licence agreement for the use of the Pearl River Bridge trade mark and label forone year ending 1st February 1995.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5) Tung Fook (1982) and Shiwan Brewery shortly before the expiry of the licence agreement embarked upon a series of publicationsof false statements making threats against GDF's distributor and Yau Shing Hong's retailers.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6) Tung Fook (1982) wrongfully obtained an assignment of the copyright in the Super Mellow Mijiu label.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p368" name="p368">368.</a> With this background, the publications were clearly made maliciously. Tung Fook (1982), Shiwan Brewery and in my view, Foshan Foodsas well, had clearly acted in concert in a scheme aiming at injuring GDF's business.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p369" name="p369">369.</a> The Plaintiffs further relied on some recent events, namely, in October 1998 it was discovered that Tung Fook (1982) had posted upon its show window the announcement which appeared in the Tin Tin Daily News of 29th - 31st May 1995. There was also a recent televisionadvertisement by Shiwan Brewery in which the Shiwan brand of Super Mellow Mijiu was said to have changed its design a bottle bearingthe Super Mellow Mijiu label now under consideration was shown in the advertisement. It is not necessary for me to make a findingof malice based on these two new events. What had transpired previously clearly establishes a cause of action of injurious falsehoodagainst Tung Fook (1982) and Shiwan Brewery.</p>    <p class="heading">Unlawful interference with business and contractual relationship</p>    <p class="heading">(1) The Law</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p370" name="p370">370.</a> In <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em> 17th ed. para.23-56, it is stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>Unlawful interference with economic and other interests.</em> There exists a tort of uncertain ambit which consists in one person using unlawful means with the object and effect of causing damageto another."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"For example, in <em>J. T. Stratford &amp; Son Ltd v. Lindley</em>, two of their Lordships gave, as an alternative ground of their decision that an injunction should lie, the fact that the defendantshad used unlawful means to interfere with the business of the plaintiffs. 'In addition to interfering with existing contracts therespondents' action made it practically impossible for the appellants to do any new business with the barge hirers. It was not disputedthat such interference with business is tortious if any unlawful means are employed.'"</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... damage is essential to the cause of action and must be shown to have been, or to be about to be, caused by the unlawful interference.'The essence of the tort is deliberate interference with the plaintiff's interests by unlawful means'; and the intention to injuremust be a 'contributing cause' of the plaintiff's loss."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p371" name="p371">371.</a> The Plaintiffs' claim is that the letters sent by the solicitors for Tung Fook (1982) consisted of false claims and unlawful threatswhich interfered with the contractual relationship between GDF and Yau Shing Hong and also the contractual relationship between thesetwo entities and their retailers. These letters clearly had such effect as shown by the withdrawal of the stocks from Park'n Shop.However, as I have already found for the Plaintiffs, it is not necessary for me to deal further with this cause of action.</p>    <p class="heading">Estoppel</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p372" name="p372">372.</a> The Plaintiffs further relied on estoppel against the Defendants. The grounds relied upon were the Trade Mark Licence Agreements,the Production Agreements, Tung Fook (1982)'s application to GDF to be a distributor of the Super Mellow Mijiu, Chung Tai's requestto GDF to reintroduce the Shiwan Mijiu, and its application to GDF to become a distributor of the Shiwan Mijiu. The Plaintiffs arguedthat the Defendants are estopped from denying that GDF is the proprietor of the Pearl River Bridge Trade Mark and of the labels ofthe two wine. In view of my findings in this case, I also do not think it is necessary for me to deal with this aspect of the Plaintiffs'claim.</p>    <p class="heading">Counterclaim</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p373" name="p373">373.</a> The Defendants are represented by Messrs Hastings &amp; Co. At one stage it ceased to act for the Defendants but has since resumedits representation. On 24th August 1998, Master Poon, on Hastings' application, allowed it to cease to act for the Defendants. Thiswas shortly before the case was due to resume for submission. Following this order, the Plaintiffs applied for security of costsagainst Tung Fook (1982). On 7th September 1998, I granted an order requiring Tung Fook (1982) which had lodged counterclaims againstthe Plaintiffs, to provide security for costs in the sum of HK$4 million. The security was not furnished within time and Tung Fook(1982)'s counterclaim was dismissed in accordance with the terms of my order.</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p374" name="p374">374.</a> In any event, Tung Fook (1982)'s counterclaim on passing-off of the Super Mellow Mijiu would fail because it was not the owner ofthe goodwill of the Super Mellow Mijiu. Further its counterclaim on infringement of the copyright of the Super Mellow Mijiu by GDFand Yau Shing Hong failed because the ownership of the copyright is not vested in Tung Fook (1982).</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p375" name="p375">375.</a> Likewise, the counterclaim by Shiwan Brewery on the passing-off of the Super Mellow Mijiu and the Shiwan Mijiu would also fail becauseagain it was not the owner of the goodwill of these two wine. Its claim based on the copyright of the Shiwan Mijiu label would alsofail because the ownership of the copyright vests in GDF.</p>    <p class="heading">Part IV</p>    <p class="heading">CONCLUSION</p>    <p><a class="pseudopara" id="p376" name="p376">376.</a> In the end, I find that the Plaintiffs are successful in their claims.

I wish to thank Counsel for their assistance. The solicitors on both sides have also spent much effort in thepreparation of the case and their work is also appreciated. The evidence in this case was given in Chinese without translation (exceptCantonese translation for Mandarin speaking witnesses) while the submission was given in English. This approach was adopted to maximizethe efficient use of Court time and service of Counsel.
