The Re-Amended Statement of Claim was filed on 2 September 2009.  The plaintiffs claimthat they have, by experience and extensive investments in research and development, developed a set of confidential informationfor the smooth, efficient and effective running of the groupâs business.  The confidential information includes operation manualsthat contain operation procedure, various types of production and procedural flow charts, forms and quality control manuals.  Theconfidential information also includes records of suppliers and customers.  There are pleaded a series of 14 schedules of documentswhich are included as the confidential information.  The plaintiffs further plead that the confidential information constitutes tradesecrets which have been treated by them in a confidential manner.  The staff of the plaintiffs are obliged not to disclose them toany 3rd party even after termination of employment with the plaintiffs</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  However, the 1st defendant has since May 2005 started to entice and recruit senior staff of the plaintiffs and procured such peopleto disclose the confidential information to the defendants without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiffs.  As a result, theplaintiffs claim that the 1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th defendants are liable to them for breach of the law of the Mainland against unfaircompetition.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The defendantsâ group then became a market leader and was in direct competition with the plaintiffs in the sale and productionof mobile handsets and components.  The plaintiffs complain that they as a result suffered loss and damage in the costs for producingthe confidential information, the compensation paid to others to whom the plaintiffs owed a duty to keep the information confidentialand loss of business opportunities to be assessed.  They also seek an account of profits from the defendants.  There are also a claimthat the defendants had wrongfully induced the plaintiffsâ former employees to breach their duties not to disclose the confidentialinformation without the consent of the plaintiffs and a claim of conspiracy by the defendants to unlawfully obtain and use the confidentialinformation.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>The defendantsâ counterclaim</i></p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The defendants were granted leave on 2 October 2009 to re-amend their defence and to bring in a counterclaim.  They were furthergranted leave to effect some minor re-re-amendments on 28 December 2009.  The defendantsâ counterclaim is directed to the 1st and2nd plaintiffs and two other companies in the plaintiffsâ group.  They are hereinafter referred to as the defendants by counterclaim.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The defendants plead in the counterclaim that the defendants by counterclaim have since 2006 been unlawfully interfering with thebusiness of the defendants by unlawful means with the object and effect of causing loss and damage to the defendants business.  Theysay that the defendants by counterclaim have embarked upon a course of conduct of procuring and using false and fabricated evidenceor evidence unlawfully obtained to launch proceedings and persecution against the plaintiffs and/or their employees.  The defendantsby counterclaim then made and issued false statements of and concerning the defendants to the effect that the defendants and/or theirstaff had allegedly stolen or misused the confidential information or trade secrets of the defendants by counterclaim.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The defendants then plead that the 4th defendant by counterclaim had in about May 2006 unlawfully detained a former employee inan attempt to obtain from this person false evidence of misappropriation and disclosure of confidential information to the defendants(para. 62).  There is a further allegation that the defendants by counterclaim had in about June/July 2006 planted soft copies ofdocuments in a computer and hard copies of documents at the apartment of this person without his knowledge or consent (paras. 63to 65).  There is another allegation that the 4th defendant by counterclaim had in around October 2006 unlawfully intimidated anotherformer employee to obtain a false confession from her to the effect that she had been procured to divulge confidential informationto someone working for the defendants (para. 66).</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  There is then an allegation that the defendants by counterclaim had in about September 2006 paid RMB10 million bribe to the thendirector of a Judicature Appraisal Centre for Intellectual Properties in Beijing to gain access to and/or tamper with the evidenceunder examination of the centre (para. 67).  There is then an allegation that the 1st, 3rd and/or 4th defendant by counterclaim hadin May/June 2008 paid brides to a then employee of the 7th defendant to induce him to breach his duty of confidence to the 7th defendantby fabricating evidence that certain of the plaintiffsâ documents had been passed amongst or used by some employees of the defendants(para. 68). </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The counterclaim contains some particulars of these allegations under paras. 62 to 68.  The defendants also provided some furtherand better particulars of these allegations on 26 February 2010.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The defendants then plead that the defendants by counterclaim did the acts alleged in paras. 62 to 68 to fabricate false evidenceto support the various legal proceedings and criminal complaints commenced by the 3rd and 4th defendants by counterclaim (the 1stand 2nd plaintiffs) against the defendants or their employees and to make and publish defamatory statements against the 1st defendant.

They further say that the allegations are put in to causeannoyance, abuse, prejudice and unnecessary anxiety, trouble and expense to them.

The essential ingredients of the tort of unlawful interference as set out by Lord Hoffman for the majority view in <i>OBG Ltd &amp; Anor v Allan &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%201%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 1 AC 1</a> at paras. 45 to 47 and summarised in <i>Bullen &amp; Leake &amp; Jacobâs Precedents of Pleadings</i>, 16<sup>th</sup> edn., para. 52-08 are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â52â08 Following the <i>OBG</i> case referred to above, the essential elements of this tort may be identified as follows:</p>        <p class="quote">(1) Use by the defendant of unlawful means, thereby</p>        <p class="quote">(2) Interfering with the actions of a third party in relation to the claimant.</p>        <p class="quote">(3) Intention to cause loss to the claimant.</p>        <p class="quote">(4) Damage.</p>        <p class="quote">per Lord Hoffman in the <i>OBG</i> case at paras 45-47.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Leading counsel for the plaintiffs and the defendants by counterclaim relies on the speech of Lord Hoffman in the <i>OBG Ltd</i> case and submits that the unlawful means must be actionable by the third party or would have been actionable if the third party hadsuffered loss.  Lord Hoffman said in para. 49:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â49. In my opinion, and subject to one qualification, acts against a third party count as unlawful means only if they are actionableby that third party. The qualification is that they will also be unlawful means if the only reason why they are not actionable isbecause the third party has suffered no loss. In the case of intimidation, for example, the threat will usually give rise to no causeof action by the third party because he will have suffered no loss. If he submits to the threat, then, as the defendant intended,the claimant will have suffered loss instead. It is nevertheless unlawful means. But the threat must be to do something which <i>would</i> have been actionable if the third party had suffered loss. Likewise, in <i>National Phonograph Co Ltd v Edison-Bell Consolidated Phonograph Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1908%5d%201%20Ch%20335" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1908] 1 Ch 335</a> the defendant intentionally caused loss to the plaintiff by fraudulently inducing a third party to act to the plaintiffâs detriment.The fraud was unlawful means because it would have been actionable if the third party had suffered any loss, even though in the eventit was the plaintiff who suffered. In this respect, procuring the actions of a third party by fraud (dolus) is obviously very similarto procuring them by intimidation (metus).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Leading counsel for the defendants however asks me not to overlook the minority speech of Lord Nicholls in this case.  Lord Nichollssaid in paras. 149 to 155:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â149. Although the need for âunlawful meansâ is well established, the same cannot be said about the content of this expression.There is some controversy about the scope of this expression in this context.</p>        <p class="quote">150. One view is that this concept comprises, quite simply, all acts which a person is not permitted to do. The distinction is betweenâdoing what you have a legal right to do and doing what you have no legal right to doâ: Lord Reid in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 1129</a>, 1168-1169. So understood, the concept of âunlawful meansâ stretches far and wide. It covers common law torts, statutory torts,crimes, breaches of contract, breaches of trust and equitable obligations, breaches of confidence, and so on.</p>        <p class="quote">151. Another view is that in this context âunlawful meansâ comprise only civil wrongs. Thus in <i>Allen v Flood</i> itself Lord Watson described illegal means as âmeans which in themselves are in the nature of civil wrongsâ: [1898] AC I, 97-98.A variant on this view is even more restricted in its scope: âunlawful meansâ are limited to torts and breaches of contract.</p>        <p class="quote">152. The principal criticism of the first, wider view is that it âtortifiesâ criminal conduct. The principal criticism of thesecond, narrower view is that it would be surprising if criminal conduct were excluded from the category of âunlawfulâ meansin this context. In the classical âthree-partyâ form of this tort the defendant seeks to injure the claimantâs business throughthe instrumentality of a third party. By this means, as Lord Lindley said, the claimant is âwrongfully and intentionally struckat through others, and is thereby damnifiedâ: <i>Quinn v Leathem</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1901%5d%20AC%20495" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1901] AC 495</a>, 535. It would be very odd if in such a case the law were to afford the claimant a remedy where the defendant committed or threatenedto commit a tort or breach of contract against the third party but not if he committed or threatened to commit a crime against him.In seeking to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable conduct it would be passing strange that a breach of contract shouldbe proscribed but not a crime. In <i>Rookes v Barnard</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 1129</a>, 1206-1207, Lord Devlin noted it was âof courseâ accepted that a threat to commit a crime was an unlawful threat and continued:</p>        <p class="quote">âIt cannot be said that every form of coercion is wrong. A dividing line must be drawn and the natural line runs between what islawful and unlawful as against the party threatened.â</p>        <p class="quote">153. These different views are founded on different perceptions of the rationale underlying the unlawful interference tort. On thewider interpretation of âunlawful meansâ the rationale is that by this tort the law seeks to curb clearly excessive conduct.The law seeks to provide a remedy for intentional economic harm caused by unacceptable means. The law regards all unlawful meansas unacceptable in this context.</p>        <p class="quote">154. On the narrower interpretation this tort has a much more limited role. On this interpretation the function of the tort of unlawfulinterference is a modest one. Its function is to provide a claimant with a remedy where intentional harm is inflicted indirectlya distinct from directly. If a defendant intentionally harms a claimant directly by committing an actionable wrong against him, theusual remedies are available to the claimant. The unlawful interference tort affords a claimant a like remedy if the defendant intentionallydamages him by committing an actionable wrong against a third party. The defendantâs civil liability is expanded thus far, butno further, in respect of damage intentionally caused by his conduct.</p>        <p class="quote">155.     In my view the former is the true rationale of this tort.  The second interpretation represents a radical departure fromthe purpose for which this tort has been developed. If adopted, this interpretation would bring about an unjustified and unfortunatecurtailment of the scope of this tort.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Leading counsel for the defendants further refers to the speech of Lord Walker in the same case.  Lord Walker suggested that neitherof the views of Lord Hoffman and Lord Nicholls would be the last word on this difficult and important area of the law (para. 269).</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Leading counsel also refers to <i>Revenue and Customers Commissioners v Total Network SL</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%201%20AC%201174" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 1 AC 1174</a> at para. 43 where Lord Hope expressed his reservation on Lord Hoffmanâs view in <i>OBG Ltd</i> on unlawful means.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Leading counsel submits that the law of unlawful interference is developing and unlawful means should not be limited to actionablewrongs, but should include other wrongful acts like criminal conduct.  Counsel asks me to at least leave this issue for the trialjudge who will have the advantage of hearing all the evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Apart from the nature of the unlawful means, the plaintiffs and the defendants by counterclaim also submit that para. 62 of thecounterclaim does not allege any loss or damage to the defendants and nothing is pleaded to flow from the detention of Ping.  Para.62 and its further and better particular also do not suggest that any evidence has in fact been fabricated or obtained.  What isalleged in para. 62 is only an attempt to persuade Ping to give false evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Regarding paras. 63 to 65, para. 63 pleads the planting of soft copies of documents on Pingâs computer, para. 64 pleads the plantingof hard copies at his apartment and para. 65 pleads the seizure of the documents by the Baoan PSB.  Counsel however points out theabsence of any particulars on how, when and by whom the hard and soft copies were planted. Counsel refers to <i>Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1940%5d%20AC%20152" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1940] AC 152</a> at 169-170 where Lord Wright said that inference from objective facts had to be distinguished from conjecture or speculation andthe method of inference would fail in the absence of positively proved facts.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Counsel also submits that the inferences suggested by the defendants are obviously unsustainable.  Furthermore, the serious natureof the allegation which amount to perverting the course of justice must be supported by particulars from which inference can be drawn.Since the defendants have failed to supply the particulars, the allegation should be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Counsel further argues that the planting of hard and soft copies of document on Ping does not give rise to a wrong actionable byPing.  On the majority view in <i>OBG Ltd</i>, these allegations do not support the defendantsâ claim of unlawful interference.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Regarding para. 66 of the counterclaim which alleges the unlawful intimidation of Zhang by Wu in October 2006 to obtain a falseconfession from Zhang that Jun had procured/induced her to divulge confidential information, counsel submits that the allegationcontained nothing unlawful and there is no suggestion that Wu and Yang were seeking a knowingly false confession from Zhang.  Thereis also no allegation that any confession had indeed been obtained from Zhang during the train journey on 17 October 2006.  The allegedconfession was only made some six days later to the public security officers.  The defendants could not plead to any link betweenthe alleged intimidation and the false statement given six days later.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Regarding the allegation of bribery in para. 67, counsel says that the defendants want to invite the court to infer that the harddrive had been tampered with.  The defendantsâ case as supplemented by the further and better particulars is that there were 17more documents in the hard drive on 25 February 2008 than on 28 August 2006.  But the defendants have to plead and prove that thesedocuments were added by an employee of the defendants by counterclaim to a USB drive on 29 September 2007 and they were added fromthe USB drive to the hard drive by employee of the Appraisal Centre.  The defendants also have to plead what documents were in factadded.  Para. 67 therefore failed to plead the necessary facts to make out a case of tampering with evidence.  No inference of actualtampering with evidence by the defendants by counterclaim can be drawn from the allegation.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Counsel also submits that the alleged bribery of Zhao Jun is irrelevant as that did not lead to any consequence that could supporta case of unlawful interference by the defendants by counterclaim.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Counsel further submits that in any case, all references to âtamperingâ should be struck out as being scandalous, frivolous,vexatious and embarrassing and an abuse of the process of the court because necessary facts have not been pleaded.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Finally, regarding the allegation of Wang Pengyu paying bribes to Zhang Chaozheng, the defendants admit that no document was eversent out by Zhang Chaozheng and no evidence fabricated.  Hence, counsel submits that even if brides had indeed been paid, nothingresulted from them and no consequence was caused to the defendants.  The defendants therefore suffered no detriment or loss.  Withoutloss or damage to the defendants, there could not be any claim of unlawful interference. </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Alternatively, counsel says all references to âfabricationâ should be struck out as being scandalous, frivolous and vexatiousand embarrassing and an abuse of the process of the court because the defendants have admitted that no fabrication had occurred.</p>    <p class="heading">The defendantsâ arguments in opposition</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The defendants first explain the structure of the counterclaim of unlawful interference which has been explained above in the introductionof the counterclaim.  Para. 61 is the general allegation that the defendants by counterclaim had since around 2006 embarked upona course of conduct by unlawful means to cause loss or harm to the business of the defendants.  Paras. 62-68 then provide the materialfacts of the alleged course of conduct.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Para. 69 repeats the purpose of the course of conduct.  Para. 70 says that the ultimate objective of the course of conduct is toinjure and cause loss to the defendants.  Paras. 71 to 84 provide the particulars of the proceedings and prosecutions.  Para. 85pleads the general particulars of the public statements and announcements.  Para. 86 pleads the loss and damage suffered by the defendantsas a result of the course of conduct.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  All these paragraphs form part of the counterclaim against the defendants by counterclaim for unlawful interference with the defendantsâbusiness and economic interests.  Paras. 62 to 68 contain the material facts of the alleged course of conduct for procuring falseor fabricated evidence. </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Regarding para. 62, the defendants further submit that it pleads the attempt of the defendants by counterclaim to obtain false evidencefrom Ping by unlawfully detaining him, coercing and intimating him to falsely confess that he had disclosed the confidential documentof the 4th defendant by counterclaim to Jun.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The matters pleaded form part of the course of conduct of the defendants by counterclaim as pleaded in para. 61.  This attempt isfollowed by the allegation of planting of soft and hard copies of documents in Pingâs computer and apartment during the wrongfuldetention as pleaded in paras. 63 to 65.  The planting of documents resulted in fabrication of evidence against Ping.  It is thereforewrong for the plaintiffs and the defendants by counterclaim to have considered para. 62 in isolation of the other paragraphs andignored that this paragraph is just part of the course of conduct.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  The loss and damage resulting from the course of conduct to the defendants is also pleaded in para. 82.  The quantum is for assessmentat the trial.  Therefore, the fact that para. 62 alone does not constitute a cause of action is not a reason for striking it out. Its allegations are material to the issues between the parties.  The defendants also disagree that the plea in para. 62 is frivolous,vexatious, embarrassing or otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.  They say that the defendants by counterclaim would notbe prejudiced by this plea as they can refute the allegations.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Regarding paras. 63 to 65, the allegations are the planting of soft copy documents in Pingâs computer and hard copy documentsin his apartment during the period of alleged unlawful detention.  The defendants further plead in the further and better particularsfor para. 63 that Pingâs computer had been tampered by an employee of the defendants by counterclaim and documents unrelated toPingâs work were then found in a drive of Pingâs computer where Ping did not save his documents. </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The defendants also plead in the further and better particulars for para. 64 that an employee of the defendants by counterclaimhad remained in Pingâs apartment after Ping and other people had left.  A search of a bookshelf at the apartment was conductedlater and this employee went straight to the bookshelf and took out a stack of documents. This person knew exactly where the documentswere.  Ping had not seen such documents before.  There was no then further search of the apartment. </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The defendants submit that there is no basis to strike out paras. 63 to 65 when they are read with the further and better particulars. There is no alternative explanation on why the documents should have appeared in Pingâs computer and his apartment.  The defendantsâcontention of planting cannot be said to be unarguable and, if Ping can give credible evidence on this, the court may draw the inferenceof planting. </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The defendants further point out that the authorities relied on by the other side on drawing of inferences do not relate to strikingout.  They are on drawing of inference at the trial. </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  The documents alleged to have been planted are those alleged to be confidential information by the plaintiffs and are amongst thosein Schedules 1 to 14 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim.  Hence, the lack of full particulars before discovery and exchange ofwitness statement should not prejudice the defendants by counterclaim and they cannot be said to have difficulty in pleading theirdefence.  The particulars of the planted soft copies will also be available once the hard drive of Pingâs computer is releasedby the Baoan PSB for examination.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Regarding the argument that planting of documents is not an actionable civil wrong at the instance of Ping and hence no claim ofunlawful interference can be made by the defendants, the defendants argue that planting of evidence certainly constitutes criminalacts.  Furthermore, other former employees of the defendants by counterclaim can maintain civil actions of malicious prosecutionsagainst the defendants by counterclaim as they have used the planted false evidence to prosecute these former employees.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Para. 66 pleads unlawful intimidation of Zhang to obtain a false confession from her that Jun had procured or induced her to divulgeconfidential information of the 4th defendant by counterclaim.  The defendants submit that Zhang had been beaten up by the publicsecurity officers, taken on a 20-hour train journey from Weinan to Shenzhen in the company of the public security officials and anemployee of the 4th defendant by counterclaim.  She was interrogated by a public security official aggressively and with threatsto her father too.  As a result of the threats, she yielded and gave a false confession that Jun had asked her to disclose the confidentialinformation of the defendants by counterclaim.  The false admission had also been used to support legal proceedings against Jun andthus caused damage to Jun.  Zhang therefore has a cause of action of intimation against the defendants by counterclaim.  The actof the employee of the 4th defendant by counterclaim also constitutes criminal offences under the laws of Hong Kong. </p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Regarding the argument of lack of dispute of causal link raised by the defendants by counterclaim, namely that Zhang only made aconfession to the public security officers six days later, the defendants submit that this is a matter for the trial.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Para. 67 pleads the alleged bribery of Zhao Jun by the defendants by counterclaim for access to the computer which was being examinedby the Appraisal Centre.  The defendants raised four questions.  They asked why the defendants by counterclaim had bribed Zhao andwhy they were given access to a USB drive containing documents.  These documents were relevant to the 2006 PRC Action brought bythe defendants by counterclaim and they were copied to the hard drive of a computer under examination by the Appraisal Centre byan Employee of the Centre pursuant to Zhao Junâs instruction.  They also queried why there were 17 additional documents in thefolders of Jun and Xi which were not there in August 2006 when the hard drives were first seized.  They further challenged the defendantsby counterclaim to explain their withdrawal of the 2006 PRC Action after the defendants had challenged the credibility of the reportand suggested that the hard drives had been tampered.  They submit that if there are no plausible explanations to these questions,then the inference argued by the defendants that there was tampering of the hard drive cannot be said to be unsustainable.  In anycase, the issue of tampering is a matter for the trial judge. </p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  They also say that the defendants by counterclaim can plead to this allegation and no prejudice is caused to them by the lack offull particulars before discovery and exchange of witness statement.  The full particulars of the additional documents will be knownafter the hard drive is a released by the Shenzhen Intermediate Peopleâs Court for forensic examination.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  In answer to whether the bribery of Zhao Jun would amount to unlawful means, the defendants argue that the use of the tampered evidenceconstitute unlawful means as it would support a claim of malicious prosecution and is a criminal act.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Finally, there is the allegation in para. 68 of bribery of Zhang Chaozheng, an employee of the defendants, by the defendants bycounterclaim.  The bribes are alleged to induce Zhang to fabricate evidence that certain of the defendantsâ documents, which werealleged to belong to the defendants by counterclaim, had been passed amongst and/or used by the employees of the defendants.  Thoughthe defendants say that Zhang had refused to assist the defendants by counterclaim, they say that the matter pleaded is still relevantas it forms an integral part of the course of conduct engaged in by the defendants by counterclaim with the intention of creatingfalse evidence to interfere with the business of the defendants.</p>    <p class="heading">Analysis and decision</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The approach of the plaintiffs and the defendants by counterclaim is to consider each of paras. 62 to 68 of the counterclaim individuallyand in isolation of the others.  However, para. 61 of the counterclaim refers to a course of conduct of the defendants by counterclaim. The course of conduct was of procuring and using false or fabricated evidence and/or evidence unlawfully obtained to launch proceedings/prosecutionsagainst the plaintiffs and/or their staff and to make false public announcements that the defendants and/or their staff had stolen/misusedthe defendantsâ confidential information.  The particulars of the course of conduct is then pleaded in paras. 62 to 68 and thefurther and better particulars given for them.  Any individual allegation in these paragraphs is a part of the alleged course ofconduct and not a self-contained allegation constituting a claim in its own right.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  The defendants plead and seek to prove a course of conduct which would support the claims pleaded in para. 61.  It is not necessaryfor each and every of the pleaded acts to have accomplished its desired result before the course of conduct can be established. It is therefore inappropriate to consider each individual allegation in isolation from the others.  All allegations in paras. 62to 68 should be considered together and see if they together can constitute the alleged course of conduct to support the claims pleadedin para. 61.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  For the claim of unlawful interference, the majority view in <i>OBG Ltd</i> no doubt requires a wrong actionable by the 3rd party.  However, I cannot overlook the fact that this cause of action is still developingand the reasons of Lord Nicholls in his dissent are indeed powerful.  Lord Hope in <i>Revenue and Customs Commissioners</i> has also expressed his reservation about the majority view of <i>OBG Ltd</i>.  In the light of these, I think it is premature to strike out this claim at this stage just on the ground of absence of an actionablewrong to the 3rd party.  I think this plea should be allowed to develop and be decided by the trial judge who would be able to hearall the evidence of the parties.  Furthermore, the summary of the defendantsâ submissions above shows that there are the claimsof intimidation and malicious prosecution that are open to some of the former employees of the defendants by counterclaim.  For thesereasons, I do not think I should strike out paras. 62 to 68.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Furthermore, regarding para. 62, though no evidence was fabricated or obtained by detaining Ping, it is part and parcel of the defendantsâallegation that the defendants by counterclaim have tried to procure false evidence which included the planting of soft and hardcopy documents as pleaded in paras. 63 to 65.  Although para. 62 alone does not constitute a course of action, I do not think itshould be strike out.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Regarding paras. 63 to 65, the argument of absence of particulars have been answered by the defendants.  They say that the defendantsby counterclaim can plead to the these paragraphs and no prejudice has arisen to them.  Furthermore, the cases relied on by the plaintiffsand the defendants to counterclaim on when inference can be drawn are relevant to the drawing inference at the trial.  I agree withthe defendants that their allegations are not so weak that no inference can be drawn even if they can all be proved with credibleevidence.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Regarding para. 66, the plaintiffs and the defendants by counterclaim argue that there was no suggestion that Wu and Yang were seekinga knowingly false confession from Zhang.  However, given the circumstances of the alleged detention, intimidation and aggressiveinterrogation, it was plain to Zhang on what was expected from her.  This issue should be for the trial judge.  The causal link ofthe confession given by Zhang six days later should likewise be reserved for the trial judge.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Regarding para. 67, the attack on the lack of particulars of the 17 additional documents has been answered by the defendants.  Thereis also no prejudice to the defendants by counterclaim as they can plead to this allegation.  If the four questions raised by thedefendants cannot receive plausible explanations, then there would be the issue of whether any inference, and if so, what inferenceshould be drawn. </p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  If para. 67 can survive the attack, I also do not see why the references to âtamperingâ with evidence should be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Finally, for the alleged bribery of Zhang Chaozheng in para. 68, I also think that this is part of the alleged course of conductalleged by the defendants and should not be struck out. </p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  I also do not think I should strike out the references to âfabricationâ if I should allow para. 68 to remain.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  In the premises, I do not think any part of paras. 62 to 68 should be struck out.  It follows that there is no consequential strikingout either.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  I therefore dismiss the Re-Amended Summons to strike out issued by the plaintiffs and the defendants by counterclaim.  I also makea costs order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiffs and the defendants by counterclaim do pay the defendantsâ costs of this application.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="border-collapse: collapse">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(L.
