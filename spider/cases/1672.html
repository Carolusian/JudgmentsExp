What remains for Lam is the questionof quantum. Lam was absent during the trial. The two actions were tried together.</p>    <p class="heading">I. Liability</p>    <p class="heading">Plaintiff's case</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The plaintiff was a cleaning worker employed by Jamsart. On 21 January 2001, at about 6 a.m., the plaintiff was deployed to workoutside Fei Fei Hot Pot Restaurant in Wanchai ("the Restaurant"). The Restaurant was on Jaffe Road between Marsh Road and TonnochyRoad. The plaintiff was assigned to clean the signage about 7 feet above the front entrance of the Restaurant. The signage was about26 feet wide. There were four Chinese characters "Fei Fei Hot Pot" reading from left to right. Facing the signage, the first character"Fei" was near Marsh Road, and the last character "Pot" was near Tonnochy Road.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The plaintiff was up on a 6 foot A-shape folding wooden ladder provided by Jamart. He was straddling the two sides of the ladderand his feet were on the fourth rung. He was facing the signage and cleaning the character "Pot". He noticed a man and a woman (lateridentified to be Lam) quarrelling. He did not pay attention to them and continued working. The next thing the plaintiff knew washe fell down the ladder. There was no one to hold the ladder for him while he was working.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The plaintiff relied on part of the oral evidence of his supervisor Michael Levi Lei ("Lei"): Lei said he first noticed Lam and theman on the opposite pavement at the corner of Jaffe and Marsh. They were making loud noises. They crossed Jaffe Road diagonally towardsTonnochy Road. Lei saw Lam grab the man's clothes, throw her handbag at the man, throw banknotes at the man three times. They werepulling and pushing each other and they moved to a taxi parked just beyond the right end of shop front of the Restaurant near TonnochyRoad. Lam jumped and stood on the bonnet of the taxi. The man pulled Lam down and she lied on the bonnet. They got entangled andboth skidded onto the ground. The man got up and pulled Lam up. They continued pulling and pushing in front of the taxi. Suddenly,Lam gave a loud cry and rushed to push the ladder. The plaintiff fell with the ladder onto the ground.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The plaintiff also relied on Lei's police statement which had been confirmed by him in evidence:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I saw the wooden ladder, after being pushed, closing and falling onto the ground. At the same time I saw Yeung Tung Sang fallingfrom the ladder onto the ground as well."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> On 13 July 2001, Lam pleaded guilty before a magistrate for inflicting grevious bodily harm on the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The plaintiff's primary case is that in the circumstances, the disorderly conduct of Lam and the man presented a danger to him andLei failed to prevent the danger to the plaintiff by holding the ladder and/or asking him to come down.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiff's secondary case was that the ladder was not a safe equipment in the circumstances. There was no brace to fix the twosides from folding inwards. There was only a piece of string connecting the two sides to stop it from opening too far. Had therebeen a brace fixing the two sides, the ladder would not have closed before it fell.</p>    <p class="heading">Jamsart's case</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Jamsart's case is that the act of Lam in pushing the ladder was not reasonably foreseeable. Further, the statement in Lei's policestatement that the ladder had closed before it fell was misrecorded.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> There is a dispute as to the position of the ladder. Lei said the plaintiff was cleaning the first character "Fei" instead of "Pot",and the ladder was closer to Marsh Road and further away from the parked taxi.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Lei said he had been standing at the parking meter near the first character "Fei". He could look through the glass panel into theRestaurant where his other workers were working, and at the same time was in a position to give assistance to the plaintiff, if necessary.He said he was concerned with the behaviour of Lam and the man and observed them to see whether they would come over to endangerthe plaintiff on the ladder. However, he said it was not necessary to warn the plaintiff nor to hold the ladder as:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(a)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">he thought Lam and the man were merely flirting intensely and were not violent;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(b)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">they were a long distance (about 18 to 19 feet) away from the plaintiff;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(c)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">after the entanglement on the taxi, they were moving away from the plaintiff;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(d)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">Lam's act in dashing to the ladder was unpredictable.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> There is also a dispute as to whether there were yellow plastic panels to warn pedestrian to keep away from the slippery floor. Leisaid there were, while the plaintiff said although some panels were purchased recently, they were not displayed.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Lei said the reference to the closing of the ladder in his police statement was misrecorded. He never told the police that the ladderclosed first before it fell.</p>    <p class="heading">Assessment of the evidence</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Photographs taken by the police at the scene were produced. They showed the position of the ladder in relation to the Restaurant,and they did not show any yellow warning panels.

During cross-examination, he said the part relatingto the closing of the ladder before it collapsed was misrecorded. The statement was given in the evening of the accident, and Leisaid his memory was still fresh then. He had made amendments to other parts of the statement and initialled them.

A child climbed down the hole. When he cameout he kicked over one of the lamps. It fell into the hole and caused an explosion. The child was burn. The child was burn. LordReid said at pp 845 and 847:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"So we have (first) a duty owned by the workmen, (secondly) the fact that if they had done as they ought to have done there wouldhave been no accident, and (thirdly) the fact that the injuries suffered by the appellant, though perhaps different in degree, didnot differ in kind from injuries which might have resulted from an accident of a foreseeable nature. The ground on which this casehas been decided against the appellant is that the accident was of an unforeseeable type. Of course, the pursuer has to prove thatthe defender's fault caused the accident, and there could be a case where the intrusion of a new and unexpected factor could be regardedas the cause of the accident rather than the fault of the defender. But that is not this case. The cause of this accident was a knownsource of danger, the lamp, but it behaved in an unpredictable way."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"This accident was caused by a known source of danger, but caused in a way which could not have been foreseen, and, in my judgment,that affords no defence."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The relevant passage in <strong>The Wagon Mound No. 1</strong> is per Viscount Simonds at p 425:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If, as admittedly it is, B's liability (culpability) depends on the reasonable foreseeability of the consequent damage, how is thatto be determined except by the foreseeability of the damage which in fact happened - the damage in suit?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> In <strong>Jolly v Sutton Borough Council</strong>, Lord Steyn held at p 1090:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"But this is to take one sentence in the judgment in <em>The Wagon No. 1</em> out of context. Viscount Simonds was in no way suggesting that the precise <em>manner</em> of which the injury occurred nor its extent had to be foreseeable. And Lord Reid was saying no more. The speech of Lord Reid in <em>Hughes v Lord Advocate is</em> in harmony with the other judgments. It is not in conflict with <em>The Wagon Mound No. 1</em>. The scope of the two modifiers - the precise manner in which the injury came about and its extent - is not definitively answeredby either <em>The Wagon Mound No. 1</em> or <em>Hughes v Lord Advocate</em>. It requires determination in the context of an intense focus on the circumstances of each case: see <em>Fleming, Law of Torts</em> 9th ed (1988) pp 240-243."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Lord Hoffman also said at p 1901:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" It is also agreed that the plaintiff must show that the injury which he suffered fell within the scope of the council's duty andthat in cases of physical injury, the scope of the duty is determined by whether or not the injury fell within a description whichcould be said to have been reasonably foreseeable. <em>Donoghue v Stevenson</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1932%5d%20AC%20562" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1932] A.C. 562</a> of course established the general principle that reasonable foreseeability of physical injury to another generates a duty of care.The further proposition that reasonable foreseeability also governs the question of whether the injury comes within the scope ofthat duty had to wait until <em>Overseas Tankship (U.K.) Ltd. v. Morts Dock and Engineering Co. Ltd. (The Wagon Mound)</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1961%5d%20AC%20388" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1961] A.C. 388</a> (<em>"The Wagon Mound No. 1"</em>) for authoritative recognition. Until then, there was a view that the determination of liability involved a two-stage process. Theexistence of a duty depended upon whether the injury of some kind was foreseeable. Once such a duty had been established, the defendantwas liable for any injury which had been 'directly caused' by an act in breach of that duty, whether such injury was reasonably foreseeableor not. But the present law is that unless the injury is of a description which was reasonably foreseeable, it is (according to taste)'outside the scope of the duty' or 'too remote'.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It is also agreed that what must have been foreseen is not the precise injury which occurred but injury of a given description.

He was injured by the assailant throwingsulphuric acid at him. The assailant was a psychiatric patient registered with another hospital. She had visited the centre beforeand made complaints about the doctors at the centre. On the day of the incident, the assailant started making complaints again. Shebecame agitated and began to throw sulphuric acid on persons around her. The plaintiff was injured while trying to scatter the crowd.There was evidence that the defendant actually knew there had been other incidents of violence at the centre before, and that theassailant was actually mentally unstable. Cheung J said at p 337 that one must judge the likelihood of harm with reference to thestate of knowledge which could be attributed to the defendant at the time of the occurrence. Given the nature of the centre and otherincidents of violence, the defendant was held to know or ought to have known there was a real risk of injury of the visitors to thecentre towards the staff working there. The defendant was liable for failing to take precaution to safeguard the plaintiff from therisk of injury. The decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal ([2001]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=3%20HKLRD%20209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">3 HKLRD 209).</a></p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> In this case, Jamsart's supervisor Lei was present at the scene of the commotion and Jamsart had knowledge of all the circumstances.Lei was actually concerned that the behaviour of Lam and the man might endanger the plaintiff.

Further, given the design of the ladder that it had no brace to secure the positionof the two sides, <em>a fortiori</em>, the defendant had to take reasonable precaution to safeguard the plaintiff from falling. It is not important that the ladder wastoppled by a deliberate push by Lam as opposed to an accidental contact during their pushing and pulling.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> I find that Jamsart was in breach of duty in failing to take reasonable precaution to ensure the ladder was not toppled by the movementof Lam and the man.

He disagreed with Dr. Annegers method of adding up the annual risk from the1st to 30th year as the number of years up to the time of assessment where no epilepsy has occurred are irrelevant.

In those cases, the plaintiffs sufferedreduction of degree of mobility and require treatment for the rest of their lives. They are more substantial injuries than the presentcase.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> In <strong>Ip Shuk Hing v Yuen Yuk Wai &amp; anor</strong> HCPI 216/1999 (date of judgment 11 August 2000) per Deputy Judge McMahon (as he then was) referred to in <strong>Tse Ngan Heung v Lo Sin Tak &amp; anor</strong> HCPI 565/1999 (date of judgment 10 January 2002) cited by Mr. Ismail, the plaintiff there, a 42-year old woman, had a traffic accidentand sustained physical injury to her right knee involving a hairline fracture of the small bone called Gerdys tubercle and also receiveda blow to her head which resulted in a haematoma and loss of consciousness. The judge found that she suffered minor degree of permanentdisability in her right leg, an overall mild degree of Post Concussion Syndrome and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, mild to moderatecognitive deficit, mild level of symptoms of headache, instability and dizziness, insomnia and anxiety. An award of $300,000 wasmade for PSLA.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> In my assessment, the award for PSLA should be $450,000.</p>    <p class="heading">Loss of pre-trial of earnings</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> Jamsart disputed the average monthly wage of $12,593 as the plaintiff had to work on every working day in order to receive the hardworking bonus. Be that as it may, $12,593 is the average figure taking from the List of Earnings for January to December 2000 filedby Jamsart. I find that the average monthly earnings at the time of accident were $12,593.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Jamsart submitted that even if the accident had not occurred, the plaintiff could not hold on to the high wages as there was downwardtrend in the wages. The replacement worker was only paid a basic wage of $6,800 per month. Other new employees in September 2002were paid basic wage of no more than $7,800 and they were younger and fitter, also they possessed driving licence.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> I have found that the plaintiff was dismissed for loss of productivity as a result of the accident. I also find that his reducedearnings during the resumption of employment at Jamsart/Cheong Lai was due to his loss of productivity as a result of the injuries.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> Although the plaintiff had to work at height of 1/F, he did not belong to the specialist category of workers which had to work atgreat height, e.g. on suspended gondola. Given the relatively lack of security in of the type of cleaning job the plaintiff usedto hold, he is not immune from the general downward trend in wages.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> I accept that since September 2002, the basic wage for plaintiff's pre-accident job should be between $6,800 and $7,800. Even so,the new recruits earn about twice the statistical wages of ordinary cleaners. There will be overtime and bonuses additionally. Asbest as can be, I assess the median wage after the September 2002 until trial as $10,500.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> The assessment for pre-trial loss of earnings is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(a)</td>                <td width="50%">Sick leave period (21/1/01 - 5/3/02)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td width="50%">$12,593 x 13.5 months = $170,005.50</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td width="50%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(b)</td>                <td width="50%">Resumed employment at Jamsart/Cheong Lai (6/3/02 - 31/8/02)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td width="50%">$12,593 x 6 months - $42,150 = $33,408.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td width="50%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(c)</td>                <td width="50%">Job hunting between Cheong Lai and Cheung Kee (September 2002)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td width="50%">$10,500 x 1 month = $10,500.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td width="50%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(d)</td>                <td width="50%">Present employment with Cheung Kee (October 2002 to mid-October 2003)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td width="50%">($10,500 - $4,800) x 12.5 months = $71,250.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td width="50%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td width="50%">Total: $285,163.50</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Loss of future earnings</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> Mr. Ismail suggested that the appropriate multiplier is 16. Mr. Lim submitted that the plaintiff was able to return to pre-accidentwork and there is no loss. I have ruled that there is a loss of productivity by reason of the plaintiff's fear of height. I findthere is loss of future earnings by reason of the disability to work at height of 1/F.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> As the wage trend has more or less stabilised, I adopt the medium wage of $10,500 as in the case of pre-trial loss.

The deduction for present/notional earnings is $4,800.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> Hence, the loss of future earnings is ($10,500 - $4,800) x 12 months x 16 = $1,094,400.00.</p>    <p class="heading">Loss of Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) entitlement</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> The date of the accident is after the introduction of MPF.

He has been able to hold on to such kind of job without muchinterruption. The sort of handicap he may face in the labour market upon a change of employment is his lack of confidence upon theconsciousness of the surgical dent and general bad mood.
