Its director, Ng, came to Hong Kong and has been living heresince 1993.  Ng came to know Law in early 1995 and they discussed about supplying beer-brewing equipment to manufacturers in themainland.  This resulted, at least at one stage in May 1995, in some kind of joint venture between the plaintiff and Law.  Law introducedthe plaintiff to a German supplier which was a German company called âJAUST KEL-Anlagen GmbHâ (â<i>the German supplier</i>â or â<i>Jaust</i>â).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  There was delay on the German supplierâs part to ship the equipment despite part payment having been made.  Parts of the equipmentwere however delivered to Wuhan in early 1996.  But the delivered equipment was defective and the plaintiff informed Law and theGerman supplier of this and sought compensation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Further, the plaintiff alleges that the German supplier used forged documents and misrepresentations to induce it to enter intoa sale and purchase agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Discussions intended for settling the matter did not bear fruit.  In December 1996, Ng asked Tsang to help resolve the matter throughlegal action.  This led to the matters set out under the next heading below.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The Plaintiffâs Case on Liability</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Since July 1996, Ng started to enquire about the costs for commencing civil claims against Law and/or the German supplier.

They all played little or no part in the dealings between Ng and Tsang/the defendant during the period from December 1996 to March1999.  Chan recalls having met Ng in mid-1997.  Wong, Lee and Ms. Wong all said they met Ng in the defendantâs firm in February1999 (twice in the case of Lee).  Wong has also seen Ng in the office a few times before then.  Ng told Chan he had paid about HK$600,000to Tsang whereas Ng told Wong a few days earlier some HK$200,000 to 300,000 had been paid to Tsang.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The testimony of the above witnesses from the defendantâs firm is relevant to my consideration of the veracity and/or reliabilityof Ngâs testimony.  There are variances between him and those witnesses regarding several matters.  The first important matteris how often Ng has been to the office of the defendantâs firm.  The second important matter is whether the plaintiff has paidany sum(s) to Tsang and, if so, how much has been paid to him.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Having considered all the materials before me, I make the following findings as regards the witnessesâ credibility and reliability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I find Ng to be truthful and reliable in relation to his claim that it was reasonable to think that Tsang was a solicitor in thedefendantâs firm.

(b) above, I prefer the testimony of Ng to that of Wong.  Ng has given a statement to the police in March1999.  He already claimed the plaintiff had paid Tsang a total sum of around HK$600,000 then.  But I do not accept his assertionthat the defendant knew of Tsangâs fraud at the time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The defendant has filed 2 witness statements.  In the supplemental witness statement, he asserts in effect that he has properlysupervised Tsangâs work in relation to the plaintiffâs claim.  This, however, was not the impression given by a fair readingof his first witness statement.  There is a glaring absence of anything about supervising Tsangâs work in that document.  In anyevent, having considered the overall circumstance, I reject the defendantâs testimony in relation to any assertion that he hasproperly supervised Tsang at the relevant time.  However, I accept that the defendant knew of Tsangâs misdeeds only after the event.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Relevant Legal Principles regarding Liability</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  In this action, it is not part of the defence that Tsangâs deeds were lawful (or otherwise justifiable).  This stance is indeedsensible in view that Tsang faced 9 charges in a criminal prosecution and pleaded guilty to 6 of them.  Two of the charges concernedhis having received from Ng 2 respective sums of HK$20,000 and 30,000.  He denied, however, 3 charges of having deceived Ng 3 respectivesums of HK$160,000, 240,000 and 110,000 (a total of HK$510,000).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The essence of the defence in relation to liability is this.

I consider close connection to be an intellectually satisfyingand practical criterion for vicarious liability. It imposes vicarious liability when, but only when, it would be fair and just todo so. And it provides a workable concept, namely a sufficiently close connection, for determining in each case whether doing sowould be fair and just.

The "close connection"test confronts that question in that way. There is no conclusive precedent to the contrary.

In regard to vicarious liability,the nature of the employment is not to be ascertained merely by attempting to tabulate the employee's duties.

It is in fact not evenevidence of negligence, this being one of the ultimate questions which this court has to determine in this action.

The defendantâs letter was written in response to the plaintiffâs complaint to the Law Society and can be summarised asfollows.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  It first refers to the plaintiffâs complaint and records that Tsang pleaded guilty to 6 charges and was sentenced to 2 yearsâimprisonment.  The response to the plaintiffâs complaint was then set out.  The following are the parts relevant to this action:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â[Tsang] has more than 25 years of experience as a solicitorâs clerk in Hong Kong.  He is very capable in certain areas of work. <b><i>As a result, I entrusted him with greater responsibility</i></b>.  In particular, [Tsang] <b><i>was permitted to conduct initial âfilteringâ interviews with some prospective clients</i></b>.  Thereafter, <b><i>he was required to report</i></b> to me and to seek my instructions as to whether the client would be acceptedâ;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â[Tsangâs] <b><i>written work</i></b> was always reviewed by me or â¦ by another solicitor â¦  I have adopted a system whereby each morning I am given a copy of alloutgoing correspondence from the previous dayâ;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âAbout once a month I give our filing clerk a list of <b><i>files</i></b> and ask her to bring them to me.  I review those files carefully. â¦ â (emphasis supplied).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  The undisputed facts show that Tsang in fact accepted the plaintiff as a client before this was known to the defendant; on 6 June1997, he attended a conference with counsel and Ng.  For some unknown reason, the file in connection with the plaintiffâs claimwas only opened on 14 June 1997.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The defendant claims in his witness statement he was made aware of the conference by Tsang and he permitted Tsang to attend theconference:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âin order [to] explore whether â¦ [the defendant] should agree to accept a retainerâ (para. 15, defendantâs witness statement).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">According to the defendant, the next occasion on which he became aware of the plaintiffâs file was about half a year or more later:para. 19, defendantâs witness statement.  Even then, according to him, he only:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âconfronted Tsang and insisted that funds be obtained from the plaintiff to pay counselâs feeâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Thus, (implicitly at least) the defendant, through Tsang, accepted the plaintiffâs retainer.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  The first time the defendant personally arranged Ng to be attended to (other than by Tsang) was probably in February 1999 (in anyevent, after Tsang has been asked to resign).  It was from this, the defendant first became aware of Tsangâs dishonesty: para.25, defendantâs witness statement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In view of the above circumstances, and for the following reasons, I am satisfied that the defendant should be held liable for Tsangâswrongful acts both under the âclose connectionâ test and the traditional <i>Salmond</i> test.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  First, Tsang has actual authority from the defendant to deal with the plaintiff.  As the defendant stated in his witness statement,Tsang at least has authority to conduct âinitial filtering interviews with clientsâ.  However, Tsang in fact went further andopened a file on 14 June 1997 and continued representing the plaintiff in the legal action.  When the defendant discovered that abouthalf a year later, according to him, he âinsisted â¦ funds be obtained â¦ to pay counselâs feeâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  From these facts, and the fact that there was minimal supervision of Tsang (if any) in relation to the plaintiffâs file (untilafter Tsangâs resignation), I conclude that, at the time, Tsang was effectively authorised to represent the defendant in relationto the plaintiffâs litigation and all related matters, including demanding for legal fees.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Alternatively, even if there had not been actual authority, by virtue of the same factual circumstances, there has been a âholdingoutâ by the defendant so that the plaintiff was entitled to consider Tsangâs deeds were acts representative of the defendant. Hence, it is just and fair the defendant be held liable for Tsangâs misdeeds.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Similarly, for the same reason, applying the âclose connectionâ test, this is a case where Tsangâs wrongful acts were so closedconnected to his employment that it is fair and just to hold the defendant vicariously liable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  In other words, I find the defendant liable on the grounds of vicarious liability and breach of contract: see para. 5(2) and 5(3)above.  The nature and extent of his liability under these grounds is very probably the same.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  In view of the above conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider the detailed heads of allegations put forth by the plaintiff (setout in para. 16 above) in support of his case in negligence.  Insofar as it may be necessary to make any finding on this issue, Iam satisfied that there has been negligence on the defendantâs part on the basis that his supervision over Tsang has fallen belowwhat one can expect from a reasonably prudent solicitor.  I so conclude taking into account, in particular, the lack of evidenceon proper supervision by the defendant, for example, as regards the opening of clientâs file and what work has been done and/orlegal fees have been collected, in relation thereto, over a relatively lengthy time period (from about June 1997 to about February1999).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  In short, I also find against the defendant as regards his liability for negligence: see para. 5(1) above.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Quantum of Loss</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  The relevant legal principles relating to quantum of damages can be summarised as follows.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  In relation to damages recoverable for professional negligence, before considering questions of remoteness or causation, it is necessaryto determine the scope of the duty which was breached: <i>Jackson &amp; Powell</i> <i>on Professional Negligence</i> (2002) 5<sup>th</sup> Ed., para. 3-02.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  A common feature of professional negligence litigation is that the court must determine what course events would have taken if thedefendant had properly discharged his professional duty:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ If given competent treatment [by a medical practitioner], would the patient have recovered?

Further, the plaintiff could have sought these sums from Law and/or the Germansupplier, based on the various allegations against them including breach of the sale contract and misrepresentation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  As stated above, the basis of this part of the plaintiffâs claim is that the defendantâs negligence (and/or Tsangâs wrongfulacts) resulted in a delay in the commencement of its legal action against Law and/or the German supplier.  The delay was allegedlyabout 26 months (up to March 1999).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The defendant argues that this loss was rather caused by the plaintiffâs unwise action or inaction in not pursuing its claim againstLaw and/or the German supplier to the end.  With respect, I disagree with this argument.  From the time when Law emigrated and Jaustbecame bankrupt, it would not be reasonable to expect the plaintiff to continue legal action against them.  This is because, in allprobabilities, such course would (at the most) only result in an empty judgment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  This loss is not based on the loss of an opportunity to bring legal proceedings as a matter of law (for instance, a failure to commencelegal action within the limitation period).  It is rather based on the disappearance of Law and the German supplier: Law emigratedin September 1997; the German supplier was declared bankrupt in December 1997.  What the plaintiff is in effect asserting is, asa matter of practicality, it is impossible to recover the sums claimed herein from Law or the German supplier.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  In relation to Law, the plaintiff contends that the period of delay should run from December 1996, when he first paid Tsang.  Evenif that contention be accepted, the period of delay was about 9 to 10 months up to Lawâs emigration in September 1997.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  No doubt it is within the defendantâs scope of duty to commence and pursue legal actions for the plaintiff in a timeous manner. However, in the factual context of this action, I cannot be satisfied that a delay of about 9 to 10 months was the effective causeof the plaintiffâs inability (as a matter of practicality) to seek damages from Law.  Law would very probably still have emigratedin September 1997 even if the defendant had performed his professional duty to commence and continue the legal action.  It is unlikelythe litigation could be ended before then.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  The same reasoning applies to the claim against the German supplier (although the bankruptcy of Jaust took place slightly laterthan Lawâs emigration).  In addition, I agree with the further argument that the plaintiff was (or, at least, should reasonablyhave been) aware that no legal action had been commenced in Hong Kong against Jaust by December 1997.  It can be inferred that theplaintiff had no complaint against this at the time.  In any event, the plaintiff could have taken (but did not take any) alternativecourses of action; for example, engaging another solicitors firm to commence legal action either in Hong Kong or in Germany.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Quite some time has been spent by the defendant in cross-examination and final submissions on the strength of the plaintiffâsintended claim against Law and the German supplier.  In short, the defendant contends that the plaintiffâs intended claim againstthem is unlikely to succeed.  Because of the conclusion reached above, I do not find it necessary to deal with this aspect.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  For the reasons set out above under this sub-heading, I am not satisfied that Tsangâs misdeeds and/or the defendantâs negligencewas/were the effective cause of the plaintiffâs loss relating to the amount of loss allegedly suffered by its customers in Wuhan(HK$10,150,820.42): para. 2(2) above.  The same comment applies to the plaintiffâs alleged investment loss and loss of customersin the Mainland.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  The plaintiffâs claim set out in para. 1(b) to 1(d), the last sentence of para. 1 and 2(2) above are therefore dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  In relation to the claim for nominal damages for the plaintiffâs loss of goodwill (para. 2(1) above), it is unclear if that lossis said to arise from Tsangâs misdeeds <i>per se</i>, or whether it is said to arise in the same way as that set out in para. 1(b) to 1(d) and 2(2) above.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Insofar as the loss set out in para. 2(1) above is said to arise in the same way as that set out in para. 1(b) to 1(d) and 2(2)above, it is dismissed for the same reasons set out under this sub-heading.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Insofar as that loss is said to arise from Tsangâs misdeeds <i>per se</i>, I agree with the defence that this is an untenable claim and it is dismissed for that reason.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(b)  Payments to Tsang on Account of Legal Fees</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  This head of claim includes:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">legal fees paid to Tsang during the period from December 1996 to March 1999 (HK$640,000): para. 1(e) above;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">legal fees paid to Tsang in relation to HCA 17330/1998 (HK$20,000): para. 1(f) above.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  The defendant handed in a document headed âPosition Statement of the Defendantâ at the beginning of the trial (â<i>the position statement</i>â).  He states therein that he accepts responsibility for repaying to the plaintiff payments actually made by the plaintiff to Tsang:para. 1 to 3 and 5 thereof.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  The total sum which the plaintiff claims has been received by Tsang is HK$660,000.  It is unclear from the position statement theprecise extent of the defendantâs accepted responsibility.  The defendant appears to accept responsibility for HK$20,000 (for whicha receipt has been issued).  He says in the position statement:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ [the defendant] accepts responsibility for such amount of payments as the Plaintiff can prove to the satisfaction of this Courtâ¦ â (para. 5 thereof) .</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">But, in relation to the remaining HK$640,000, the position statement also states:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âTsang had admitted taking only two sums of HK$20,000 [responsibility for which has been accepted (see above)] and HK$30,000 anda sum of not more than HK$80,000 from [Ng]â (para. 3(b) thereof).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  It would therefore appear, out of the total claim of HK$660,000 under this heading, the defendant admits a total of HK$130,000 hasbeen received by Tsang (and therefore his firm).  I will treat the remaining HK$530,000 (660,000 â 130,000) to be a disputed claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  As stated above, I accept Ngâs testimony is truthful and reliable in this respect.  I am satisfied that the plaintiff has paidthe sums claimed to Tsang, as the defendantâs agent.  Even if the defendant had in fact only admitted liability to repay HK$20,000(and no more), by virtue of the above finding of fact, I would still have found him liable for the whole sum claimed by the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  In the defendantâs final submission, it is stated that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ The $20,000 consisted of $12,000 being disbursement of counselâs fees and $8,000 being the firmâs fees for work done â¦[The plaintiff] does not seem to dispute that such fees were [proper] â¦ â: para. 7 thereof.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  It is unclear if the defendant is asserting that, since the sums were properly incurred, the plaintiff is not entitled to recoverthem.  By virtue of the position statement, I do not think he is making that assertion.  In case he is, I find that the servicesrendered were valueless.  The sums should be recoverable by the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Accordingly, judgment in the sum of HK$660,000 is entered against the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(c)  Ngâs Travelling Expenses</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  This head of claim is set out in para. 1(g) above (HK$220,000).

I agree with the defence that the wasted legal fee could not be attributed tothe defendant.  The defendant could decide the manner in which he should carry on his practice.  There is no evidence that the change(s)in the firm name was/were intended to confuse or mislead the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  It is therefore the plaintiffâs own fault in erroneously commencing HCA 1279/2000 against Messrs.

I will make an order to this effect if none of the parties applies within 14 days from the date of judgment for some otherbasis for calculating interest.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Other Matters</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  Perhaps it is due to the plaintiff acting in person through Ng, a lot of matters which are irrelevant to the issues in this actionhave been raised in various documents and at trial.  Although these matters have not been expressly referred to above, I have consideredthem.  Some of these matters are contained in a Chinese document supplied by the plaintiff headed âOpeningâ.  Further, some ofthe matters stated in that document have not been pleaded by the plaintiff.  Objections have been raised by the defence as a result. The plaintiff very sensibly agreed at the beginning of the trial not to pursue the matters objected to by the defence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Costs Order Nisi</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  There is no apparent reason to depart from the usual rule that costs should follow the event.
