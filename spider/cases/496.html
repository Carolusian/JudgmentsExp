Clauses 21 and 22 of the Terms and Conditions of Bill of Lading, No.KKA040, pleadedin the Amended Statement of Claim, read as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"21. LAW</p>        <p class="quote">The provisions of this Bill of Lading apply to all relations between the parties to the contract evidenced herein. The law of theNetherlands shall supplement those provisions only insofar as not dealt with by the contract evidenced in this Bill of Lading.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">22. JURISDICTION</p>        <p class="quote">Any claim or dispute arising under this Bill of Lading shall in first instance be decided by the Court at Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</p>        <p class="quote">No proceedings may be brought before other court unless the parties expressly agree on the choice of another court or arbitrationtribunal."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The Background Facts</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The Plaintiff is a Hong Kong company which trades in electrical goods. The Defendant, which is owned by a Dutch parent, is also incorporatedin Hong Kong, and functions as a freight forwarder. This claim is a claim by the Plaintiff for the misdelivery of a consignment ofelectrical goods which were carried from Hong Kong to Kotka, Finland.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The underlying contract of sale of these goods was concluded in early October 1997 with another Hong Kong company called Maratz (HK)Limited ("Maratz"), which went into liquidation in 1998. The goods the subject of the contract were clearly intended for export sincethe contract provided that payment would be effected by Maratz to the Plaintiff within 15 days "against mate receipt". As Mr Sussex,who appeared on this application for the Defendant, pointed out, the obvious intention was that the Plaintiff would retain the 'matereceipt' provided by the carrier until Maratz paid for the goods because, without this receipt, Maratz would not be able to obtaina bill of lading, and without a bill of lading consequently would not be able to deal with the goods at their destination.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> By a Shipping Order dated 15th October 1997 Maratz instructed the Defendant to arrange shipment of a 40-foot container, in whichthe contract goods were packed, for shipment from Hong Kong to Kotka. Subsequent thereto, on 24th October 1997, these electricalgoods were delivered to HIT's Container Terminal at Kwai Chung and a Terminal Receipt was issued, which document has been referredto by both the Plaintiff and the Defendant as the 'mate receipt'.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Pursuant to the shipping arrangements which had been made by the Defendant, the goods were in fact shipped on the vessel "Ming Moon",owned and operated by 'K' Line in that company's liner service between Hong Kong and Northern Europe. In this regard, a 'K' Lineocean bill of lading appears to have been issued which names the Defendant as Shipper, and an entity known as Scanrapid OY, of Helsinki,Finland, as Notify Party and Consignee.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> On 28th October 1997, the buyer of the goods, Maratz, requested the Defendant to issue a 'house' bill of lading in accordance withthe specimen supplied, which named Maratz as Shipper. The Defendant duly complied with this request and on 3rd November 1997 issuedwhat transpired to be a first bill of lading, No.7A28KKA040, as agent on behalf of "Kingwood Container Lines", the full significanceof which was apparently then unappreciated. This first 'house' bill of lading was, apparently, also issued by the Defendant withoutsight of any mate receipt in respect of these goods. Shortly thereafter, the Defendant also invoiced Maratz for freight and othercharges arising in connection with this shipment.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Some six weeks later, on 11th December 1997, the Defendant received a further request from Maratz to issue a <em>second</em> bill of lading in respect of this same shipment of electrical goods. On this occasion the<em>pro forma</em> supplied by Maratz required the Plaintiff (as opposed to Maratz) to be named as Shipper. I am told by Mr Sussex that the Defendantissued the second bill, again as agents for "Kingwood Container Lines", but retained the bill because Maratz had <em>not</em> yet surrendered the Terminal Receipt issued to Maratz by HIT when these goods had originally been delivered to Kwai Chung.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On 18th December 1997, the Defendant faxed Maratz to the effect that this consignment of goods had reached Kotka, and stated thatbecause Maratz had not yet surrendered the Terminal Receipt (described as 'the mate receipt'), the ocean carrier was threateningto auction off the goods. As a result, on or about 18th December 1997, the Terminal Receipt was delivered by Maratz to the Defendantand in turn this second 'house' bill of lading, No.KKA040, was released to Maratz, in this instance naming the Plaintiff as Shipper.And it is in respect of this <em>second</em> bill of lading that the Plaintiff hitherto has framed its claim in these proceedings.</p>    <p class="heading">The Argument</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In the usual course argument in support of a stay application based upon a foreign jurisdiction clause proceeds along fairly well-definedlines. The applicability of the clause to the relevant contract of carriage is normally clearly established, and thereafter, on whatare generally referred to as the principles set out in <strong>The "El Amria"</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20119" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 2 Lloyds Rep. 119</a> (see in particular the speech of Brandon LJ at 123), the matter is debated and the Court's discretion to stay is, or is not, exercisedupon the basis of whether the Plaintiff/Respondent, on whom the burden rests, can demonstrate strong cause for <em>not</em> so doing.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Here, however, two significant 'wrinkles' have arisen, which render this case unusual. I take them briefly in turn.</p>    <p class="heading">(i) Non-existent principal</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> <em>Both</em> the 'house' bills of lading issued by the Defendant were issued "as agents only", and purport to have been issued on behalf of 'KingwoodContainer Lines' as carrier. This company was a Netherlands Antilles company which was dissolved in 1993 at a time when the Furnessgroup was apparently subject to restructuring by new owners. The precise details do not for the moment matter; suffice to say thatMr Sussex submits that the house bills in this form were issued by the Defendant in ignorance of the fact that the purported principalhad ceased to exist, with the result that the Defendant in this case had purported to contract on behalf of a non-existent principal.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In his helpful skeleton argument, Mr Sussex has taken the Court through a useful (and educational) summary of the legal possibilitiesthrown up by this situation, and has argued that, in the circumstances, this is not a case wherein it can or should be said thatthere is no contract in existence at all but, to the contrary, that the contract in question was concluded with the Defendant itself.He arrives at this conclusion <em>either</em> as the result of the application of Hong Kong law, which involves a line of cases commencing with <strong>Kelner v. Baxter</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281866%29%20LR%202%20CP%20174" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1866) LR 2 CP 174</a>, or by means of the application of Dutch law, Rule 181 of <em>Dicey and Morris</em> providing that the formation and existence of a contract falls to be determined by the putative proper law of that contract, namely,Dutch law, and that the unchallenged evidence before the Court is that Dutch law would regard the bill of lading as constitutinga contract made with the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Having arrived at his desired position by application of belt or braces, Mr Sussex then argued that <em>before</em> any bill of lading was issued by the Defendant, a contract existed between the Defendant and Maratz, as evidenced by the ShippingOrder, the fact that the Defendant invoiced Maratz for shipping charges, and the fact that the Defendant contracted with 'K' Lineto ship the goods to Kotka. Equally, he said, it was plainly intended that when a bill of lading was issued, a contract would comeinto existence between Maratz and the carrier, as to the precise identity of which Maratz was obviously indifferent. Accordingly,he submitted, when the Defendant issued the second 'house' bill of lading in exchange for the Terminal Receipt, there was a novationof that contract as contained in or evidenced by the first bill of lading, the Plaintiff thereby becoming a party to this contractof carriage in substitution for Maratz, and that, due to the demise of Kingwood Container Lines, as a matter of law this was a contractof carriage made with the Defendant personally.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> It followed that, since the second bill of lading (like the first) contained the Law and Jurisdiction clause relied upon to foundthe present stay application, the Plaintiff was, in effect, stuck with it. The Plaintiff had sued the Defendant in contract on thebasis of the Bill of Lading No.KKA040, and reformulation of the case in bailment failed to assist, because if (which was not necessarilyaccepted) the Defendant at any time had assumed physical possession, and therefore become bailee of the goods, such bailment wouldhave had to have been on the terms of the bill of lading, and accordingly the Plaintiff could not escape the jurisdiction clauseby framing its case in the alternative in bailment.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Miss Teresa Cheng, on behalf of the Plaintiff, did not seek to meet this detailed analysis head on; instead she sought to sidestepit. With customary fairness, she accepted that <em>if</em> her client was constrained to rely on the existing pleading, invoking the second 'house' bill of lading and/or bailment, then significantdifficulties would lie in her path, and she would face an uphill battle in resisting the present application.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Instead, she produced for the consideration of the Court a proposed draft re-amendment to the existing Amended Statement of Claimwhich, in substance, focused upon a characterisation of the second bill of lading as a 'false' bill and as a 'sham document' whichthe Plaintiff had exchanged <em>against</em> delivery up of the Terminal Receipt in ignorance of the fact that Kingwood Container Lines no longer existed, and also in ignoranceof the existence of the first bill of lading, which itself had been issued by the Defendant to Maratz <em>without</em> sight of the Terminal (or 'mate') receipt.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The draft amendments as thus put up, which no doubt will be the subject of a formal application to amend in terms should a stay ofthese proceedings not be granted, recite the history of events as they were <em>now</em> known by the Plaintiff (the affidavit evidence filed upon this stay application having assisted the Plaintiff, which hitherto hadnot known precisely what had gone on between the Defendant and Maratz nor appreciated the sequence of events involving the two 'house'bills of lading). The Plaintiff specifically complains of not being informed by a Mr Ferreira of the Defendant, during a conversationwith a Mr Wong of the Plaintiff, as to the existence of the first 'house' bill of lading when in the same conversation Mr Ferreirahad said that a bill of lading would be issued to the Plaintiff in exchange for the mate receipt, thereby impliedly representingthat such bill of lading to be issued "is the only Bill of Lading in respect of the said goods and that this Bill of Lading to beissued would be a valid title document" (at paragraph 5F). The draft pleading then recites (at paragraph 5H) that in reliance uponthe aforesaid representation by Mr Ferreira "the Plaintiff did surrender its Mate Receipt to the Defendant in or around December1997 and at the same time took delivery of a purported Bill of Lading No.KKA040 issued by the Defendant (the second House Bill)".Nor was the Defendant at the material times aware of the details of the Ocean Bill issued by 'K' Line to the Defendant (naming theDefendant as Shipper and Scanrapid OY as Consignee and Notify Party), which Ocean Bill had been 'surrendered' (paragraph 5L), andthat thereafter Scanrapid OY took delivery at the discharge port "on a date unknown to the Plaintiff" (paragraph 5M).</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The Plaintiff further asserts that when, as holder of the second House Bill, it made the request to the Defendant to release thegoods, "the Plaintiff was ... unaware of all the dealings with the parties of the Defendant ... save for the dealing with the Plaintiff"(paragraph 6), and avers that "By reason of the misrepresentation of the Defendant pleaded hereinabove and the acts or omissionsof the Defendant, the Plaintiff has suffered loss and damage", thereafter providing six particulars of negligence, together withparticulars of misrepresentation and damage, the latter element being referable to the value of the goods, namely US$55,036.86 (paragraph8A).</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The claim as originally pleaded is retained in the alternative (at paragraph 9), albeit on the basis that "if it is found that thesecond House Bill is a valid Bill of Lading notwithstanding the existence of the first House Bill duly issued to Maratz by the Defendant..."</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> As the result of the foregoing, therefore, Miss Cheng makes it clear that the principal case she now wishes to run against the Defendant,subject to the grant of leave to effect a formal amendment in terms, centres around the issuance by the Defendant of the two 'house'bills of lading, and she argues that there can be no novation in the terms submitted by Mr Sussex when, at the time of the exchangeof the Terminal Receipt for the second house bill, the Plaintiff was entirely ignorant of the existence of the first house bill.So that it followed, she said, that her primary case against the Defendant is now firmly based on a free-standing claim in tort,as opposed to contract or bailment, and that it was the Defendant's misrepresentation, via Mr Ferreira, that gave rise to the deliveryup of the all-important mate receipt in exchange for the second house bill, which then erroneously was thought by the Plaintiff tobe the only such bill of lading in existence. Moreover, although she could not put it any higher on the face of the papers, she furthersubmitted that there was "evidence which tends to suggest" that it had been the first house bill which had been operative in thewrongful release of the goods to Scanrapid OY.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> In addition, submitted Miss Cheng, such new case had not been the subject of attention by the expert on Dutch law, whose evidenceas exhibited obviously had not covered these aspects, in particular the existence of another bill of lading and the arrangementsindependently made between the Defendant and Maratz. So that when the case was looked at in this new light, Miss Cheng argued, therewas very good reason to maintain the trial of this relatively small claim within the existing Hong Kong proceedings, and not to orderthe stay which in any event, she said, was now sought by the Defendant for obvious procedural purposes.</p>    <p class="heading">Decision</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> After reflecting on all the circumstances disclosed in the evidence, together with the submissions of Counsel, in the exercise ofmy discretion I have decided <em>not</em> to stay this action in favour of Rotterdam. And I do this in large part on the basis of the revised case in tort which the Plaintiffnow seeks to pursue against the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The case as now primarily put forward involves Hong Kong parties, with Hong Kong witnesses testifying to events which occurred inHong Kong. Notwithstanding the elaborate analysis put forward by the Defendant, that is the bottom line. In coming to this view Ihave not overlooked Mr Sussex's critique of the revised case - to which in my view he rightly accepts the Court may pay heed, notwithstandingthe absence of the grant of formal leave to amend - in terms of causation, and in terms of what he describes as the 'shoehorning'of a contract case into a tort framework. But it seems to me, in the circumstances now prevailing in which the case has assumed amanifestly different bias, that it would be quite inappropriate at this stage to send these two Hong Kong companies off to Rotterdamto debate the merits of a case factually rooted in Hong Kong and in the context of a claim which is worth so relatively little (whethersuch be the face value of the claim or the package limit) with the result that, to use Lord Brandon's terminology, considerationof the aspect of "the relative convenience and expense of trial" in my view points all one way.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> I further entertain a real doubt, in the circumstances of this case, as to the genuineness of the Plaintiff's desire for trial inRotterdam, or whether, again in Lord Brandon's words, the Defendant is seeking "procedural advantages" or is seeking to create atactical edge of the type which can readily be appreciated by any commercial litigator.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Moreover, I take into consideration that this is a claim, again most unusually in the circumstances of a stay application, to whicha Defence <em>already</em> has been fully pleaded, incorporating all relevant defences, including time bar and package limitation (asserted to be US$500). Thisis another strange facet of this case, albeit in the circumstances I see no need to rehearse in detail the somewhat odd sequenceof events by which this situation arose, involving the dismissal by a Master, at a three-minute hearing on 1st March 1999, of theoriginal stay application (prior to the transfer of this case to the Commercial List), the consequent filing of a Defence dated 1stMarch 1999, and the Order on the appeal to Sakhrani J dated 10th March 1999, whereby Master Kwan's Order was set aside, with thestay application being adjourned to the Commercial List for hearing. And whilst I decline to categorise the filing of this Defencein itself as amounting to a binding election, waiver or other type of procedural bar to the mounting of the present stay application,as Miss Cheng suggested, I do not ignore the fact that the pleadings in this action are now in place and, subject to consequentialamendment, the battle lines firmly drawn between the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Looked at overall, therefore, to cause this entire matter now to be stayed in Hong Kong and to be recommenced and readdressed inRotterdam strikes me, in the circumstances, as an absurdity, and I decline so to order.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The result of the foregoing is that the Defendant's application, by its summons dated 26th February 1999, is dismissed. I make anOrder nisi that the costs of and occasioned by this application are to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff in any event, suchcosts to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> I am obliged to Counsel for their assistance.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">(William Stone)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Charles Sussex, inst'd by M/s Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan, for the Defendant/Applicant</p>        <p>Miss Teresa Cheng, inst'd by M/s Ko &amp; Co, for the Plaintiff/Respondent</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/1999/314.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
