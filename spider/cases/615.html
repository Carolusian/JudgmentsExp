He was the first passenger on the upper deck.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Although in his witness statement dated 2 May 2006 Chan said that 2 to 3 passengers also got on the bus at the Po Lam terminus andthat he could not recall where they took their seats, he confirmed in cross-examination that when he was interviewed by the plaintiffâssolicitors in June or July 2005 he had told them that he recalled that there were about 2 to 3 passengers who had also got on tothe upper deck of the bus at the Po Lam terminus but that they had all gone to the back of the bus to get a seat.  It seems to methat his recollection in June or July 2005 would have been more reliable than his recollection at the time of his witness statementin May 2006.  I accept that there were 2 to 3 passengers who also got on to the upper deck at the Po Lam terminus and that they allwent to the back of the bus to get a seat. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> I accept Chanâs evidence.  I prefer Chanâs evidence to the plaintiffâs evidence as to whether there were passengers at therear of the bus when the plaintiff got on to the upper deck at the first stop.  Save for this, I also accept the plaintiffâs evidence. I find that there were 2 to 3 passengers who also got on to the upper deck of the bus at the Po Lam terminus and that they all wentto sit at the back of the bus.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Chan also said that he heard some sound or noise and he explained that when the bus was in motion it seemed that there were someitems or objects rolling on the floor of the upper deck.  He also said that he heard that sound on the first leg of the journey fromwhere he got on the bus to the first stop.  He did not hear anything else.  I accept his evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Chan saw the plaintiff arriving on the upper deck of the bus at the first stop after the Po Lam terminus.  He said that the plaintiffwas going towards the rear of the bus.  He saw him take 3 steps before he fell over.  He saw him fall and the plaintiff was lyingon his back.  The other passengers notified the bus driver to stop the bus which he did.  Chan called the police.  He saw the plaintifflying on the floor and he was unconscious.  He also saw a 2A size battery lying near the plaintiffâs foot. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Lam is an experienced driver with around 18 years driving experience.  He joined the defendant as a bus captain in 1998 and is stillworking as a bus captain for the defendant.  Lam gave evidence that he was driving the bus on Route 93K on 12 October 2002 and hehad been driving on that route for a few months prior to the accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Lam also gave evidence that buses leave the terminus at a designated time.  Before that time and for a few minutes prior to departurehe opens the door of the bus and lets passengers in for about 3 minutes with the engine running and the air-conditioning switchedon.  Passengers get on at the front door where they pay their fare and work their way into the bus either on the lower deck or climbingthe stairs to the upper deck.  Lam followed this procedure every time he drove the bus on that route.  I accept his evidence.  Ifind that he followed his usual procedure by leaving the door open and letting in passengers for about 3 minutesbefore the departuretime of 7:50 pm on 12 October 2002 at the Po Lam terminus with the engine running and the air-conditioning switched on.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> The bus arrived at the first bus stop at about 7:55 pm, so the trip to the first stop took about 5 minutes.  Lam also said that around3 passengers got on at the first stop which must have included the plaintiff.  It appears that all 3 passengers must have gone onto the upper deck as from the defendantâs traffic accident inspection report it seems that two ladies got on the bus at the samestop as the plaintiff and were following him up to the upper deck.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Lam said that after the passengers boarded the bus at the first stop after the terminus he drove away.  Not far from the bus stophowever, someone told him that a passenger on the upper deck had fallen.  He then stopped the bus and went to the upper deck.  Heremembered that there were about 10 passengers on the upper deck.  On this evidence it would mean that there were more passengerswho got on to the upper deck at the Po Lam terminus than what Chan said.  However, in my view, Chanâs evidence on this is morereliable as he was on the upper deck throughout.  I prefer Chanâs evidence on this. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Lam also said that he saw the plaintiff lying unconscious on the ground of the upper deck near the staircase.  He called the police. He also remembered seeing a small battery on the aisle near the shoulder of the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> On the plaintiffâs evidence, which I accept, I find that the plaintiff saw 2 batteries rolling towards him from the floor at therear of the bus as he was walking for about 2 steps on the upper deck towards the rear.  I have no hesitation in finding that theplaintiff stepped on a small cylindrical battery, either a 2A size or a 3A size battery which was on the floor of the upper deckas he was walking towards the rear and which caused him to fall and sustain his serious personal injuries.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The defendantâs system of cleaning buses</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Ho gave evidence of the defendantâs system for the cleaning of buses at the time of the accident which I accept.  The defendantemployed its own cleaning workers who worked from 8 am to 5 pm each day.  They would clean the buses whenever it arrived at a terminus.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Ho also said that bus captains would also inspect the bus to see if passengers left any items on board and to clean the bus.  Hesaid that the bus captains were supposed to remove the items that are removable like plastic bags, glass bottles and large sheetsof newspapers.  It was their responsibility to keep the buses clean when the cleaners were off duty.  He said that the cleaners wererequired as part of the cleaning operation to sweep the floors of the upper and lower deck of buses including the staircase and theywould also sweep under the seats of the buses.  Bus captains, he said, were not told to inspect under the seats when inspecting busesfor cleanliness.  He accepted that the scope of cleaning carried out by cleaners was different than that carried out by bus captains. Cleaners were required to do the cleaning job thoroughly with the necessary equipment and tools unlike bus captains.  He said thatbus captains were not provided with gloves, garbage bags or rubbish bins but bins were provided at the terminuses.  He said thatas far as bus captains were concerned they were asked to perform the cleaning job to a reasonable degree in that no items which wouldpose a danger to passengers would be left there.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Ho also said that from his personal experience on bus journeys passengers did leave items like glass bottles and soft drink canson buses.  Ho frankly accepted that if bus captains were not told to look under the seats for such items left on buses they wouldnot be able to remove such items if left on the bus under the seats.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> The same system of cleaning and inspection of buses was employed for all of the defendantâs buses in all its depots in Hong Kongand Kowloon.  In all his time with the defendant since 1994 Ho said that he had never come across a passenger falling over on somethingleft on a bus.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Ho also said that a survey on cleanliness of buses was conducted among bus captains in late 2001.  It was found that about 100 buseswere found to be unclean.  This led to the extension of the working hours for the cleaning workers to 9 pm for the buses on the uncleanroutes from early 2002.  However, buses on route 93K were not affected as the buses on that route were not found to be unclean. On the evidence, cleaning workers were not required to clean the bus after 5 pm on the day of the accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Lam also gave evidence about the system of the cleaning of buses and the inspections of the bus made by him as a bus captain.  Hesaid that when he received training at the training school of the defendant he was taught that as a bus captain he had to inspectthe bus compartments whenever the bus arrives at a terminus.  He was taught to inspect the upper and lower decks after passengersalighted at a terminus to make sure that all passengers have alighted and that no one left anything behind and to also inspect thebus for cleanliness.  He would walk slowly along the aisle from the front to the rear of the bus, look left and right at the seatsand the floor.  However, he was not required to look under the seats of the bus.  He also said that if there were some movable objectsuch as bottles or soft drink cans, he would remove them.  If there were something difficult to clean like vomit, he would reportit to the terminal supervisor immediately who would arrange for cleaners to clean it up or for another bus to be used.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Lam also said that prior to the accident he had never experienced a person slipping and falling on a bus he was driving.  He saidthat as part of his training he was supposed to remove soft drink cans, plastic bags, newspapers.  Chan noticed that there was rubbishlying on the floor of the upper deck.  He explained that the rubbish that he noticed was paper and tissues.  He had also seen oneor two bits of paper or tissues on the staircase as he was going upstairs to the upper deck.  The fact that there was a few sheetsof tissue paper on the upper deck and staircase as found by Chan when he boarded the bus does not mean that Lam did not do his jobof inspecting the bus properly.  He was not required to clean the bus to the same extent as cleaning workers were required to.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Lam explained that if the bus arrives at a terminus and if it was only after a relatively long time that he would drive the bus againfor instance, after meals or before the first run in the morning, the bus captains were required to inspect the bus once more beforethe passengers board the bus.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Lamâs evidence as to what bus captains were taught and what they were required to do was confirmed by Ho.  I accept Ho and Lamâsevidence on the defendantâs system of cleaning buses.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Inspection of the bus by Lam</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Lam said, and I accept, that on 12 October 2002 the bus arrived at the Po Lam terminus at about 6:45 pm.  It left the Mongkok terminusafter 5 pm when cleaning workers had already gone off work for that day.  After arriving at the Po Lam terminus and after the passengersgot off he inspected the bus.  He inspected the seats and the floor of the bus compartments but he did not find any object and hedid not find any battery there.  He then closed the bus and went for dinner.  After dinner he went back to the Po Lam terminus ataround 7:40 pm and went into the bus, switched on the lights and inspected the bus again.  He did not find any battery there.  Iaccept his evidence and find that on his two inspections at the Po Lam terminus he did not find any battery on the floor of the upperdeck.  However, he did not inspect underneath the seats and if there were a battery hidden underneath a seat, he would not have seenit.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Issue (1)</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> The slip and fall of the plaintiff by stepping on a battery on the upper deck of the bus was undoubtedly an unusual event. But theplaintiff must go further before the evidential burden of showing that the accident happened without negligence on its part is shiftedto the defendant.  The plaintiff must also prove, on a balance of probabilities, that in the absence of explanation the event ismore consistent with fault on the part of the defendant than the absence of fault.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Ms Lee, for the plaintiff, accepted that unless the plaintiff can show that the event is more consistent with fault on the part ofthe defendant than the absence of fault, the plaintiffâs claims fail.  She submitted that to do this the plaintiff has to persuadethe court that the defendant or its employee knew, or by the exercise of proper care and diligence should have known, of the presenceof the battery and failed to remove it.  She accepted that if the battery was discarded by a passenger who boarded the bus at thePo Lam terminus after Lamâs inspection of the bus, Lam would not have known of its presence irrespective of proper care and diligencewhile inspecting the bus at the Po Lam terminus.  In that event, she accepted that the plaintiffâs case failed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> It seems to me that there are only two possibilities as to when the battery which the plaintiff stepped on was discarded, either:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">before the final inspection by Lam at the Po Lam terminus; or </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">after the final inspection by Lam at the Po Lam terminus. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> It is for the plaintiff to prove that the battery was discarded before the final inspection by Lam before the evidential burden isshifted to the defendant to show that the accident happened without negligence on its part.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> The sound that Chan heard of something rolling on the floor was probably the sound of the batteries which had been discarded on thefloor of the upper deck and I so find. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Ms Lee submitted that the evidence shows that the batteries were on the floor of the upper deck before the bus left the terminusas Chan heard the sound or noise of something rolling on the floor when the bus was in motion.  She further submitted that as Chandid not hear any other sound, it is likely that the batteries were discarded before and not after the final inspection by Lam. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> I am unable to accept Ms Leeâs submissions.  It is clear that Chan did not say that he heard the sound of something rolling onthe floor as soon as the bus was in motion.  Chan also said that he heard that sound during the first leg of the journey from wherehe got on the bus to the first stop.  It seems to me that the batteries could have been discarded by someone at the rear of the buson the upper deck at any time during that trip whilst the bus was in motion. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Even if Chanâs evidence can be regarded as evidence that he heard the sound of something rolling on the floor as soon as the buswas in motion, someone at the rear of the bus on the upper deck could still have discarded the batteries after the final inspectionby Lam.  Lam said, and I accept, that he followed his usual procedure of allowing passengers to board about 3 minutes before departurewith the engine running and the air-conditioning switched on.  The fact that Chan did not hear any other sound provides no assistance. The engine of the bus was running at the time together with the air-conditioning switched on.  Someone at the rear of the bus onthe upper deck could have discarded the batteries on the floor without Chan hearing it from where he was sitting.  After all, Chanwas on an ordinary bus trip minding his own business and not paying any attention to what anyone else was doing.  In my view, ifsomeone at the rear did discard the batteries it would not be surprising if Chan did not hear that.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> It is incumbent on the plaintiff to prove that the batteries were discarded before the final inspection of the bus by Lam.  The plaintiffhas failed to satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that the battery that the plaintiff stepped on was on the floor of the upperdeck before the final inspection by Lam at the Po Lam terminus.  It could just as easily have been discarded after his final inspectionby 1 of the 2 to 3 passengers who got on at the Po Lam terminus and sat at the rear of the upper deck.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has proven that the discarded battery was on the bus before the final inspection by Lam atthe Po Lam terminus.  The answer to issue (1) is ânoâ.  The plaintiff has not discharged his burden of proof to show that theunusual event is, in the absence of explanation, more consistent with fault on the part of the defendant than the absence of fault. That being so, the evidential burden to show that the accident happened without negligence on the part of the defendant does notshift to the defendant.  The other issues do not arise.  The plaintiffâs claims fail.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> I have considerable sympathy for the plaintiff as he sustained a serious injury whilst stepping on a battery on the bus.  However,I am unable to find liability on the part of the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> The plaintiffâs claims are dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> I also make an order <i>nisi</i> that :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the costs of the action be costs to the defendant; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the plaintiffâs own costs are to be taxed in accordance with <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a></i>.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Arjan H Sakhrani)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Ms Christina Lee, instructed by M/s Ho, Tse, Wai &amp; Partners, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr John Bleach, S.C. and Mr Raymond Leung, instructed by M/s Hastings &amp; Co., for the Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p style="text-align: left"> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2007/1194.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
