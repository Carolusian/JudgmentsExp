name="p1">1.</a> This case concerns the <brs_term brs_term_id="0" brs_term_type="3">granite cladding</brs_term> to the new Bank of East Asia head-quarters building at Des Voeux Road Central. The development was completed at the beginning of1983. The building consists of a tower block 23-storeys high, standing on a podium of 5 storeys. The architects and structural engineersfor the project were Messrs. Palmer and Turner (&quot;Palmer &amp; Turner&quot;) and the nominated sub-contractors for the claddingwere Tsien Wui Marble Factory Ltd (&quot;TW&quot;).</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="83"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p2" name="p2">2.</a> Two factors render this a difficult case for this Court: (1) At trial, because of admissions made on behalf of Palmer &amp; Turner,the <brs_term brs_term_id="1" brs_term_type="2">tort of negligence</brs_term> was assumed to have been established; the ingredients constituting the <brs_term brs_term_id="2" brs_term_type="2">cause of action</brs_term> were not explored in depth in the courts below. (2) Because of those admissions, essential <brs_term brs_term_id="98" brs_term_type="9">findings</brs_term> of fact, going to the heart of a key <brs_term brs_term_id="97" brs_term_type="9">issue</brs_term>, were not made by the trial court; they were barely touched upon in the Court of Appeal. This explains the length of this <brs_term brs_term_id="1731" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="84"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p3" name="p3">3.</a> The Bank's <brs_term brs_term_id="99" brs_term_type="9">case</brs_term> against Palmer &amp; Turner was, and is now, in negligence alone, counsel for the Bank having conceded at trial that the contractualclaim was <brs_term brs_term_id="551" brs_term_type="9">time-barred</brs_term>. Further, it was admitted at trial by Palmer &amp; Turner that they were in <brs_term brs_term_id="555" brs_term_type="9">breach</brs_term> of their <brs_term brs_term_id="552" brs_term_type="9">duty of care</brs_term> to the Bank. The terms of their admissions will need examination later. Subject to the <brs_term brs_term_id="557" brs_term_type="9">defence</brs_term> based upon the <brs_term brs_term_id="549" brs_term_type="9"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a></brs_term>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap. 347</a>, it was conceded by Palmer &amp; Turner that they were liable to the Bank for <brs_term brs_term_id="550" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term>; these were assessed by the <brs_term brs_term_id="553" brs_term_type="9">trial judge</brs_term> in the sum of $38,502,951.85. The history of this piece of <brs_term brs_term_id="556" brs_term_type="9">litigation</brs_term> is fully set out in Mr Justice Ching PJ's <brs_term brs_term_id="554" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> and needs no repetition.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="85"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p4" name="p4">4.</a> Before this Court, the entire focus of the case, as far as Palmer &amp; Turner are concerned, is on the meaning of the words <em>the date on which the <brs_term brs_term_id="559" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrued</em> as they appear in the relevant provisions of the <brs_term brs_term_id="558" brs_term_type="9"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a></brs_term>. As the decision on this <brs_term brs_term_id="100" brs_term_type="9">issue</brs_term> is also relevant to TW it would be convenient to deal with the case against Palmer &amp; Turner first.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="86"><p class="heading">The focus of the <brs_term brs_term_id="102" brs_term_type="9">issue</brs_term></p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="87"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p5" name="p5">5.</a> This point needs emphasis at the outset: The barring of a party's remedy by the imposition of a time limit for the institution of<brs_term brs_term_id="103" brs_term_type="9">proceedings</brs_term> is a consequence of statute. At <brs_term brs_term_id="561" brs_term_type="9">common law</brs_term> there is no <brs_term brs_term_id="562" brs_term_type="9">limitation period</brs_term> within which actions must be brought. Rightly or wrongly the legislature has, as a matter of policy, decided that certain actionsshould not be brought after expiration of certain time; that stale claims (as delineated within the <brs_term brs_term_id="1880" brs_term_type="9">statutory scheme</brs_term>) should not be entertained.

The argument for the architects was put in this way: The Bank suffered damage at around the timewhen the cladding work was completed and in any case no later than when the final certificates were issued by the architects andpayment made thereon by the Bank: By this time, the Bank had clearly relied upon, and acted upon, the exercise of care and skillby the architects in rendering their services; thus, subject to the question of damage, the Bank had a complete <brs_term brs_term_id="687" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> based upon <strong>Hedley Byrne v Heller</strong> principles; as to <em>damage</em>, what the Bank had was a building with a cladding that was defectively designed and which, sooner or later, was going to fail: thefact that the full measure of <brs_term brs_term_id="146" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> might not be ascertainable for some time did not mean that the Bank had suffered no pecuniary <brs_term brs_term_id="147" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>: the detriment suffered by the Bank was in having sub-standard building works when it had paid for properly designed works: Thiswas what counsel Mr Michael Thomas SC in the course of argument before us called a &quot;<brs_term brs_term_id="688" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> for <brs_term brs_term_id="689" brs_term_type="9">modern negligence</brs_term> without physical damage of the <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong> kind&quot;.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="173"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p37" name="p37">37.</a> In <strong>Hedley Byrne v.

The <brs_term brs_term_id="693" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> held that but for a <brs_term brs_term_id="29" brs_term_type="2">disclaimer of liability</brs_term> the defendant would have been liable in <brs_term brs_term_id="692" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term>: Thereby reversing the long-established rule that, in the absence of contract, an action for <brs_term brs_term_id="28" brs_term_type="2">negligent misrepresentation</brs_term> could not be maintained. Since then, the <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong> principle has been extended to a variety of situations.

As an illustration if per chance theplaintiff had wished to sell its bank building immediately upon the completion thereof and a purchaser had not only had a physicalsurvey carried out but had inspected the <brs_term brs_term_id="702" brs_term_type="9">building plans</brs_term> and discovered that a proper allowance had not been made for <brs_term brs_term_id="31" brs_term_type="3">shrinkage</brs_term>, <brs_term brs_term_id="32" brs_term_type="3">creep</brs_term> and <brs_term brs_term_id="33" brs_term_type="3">thermal expansion</brs_term> and that the <brs_term brs_term_id="34" brs_term_type="3">fixing means</brs_term> were an inappropriate design when taking into account the thickness of the cladding such that the cladding may well fail, the valueof the building may well have diminished. In such circumstances, allowance would no doubt be demanded by the purchaser for the potentialhazard to the cladding. In principle, I see no reason why an economic <brs_term brs_term_id="152" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> of that nature should not be recoverable. ... If that were correct, the <brs_term brs_term_id="704" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> in this case would arise upon the completion of the building and the payment therefor by the Plaintiff since the Plaintiff wouldhave obtained a building with an inherent latent defect which may or may not give rise to physical damage. ...</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="180"><p class="quote">Evidently, the Judge below considered that the defects in the design were such that physical damage was likely to be brought about.On this basis, I consider that the point of time at which the Plaintiff suffered economic <brs_term brs_term_id="153" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> by reason of the defective design was the date when it acquired and paid for the building with the defective design.

A modern high-rise building is a highly complex structure. Many componentsgo into its making. A builder, or an architect or engineer, will owe duties in contract, but can be under no <brs_term brs_term_id="708" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term> in <brs_term brs_term_id="711" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> to all the world to ensure that the building is free of all defects: Whether negligently caused or otherwise. Thus, in the EnglishLaw Commission report on &quot;Civil <brs_term brs_term_id="709" brs_term_type="9">Liability</brs_term> of Vendors and Lessors of Defective Premises&quot; (Law Commission No. 40, dated 15 December 1970) the adjective &quot;defective&quot;is used in two senses.

A house is defective if its conditionfalls short of the standard of quality which the purchaser is entitled to expect: What the report refers to as &quot;defects of quality&quot;.The Law Commission recommended amending the law to protect purchasers and lessees of <em>dwellings</em> (<em>not</em> commercial or industrial premises) to give them a right of action against builders for defects of quality. This then led to the DefectivePremises Act 1972 - which has no counterpart in Hong Kong.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="187"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p45" name="p45">45.</a> Here, Palmer &amp; Turner accepted at trial that the plan they passed was &quot;defective&quot; in that it failed to provide adequatelyfor the differential movement between the cladding and the structure of the building: See paragraph (vii) of the admissions referredto earlier. This led eventually to the spalling and cracking of some of the slabs, exposing the Bank to the risk of endangering others.Formulated in this way, the <em>physical damage</em> was an ingredient of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1746" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> against the architects. What the Court of Appeal accepted was something quite radical in this field of law: The court should unhookthe ingredient of physical damage from the <brs_term brs_term_id="716" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term>, viewing the case as one of <em>pure economic</em> <brs_term brs_term_id="157" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>. The difficulty facing the Court of Appeal was this: <em>Both</em> parties were urging this radical <brs_term brs_term_id="1747" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term> with opposing results. The defendants <brs_term brs_term_id="156" brs_term_type="9">submitted</brs_term> that, adopting this <brs_term brs_term_id="1748" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term>, the <brs_term brs_term_id="717" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrued the moment the Bank acted upon the &quot;advice&quot; of the architects (in 1982), whilst the plaintiff urged that it accruedwhen diminution in the market value of the building was reasonably discoverable (in 1993).</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="188"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p46" name="p46">46.</a> The notion that the discipline of law might have required the court to have regard to the <brs_term brs_term_id="719" brs_term_type="9">statutory scheme</brs_term> governing <brs_term brs_term_id="718" brs_term_type="9">limitation periods</brs_term> for latent defects in buildings, in particular its historical development, seems to have found little favour in the courts below.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="189"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p47" name="p47">47.</a> In these circumstances it is necessary to go back to first principles.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="190"><p class="heading">First principles</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="191"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p48" name="p48">48.</a> The early cases on <brs_term brs_term_id="722" brs_term_type="9">latent damage</brs_term> - <strong>Dutton v. Bognor Regis U.D.C., Sparham-Souter, Pirelli</strong> etc - all proceeded along Donoghue v. Stevenson lines. <strong>Dutton</strong> concerned a claim for <brs_term brs_term_id="724" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> brought by a house owner arising from defective foundations. The <brs_term brs_term_id="728" brs_term_type="9">trial judge</brs_term> held that the &quot;neighbour&quot; principle in <strong>Donoghue v. Stevenson</strong>, as subsequently developed, applied to the case. He awarded <brs_term brs_term_id="725" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> against the local council, for failure to inspect the foundations properly, based on the estimated cost of repair, surveyor's feesand diminution in the value of the house. The council appealed. In the Court of Appeal at 393-F Lord Denning <brs_term brs_term_id="720" brs_term_type="9">MR</brs_term> said that the distinction between chattels and real property was quite unsustainable, and agreed with the judge that the case couldbe brought within <strong>Donoghue v. Stevenson</strong> principles (see p.397-C); it was a question whether the court should apply them: See also Sachs LJ at 405-B, 406-B and Stamp LJ at409-H to 411-F. It was taken for granted that physical damage to the plaintiff's property was at the heart of the <brs_term brs_term_id="723" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term>: Though, as Lord Denning <brs_term brs_term_id="721" brs_term_type="9">MR</brs_term> remarked at 396-E, if the foundations were negligently passed but the owner discovered the defect before the building collapsed andinjured someone, the council would still be <brs_term brs_term_id="1887" brs_term_type="9">liable</brs_term>: Even though, in such an instance, the damage suffered would be in the nature of economic loss: Damage to the plaintiff's pocketand not to the building. In <strong>Dutton</strong>, the appeal concerned only the council, the action against the builder having been settled before trial. It was however recognizedthat if the builder was not liable for <brs_term brs_term_id="726" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> for negligence in building the house, the council could not be liable for passing the bad work. So <strong>Dutton</strong> involved more than the council's <brs_term brs_term_id="1888" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term> for <brs_term brs_term_id="731" brs_term_type="9">breach</brs_term> of bye-laws, and extended the scope of <strong>Donoghue v.

Workingout some of the more detailed rules could well be a gradual process, and not free from difficulty. But the present case does notseem to me to give rise to any special difficulties in relation to questions of law as to the <brs_term brs_term_id="738" brs_term_type="9">duty of care</brs_term> and the <brs_term brs_term_id="737" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> ...

If the latent defect causes actual physical damage to the structure of the building itself, rather than <em>other</em> property, the defendant is still liable. The analysis focuses upon physical damage; and, as can be seen in <strong>Pirelli</strong> itself, the court ignores the somewhat theoretical question of &quot;pure&quot; economic <brs_term brs_term_id="165" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>, that is to say <brs_term brs_term_id="750" brs_term_type="9">breach</brs_term> of duty which does not lead to physical damage.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="203"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p56" name="p56">56.</a> This <brs_term brs_term_id="1755" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term> is founded upon common sense.

Of particular relevance, for the purposes of the presentcase, is <strong>Murphy</strong> which concerned errors in the design of the foundation of a house: The passing of the plans by the local council was delegated toan independent contractor who failed to spot the errors in the design. The <brs_term brs_term_id="761" brs_term_type="9">trial judge</brs_term> found that the extensive damage to the walls and pipes caused by subsidence posed an imminent danger to the safety and health ofthe plaintiff and, following <strong>Anns</strong>, awarded <brs_term brs_term_id="757" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> of ï¿¡35,000, being the diminution in the market value of the house.

The Court of Appeal, following Anns, upheld the judge.

The <brs_term brs_term_id="775" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> in <strong>Murphy</strong> held that this went too far - thereby giving, as Sir Robin Cooke, President of the New Zealand Court of Appeal, remarked in an articlein (1991) 107 LQR at 54, one of the most striking instances in the history of English law of judicial legislation. In &quot;clawingback&quot; on the scope of the <brs_term brs_term_id="771" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> of negligence in cases of pure economic <brs_term brs_term_id="174" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>, the <brs_term brs_term_id="776" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> in <strong>Murphy</strong> was not directly concerned with <strong>Pirelli</strong> and <strong>Ketteman</strong>: Lord Keith of Kinkel alone, of the seven <brs_term brs_term_id="1891" brs_term_type="9">Law Lords</brs_term>, made observations on <strong>Pirelli</strong>, saying that where the plaintiff had a contractual relationship with the defendant, the case could be brought within the relianceprinciple in <strong>Hedley Byrne v. Heller</strong> (see p.466D-G). By this route Mr Thomas SC sought successfully in the present case to <brs_term brs_term_id="777" brs_term_type="9">lead</brs_term> the Court of Appeal to look at the <brs_term brs_term_id="773" brs_term_type="9">issue</brs_term> differently from the way it was seen in <strong>Pirelli</strong> and <strong>Ketteman</strong>: unhooking, as it were, the claim from the physical damage: If, following the <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong> <brs_term brs_term_id="1892" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term>, the <brs_term brs_term_id="769" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> could be said to arise when the Bank <em>relied</em> upon the professional advice of the architect, then the focus was no longer on <em>physical damage</em> to the building and what it might cost to repair that damage; it was on the diminution in the <em>value</em> of the building in consequence of the defect in the <em>design</em> for the cladding. The damage, if it occurred, must necessarily come much earlier in time. Mr Thomas was unable to cite a single caseconcerning <brs_term brs_term_id="767" brs_term_type="9">latent damage</brs_term> to buildings where this new <brs_term brs_term_id="1893" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term> was applied, but he argued by way of analogy with cases concerning negligent solicitors and the like, where the <brs_term brs_term_id="770" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrued as soon as the advice was given, and was acted upon by the plaintiff. As mentioned earlier, this view of the law was acceptedby the Court of Appeal.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="209"><p class="heading">How radical is this new <brs_term brs_term_id="1761" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term>?</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="210"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p61" name="p61">61.</a> What needs emphasis is this: What we are concerned with in this case is not simply some minor defect in quality which one sees everydayin a newly completed high-rise building. We are concerned with defects which, if not remedied, were very likely to cause seriousinjury to persons and property in the neighbourhood. As La Forest J said in <strong>Winnipeg Condominium Corporation v. Bird Construction Co.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2074%20BLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 74 BLR 1</a> at 10E-F - a case fairly close to the present one on the facts - &quot;the degree of danger to persons and other property createdby the negligent construction of a building is a cornerstone of the policy analysis that must take place in determining whether thecost of repair of the building is recoverable in <brs_term brs_term_id="780" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term>&quot; and, at least with respect to dangerous defects &quot;<brs_term brs_term_id="778" brs_term_type="9">compelling</brs_term> policy reasons exist for the imposition upon contractors of tortious <brs_term brs_term_id="1895" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term> for the cost of repair of these defects&quot;. La Forest J concluded that where a contractor (or any other person) is negligent inthe planning or construction of a building, and where that building is found to contain defects resulting from such negligence whichpose a real and substantial danger to the occupants, the reasonable cost of repairing the defects and putting the building back intoa non-dangerous state are, in principle, recoverable in <brs_term brs_term_id="781" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> by the occupants. The Supreme Court of Canada therefore rejected the broad bar against recovery for pure economic <brs_term brs_term_id="175" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> as established in <strong>Murphy</strong> and concluded that as far as Canada was concerned <strong>Anns</strong> was still good law.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="211"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p62" name="p62">62.</a> It is, of course, unnecessary for us to decide whether the <brs_term brs_term_id="178" brs_term_type="9">statement</brs_term> of principle in <strong>Winnipeg Condominium</strong> applies in Hong Kong - thereby, in effect, deciding that the rejection of <strong>Anns</strong> by the <brs_term brs_term_id="783" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> in <strong>Murphy</strong> is not a line we should follow - because in <strong>Winnipeg Condominium</strong> the plaintiff did not have the degree of proximity with the builder and the architects as the plaintiff has in this case. There was,in <strong>Winnipeg Condominium</strong>, no contractual relationship between them. Here, Palmer and Turner were directly engaged by the Bank as architects for the project,so proximity is not an <brs_term brs_term_id="176" brs_term_type="9">issue</brs_term>. What <strong>Winnipeg Condominium</strong> tells us is that the Supreme Court of Canada at any rate was not prepared to go along with the <brs_term brs_term_id="784" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> in <strong>D&amp;F Estates</strong> and <strong>Murphy</strong> in throwing over the traditional <brs_term brs_term_id="1763" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term>: So long as the economic <brs_term brs_term_id="177" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> flows directly from the physical damage, it is recoverable by the plaintiff.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="212"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p63" name="p63">63.</a> In so concluding, the Supreme Court of Canada was following the lead given by the majority of the High Court of Australia (MasonCJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ) in <strong>Bryan v. Maloney</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%2069%20ALJR%20375" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 69 ALJR 375</a> where, at 383, the majority said:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="213"><p class="quote">&quot;It is difficult to see why, as a matter of principle, policy or common sense, a negligent builder should be liable for ordinaryphysical injury caused to any person or to other property by reason of the collapse of a building by reason of the inadequacy ofthe foundations but be not liable to the owner of the building for the cost of remedial work necessary to remedy that inadequacyand to avert such damage. Indeed, there is obvious force in the view expressed by Lord Denning <brs_term brs_term_id="785" brs_term_type="9">MR</brs_term> in <em>Dutton v Bognor Regis Urban District Council</em> that, as a rational basis for differentiating between circumstances of <brs_term brs_term_id="786" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term> and circumstances of no <brs_term brs_term_id="787" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term>, such a <brs_term brs_term_id="179" brs_term_type="9">distinction</brs_term> is an 'impossible' one.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="214"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p64" name="p64">64.</a> Brennan J, at 391, said that it was artificial to classify defects in a building as pure economic <brs_term brs_term_id="180" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>.

His conclusion, concurred in by Leong JA, was as follows:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="227"><p class="quote">&quot; In any event, it seems to me, on Mr. Kinnear's evidence which was to the effect that after the initial failure of cladding,the Restenburg granite was likely to fail increasingly after a period of ten years hence even if the cladding of the building wasnot doomed to failure from the very beginning i.e. 1982, it must have been doomed to failure and in all probability did fail afterthe initial shrinkage and <brs_term brs_term_id="804" brs_term_type="9">creep</brs_term> had taken place i.e. 1984. This was particularly so because this would have partly been dependent, apparently, on the short periodbetween the completion of the concrete construction and the fixing of the granite. In Mr. Fong's evidence it showed that there washardly any delay between the completion of the concrete and the fixing of the granite. On this basis, it seems that physical defectsin the cladding would have emerged at least by 1985. On that footing, the <brs_term brs_term_id="803" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> would have accrued more than 6 years before the 1st July 1991 and the action would have been statute barred.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="228"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p74" name="p74">74.</a> The evidence adduced at trial was highly complex. What Rogers JA referred to in his <brs_term brs_term_id="806" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> was only part of the evidence. It is common ground that somewhere between the beginning of 1983 (when the building was completed)and the middle of 1993 (when the defects became progressively worse and experts were called in to advise), <brs_term brs_term_id="1898" brs_term_type="9">physical damage</brs_term> in the <strong>Pirelli</strong> sense <em>did</em> in fact occur; but as to <em>when</em> it first occurred, it falls to us in this Court to examine the evidence closely for the first time.

It marks the time when the <brs_term brs_term_id="805" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> first accrued on <strong>Pirelli</strong> principles.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="229"><p class="heading">Alternative dates</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="230"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p75" name="p75">75.</a> Another point needs emphasizing. As mentioned earlier, s. 31 of the <brs_term brs_term_id="808" brs_term_type="9"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a></brs_term> took effect on 1 July 1991.

This provision would assist the Bank by extending the time for bringing <brs_term brs_term_id="193" brs_term_type="9">proceedings</brs_term> unless, by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s38a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.38A(2)(a)</a>, the <brs_term brs_term_id="809" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> was already barred when <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31</a> became effective. Thus, on <strong>Pirelli</strong> principles, if physical damage first occurred <em>after</em> 1 July 1985 - say, at about the time when Mr Michael Tang of Hong Kong Land made his survey in September 1989 - then <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31</a> would come into play; the action would <em>not</em> have been time barred on 1 July 1991; the inquiry would then shift to the question when the Bank first acquired &quot;knowledge&quot;of the facts supporting the bringing of an action in terms of <brs_term brs_term_id="194" brs_term_type="9">subsections</brs_term> (5) and (7) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31.</a> But if the <brs_term brs_term_id="810" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> was already barred when <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31</a> came into effect, then the question of knowledge is irrelevant under the statutory scheme: The <brs_term brs_term_id="811" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> remained barred.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="231"><p class="heading">Overview of the facts</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="232"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p76" name="p76">76.</a> Many cases of <brs_term brs_term_id="813" brs_term_type="9">latent damage</brs_term> to buildings were cited to us in the course of argument, and even more are referred to in the printed cases. So far as can be seen,the present case stands unique upon its own facts. The changes in the structure of the Bank building were microscopic. They happenedover many years. Many factors were at work. Six experts testified at the trial, but none said categorically that given the particulardesign of the cladding as devised by Mr Ragaglini it was bound to fail. The <brs_term brs_term_id="814" brs_term_type="9">trial judge</brs_term> was criticized by the Court of Appeal for concentrating on <em>physical damage</em> to the building rather than the <em>economic <brs_term brs_term_id="195" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term></em> to the Bank caused by the defective design. But the reality on the ground reflects the judge's <brs_term brs_term_id="1769" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term>. There was evidence to the effect that a slab had to be replaced in 1991, another in 1992. Had an expert been brought in then, hewould have seen that something was seriously amiss. But that was some 8 or 9 years after the completion of the building. Any suggestionthat the Bank had, in 1982 when the building was first completed, incurred serious economic <brs_term brs_term_id="196" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> running into tens of millions of dollars would have been dismissed as absurd. Rogers JA, it will be recalled, did not think thatthe cladding was &quot;doomed to failure&quot; from the very beginning. When the problems really first emerged some ten years laterthe focus of every professional person concerned - Jones Lang Wootton the property managers, Mr Douglas Collins director of P&amp;TArchitects and Engineers Ltd, CDC Inc. consultants to TW, Binnie Consultants Ltd acting for the Bank - was on the cladding and notthe drawings. In a report to TW dated 7 October 1993 CDC Inc. said that they had not seen any &quot;design or as-built drawings&quot;,and yet they considered themselves in a position to render professional advice. It is therefore not surprising that the judge's focusshould have been on the <em>physical damage</em>: the cracking and spalling of the granite slabs: this was the matter of concern to the parties and this eventually led to the entirecladding being replaced.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="233"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p77" name="p77">77.</a> Further, this point needs emphasis: The <brs_term brs_term_id="197" brs_term_type="9">case</brs_term> against Palmer &amp; Turner proceeded on admissions: It was admitted that the architects knew or ought to have known that the defectsas <brs_term brs_term_id="816" brs_term_type="9">pleaded</brs_term> might <brs_term brs_term_id="198" brs_term_type="9">constitute</brs_term> <em>danger of physical injury to persons or properties</em> in the vicinity of the Bank building. The duty owed to the Bank, as admitted by them, was a duty to avoid economic <brs_term brs_term_id="199" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> by acts or <brs_term brs_term_id="815" brs_term_type="9">omissions</brs_term> giving rise to danger of <em>physical injury</em> to persons or properties: Unless bits of the stone cladding risked falling off there could be no such danger.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="234"><p class="heading">Rogers JA's test</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="235"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p78" name="p78">78.</a> As mentioned earlier, all 3 Justices of Appeal accepted Mr Thomas SC's primary contention. Rogers JA, in the passage of his <brs_term brs_term_id="817" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> referred to above, put forward the possibility of the Bank wishing to sell the Bank building immediately upon completion and thepurchaser, inspecting the building plans, then discovered &quot;that a proper allowance had not been made for shrinkage, <brs_term brs_term_id="818" brs_term_type="9">creep</brs_term> and thermal expansion and that the fixing means were an inappropriate design when taking into account the thickness of the cladding&quot;,such that the cladding might fail. This scenario is not supported by evidence. There was no evidence that a person, inspecting theplans at that time, with or without the help of professional advice, would or could have come to that conclusion.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="236"><p class="heading">Factors causing damage</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="237"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p79" name="p79">79.</a> There were many factors which contributed to the ultimate problem. Whilst, as a matter of short-hand, it is possible to put the problemdown to &quot;design fault&quot;, the matter was in fact far more complex. Take for example the phenomena known as <em><brs_term brs_term_id="43" brs_term_type="3">drying shrinkage</brs_term></em> and <em><brs_term brs_term_id="819" brs_term_type="9">creep</brs_term></em>. (<em>Shrinkage</em> refers to the drying of the concrete which causes <brs_term brs_term_id="44" brs_term_type="3">minute movement</brs_term>s of the concrete surfaces and <em><brs_term brs_term_id="820" brs_term_type="9">creep</brs_term></em> refers to the settling of the building). Although shrinkage could cause diminutions of up to 1.5 mm per storey height, the evidencewas that both phenomena would largely take place within the first few months of construction; thereafter movements due to these twofactors would be progressively reduced. Dr. Shillinglaw said in his report of March 1997 that according to &quot;average textbookcurves&quot; 40% of shrinkage and <brs_term brs_term_id="821" brs_term_type="9">creep</brs_term> occurred within the first 28 days. Accordingly, if the cladding had been mounted on the concrete structure after it had been givena few months to dry and settle, then little allowance for these factors would have been necessary in the plans.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="238"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p80" name="p80">80.</a> Another factor which contributed to some of the panels cracking and spalling was this: They were secured to the wall by means of<brs_term brs_term_id="45" brs_term_type="3">fish-tail hook</brs_term>s. The hooks went into recesses in the granite slabs. They were then grouted in with cement thereby locking the slabs in place. Hada <brs_term brs_term_id="47" brs_term_type="3">more malleable material</brs_term> been used, that would have allowed for some movement when the slabs reacted to temperature changes; as it was, the <brs_term brs_term_id="1902" brs_term_type="9">locking effect</brs_term> of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1900" brs_term_type="9">fish-tail hook</brs_term>s resulted in more stress to the cladding. Thus, it was not simply the design showing the use of fish-tail hooks which caused theproblem: it was the use of cement grout together with the <brs_term brs_term_id="824" brs_term_type="9">fish-tail hooks</brs_term> which contributed to the additional stress. Again, an examination of the plans was unlikely to have revealed this problem.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="239"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p81" name="p81">81.</a> There was yet another factor. The stainless steel hooks which secured the granite slabs to the reinforced concrete structure werenot wholly recessed into the slabs but intruded into the space between the slabs, thus prevented the slabs from moving within theexpansion joints by the designed amount. There were no contemporaneous drawings produced at the trial showing such a design for themountings: It is not clear from Rogers JA's <brs_term brs_term_id="825" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term>, when he referred to the &quot;purchaser&quot; inspecting the drawings, what precise drawings he had in mind. The fact that partsof the steel hooks intruded into the space between the slabs was, of course, not apparent: This was hidden by the mastic which sealedthe joints.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="240"><p class="heading">CP 298</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="241"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p82" name="p82">82.</a> At trial, and in the Court of Appeal, much was made by counsel of this fact: If one examined CP298 carefully, one would have seenthat a minimum of 13 mm width of <brs_term brs_term_id="826" brs_term_type="9">compression joints</brs_term> per floor was recommended, to accommodate the <brs_term brs_term_id="48" brs_term_type="3">irreversible shrinkage</brs_term> of a <brs_term brs_term_id="49" brs_term_type="3">reinforced concrete frame</brs_term>. In fact, what the drawings provided for were 6 mm <brs_term brs_term_id="827" brs_term_type="9">compression joints</brs_term> per floor, plus 20 mm <brs_term brs_term_id="828" brs_term_type="9">compression joints</brs_term> at the 7th, 13th and 18th floor levels. Mr Thomas, counsel for Palmer &amp; Turner, argued that this deviation would have been manifest:Without even looking at the drawings, an expert surveying the building after it was completed would have realized this was a &quot;designfault&quot;. This argument was rejected by the Court of Appeal. Rightly so. CP298 constituted nothing more than guide-lines; it wasagreed by the experts at the trial that CP298 did not apply to all cladding types and departures from its recommendations were permitted,provided performance equivalence could be demonstrated.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="242"><p class="heading">Why did the cladding fail?</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="243"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p83" name="p83">83.</a> In a report made by Dr Mathews and Dr Yates (of the British Research Establishment) for TW's solicitors in March 1997 these expertsconcluded as follows:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="244"><p class="quote">&quot;The damage to the cladding panels appears to be the result of a combination of four design and construction problems.

In his report he said:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="251"><p class="quote">&quot;My opinion, taking into account my calculations and those produced by the British Research Establishment, is that the claddingand the fixings would have been able to withstand the movements in building and the solar gains but due to the close follow on afterthe concrete pours, the cladding has been unable to cope with the excessive shrinkage of the concrete that has resulted.</p></brs_paragraph>        <brs_paragraph id="252"><p class="quote">Building movement has occurred due to concrete shrinkage as the moisture in the concrete has slowly evaporated.

This, he said, was &quot;relatively new knowledge&quot;:It was &quot;the same failure as occurred to the Comet airliner which never necessarily went beyond its <brs_term brs_term_id="52" brs_term_type="3">static strength</brs_term> but failed because it reached a lesser figure sufficiently frequently to fatigue it. The same phenomenon exists in granite&quot;.This was due to the diurnal changes in temperature over a long period.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="254"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p86" name="p86">86.</a> Mr Perry, called by Palmer &amp; Turner to testify as an expert, went rather further than the other experts in discounting the designfaults as the cause of the damage. He said in evidence:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="255"><p class="quote">&quot;I think the key thing I would like to highlight is at a design level this is an <brs_term brs_term_id="53" brs_term_type="4">adequate design</brs_term>. I am not suggesting it was a brilliant design, and nor am I suggesting that it was easy, necessarily, to supervise on site. Butnevertheless it is a relatively simple <brs_term brs_term_id="1772" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term>, and the criticisms that appear to have been given to it are really ones of execution, rather than conception, rather supervisionthan design.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="256"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p87" name="p87">87.</a> The judge however rejected his evidence in this regard.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="257"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p88" name="p88">88.</a> The evidence, as summarized above, was not referred to in Rogers JA's <brs_term brs_term_id="830" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> and contradicts his surmise that a purchaser of the Bank building examining the position at the end of 1982 would have concludedthat the cladding was going to fail.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="258"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p89" name="p89">89.</a> As mentioned earlier, at the trial, there was scant reference to the drawings. Such plans relating to the cladding as might havebeen lodged by Palmer &amp; Turner as Authorized Persons of the project with the Building Authority were never produced at trial.The only drawing produced was one dated 3 July 1981 showing 6 mm joints between the floors and the <brs_term brs_term_id="200" brs_term_type="9">statement</brs_term> &quot;mouvement horiz. joint 20 mm each 6 floors&quot;. On the evidence, this drawing, by itself, if seen by the hypothetical purchaserof the Bank building in 1982, would probably not have caused alarm. What eventually led to the failure of the cladding was not simplythe lack of space between the slabs in the design; it was that coupled with the other factors: The nature of the material itself,the way it was fixed to the concrete structure and the timing in the fixing process.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="259"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p90" name="p90">90.</a> As set out in Mr Kinnear's report of 18 March 1997 the reasons for the ultimate failure of the cladding were:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="260"><p>(a) The differential movements between the cladding and the structure due to drying shrinkage and <brs_term brs_term_id="831" brs_term_type="9">creep</brs_term>;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="261"><p>(b) Thermal expansion and contraction of stone due to diurnal and seasonal changes in temperature;</p></brs_paragraph>        <brs_paragraph id="262"><p>(c) Fatigue in the stone itself, possibly accentuated in some cases by the cutting and drilling operations inducing minor cracks whichweakened the stone.</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="263"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p91" name="p91">91.</a> From this Mr Kinnear reached the following conclusion:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="264"><p class="quote">&quot;I am able to conclude ... that there has been a progression from relatively minor 'chipping' of stone, referred to in the earliestreport at around 1989, to the very much more serious deep spalls and bowing of panels seen during my survey in November 1995 andwhich continues now to extend. The earliest damage seen in 1989 is consistent with the damage which would be expected at a relativelyearly age from consumption of the provision for compression movement. This would have caused natural defects in the stone and minorcracks induced in the stone during the cutting and drilling operations ... to begin to open. These items of damage are relativelyfew in number ... and not severe ....

As a practical and tacticalpoint, if the plaintiff is able to bring evidence establishing prima facie that the <brs_term brs_term_id="864" brs_term_type="9">limitation</brs_term> period has not yet expired, then it will be necessary for the defendant to rebut this if he is to <brs_term brs_term_id="1905" brs_term_type="9">succeed</brs_term> on the <brs_term brs_term_id="1906" brs_term_type="9">limitation</brs_term> point, but the correct formulation is nevertheless to say that the <brs_term brs_term_id="1904" brs_term_type="9">burden of proof</brs_term> remains on the plaintiff.

There the High Court of Australia was dealing with a case of damage to a house from inadequate <brs_term brs_term_id="58" brs_term_type="3">footing</brs_term>s; at p.503 Deane J said that the plaintiffs' claim as crystallised was not in respect of damage to the fabric of the house or toother property caused by collapse or subsidence of the house, it was for &quot;the loss ... represented by the actual inadequacyof the foundations, that is to say ... for the cost of remedying a structural defect in their property which already existed at thetime when they acquired it ...&quot;. Deane J then looked at two possibilities for determining when the <brs_term brs_term_id="895" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrued: (i) when the plaintiffs acquired the house, paying a higher price in ignorance of the inadequacy of the foundations, thusin effect suffering a <brs_term brs_term_id="223" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> or detriment at that time or (ii) when the inadequacy of the foundations were first known or manifest. Deane J considered the latterappropriate: only then did economic <brs_term brs_term_id="224" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> in the form of actual diminution of the market value of the house occur. In adopting this <brs_term brs_term_id="1786" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term> Lord Lloyd of Berwick in <strong>Invercargill</strong> said (at p.648-F):</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="291"><p class="quote">&quot;the <brs_term brs_term_id="904" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrues when the cracks become so bad, or the defects so obvious, that any reasonable homeowner would call in an expert.

Their Lordships do not think it is possible to define the moment more accurately.

The basis on which <strong>Sparham-Souter</strong> was over-ruled is significant. In <strong>Sparham-Souter</strong>, as mentioned earlier, Geoffrey Lane LJ had said there was no proper analogy between the situation there (a house with inadequatefoundations) and <strong>Cartledge v.

The <brs_term brs_term_id="926" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> determined in <strong>Pirelli</strong> that, in cases of buildings with latent defect, the principle which applied for the purposes of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.2(1)</a> of the <brs_term brs_term_id="924" brs_term_type="9">Limitation Act</brs_term> 1939, was the same as for all other negligence claim cases: including, for instance, claims against solicitors and valuers.

In <strong>Mount Albert Borough Council v. Johnson</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%202%20NZLR%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 2 NZLR 234</a> the New Zealand Court of Appeal held that in a latent defect case the <brs_term brs_term_id="940" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> under the <brs_term brs_term_id="943" brs_term_type="9">Limitation Act</brs_term> 1950 only arose when the defect became &quot;apparent or manifest&quot;. Ten years later, in <strong>Askin v. Knox</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20NZLR%20248" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 NZLR 248</a>, the Court of Appeal had the opportunity of reviewing the position, in the light of <strong>Pirelli</strong> which had been decided a few years before. The Court said that the guidance given in <strong>Mount Albert Borough Council</strong> should be followed. This was not necessary to the <brs_term brs_term_id="1792" brs_term_type="9">decision</brs_term> as the plaintiff had failed to prove negligence on the facts, but the Court of Appeal went out of its way to endorse <strong>Mount Albert Borough Council</strong> and at the same time expressed the view that Parliament should consider introducing a &quot;<brs_term brs_term_id="941" brs_term_type="9">longstop</brs_term>&quot; <brs_term brs_term_id="946" brs_term_type="9">limitation period</brs_term> such as the absolute limit of 15 years in the English <brs_term brs_term_id="939" brs_term_type="9">Latent Damage</brs_term> Act 1986, so that defendants should not be faced with inordinately <brs_term brs_term_id="937" brs_term_type="9">stale claims</brs_term>. The New Zealand Parliament acted on this suggestion and passed the Building Act 1991, introducing a &quot;<brs_term brs_term_id="65" brs_term_type="4">longstop</brs_term>&quot; <brs_term brs_term_id="1914" brs_term_type="9">limitation period</brs_term> similar to the Hong Kong s.32, but there was nothing equivalent to s.31: It was deemed unnecessary because the New Zealand Courtof Appeal in <strong>Askin v. Knox</strong> had not followed <strong>Pirelli</strong>: Plainly, by passing the Building Act 1991, protecting defendants from <brs_term brs_term_id="938" brs_term_type="9">stale claims</brs_term> by the &quot;longstop&quot;, the New Zealand Parliament must have endorsed the &quot;discoverability&quot; test which served the<brs_term brs_term_id="948" brs_term_type="9">interests</brs_term> of plaintiffs in cases where latent defects were not reasonably discoverable. Thus, the question facing the <brs_term brs_term_id="945" brs_term_type="9">Privy Council</brs_term> in 1995, when <strong>Invercargill</strong> was heard, was this: For the purposes of New Zealand law, must the clock be wound back to 1982, as if <strong>Pirelli</strong> principles governed in New Zealand, or should the reality be accepted that the law in New Zealand had for nearly two decades developeddifferently, and in this regard there would be no homogeneity in the <brs_term brs_term_id="944" brs_term_type="9">common law</brs_term>?</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="311"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p122" name="p122">122.</a> No such problem faces us here.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="312"><p class="heading">The way forward</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="313"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p123" name="p123">123.</a> The <brs_term brs_term_id="955" brs_term_type="9">statutory scheme</brs_term> for the <brs_term brs_term_id="953" brs_term_type="9">limitation</brs_term> of actions strikes a balance between the competing <brs_term brs_term_id="952" brs_term_type="9">interests</brs_term> of the parties. Section 4(1)(a) of the <brs_term brs_term_id="950" brs_term_type="9"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a></brs_term> does not require plaintiffs to put forward tortious claims based upon mere surmise. Actual damage is a natural ingredient of anyclaim in <brs_term brs_term_id="951" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term>. It is, as Brennan J said in <strong>Bryan v. Maloney</strong> at 391, artificial to classify defects in a building as pure economic <brs_term brs_term_id="235" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="314"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p124" name="p124">124.</a> The harm done by the defendants' negligence is not purely economic: It is physical damage to the building as well. The case for &quot;re-classifying&quot;such damage has not, in my judgment, been made out.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="315"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p125" name="p125">125.</a> Cases where actual damage can be shown to have occurred more than 6 years before the plaintiff discovers it will be rare. Take thisvery case: Upon the evidence, the physical damage found by the then managers of the Bank building in September 1989 ought, in theview of some of the experts, to have led to further investigation. If experts had been called in then, it is at least possible thatthe cracking and spalling of the granite then observed might have been traced to defects in the design and in the manner of construction.Thus, upon classic <strong>Pirelli</strong> lines the Bank might well have commenced <brs_term brs_term_id="237" brs_term_type="9">proceedings</brs_term> within time even without the help of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31</a>, if Hong Kong Land had alerted the Bank to their findings and they had acted promptly in seeking expert advice.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="316"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p126" name="p126">126.</a> Where the design has led to the construction of a building which was <em>bound</em> to cause the owner to <brs_term brs_term_id="959" brs_term_type="9">incur</brs_term> additional expense (be it for remedial work or <brs_term brs_term_id="958" brs_term_type="9">reinstatement</brs_term>) it would be a rare case if a defect so profound does not give rise to manifest physical damage within 6 years.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="317"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p127" name="p127">127.</a> As I see it, we have in Hong Kong a legal regime for dealing with latent defect claims which is well grounded in established principlesand which is entirely reconcilable with other negligence claims in the tortious field. The <brs_term brs_term_id="239" brs_term_type="9">submission</brs_term> made by Mr Mauleverer that the &quot;trend&quot; of legal development, at least since <strong>Murphy</strong>, is to adopt the &quot;discoverability&quot; test is, in my judgment, far too superficial. This is not reconcilable with our <brs_term brs_term_id="963" brs_term_type="9">statutory scheme</brs_term> for the <brs_term brs_term_id="962" brs_term_type="9">limitation</brs_term> of actions in <brs_term brs_term_id="961" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term>. It is no answer to say that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31</a> does not, as such, endorse <strong>Pirelli</strong> but simply mitigates its effect. Whilst it is true that the concept of a <em><brs_term brs_term_id="960" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term></em> accruing at a certain date, as embodied in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4(1)</a>, is derived from <brs_term brs_term_id="66" brs_term_type="4">judge-made law</brs_term>, and therefore can be modified in this Court to suit changing circumstances, we should be slow to shift with what might be perceivedas the moving tide.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="318"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p128" name="p128">128.</a> Earlier, I had referred to Lord Reid's <brs_term brs_term_id="970" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> in <strong>Cartledge v.

I respectfully question whether this criticism of Lord Reid's <brs_term brs_term_id="971" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> in <strong>Cartledge v. Jopling</strong> is justified. The <brs_term brs_term_id="968" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> was there seeking to give meaning to the words &quot;the date on which the <brs_term brs_term_id="967" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrued&quot;, and all that Lord Reid was saying was that those words could not be given a different meaning in the case of <brs_term brs_term_id="964" brs_term_type="9">latent damage</brs_term>: particularly having regard to the fact that where fraud or concealment were involved, that was already covered by the statute. Loop-holeswere for the legislature to fill: It was not proper for the courts to distort the plain meaning of well-worn words in order to strainfor a particular result in an individual case.

It has what is known as a<brs_term brs_term_id="1012" brs_term_type="9">dry hung</brs_term> granite cladding. Large panels of it were mounted on anchors which were in turn attached to the building. The sub-contract for thedesign of the system and for the execution of the work was let to Tsien Wui Marble Factory Limited. Payments were to be made by stagesupon certification by the architects. Tsien Wui submitted their first invoice in August 1981 which appears to have been paid sometimebefore 21 November 1981. The architects and structural engineers for the redevelopment as a whole were Palmer &amp; Turner who passedthe plans produced by Tsien Wui. The cladding was completed in July 1982. The <brs_term brs_term_id="1004" brs_term_type="9">occupation permit</brs_term> was issued in November 1982 and the building as a whole was completed in March 1983 but the completion of the building and the issueof the <brs_term brs_term_id="1005" brs_term_type="9">occupation permit</brs_term> does not appear to have any relevance to the date of completion of the cladding. The cladding failed and has had to be replaced ata cost in excess of $38,000,000. The Bank issued a <brs_term brs_term_id="1016" brs_term_type="9">writ</brs_term> against Tsien Wui on 20 June 1994 alleging <brs_term brs_term_id="1013" brs_term_type="9">breach</brs_term> of contract and negligence. At trial it was accepted that, except for a claim under an alleged guarantee, the claim in contract was<brs_term brs_term_id="1008" brs_term_type="9">time barred</brs_term>. On 25 May 1996 the Bank issued a <brs_term brs_term_id="1017" brs_term_type="9">writ</brs_term> against Palmer &amp; Turner also alleging <brs_term brs_term_id="1014" brs_term_type="9">breach</brs_term> of contract and negligence but again at trial it was accepted that the claim in contract was <brs_term brs_term_id="1009" brs_term_type="9">time barred</brs_term>. The actions were consolidated and were heard by Findlay J. He found in favour of Tsien Wui. He found that Tsien Wui had not givenany guarantee and that it was not liable in negligence because it had employed an independent contractor, a Mr Ragaglini, to producethe design. Palmer &amp; Turner admitted negligence but argued that that <brs_term brs_term_id="1006" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> was <brs_term brs_term_id="1010" brs_term_type="9">time barred</brs_term>. He found against them. The Court of Appeal upheld the <brs_term brs_term_id="252" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> in favour of Tsien Wui and reversed the <brs_term brs_term_id="253" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> against Palmer &amp; Turner <brs_term brs_term_id="1015" brs_term_type="9">holding</brs_term> that the <brs_term brs_term_id="1007" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> in the latter case was <brs_term brs_term_id="1011" brs_term_type="9">time barred</brs_term>. The matter thus comes before this Court.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="346"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p143" name="p143">143.</a> The claim on the guarantee against Tsien Wui was based on clause 2.15 appearing in the tender documents and incorporated into thesub-contract.

It argued successfully in the Courts below that on the facts itshould nevertheless not be liable. The evidence was that to the knowledge of the Bank Tsien Wui lacked the necessary expertise in<brs_term brs_term_id="1020" brs_term_type="9">dry hung</brs_term> cladding and that with the knowledge and approval of the Bank it had employed the services of a specialist, Mr Ragaglini. I regretthat I must disagree with the Courts below as to the consequences of this evidence. Tsien Wui was a nominated sub-contractor andremained liable for the design unless they were released from that responsibility. The evidence does not go that far. It has notbeen argued that Tsien Wui did not otherwise owe the relevant <brs_term brs_term_id="1019" brs_term_type="9">duty of care</brs_term> to the Bank. If they could not produce a proper design themselves it was their duty to procure one. They knew that reliance wouldbe placed upon it.

A number of the <brs_term brs_term_id="266" brs_term_type="9">submissions</brs_term> also mentioned the practical problems, especially in terms of evidence, of defending an action many years after the events givingrise to it and some <brs_term brs_term_id="267" brs_term_type="9">suggested</brs_term> that these had led to a growing number of insubstantial claims.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="372"><p>Primarily, the legislature both in England and in Hong Kong considered that the <brs_term brs_term_id="1066" brs_term_type="9">limitation</brs_term> for actions in both <brs_term brs_term_id="1065" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> and contract was properly set at six years from the date of accrual of the action. Of that period, Bingham LJ said in <strong>D.W. Moore and Co. Ltd v.

On the one hand, defendants are to be protected from <brs_term brs_term_id="74" brs_term_type="2">stale claim</brs_term>s when documents or witnesses are no longer available or memories, from the passing of time, supervening illness or other reasons,have faded or failed. The present case is an example of this. The plans for the cladding should have been lodged with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123" class="autolink_findacts">Buildings Ordinance</a> Office but no trace of them has been found there. It may have been expected that Palmer &amp; Turner or Tsien Wui would have kepta copy but apparently they have not. The only document which might conceivably be called a plan was the rough sketch on a singlepiece of paper apparently drawn up by <brs_term brs_term_id="1068" brs_term_type="9">Mr</brs_term> Ragaglini during a meeting. In these circumstances that rough sketch was the only plan produced and the experts who gave evidenceand the Court were deprived of the opportunity of examining the full set of the actual documents. Few memoranda or minutes of meetings,if they ever existed, appear to have been kept and those that were produced contained nothing useful on the question of <brs_term brs_term_id="1078" brs_term_type="9">limitation</brs_term>. It takes only a quick reading of the transcript of the evidence to appreciate that memories have faded. On the other hand, the compromisemeans that there will be hard cases where a plaintiff sets out an apparently <brs_term brs_term_id="1922" brs_term_type="9">unanswerable</brs_term> claim only to find that his action has been <brs_term brs_term_id="1803" brs_term_type="9">time barred</brs_term>. So, for instance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5</a> of the Ordinance, which has been in the Ordinance since its inception and which finds its equivalent in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(1)</a> of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1076" brs_term_type="9">Limitation Act</brs_term>, provides that in cases of successive conversions time begins to run from the accrual of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1072" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> in respect of the first conversion. In <strong>R.B. Policies at Lloyd's v. Butler</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1950%5d%201%20KB%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1950] 1 KB 76</a> a motor car was stolen by an unidentified thief and was then sold to an innocent purchaser. The plaintiff's claim against the purchaserwould have seemed to be irresistible but more than six years had elapsed since the theft. The fact that the plaintiff could not havetaken <brs_term brs_term_id="1802" brs_term_type="9">proceedings</brs_term> against an unknown thief did not assist him. The action was held to be <brs_term brs_term_id="1075" brs_term_type="9">time barred</brs_term>. In <strong>Cartledge v. Jopling</strong> the plaintiffs had contracted <brs_term brs_term_id="1069" brs_term_type="9">pneumoconiosis</brs_term>. It was held that the <brs_term brs_term_id="1073" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrued when more than negligible damage had been suffered even though the plaintiffs did not know and could not have known of it.However hard these cases may be, it is not for the Courts effectively to allow extensions when the legislature has not done so. Toborrow the words of Sir Thomas Bingham MR in <strong>Spencer-Ward v. Humberts</strong> (<brs_term brs_term_id="1071" brs_term_type="9">unreported</brs_term>, English Court of Appeal, 6 July 1994) said in another connection,</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="376"><p class="quote">&quot;It would be a pity if a desire to be indulgent to plaintiffs led the court to be unfair to defendants.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="377"><p>To this I would add that it would be unfortunate if the courts were to ignore the legislation in an attempt to effect an undefinedsolution of <brs_term brs_term_id="1082" brs_term_type="9">fairness</brs_term>. It is the task of the Courts to construe provisions bearing in mind the purposes of the legislation and the provisions of the Ordinanceas a whole. There appears, however, to have been a current in the Courts in England and other Commonwealth jurisdictions to amelioratethe position of plaintiffs who could not have known of or discovered the damage they had suffered before the period of <brs_term brs_term_id="1083" brs_term_type="9">limitation</brs_term> expired.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="378"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p151" name="p151">151.</a> Neither the Courts nor the legislatures in England and in Hong Kong have been unaware of the difficulties in a case where there hasbeen <brs_term brs_term_id="1086" brs_term_type="9">damage</brs_term> which is neither discovered nor discoverable. As long ago as 1886 the <brs_term brs_term_id="1085" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> decided the appeal in <strong>The Darley Main Colliery Company v.

It was held that the second subsidence created a fresh <brs_term brs_term_id="1084" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> so that the action was within time.

Jopling</strong>. At page 781 of the report of that decision Lord Pearce referred to the words of Lord Halsbury which I have cited. He continued,</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="382"><p class="quote">&quot;The <brs_term brs_term_id="1092" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrued when it&quot; that is to say the damage &quot;reached a stage, whether then known or unknown, at which a judge could properlygive <brs_term brs_term_id="1093" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> for the harm that had been done.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="383"><p>Each of their Lordships were in agreement that the <brs_term brs_term_id="1094" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrued when more than minimal damage was done even though the plaintiffs did not know and could not reasonably have known of it.Each of them came to this conclusion with clearly expressed reluctance. At the time, the only impediment in the <brs_term brs_term_id="1097" brs_term_type="9">Limitation Act</brs_term> which compelled them to hold that discovery or discoverability was irrelevant was section 26 of the Act which is in the same termsas section 26 of the Ordinance. That section provides that where (1) the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant or (2) anyfact relevant to the plaintiff's <brs_term brs_term_id="1098" brs_term_type="9">right of action</brs_term> has been deliberately concealed from him by the defendant or (3) the action is for <brs_term brs_term_id="1099" brs_term_type="9">relief</brs_term> from the consequences of a mistake, time does not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered or could with reasonable diligencehave discovered the fraud, concealment or mistake as the case may be. The section proceeds upon the assumption that a <brs_term brs_term_id="1095" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> has in fact accrued even though the plaintiff is ignorant of it and could not reasonably have discovered the necessary facts. Itdoes not postpone the date of accrual of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1096" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term>. In appropriate circumstances it simply postpones the date from which time is to run.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="384"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p153" name="p153">153.</a> At page 772 of the report of <strong>Cartledge v. Jopling</strong> Lord Reid said that if the matter had been governed by <brs_term brs_term_id="1106" brs_term_type="9">Common Law</brs_term> he would have held that a <brs_term brs_term_id="1105" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> ought not be held to accrue until either the injured person had discovered it or it would have been possible for him to have discoveredit if he had taken such steps as were reasonable in the circumstances. He then read the two English sections, <brs_term brs_term_id="275" brs_term_type="9">section</brs_term> 2(1)(a) and <brs_term brs_term_id="276" brs_term_type="9">section</brs_term> 26, together and said,</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="385"><p class="quote">&quot;But the present question depends on statute, the <brs_term brs_term_id="1107" brs_term_type="9">Limitation Act</brs_term>, 1939, and <brs_term brs_term_id="277" brs_term_type="9">section</brs_term> 26 of that Act appears to me to make it impossible to reach the result which I have indicated. That section makes special provisionswhere fraud or mistake is involved: it provides that time shall not begin to run until the fraud has been or could with reasonablediligence have been discovered. Fraud here has been given a wide interpretation, but obviously it could not be extended to coverthis case. The <brs_term brs_term_id="1804" brs_term_type="9">necessary implication</brs_term> from that section is that, where fraud or mistake is not involved, time begins to run whether or not the damage could be discovered.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="386"><p>Lord Evershed at page 773 said,</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="387"><p class="quote">&quot;To postpone the date in such a case as the present would, in my opinion, necessarily require the insertion of some words qualifyingthe statutory formula. <brs_term brs_term_id="1110" brs_term_type="9">My Lords</brs_term>, the well-established principles of the interpretation of statutes by the courts of this country forbid such an insertion; and moreparticularly so having regard to the <brs_term brs_term_id="1111" brs_term_type="9">express provision</brs_term> in <brs_term brs_term_id="280" brs_term_type="9">section</brs_term> 26 of the same Act for postponing the date of the accrual of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1112" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> in cases involving fraud or mistake to the date when the fraud or mistake was, or could with reasonable diligence, have been discovered.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="388"><p>The reference to the postponement of the date of accrual of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1113" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> rather than to the postponement of the date for the commencement of the running of time is clearly a slip.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="389"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p154" name="p154">154.</a> Quite apart from <brs_term brs_term_id="281" brs_term_type="9">authority</brs_term> it is clear that the discovery or <brs_term brs_term_id="76" brs_term_type="4">discoverability of damage</brs_term> cannot in itself amount to damage. To adopt the words of Lord Halsbury in <strong>Darley</strong> set out above, if damage is suffered then there is damage to the extent that it has been suffered. The discovery of damage is self-evidentlynot the occurrence of damage. So, in <strong>Cartledge v. Jopling</strong> Lord Pearce at page 778 said,</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="390"><p class="quote">&quot;Nor can his knowledge of the state of his lungs be the deciding factor. It would be impossible to hold that while the X-rayphotographs are being taken he cannot yet have suffered any damage to his body, but that immediately the result of them is told tohim, he has from that moment suffered damage.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="391"><p>Once relevant damage has been sustained, one of the necessary elements of an action in <brs_term brs_term_id="1115" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> exists. The discovery, or discoverability, of it does not cause or <brs_term brs_term_id="1116" brs_term_type="9">amount to</brs_term> damage. It does neither more nor less than to provide the evidence for the plaintiff to prove his damage or the extent of it. Absentlegislation, ignorance of the damage or the inability to discover it cannot assist any more than ignorance of or the inability todiscover the identity of a <brs_term brs_term_id="77" brs_term_type="2">tortfeasor</brs_term> can assist. It was aptly put by Mr <brs_term brs_term_id="1114" brs_term_type="9">Recorder</brs_term> Moxon-Browne QC in <strong>Western Challenge Housing Ltd v.

That section applies to anyaction for negligence, <brs_term brs_term_id="1122" brs_term_type="9">nuisance</brs_term> or <brs_term brs_term_id="1123" brs_term_type="9">breach</brs_term> of duty where the <brs_term brs_term_id="1118" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> claimed by the plaintiff consist of or include <brs_term brs_term_id="1119" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> for <brs_term brs_term_id="1120" brs_term_type="9">personal injury</brs_term>. By <brs_term brs_term_id="1128" brs_term_type="9">subsection</brs_term> (2), where the section applies, section 4 is not to apply. <brs_term brs_term_id="287" brs_term_type="9">Subsection</brs_term> (4) provides that, except in the case of death, the <brs_term brs_term_id="1121" brs_term_type="9">limitation period</brs_term> for such actions is to be three years from</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="394"><p class="quote">&quot;(a) the date on which the <brs_term brs_term_id="1129" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrued; or</p></brs_paragraph>        <brs_paragraph id="395"><p class="quote">(b) the date (if later) of the plaintiff's knowledge.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="396"><p>Provisions are then made to ascertain the date of knowledge.

Section 32, which provides a long-stop of 15 years, applies to all actions in negligenceexcept for those within section 27. The section and section 30 apply only to cases of <brs_term brs_term_id="1133" brs_term_type="9">personal injury</brs_term>. These sections therefore have no application to cases of pure economic <brs_term brs_term_id="289" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> or to damage caused to buildings. Section 27 did not purport to overturn the <brs_term brs_term_id="78" brs_term_type="2">ratio decidendi</brs_term> of <strong>Cartledge v. Jopling</strong>. <brs_term brs_term_id="300" brs_term_type="9">Subsection</brs_term> (2) removes the application of section 4(a) but <brs_term brs_term_id="298" brs_term_type="9">section</brs_term> 27(4)(a) provides that time begins to run from the date of the accrual of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1130" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> while cutting down the period from six to three years. <strong>Cartledge v.

The plaintiff issued its <brs_term brs_term_id="1147" brs_term_type="9">writ</brs_term> in October 1978. The plaintiff's argument was that time did not begin to run until the damage was discoverable.

For many years it had been accepted that the relevant date was the date of such a notice although this was neverspecified or otherwise indicated by the Act. I need not go further into the details of the case other than to say that it was notuntil April of 1961 that the new building could have commenced, by which time building costs had risen more than two-fold. The Associationinsisted that that was the relevant date at which compensation was to be assessed. The Corporation insisted on the date of the noticeto treat and called in aid subsequent Acts which clearly proceeded upon that basis by providing for a period after the date of thenotice to treat as being the relevant period for assessment. In relation to those subsequent Acts, Lord Reid said at page 898,</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="413"><p class="quote">&quot;These provisions do show that Parliament (or the <brs_term brs_term_id="1194" brs_term_type="9">draftsman</brs_term>) must have thought the law was that compensation was assessable on the basis of the value as at the date of the notice to treat.But the mere fact that an enactment shows that Parliament must have thought that the law was one thing does not <brs_term brs_term_id="1925" brs_term_type="9">preclude</brs_term> the courts from deciding that the law was in fact something different .... No doubt the position would be different if the provisionsof the enactment were such that they were only workable if the law was as Parliament supposed it to be.

I do say that it is not and cannot be the law in either Hong Kong or England forreasons I have already given. It is as contrary to the logic of and the decision in <strong>Cartledge v.

Nor can I readily accept the concept that economic <brs_term brs_term_id="358" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> is suffered in relation to a building only when the market value is affected.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="428"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p163" name="p163">163.</a> The <brs_term brs_term_id="1932" brs_term_type="9">proposition</brs_term> that economic <brs_term brs_term_id="362" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> in relation to a building is suffered only when its market value is depreciated is one which to my mind involves insuperable difficultiesgenerally. It ignores the fact that damage has already occurred and that discovery is not damage of itself and cannot itself causedamage. It necessarily means that the owner of the property would be selling it or otherwise dealing with it, for instance, by wayof mortgage. That is to say, it involves realising a loss rather than suffering it, for the <brs_term brs_term_id="1263" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> has been suffered when the damage or defect came into existence. It is not unknown for some owners to put up property for sale forthe purposes of <brs_term brs_term_id="1269" brs_term_type="9">testing</brs_term> the market without any intention of actually selling or mortgaging. To my mind it necessarily draws a <brs_term brs_term_id="1933" brs_term_type="9">distinction</brs_term> between the damage necessary or sufficient as one of the bases of a <brs_term brs_term_id="1257" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> in negligence between saleable objects, such as buildings, on the one hand and objects which are not saleable, such as the humanbody and, in cases of pure economic loss, cases such as tax, legal and valuation advice on the other. I can see no logical <brs_term brs_term_id="1266" brs_term_type="9">justification</brs_term> for any such distinction. It confuses or equates physical damage with economic damage. In the latter case no physical damage is necessary.It confuses the damage necessary for a <brs_term brs_term_id="1258" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> in negligence and the evidence necessary to prove the damage or its quantum. In truth, where a latent defect exists in a physicalobject damage exists. Cracks in a building are surely manifestations of a latent defect which must have been working insidiouslyon the structure before the cracks occur just as <brs_term brs_term_id="1255" brs_term_type="9">pneumoconiosis</brs_term> works upon the human body before symptoms occur. As a practical matter, there is a difficulty as to by whom a defect must be knownbefore it can be said that the market value of a building has been depreciated. The vast majority of people in Hong Kong live inflats between which and commercial or other buildings no distinction is made in this respect by legislation. Flats are usually sold&quot;as is&quot; with questions being raised only as to such matters as <brs_term brs_term_id="1818" brs_term_type="9">title</brs_term> and <brs_term brs_term_id="1256" brs_term_type="9">encumbrances</brs_term>. Surveys are not usually performed. An owner who knows of a serious latent defect and who sells &quot;as is&quot; without disclosingit would therefore not be caught by the provisions of section 26. On the other hand, in the unlikely event of a purchaser obtaininga survey report which discloses the defect the purchaser would very likely simply break off negotiations without telling the vendorwhy. The market value would then have been depreciated so far as that prospective purchaser is concerned, without the <brs_term brs_term_id="1817" brs_term_type="9">knowledge</brs_term> of the owner. Quite apart from this in the case of a house, damage may be discovered accidentally such as when a workman goes intothe upper spaces of a house and notices serious cracking. Whether he chooses to say anything or not about this fortuitous discoverypresents a lottery upon a lottery. A question then also arises as to the qualifications of any person who should, by chance or design,have noticed any damage or defect. In the present case, a member of the management company, Hong Kong Land, drew up a report in 1989.Findlay J found that the contents of that report were, if anything, reassuring. No doubt the author of the report found nothing alarming,but he was not a cladding expert. By contrast the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence of the cladding experts was that anexpert would have recognised that that damage required further <brs_term brs_term_id="1261" brs_term_type="9">investigation</brs_term>. This evidence immediately takes the case out of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1265" brs_term_type="9">ambit</brs_term> of <strong>Invercargill</strong> where the damage by way of defects was undiscovered. More importantly, however, it does not seem right that the accrual of a <brs_term brs_term_id="1259" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> should depend upon whether the damage is seen and appreciated to be damage from a latent defect by an expert or whether it is notappreciated to be such by a building manager. Finally, I note without further comment at the moment that in <strong>Invercargill</strong>, apart from <strong>Pirelli</strong>, the decision in <strong>Murphy v. Brentwood District Council</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 AC 398</a> was not followed.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="429"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p164" name="p164">164.</a> Mr Thomas urged upon us Article 8 of the Basic Law which reads,</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="430"><p class="quote">&quot;The laws previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the <brs_term brs_term_id="1275" brs_term_type="9">common law</brs_term>, <brs_term brs_term_id="1276" brs_term_type="9">rules of equity</brs_term>, ordinances, <brs_term brs_term_id="1273" brs_term_type="9">subordinate legislation</brs_term> and <brs_term brs_term_id="1274" brs_term_type="9">customary law</brs_term> shall be maintained, except for any that contravene this law, and subject to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong SpecialAdministrative Region.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="431"><p>He argues that Ordinances, and in particular section 4(1)(a), are to be interpreted in accordance with <brs_term brs_term_id="1279" brs_term_type="9">common law</brs_term>, a proposition with which I entirely agree, and that the interpretation of section 4(1)(a) has been laid down by the <brs_term brs_term_id="1277" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> and continues to be the law of Hong Kong.

As I have alreadysaid, we are not concerned with whether or not any relevant duty was owed by Tsien Wui and Palmer &amp; Turner to the Bank. Secondly,we are not directly concerned therefore with cases such as whether or not a council inspector, and thereby the council, owed a dutyto the plaintiff. Thirdly, we are not concerned with cases of subsequent purchasers. The sole question with which we are concernedis the date at which any relevant damage occurred. That, however, means that we must first decide what damage is relevant.

Stevenson</strong>, from which the modern law of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1293" brs_term_type="9">tort of negligence</brs_term> has been developed, are well known. If the principles laid down are to apply only to those facts or facts of that kind they wouldapply only to cases of (1) manufacture of consumable goods containing a latent defect (2) sold to a direct purchaser or coming intouse by a person to whom a <brs_term brs_term_id="1295" brs_term_type="9">duty of care</brs_term> by the manufacturer exists (3) who has not had an opportunity of examining the goods and (4) who has suffered physical damage fromconsuming them, in other words where the defective goods cause physical damage to someone or something other than itself. The principle,however, has not been confined to such circumstances in later cases. In some of the later cases it is not clear whether or not thedecisions resulted from the application of these principles. More than three decades later came the <brs_term brs_term_id="1936" brs_term_type="9">decision</brs_term> in <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong>, from which the modern law of negligence causing pure economic <brs_term brs_term_id="371" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> has developed. It was a case of <brs_term brs_term_id="1292" brs_term_type="9">negligent misrepresentation</brs_term> given under a <brs_term brs_term_id="1294" brs_term_type="9">disclaimer</brs_term> of responsibility. There was no question of physical damage to anyone or any thing. Nor, on the facts of the case, could there havebeen any question of physical damage. At page 472 of the report counsel for the appellants is said to have argued that the correctapplication of the principles in <strong>Donoghue v. Stevenson</strong> was not limited to physical damage to a person or to other property.

At 1061 in the course of his speech, after referring to the well knownwords of Lord Atkin at page 580 of the report of <strong>Donoghue v.

LordAtkin's aphorism, if it were of universal application, would have sufficed to dispose of that case, apart from the express disclaimerof <brs_term brs_term_id="1324" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term>. But your Lordships were unanimous in <brs_term brs_term_id="1328" brs_term_type="9">holding</brs_term> that the difference in the characteristics of the conduct in the two cases prevented the propositions of law in <em>Donoghue v.

Your Lordships accordingly proceeded to analyse the previous <brs_term brs_term_id="1327" brs_term_type="9">decisions</brs_term> in which conduct complained of had been careless words, from which you induced a proposition of law about <brs_term brs_term_id="1325" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term> for damage caused by careless word; which differs from the proposition of law in <em>Donoghue v.

The house was purchased and thensold on to the plaintiff who did not have it surveyed. It was surveyed and passed, however, by the building society from whom sheobtained a mortgage. Soon after the plaintiff moved in serious defects developed in the internal structure because the foundationswere unsound. She sued the builder and the council but settled with the builder on advice that she could not succeed. At trial thejudge found that the council came within the 'neighbour' principle and was in <brs_term brs_term_id="1333" brs_term_type="9">breach</brs_term> of its duty to her. An appeal by the council was <brs_term brs_term_id="379" brs_term_type="9">dismissed</brs_term>. The Court of Appeal found that a <brs_term brs_term_id="1331" brs_term_type="9">duty of care</brs_term> existed under <strong>Dorset Yacht</strong>. It found also that <strong>Donoghue v. Stevenson</strong> applied. At page 396 Lord Denning <brs_term brs_term_id="1329" brs_term_type="9">MR</brs_term> cited the passage in the <brs_term brs_term_id="1940" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> of Diplock LJ in Bagot already set out above and held that the damage occurred when the foundations were badly constructed. At page405 Sachs LJ expressed no conclusion on the correctness of that passage but was in agreement with Lord Denning as to the date onwhich the <brs_term brs_term_id="1330" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrued. He held that <strong>Donoghue v. Stevenson</strong> applies to a defective house just as it applies to a defective article. None of the three Lords Justices adverted to the fact thatthe defects in the foundations, part of the house, had caused damage to itself. Lord Denning subsequently recanted his views in<strong>Sparham-Souter v.

The plaintiff purchased two of the homes inwhich cracks later appeared. The plaintiff issued proceedings against both the builders and the council alleging negligence in failingto ensure that the plans and foundations complied with the relevant bye-laws, in failing to inspect the property during the workand in issuing the certificates. The <brs_term brs_term_id="1335" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> in negligence in issuing the certificates was not <brs_term brs_term_id="1337" brs_term_type="9">time barred</brs_term> but otherwise it was held in the Court of Appeal that the <brs_term brs_term_id="1336" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrued not at the date of the negligent act or <brs_term brs_term_id="1338" brs_term_type="9">omission</brs_term> but at the date when damage was first sustained by the plaintiff. Recanting his <brs_term brs_term_id="1339" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> in <strong>Dutton</strong>, Lord Denning said, at page 867/868,</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="452"><p class="quote">&quot;The <brs_term brs_term_id="1342" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrues, not at the time of the negligent making or passing of the foundations, nor at the time when the latest owner bought thehouse, but at the time when the house began to sink and the cracks appeared. That was the first time that any damage was sustained.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="453"><p>Later at page 868, he said,</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="454"><p class="quote">&quot;... when building work is badly done ... the <brs_term brs_term_id="1343" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> does not accrue, and time does not begin to run, until such time as the plaintiff discovers that it has done damage, or ought, withreasonable diligence, to have discovered it.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="455"><p>I note the following points. First, the date of accrual of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1344" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> is tied to when the house began to sink and the cracks 'appeared'. That is to say, when physical damage appeared. That is to be contrastedwith the speech of Lord Fraser at page 19 in <strong>Pirelli</strong> which I set out later in this <brs_term brs_term_id="1346" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term>, where he was at pains not to use the word 'appeared'. Secondly, time does not begin to run until the <em>plaintiff</em> discovers that <em>it has done damage</em> or ought, with reasonable diligence, to have discovered it, 'it' presumably referring to the damage which has been done. On the faceof it, this relates only to the <em>plaintiff's</em> knowledge and is <brs_term brs_term_id="1345" brs_term_type="9">subject to</brs_term> some of the difficulties I have already mentioned. There seems also to have been an equation between the appearance or occurrenceof the damage and its discovery or discoverability.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="456"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p172" name="p172">172.</a> Geoffrey Lane LJ at page 880 distinguished the position in a case of personal injuries from a case of a latent defect in a building.He said,</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="457"><p class="quote">&quot;There is no proper analogy between this situation and the type of situation exemplified in <em>Cartledge v.

In those circumstances clearly damage is done tothe plaintiff and the <brs_term brs_term_id="1347" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrues from the moment of the first injury albeit undetected and undetectable.

It seems to me that there is a true analogy between theplaintiff whose body has, unknown to him, suffered injury by inhaling particles of dust, and a plaintiff whose house has unknownto him sustained injury because it was built with inadequate foundations or of unsuitable materials. Just as the owner of the housemay sell the house before the damage is discovered, and may suffer no financial <brs_term brs_term_id="381" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>, so the man with the injured body may die before <brs_term brs_term_id="1349" brs_term_type="9">pneumoconiosis</brs_term> becomes apparent, and he also may suffer no financial <brs_term brs_term_id="382" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>.

First, the decision in <strong>Anns</strong> was departed from where it held that a council would owe the relevant duty to purchasers and where it held that the <brs_term brs_term_id="1418" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> in negligence accrued when the building presented a present or imminent danger to the health and safety of owners or occupiers. <strong>Dutton</strong> was overruled. Secondly, it reaffirmed that the application of the principles in <strong>Donoghue v.

Lord Bridge at page 478/479said,</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="488"><p class="quote">&quot;Here, once the first cracks appear, the structure as a whole is seen to be defective and the nature of the defect is known.Even if, contrary to my view, the initial damage could be regarded as damage to other property caused by a latent defect, once thedefect is known the situation of the building owner is analogous to that of the car owner who discovers that the car has faulty brakes.He may have a house which, until repairs are effected, is unfit for habitation, but, subject to the reservation I have expressedwith respect to ruinous buildings at or near a boundary of the owner's property, the building no longer represents a source of dangerand as it deteriorates will only damage itself.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="489"><p>See also Lord Keith at page 462. Thirdly, the exception to which Lord Bridge referred in the passage cited above was first mentionedby him earlier at page 475. He said,</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="490"><p class="quote">&quot;... if a building stands so close to the boundary of the building owner's land that after discovery of the dangerous defectit remains a potential source of injury to persons or property on neighbouring land or on the highway, the building owner ought,in principle, to be entitled to recover in <brs_term brs_term_id="1421" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> from the negligent builder the cost of obviating the danger, whether by repair or by demolition, so far as that cost is necessarily<brs_term brs_term_id="1422" brs_term_type="9">incurred</brs_term> in order to protect himself from potential <brs_term brs_term_id="1420" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term> to third parties.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="491"><p>This is founded in good common sense and comes within the principles of <strong>Donoghue v.

Such a building would present a danger of damage to persons or to property other than itselfand it would be absurd if the law were to hold that an owner must be forced to wait until such damage occurs before he can seek redress.Finally, and I think most importantly, the damage sued upon was recognised to be pure economic damage. Lord Keith at page 466 alsoheld that the damage in <strong>Anns</strong>, <strong>Junior Books</strong> and <strong>Pirelli</strong> was also pure economic damage within <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong>.

Secondly, in these circumstances physical damage is not necessary to the accrual of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1424" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term>. As it was put by Lord Roskill in <strong>Junior Books</strong> at page 546, the plaintiff had suffered 'damage to the pocket'.

If one asks, 'what were the <brs_term brs_term_id="1428" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> to be awarded <em>for</em>?' Clearly they were not to be awarded for injury to the health or person of the plaintiffs for they had suffered none. But equallyclearly, although the '<brs_term brs_term_id="1429" brs_term_type="9">damage</brs_term>' was described, both in the Court of Appeal in <em>Dutton</em> and in this House in <em>Anns</em>, as physical or material damage, this simply does not withstand analysis. To begin with, it makes no sort of sense to accord a remedywhere the defective nature of the structure has manifested itself by some physical symptom, such as a crack or fractured pipe, butto deny it where the defect has been brought to light by, for instance, a structural survey in connection with a proposed sale. Moreover,the imminent danger to health or safety which was said to be the essential ground for the action was not the result of the physicalmanifestations which had appeared but of the inherently defective nature of the structure which they revealed. They were merely theoutward signs of a deterioration resulting from the inherently defective condition with which the building had been brought intobeing from its inception and cannot properly be described as damage cause to the building in any accepted use of the word 'damage'.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="498"><p>Then in <strong>Henderson v.

The compensation for duty breached and the <brs_term brs_term_id="86" brs_term_type="2">quantum of damages</brs_term> would have been exactly the same.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="504"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p181" name="p181">181.</a> It is impossible to reconcile the conflicting dicta and <brs_term brs_term_id="1453" brs_term_type="9">ratio decidendis</brs_term> of these <brs_term brs_term_id="1945" brs_term_type="9">decision</brs_term>s and, as I have said at the beginning of my brief analysis of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1946" brs_term_type="9">authorities</brs_term>, we must return to first principles. Immediately that is done, logic and basic principles would dictate that the present case, likemany of the others cited, is a case of economic <brs_term brs_term_id="407" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> and that we should not necessarily be concerned with physical damage. That <brs_term brs_term_id="1837" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term>, however, leads to practical difficulties. So, in many cases such as <strong>Nykredit Mortgage Bank PLC v. Edward Erdman Group Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20WLR%201627" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 WLR 1627</a> <brs_term brs_term_id="408" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> may never occur. There the defendants over-valued property on the basis of which the plaintiff advanced for more than they wouldhave done if they had known the true value. In the event the borrowers defaulted at once. No question of <brs_term brs_term_id="1457" brs_term_type="9">limitation</brs_term> arose. The measure of <brs_term brs_term_id="1449" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> awarded was the difference between the incorrect value ascribed to the property by the <brs_term brs_term_id="1454" brs_term_type="9">valuers</brs_term> and the true value as at the date of the valuation. The question was the date from which the defendants were to pay interest. Itwas held that that date was the date when the plaintiff sustained its full allowable <brs_term brs_term_id="409" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>. The case demonstrates the difficulties which may arise in legal theory when despite the necessary duty existing and a negligent<brs_term brs_term_id="1452" brs_term_type="9">misrepresentation</brs_term> being made it cannot be said that a <brs_term brs_term_id="410" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> must arise. If the borrower never defaults no <brs_term brs_term_id="1456" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> will ever be caused. The passage from the <brs_term brs_term_id="1838" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> of Bingham LJ in <strong>D.W. Moore</strong> set out above is logical but to my mind it poses insuperable difficulties. In that case the solicitors were sued and were found liablefor negligently drafting a restraint of trade clause in a contract between the plaintiff and a director. The clause was <brs_term brs_term_id="1448" brs_term_type="9">unenforceable</brs_term> at law and the solicitors were found to be liable as from the date of the execution of the contract. It is difficult enough in theordinary <brs_term brs_term_id="1947" brs_term_type="9">running-down case</brs_term> to calculate the <brs_term brs_term_id="1835" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> suffered by the plaintiff. Factors such as the vicissitudes of life, <brs_term brs_term_id="412" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> of income and the chances of improvement or deterioration of the plaintiff's condition together with the level of expenditure fortreatment and special equipment must be taken into account. At least, in these cases, projections may be assisted by expert medicaland actuarial evidence. My mind revolts, however, at the prospect of a court in circumstances of <strong>D.W. Moore</strong> having to come to an assessment of <brs_term brs_term_id="1836" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term>. The director may never have left the plaintiff and, if he did, may never have acted in contravention of the clauses. Even if hedid, it appears to me to be quite impossible for the court to estimate fairly how much that would have damaged the plaintiff or,for instance, for how long the plaintiff may have continued in business.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="505"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p182" name="p182">182.</a> The <brs_term brs_term_id="1841" brs_term_type="9">decision</brs_term> in <strong>D.W. Moore</strong> throws up another practical difficulty. If the plaintiff had sued shortly after the execution of the contract the court may, havingregard to the difficulties of assessment, have awarded a relatively minor sum. Thereafter, if and when the director had left thecompany and acted in contravention of the clause and the evidence showed substantial damage to the company, the company would bemet by the <brs_term brs_term_id="1463" brs_term_type="9">defence</brs_term> that the <brs_term brs_term_id="1459" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> had merged into the <brs_term brs_term_id="1948" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> and that there was no new <brs_term brs_term_id="1461" brs_term_type="9">breach</brs_term>, as to which see <strong>The Darley Main Colliery Company v. Mitchell</strong>. On the other hand a generous decision by the court might well be unfair to the defendant. These difficulties are emphasised in casesof latent defects by the words of Lord Salmon in Anns already set out earlier.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="506"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p183" name="p183">183.</a> In <strong>D.W. Moore</strong> and in other like cases there may be a respectable argument that payment of fees for bad advice or plans represents economic damagebecause, however else it is put, the plaintiff has not received that for which he has bargained and for which he has paid. In myview, as I have already said, that would perhaps be going too far. There may be no further resultant damage and the sort of claimto which I have just referred seems to me to be properly the <brs_term brs_term_id="1949" brs_term_type="9">province</brs_term> of the law of contract rather than the law of <brs_term brs_term_id="1843" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term>. Any review of cases dealing with claims for pure economic <brs_term brs_term_id="414" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> shows the concern of the courts to impose reasonable limits upon the principles in a field where the potential ambit of these principlesis exceptionally wide. It is permissible and right, in my view, that we should be very slow to extend these principles to the matterof fees as representing a <brs_term brs_term_id="415" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> in the law of <brs_term brs_term_id="1465" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="507"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p184" name="p184">184.</a> The one undoubted principle is that for a <brs_term brs_term_id="1845" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> to accrue the <brs_term brs_term_id="1469" brs_term_type="9">tortious act</brs_term> must have caused harm for which the Court can properly <brs_term brs_term_id="1467" brs_term_type="9">award damages</brs_term>. The harm may be physical or economic or both. The task of the court thereafter is to ascertain when the real harm occurred. Sometimesthe evidence may be such that a reasonably precise date can be found. At other times the evidence may only allow the court to cometo a conclusion as to the earliest or the latest time at which it occurred and so be able to decide whether or not the action hasbeen brought within time. At one time I was greatly attracted to the view that the damage to the Bank occurred when it first reliedupon the plans at least by the date of the first stage payment along the same line of reasoning which found favour in <strong>Hiron v. Pynford South Ltd</strong>. On further consideration, although the decision in that case may well have been right on the evidence, I do not think it can beright on the evidence in the present appeal. I gratefully adopt the analysis of the evidence set out by Litton PJ. On that evidenceit is not possible, in my view, to say that at the first stage payment the Bank must have suffered a <brs_term brs_term_id="416" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="508"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p185" name="p185">185.</a> Like Lord Salmon in <strong>Anns</strong> I am unwilling to exclude the possibility of proof, in an appropriate case, that damage either economic or physical whether undiscoveredor undiscoverable has in fact occurred. In some cases it may well be that the evidence is such that damage can only be proved bythe occurrence of physical damage in which case the court will be bound to <brs_term brs_term_id="417" brs_term_type="9">find</brs_term> that the physical or economic <brs_term brs_term_id="418" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> has occurred at the same time. I would note that so far as the reports in both the Court of Appeal and in the <brs_term brs_term_id="1473" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> this appears to have been the factual position in <strong>Pirelli</strong>. In neither report is there any mention of other undiscovered or undiscoverable damage which may have taken place before the cracksoccurred. It seems to me that if there had been such evidence the date of the accrual of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1846" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> would have pre-dated the occurrence of the cracks but in the circumstances that was irrelevant since any later date of the occurrenceof the cracks would have put the accrual of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1471" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> beyond the permitted period of <brs_term brs_term_id="1476" brs_term_type="9">limitation</brs_term>. I would also note here that the decision in <strong>Pirelli</strong> does not provide that the damage necessary for the accrual of a <brs_term brs_term_id="1472" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> occurs only when the physical damage has become manifest. In this respect I must differ, although with the greatest of diffidence,from the passage of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1475" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> of Lord Oliver in <strong>Murphy</strong> set out earlier. There his Lordship said that it would make no sense to accord a remedy when the defective nature of the structurehad manifested itself by some physical symptom but to deny it <brs_term brs_term_id="1477" brs_term_type="9">where</brs_term> the defect had been brought to light, for instance, by a survey. <brs_term brs_term_id="1474" brs_term_type="9">With respect</brs_term>, <strong>Pirelli</strong> does not go so far. The importance of the results of a survey is that it shows that damage exists not that it is shown. Far fromexcluding that, <strong>Pirelli</strong> proceeds upon the basis of <strong>Cartledge v. Jopling</strong> that damage exists whether or not it is discovered or discoverable.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="509"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p186" name="p186">186.</a> The decision in <strong>Pirelli</strong> has been subjected to much criticism in the later <brs_term brs_term_id="1481" brs_term_type="9">decisions</brs_term> and in academic writings. There is no doubt that the decision is not perfect but I think that in the absence of legislation it wouldbe impossible to lay down an <brs_term brs_term_id="87" brs_term_type="4">all-enveloping principle</brs_term> other than that in <brs_term brs_term_id="1480" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> the <brs_term brs_term_id="1478" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrues when relevant damage is sustained, whether the <brs_term brs_term_id="1479" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> be governed by <strong>Donoghue v. Stevenson</strong> or <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong>. For myself, I am of the view that <strong>Pirelli</strong> was in fact a case of economic <brs_term brs_term_id="420" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> but where the evidence is otherwise insufficient to ascertain the date of such a <brs_term brs_term_id="421" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> the court may, if not must, take the date of the occurrence of the physical damage as being the date of the economic <brs_term brs_term_id="422" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>. I would <brs_term brs_term_id="419" brs_term_type="9">dismiss</brs_term> this appeal on the grounds that</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="510"><p>(1) The burden of bringing itself within the <brs_term brs_term_id="1482" brs_term_type="9">limitation period</brs_term> was upon the bank and it failed to discharge that burden.</p></brs_paragraph>        <brs_paragraph id="511"><p>(2) The <brs_term brs_term_id="1483" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> was for economic <brs_term brs_term_id="423" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> but in default of clear evidence as to when that economic <brs_term brs_term_id="424" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> occurred the occurrence of physical damage may be taken as the date of the accrual of that cause.

What BEA is trying to get from the words in questionis in effect an indemnity from TW to it against <brs_term brs_term_id="439" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> suffered as a result of failure of the cladding due to TW's part to exercise reasonable skill and care <em>whenever</em> such failure occurs.

It is necessary therefore to turn to BEA's claim against TW in the<brs_term brs_term_id="1543" brs_term_type="9">tort of negligence</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="541"><p class="heading">TORTIOUS <brs_term brs_term_id="1544" brs_term_type="9">LIABILITY</brs_term> ON TW's PART?</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="542"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p205" name="p205">205.</a> The second basis on which BEA claims against TW is, as I have said, tortious <brs_term brs_term_id="1545" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="543"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p206" name="p206">206.</a> As to this, TW contends as follows. Its <brs_term brs_term_id="1547" brs_term_type="9">duty of care</brs_term> in regard to the fixing system was limited to using reasonable skill and care in the selection of an independent consultant/designer.It discharged this duty when it selected Mr Ragaglini.

The relationship between BEA and TW was a special one under which TW owed BEA a non-delegableduty of skill and care. Thus Mr Ragaglini is to be taken as having acted vis-a-vis BEA as TW's agent for the purpose of dischargingTW's duty, and his failure is TW's failure. Moreover, the work was of an inherently dangerous nature, since it involved large granitepanels affixed to a high-rise building abutting the highway. So even if Mr Ragaglini was merely an independent contractor, publicpolicy excluded any <brs_term brs_term_id="1548" brs_term_type="9">defence</brs_term> by TW based on delegation of the work to an independent contractor.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="545"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p208" name="p208">208.</a> In my judgment, the legal position is as follows. Their contractual relationship and the obligations thereby undertaken by TW (ascladding contractor) to BEA (as building owner) created a special relationship of proximity between them. And this special relationshipof proximity gave rise to a duty in <brs_term brs_term_id="1549" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> on TW's part to exercise reasonable skill and care to avoid economic <brs_term brs_term_id="440" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> to BEA arising out of the failure of the building's cladding.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="546"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p209" name="p209">209.</a> It was open to TW to engage Mr Ragaglini ? in any capacity as between itself and Mr Ragaglini that he and it agreed ? to do workwhich was TW's obligation to do for BEA. But that did not relieve TW of its duty to BEA even though BEA were content that Mr Ragaglinibe brought in. It is one thing to say that BEA was content that Mr Ragaglini be brought in. It is another thing altogether ? andgroundless ? to suggest that BEA is to be taken as having been content not to have TW to look to if things went wrong.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="547"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p210" name="p210">210.</a> The judge started off correctly in <brs_term brs_term_id="441" brs_term_type="9">finding</brs_term> that TW was &quot;responsible for the design of the system for the fixing, including making allowance for movement&quot;.

Had it been raised at the trial, the course of the evidence may well have been different.On the evidence which was adduced, the judge's <brs_term brs_term_id="483" brs_term_type="9">findings</brs_term> of fact as to knowledge point to the defects being latent.

In any event, the arguments advanced on behalf of the respondent are flawed for this reason. There is a world of differencebetween, on the one hand, seeing what the width of a gap is and, on the other hand, realising that such width is insufficient.

In cases of latent building defects, the building owner's <brs_term brs_term_id="1649" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrues when the latent defects become patent. This is when they become so obvious that any reasonable building owner would callin an expert. What would be obvious to a reasonable building owner would be likewise obvious to any reasonable potential purchaser,or his expert. Accordingly the time when the defects become patent in the sense explained above is the point in time when the buildingis depreciated by the defects. And that must therefore be the point in time when the economic <brs_term brs_term_id="1652" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> occurs and the <brs_term brs_term_id="1650" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> accrues. If it is reasonable to effect repairs to the building, the cost of such repairs will represent the measure of the buildingowner's economic <brs_term brs_term_id="1653" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> flowing from the defects. If, on the other hand, it is not reasonable to effect such repairs, then the depreciation in the marketvalue of the building brought about by the defects will represent the measure of such economic <brs_term brs_term_id="509" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="630"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p238" name="p238">238.</a> I do not see how that can be confined to New Zealand.

Rather it is a question of recognizing that the economic loss in building defects cases occurs when the market value ofthe building is diminished upon the defects ceasing to be latent and becoming known to the market as represented by reasonable peoplein the marketplace. That is when the building will, absent reasonable repairs, be depreciated: as an asset and also in terms of thepotential proceeds of a possible sale. I think that one has to look at the matter along such lines if the term &quot;economic loss&quot;is to have substance and real meaning. Otherwise it would be difficult to see how the term gets beyond being a mere label. Put in<strong>Nykredit</strong> terms, I would say that the depreciation marks the onset of &quot;measurable&quot; loss and when the building owner becomes &quot;financiallyworse off&quot;.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="632"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p240" name="p240">240.</a> <strong>Invercargill</strong> does not say in what circumstances it would be unreasonable to effect repairs. Such circumstances would, as I see it, include thosein which the depreciation in the market value can be seen to be less than the cost of repairs. That would eliminate the objectionagainst the plaintiff recovering <brs_term brs_term_id="1663" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> in excess of depreciation when his <brs_term brs_term_id="517" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> is economic <brs_term brs_term_id="518" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> represented by depreciation. There may well be cases where the <brs_term brs_term_id="1664" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> will be represented by the cost of repairs plus something extra if the repairs do not wholly eliminate the depreciation. That wouldbe the position where it can be shown that the price which <brs_term brs_term_id="516" brs_term_type="9">potential buyers</brs_term> are prepared to pay is diminished by reason of the building's unfortunate history of having had to be extensively repaired.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="633"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p241" name="p241">241.</a> I should mention that counsel adverted to, but did not address us on, the decision of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1666" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> in <strong>Ruxley Electronics &amp; Construction Ltd v.

It is true that that notion has nevertheless go intothe common law as something which can sometimes happen. And it is likewise true that this is recognized in statute law in the courseof providing some relief against the notion's rigours. But, as one sees from <strong>Nykredit</strong> for example, it is not always the case that measurable <brs_term brs_term_id="521" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> occurs as soon as the wrong is done.

Doing so, I might add, does not involve disagreeing with the <brs_term brs_term_id="1671" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> or presuming to predict how their Lordships may decide future cases. It is true that in <strong>Pirelli</strong> the <brs_term brs_term_id="1672" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> treated building defects cases as cases of physical damage, while in <strong>Invercargill</strong> the <brs_term brs_term_id="1675" brs_term_type="9">Privy Council</brs_term> treated them as cases of economic <brs_term brs_term_id="522" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>.

And, TW says, the Legislative Council must have amended the <brs_term brs_term_id="1678" brs_term_type="9"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a></brs_term> by the addition of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31</a> (based on that Act) on the same assumption. All of this is, I think, true as far as it goes. TW then continues by inviting the Courtto consider whether this legislative assumption precludes development of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1680" brs_term_type="9">common law</brs_term> at variance with such assumption. In my view, it does not. I will, in a moment, come to the principle on which I proceed. Beforethat I would just observe that developing the law at variance with the assumption that the <strong>Pirelli</strong> decision is sound is something which the <brs_term brs_term_id="1679" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> itself has already done. Although this was done in a context other than <brs_term brs_term_id="1681" brs_term_type="9">limitation</brs_term>, it was nevertheless done in a fundamental respect. I refer of course to <strong>Murphy</strong> itself where, as we have seen, their Lordships categorized building defects cases as cases of economic <brs_term brs_term_id="524" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> even though <strong>Pirelli</strong> proceeded on the basis that they were cases of physical damage.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="641"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p247" name="p247">247.</a> Turning to principle, I say at once that I reject the notion that just because legislation is passed to provide relief, or some measureof relief, against an injustice created by a judicial decision, the legislature is to be taken to have set that decision in stoneso that the courts are forever debarred from revisiting it. My rejection of such a notion is, as I see it, fully supported by thedecision of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1682" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> in <strong>Birmingham Corporation v.

The former might in any event be more appropriate given that<brs_term brs_term_id="1705" brs_term_type="9">limitation</brs_term> was introduced by legislation in the first place, and moreover, that the present legislation resulted from amendments specificallymade to provide for <brs_term brs_term_id="1975" brs_term_type="9">latent damage</brs_term>. Be all of that as it may, I agree that the <strong>Pirelli</strong> <brs_term brs_term_id="1974" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term>, as explained by Ching PJ, seems not only the most appropriate, but also to best accord with the <brs_term brs_term_id="1976" brs_term_type="9">authorities</brs_term> in general.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="667"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p265" name="p265">265.</a> Likewise, I would adopt the thorough analysis made by Litton PJ of the evidence and his conclusions as to when the physical damagefirst occurred.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="668"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p266" name="p266">266.</a> Accordingly, I would also <brs_term brs_term_id="534" brs_term_type="9">dismiss</brs_term> the Bank's appeal against both the defendant architects and the cladding subcontractors.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="669"><p> </p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="670"><p>Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead NPJ:</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="671"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p267" name="p267">267.</a> I agree with the <brs_term brs_term_id="535" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> of Mr Justice Bokhary PJ. I add some observations only on the question of <brs_term brs_term_id="1707" brs_term_type="9">limitation</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="672"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p268" name="p268">268.</a> The plaintiff bank's <brs_term brs_term_id="1708" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> in negligence against the architects and the specialist cladding subcontractors did not accrue until the bank suffered relevant damage.Then, and only then, did time start to run against the bank. This is axiomatic.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="673"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p269" name="p269">269.</a> On this appeal it was common ground between the parties, in my view rightly so, that the relevant damage was financial (or economic)<brs_term brs_term_id="536" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> sustained by the bank, not physical damage to the building. In a given case, depending on the facts, the presence of physical damageto a building may march hand-in-hand with the building owner suffering financial <brs_term brs_term_id="537" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> by having to put his hand into his pocket. But this is by no means always so. Physical damage to the building and financial <brs_term brs_term_id="1711" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> to the owner are not necessarily linked. A defect may exist, and a building owner may suffer financial <brs_term brs_term_id="539" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>, before any physical damage has occurred. To make the accrual of a <brs_term brs_term_id="1709" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term>, and the running of time, dependent on the presence or absence of physical damage to a building would be to ignore the realitiesof defectively designed or defectively constructed building works. This is spelled out lucidly by I N Duncan Wallace QC in his articlein  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20105%20Law%20Quarterly%20Review%2046" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 105 LQR 46</a>, 57-59. Hence the sounder test in law, which has now gained general acceptance, is that what matters is when the building owner firstsuffered financial <brs_term brs_term_id="540" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> or detriment: see the decision of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1710" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> in <strong>Murphy v. Brentwood District Council</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 AC 398.</a></p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="674"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p270" name="p270">270.</a> As to when that date occurred in the present case, there are two competing alternatives. One possibility, for which the defendantscontended, is the date when the bank accepted and paid for its new headquarters building. At that date the bank acquired a buildingwhich was substandard because of an inherent defect in its design. Unbeknown to the bank, the building was intrinsically less valuablethan it should have been. When the defect came to light, a substantial amount of money would have to be spent on making good thedefect.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="675"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p271" name="p271">271.</a> The alternative possibility, for which the bank contended, focuses more closely on the value of the building. The market value ofa defective building remains undiminished until the defect is discovered or could be expected to come to light from inspections aprudent building owner or purchaser would make. Until then the building owner used the building as intended and suffered no untowardfinancial effects from the existence of the defect. Thus, according to this alternative, a building owner suffers no financial <brs_term brs_term_id="541" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> until the defect comes to light or in the ordinary course would have done so. In short, the crucial factual feature is the date whenthe existence of the defect became known or patent. Until then, and herein lies the reconciliation of this <brs_term brs_term_id="1872" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term> with <brs_term brs_term_id="1977" brs_term_type="9">orthodox doctrine</brs_term>, the would-be plaintiff sustained no damage and, hence, time did not begin to run against him.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="676"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p272" name="p272">272.</a> Despite powerful arguments to the contrary, the preponderance of high <brs_term brs_term_id="542" brs_term_type="9">authority</brs_term> now supports the view that, as regards latent defects in buildings, the second possibility is to be preferred. This <brs_term brs_term_id="1873" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term> has been adopted in Australia, in the decision of the High Court in The Council of the <strong>Shire of Sutherland v. Heyman</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%2d1985%29%20157%20CLR%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984-1985) 157 CLR 424</a>, 505, per Deane J. This is also the <brs_term brs_term_id="1874" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term> preferred by the courts in New Zealand, culminating in the decision of the Judicial Committee of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1714" brs_term_type="9">Privy Council</brs_term>, comprising Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Mustill, Lord Lloyd of Berwick and Sir Michael Hardie Boys, in <strong>Invercargill City Council v. Hamlin</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20624" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 624.</a> There has been no decision on this point by the <brs_term brs_term_id="1713" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term>, but in <strong>Murphy v. Brentwood District Council</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 AC 398</a>, 467, Lord Keith accepted Deane J's reasoning as <brs_term brs_term_id="1712" brs_term_type="9">incontrovertible</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="677"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p273" name="p273">273.</a> It is, of course, the fact that the <brs_term brs_term_id="1716" brs_term_type="9">limitation</brs_term> legislation applicable to latent defects in buildings is not the same in each of these countries. Further, the new regarding thecircumstances in which a <brs_term brs_term_id="1715" brs_term_type="9">duty of care</brs_term> arises is not the same. But these differences are irrelevant to the point now being considered. The reasoning underlying this preferred<brs_term brs_term_id="1875" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term> owes nothing to these considerations.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="678"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p274" name="p274">274.</a> I recognise that this <brs_term brs_term_id="1876" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term> gives the concept of financial detriment, in this context, a narrower rather than a broader meaning. This <brs_term brs_term_id="1877" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term> involves the concept that payment for services in connection with the construction of a building with an undiscovered latent defectis not in <em>itself</em> financial <brs_term brs_term_id="543" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> or detriment. This is so, even when the defect is such that at some future date expensive repairs will probably become necessary,with a consequential diminution in the market value of the building when this is realised. This concept may not be easy to reconcilewith some of the authorities concerning defective documents.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="679"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p275" name="p275">275.</a> I also recognise that this <brs_term brs_term_id="1878" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term> does not fit happily with the scheme underlying <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 31</a> of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1718" brs_term_type="9"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a></brs_term>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap. 347</a>, and the corresponding provisions in the <brs_term brs_term_id="1717" brs_term_type="9">Latent Damage</brs_term> Act 1986.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="680"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p276" name="p276">276.</a> Despite these considerations, I am not persuaded it would be right for this court to depart from the authoritative <brs_term brs_term_id="1879" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term> already adopted elsewhere on this highly debatable point. In particular, the <brs_term brs_term_id="1720" brs_term_type="9">Latent Damage</brs_term> Act 1986 and the <brs_term brs_term_id="1721" brs_term_type="9"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a></brs_term>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap. 347</a>, did not define when a <brs_term brs_term_id="1722" brs_term_type="9">cause of action</brs_term> for negligence accrues. That remained, as before, a matter to be determined by the application of principles of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1723" brs_term_type="9">common law</brs_term>. The Act, and subsequently the Ordinance, were enacted on the basis of the <brs_term brs_term_id="1724" brs_term_type="9">common law</brs_term> as <brs_term brs_term_id="1726" brs_term_type="9">enunciated</brs_term> in <strong>Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd v.

As already noted, that analysis of the relevant damage is no longer regarded as satisfactory.
