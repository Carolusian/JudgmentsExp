class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  This is a personal injuries action arising out of a fatal accident in a construction site belonging to the 1<sup>st</sup> Third Party, Hong Kong Baptist University (âBaptist Universityâ) on 15 December 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Baptist University was constructing two 21-storey student hostel buildings (âthe hostelâ) in 2001.  It retained Ronald Lu &amp;Partners (HK) Ltd as its architect and leading consultant in charge of the project.  It employed the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant, China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (âCCECCâ) as the principal contractor responsible for the superstructureworks of the hostel.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, Tridant Engineering Company Limited (âTridantâ) was a nominated sub-contractor of CCECC responsible for the electricalinstallation works. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, Talent Regent Engineering Limited (âTalentâ) was a sub-contractor of Tridant responsible for the electrical installationworksof Tower A of the hostel.  Talent further sub-sub-contracted the works to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, Hung Fai Electrical Engineering Limited (âHung Faiâ).</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Baptist University also directly employed its own specialist contractors for specialist works, including the 2<sup>nd</sup> Third Party, Roctec Technology Limited (âRoctecâ) which was responsible for installation of telecommunication system.  Roctecsub-contracted the computer cable laying works to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Third Party, Polycom Wiring Engineering Company Limited (âPolycomâ), which in turn sub-sub-contracted the works to the 4<sup>th</sup> Third Party, Ms Tam Yuk Ling formerly trading as Practical Engineering Co.  Mr Tam Man Tat (âthe Deceasedâ) was the de factoproprietor of Practical Engineering Co and the brother of Ms Tam Yuk Ling.  On 15 December 2001, the Deceased was electrocuted whenlaying computer cables on the 19<sup>th</sup> floor of Tower A of the hostel(âthe Premisesâ). </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Plaintiffs are the administratrices of the estate of the Deceased.  They instituted the present personal injuries action againstthe Defendants.  The Defendants then issued a third party notice against the four third parties.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  There is no dispute that the fatal accident was caused by the negligence of Hung Fai.  Hung Fai was subsequently wound up and theaction against Hung Fai was discontinued.  The action between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants was settled in the sum of $1.35 millionon the first day of the trial on 10 September 2008.  On the same day, the third party proceedings against the 4<sup>th</sup> Third Party was discontinued by consent with no order as to costs.  The present proceedings concern the2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Defendantsâ third party claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Third Parties for indemnity in respect of the Plaintiffsâ claim and costs of the action or contribution to the extent of the Plaintiffsâclaim which the Defendants were found liable.  At the hearing, Mr Clough, counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants, confirms that the Defendantsâ claim is only for contribution and the Defendants are not seeking an indemnity.</p>    <p class="heading">Dramatis personae</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The following persons were connected with the events leading to the fatal accident:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Mr Lee Yiu Pun Simon (âLeeâ), the project manager of CCECC.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) Mr Chiu Ka Wo (âChiuâ), the building services coordinator of CCECC.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) Mr Man Chi Shing (âManâ), the safety instructor of CCECC.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) Mr Sham Ho Kai (âShamâ), the senior project manager of Tridant.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5) Mr Leung Chung Yung (âLeungâ), a senior engineer of Tridant.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6) Mr Yip Pak Kau (âYipâ), a partner of Talent.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(7) Mr Tang Kwong Moon (âTangâ), a site supervisor of Talent.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(8) Mr Tam Hung Kwan (âTamâ), a partner of Hung Fai.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(9) Mr Yan Kwok Chuen (âYanâ), an employee of Hung Fai, whose negligence was the primary cause of the fatal accident.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(10) Mr Leung Kin Wing, the director of the information technology services centre of Baptist University.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(11) Mr Fung Bai Lei, Dominic (âFungâ), the estates officer of Baptist University.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(12) Mr Chan Kwok Bun (âChanâ), the business manager of Roctec.

His evidence as to the precautions which should have been taken upon discovery of the defectiveelectrical installation work is very critical of the manner in which Tridant and Talent discharged their duty of care.

I accept his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Sham and Yip gave evidence on behalf of Tridant and Talent respectively.  They were not directly involved in the fatal accident. In essence, their evidence is that they knew nothing about the critical facts relating to the fatal accident.  They were evasive. I give no weight to their evidence.  In any event, their evidence does not assist the Defendantsâ case.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Leung Kin Wing and Fung of Baptist University gave evidence about the tender procedures of Baptist University and Baptist Universityâsinvolvement in the supervision of the works contracted to CCECC and Roctec.  Their evidence is not in dispute.  I accept their evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  No evidence was given on behalf of Roctec and Polycom.</p>    <p class="heading">The fatal accident</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  On 15 December 2001, while laying computer cables in the metal trunkings suspended from the ceiling of the Premises, the Deceasedwas electrocuted when he touched the chassis of a fluorescent light panel (âthe Light Panelâ).  </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Labour Department conducted an investigation into the fatal accident and prepared a report (âthe Reportâ).  No party takesissue on the accuracy of the Report.  The following account of the accident is based on the Report, the statutory declarations ofthe various persons connected with the events leading to the fatal accident and the evidence of the witnesses called by the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The power to the light panels in the Premises was sourced from a miniature circuit breaker (âMCBâ) located inside the switchroom at the corridor in the Premises, which in turn was connected to and controlled by the mains switch on the ground floor of TowerA of the hostel.  The switch room in the Premises was kept under lock.  Only CCECC and Tridant had custody of the key.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  It is common ground that Yan who was not a licensed electrician qualified to perform electrical works without supervision was employedby Hung Fai to install light panels in the Premises and Yan had inadvertently connected the live wire instead of the earth wire tothe chassis of the Light Panel.  Thus, the chassis of the Light Panel would become energized when the light panels in the Premiseswere switched on.  According to Yan, a worker of Hung Fai, Mr Ng King Hung (âNgâ) had arrived in the Premises to identify thelocation where the light panels were to be connected, butNg did not instruct Yan to carry a torch or to stop working if lightingwas insufficient.  When Yan was installing the light panels, he was working under natural light via the door openings of the roomsalong the corridor in the Premises.  The lighting condition was insufficient and no temporary lighting was provided.  Hence, he couldnot distinguish the colour of the live, neutral and earth wires, which accounted for the fatal mistake.  Yan did not complain toNg about the inadequate lighting condition or request for temporary lighting or a torch. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  It is a commonly held opinion among the Defendants that it is a trade practice that if the lighting is inadequate for a worker tocarry out his work, he shall stop working and ask the principal contractor via his supervisor to provide temporary lighting.  Butthis is a reactive process which relied on the safety awareness of the worker as well.  On the other hand, Yan did not know who wasresponsible for the provision of temporary lighting or the communication channel to request for such lighting on the site. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  It is also common ground that Yan had not received any safety training and safety instruction regarding proper installation of thelight panels.  There is no dispute that Yan was not qualified to perform the work without supervision, had not been properly supervisedwhile installing the light panels in the Premises and his work had not been checked by a licensed electrician.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  On the night before the fatal accident, Man, Tang and Tam went to the Premises.  Tam switched the light panels in the Premises forcommissioning purpose.  At the time, Tang noticed that the Light Panel in question was not lit up though the others were.  No insulationtest or other electrical tests of the electrical circuit of the light panels had been carried out previously.  Tam thought Tang wouldswitch off the MCB in the switch room before they left the Premises, but Tang himself could not recall whether he had done so.  Then,later that night, Leung switched off the mains switch on the ground floor at 9:30 pm 14 December 2001, believing that the mains switchof the MCB in the switch room in the Premises had been switched off.  The inference to be drawn from the fatal accident on the followingmorning is that Tang had not switched off the MCB before he left the Premises. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Although Man and Tang knew that the Light Panel was not lit up on 14 December 2001, they did not take any immediate remedial actionthat night or on the following day prior to the fatal accident.  They also did not inform CCECC or put up any warning signs to warnother workers that the Light Panel was faulty and repair was necessary. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The defect in the Light Panel might appear innocuous, but it was a hazardous condition as the chassis would become live when theLight Panel was switched on.  According to Lee, Tridant had the responsibility to report to CCECC any defective light panel and atleast to put up warning signs to warn other workers of the defect, but that was not done.  As a result, nobody other than Man, Tangand Tam had knowledge of the defective Light Panel which could become an electrical hazard to other workers on the site.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On the morning of 15 December 2001, Leung switched on the mains switch on the ground floor thereby energized all the light panelsincluding the defective Light Panel in the Premises prior to the accident.  As he was making a general inspection in the Premises,Leung noticed a worker cutting computer cables at the corridor in the Premises and that some light panels there were not lit.  He,too, took no immediate remedial action or warn the worker not to contact the Light Panel.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Shortly before the accident, the Deceased and his co-worker were laying computer cables in the Premises.  His co-worker noticedthat the light panels in the Premises were lit, though he was not sure if the Light Panel in question was.  The co-worker was cuttingcomputer cables while the Deceased was standing on a wooden ladder removing the side cover of a metal trunking for laying computercables.  Suddenly, he heard a scream from the Deceased.  He saw the Deceasedâs left arm was in contact with the Light Panel andhis right arm was on the metal trunking while his feet were off the ladder.  Thus, the Deceased body completed the electrical circuitbetween the chassis of the energized Light Panel and the metal trunking and was electrocuted.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  On 13 November 2002, Tridant pleaded guilty to and was convicted of an offence of failing to ensure that the Light Panel was constructed,installed, protected or maintained so as to prevent electrical hazard, contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59W/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulations 5(1)</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59W/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">31</a>(1) and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59W/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">31</a>(2) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59W" class="autolink_findacts">Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Electricity) Regulations</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59W">Cap 59W</a> of the Laws of Hong Kong.</p>    <p class="heading">The cause of the accident</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  While the Defendants are unanimous that Hung Fai was primarily negligent for engaging an unqualified worker to install the lightpanels, they make allegations of negligence against one another within their camp.  CCECC blamed Tridant and Talent for not informingCCECC of the defective Light Panel, failing to rectify the defective Light Panel immediately or to put up appropriate warning signsat or near the Light Panel while Talent and Tridant blamed CCECC for permitting Roctec and Polycom to work in the Premises and fornot informing them that workers from Roctec would be laying computer cables near the Light Panel.  Mr Sakhrani, counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Third Party, made a lengthy submission on the breach of duties of the respective Defendants.  Essentially, I agree with his submission. But I do not find it necessary to deal with his submission as the liability of the Defendants as a camp is not in dispute.  Furthermore,as the third party proceedings is concerned with contribution from the Third Parties, the extent of the individual Defendantâsliability within their own camp is not in issue.  What is in issue is the extent to which the accident was caused by the acts oromissions of the Third Parties and an assessment of their blameworthiness in the fatal accident.  I shall set out below as part ofthe background and for completeness the cause of the fatal accident so far as it was attributable to the Defendants.  I shall dealwith the allegation of the acts or omissions of the Third Parties which contributed to the fatal accident and their blameworthinessseparately.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  There is no doubt that the immediate cause of the fatal accident was the hazardous condition of the Light Panel caused by the mis-connectionof wires by Yan.  Hung Fai was clearly negligent in engaging an unqualified worker without sufficient training to install the lightpanels.  It was also negligent in not providing Yan with adequate lighting to enable him to perform the work properly and in notproperly instructing him to obtain temporary lighting from CCECC or to stop working if the lighting condition was inadequate.  Itwas negligent in not supervising Yan or having his work checked by a licensed electrician.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Talent was negligent in allowing Hung Fai to engage an unqualified worker to install the light panels without supervision and withouthaving the works checked by a qualified electrician or was otherwise negligent in supervision.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Upon realising the defect in the Light Panel on the night before the accident, Hung Fai failed to immediately rectify the defect,or put up appropriate warning signs at or near the Light Panel to warn other workers of the defect and possible latent hazard.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Tridant and Talent which had knowledge of such defect through their employees failed to cause the defect to be rectified immediatelyor to have appropriate warning signs put up, especially when they were aware that other workers were working in the Premises.

Secondly, they allege that BaptistUniversity, having assumed the role of co-ordinator and project manager, failed to exercise reasonable care in supervising the executionof the works through its appointed consultants and to check that its procedures were adhered to.  Furthermore, although CCECC wasthe principal contractor, it had no control over the specialist sub-contractors employed directly by Baptist University and theirhierarchy of sub-contractors, including Roctec and Polycom. </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Baptist Universityâs defence are that it was not an occupier of the Premises, that the works at the construction site had beencontracted to an independent contractor, that it took no part in the management or control of the site, including the Premises, andthat all it did was only to monitor the progress of the works at regular site meetings.  In essence, it says that it had taken reasonablesteps to ensure that the works being carried out on the site were carried out in a competent manner and that it had contracted allof the works to qualified and responsible independent contractors, namely CCECC and Roctec.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The Third Party proceedings between the Defendants and Roctec and Polycom</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The Defendantsâ case against Roctec and that against Polycom are the same and can be conveniently dealt with together.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The Defendantsâ case against Roctec is that Roctec was also an occupier of the Premises and failed to take any or any adequatecare for the safety of the Deceased; exposing him to risk of injury and failing to discharge its non-delegable duty of care and/orcommon duty of care and to ensure that the Deceased was safe in performing his duty in the Premises.

This common duty of care is a duty to take suchcare as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premisesfor the purpose for which he is permitted to be there.  This duty is not an absolute duty and the standard of care depends on allthe circumstances of the case, including, where the visitor is injured by the negligence of an independent contractor employed bythe occupier, the nature of the work entrusted to the independent contractor and the terms of the contract: see <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a>.  At common law, in general, a person is not liable for the tort committed by his independent contractor.  The position is the sameunder the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p class="heading">Who is an occupier</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The word âoccupierâ is not defined under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a>.  However, it was judicially defined by Lord Denning in <i>Wheat and E Lacon &amp; Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%20AC%20552" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] AC 552.</a>  Essentially, an occupier is a person who has a sufficient degree of control over the premises as to put him under a duty of caretowards those who came lawfully onto the premises.  The test is one of control.  There is no need for an occupier to have exclusiveoccupation and two or more persons may be occupiers of the same premises at the same time.  In the case of a construction site, anowner who employs an independent contractor to execute works on the construction site is usually still regarded as having sufficientcontrol of the site as to put him under a duty towards all those who might lawfully be on the site.  Lord Denning held at 577 to578:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn the Occupiersâ Liability Act, 1957, the word âoccupierâ is used in the same sense as it was used in the common law caseson occupiersâ liability for dangerous premises.  It was simply a convenient word to denote a person who had a sufficient degreeof control over premises to put him under a duty of care towards those who came lawfully on to the premises â¦  Translating thisgeneral principle into its particular application to dangerous premises, it becomes simply this: wherever a person has a sufficientdegree of control over premises that he ought to realise that any failure on his part to use care may result in injury to a personcoming lawfully there, then he is an âoccupierâ and the person coming lawfully there is his âvisitorâ: and the âoccupierâis under a duty to his âvisitorâ to use reasonable care.  In order to be an âoccupierâ it is not necessary for a person tohave entire control over the premises.  He need not have exclusive occupation.  Suffice it that he has some degree of control.  Hemay share the control with others.  Two or more may be âoccupiersâ.  And whenever this happens, each is under a duty to use caretowards persons coming lawfully on to the premises, dependent on his degree of control.  If each fails in his duty, each is liableto a visitor who is injured in consequence of his failure, but each may have a claim to contribution from the other.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>As for the position of an owner who employed an independent contractor to work on his premises, Lord Denning said at page 580:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFourthly, where an owner employed an independent contractor to do work on premises or a structure, the owner was usually stillregarded as sufficiently in control of the place as to be under a duty towards all those who might lawfully come there.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">An employerâs liability for tort committed by his independent contractor</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  In general, where a person is injured by the negligence of an independent contractor employed by another, whether that other personis also an occupier of the premises where the injury occurred, the employeris not liable for the torts committed by its independentcontractor or the contractorâs sub-contractors or their employees, unless the injury is attributable to the negligence or otherpersonal faults of the employer or if the circumstances are such that the law imposes a strict or absolute duty upon the employerwhich he may not discharge by delegating its performance to an independent contractor.  This strict or absolute duty is often describedas a non-delegable duty which is not just a duty to take care, but a duty to provide that care is taken, so that if care is not taken,the duty is breached.  The position at common law has been usefully summarised by the learned authors of <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>, 19<sup>th</sup> edition at paragraphs 6-52, 6-53 and 6-63:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">    6-52   â<b>Introduction</b>  If the employer has employed an independent contractor to do work on his behalf the general rule is that the employer is not responsiblefor any tort committed by the contractor in the course of the execution of the work and in this respect the employees of the contractor,whilst acting as such, stand in the same position as their employer, so that the employer of the contractor is not liable for thetorts committed by the contractorâs employees.  Of course, even though the damage complained of may have been caused by the wrongfulact or omission of an independent contractor or his employee, it may also be attributable to the negligence or other personal faultof the employer.  If, for example, he has negligently selected an incompetent contractor, or has employed an insufficient numberof men, or has himself so interfered with the manner of carrying out the work that damage results, he will himself have committeda tort for which he can be held liable.  Again if the employer has authorised or ratified the independent contractorâs tort then,on normal principles, he will be jointly liable for that tort.  So in <i>Ellis v Sheffield Gas Consumerâs Co</i>, where a gas company which had no statutory powers to take up the streets for the purpose of laying their gas-pipes employed a contractorto take up the surface of the streets and lay their pipes for them, and where the contractorâs employees, having laid their pipes,insufficiently reinstated the surface thus causing damage, the gas company was held liable.  As Erle J. stated: âThe cause of theaccident was the very thing done in pursuance of the specific directions of the defendants contained in their contract.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">6-53   <b>Exceptions to the general rule: non-delegable duties</b>  To the general rule that an employer is not liable for the negligence of an independent contractor there are certain apparent exceptions. It is submitted, however, that these are not true exceptions (at least in so far as the theoretical nature of the employerâs liabilityis concerned) for they are dependent upon a finding that the employer is, himself, in breach of some duty which he personally owesto the claimant.  The liability is thus not truly a vicarious liability and is to be distinguished from the vicarious liability ofan employer for his employee.  If the circumstances are such that the law imposes a strict or absolute duty upon the employer, thenhe cannot discharge his duty by delegating performance of the work in question to an independent contractor.  If, therefore, theduty is not fulfilled, the employer is liable even though the immediate cause of the damage is the contractorâs wrongful act oromission.  The contractor, by his acts, puts the employer in breach of a personal duty.  Such duties are often described as ânon-delegableâand may arise either by statute or at common law.  For present purposes, they are to be contrasted with the ordinary duty to takereasonable care which can be discharged by the employment of a contractor reasonably supposed by the employer to be competent.  Often,indeed, a non-delegable duty will be a strict duty.  At the very least, the non-delegable duty is âa duty not merely to take care,but a duty to provide that care is taken,â so that, if care is not taken, the duty is broken.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">6-63   <b>Extra-hazardous acts</b>  In many of the cases cited above emphasis was placed upon the dangerous nature of the defendantâs undertaking and in <i>Honeywill and Stein Ltd v Larkin Bros Ltd</i> Slesser L.J., delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, enunciated a general principle governing âextra-hazardous or dangerousoperationsâ.  He said:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><b> â</b>Even of these, it may be predicated that if carefully and skilfully performed, no harm will follow; as instances of such operationsmay be given those of removing support from adjoining houses, doing dangerous work on the highway, or creating fire or explosion:hence it may be said, in one sense, that such operations are not necessarily attended with risk.  But the rule of liability for independentcontractorsâ acts attaches to these operations, because they are inherently dangerous, and hence are done at the principal employerâsperil.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The facts of the case were that the claimants had procured the defendants to take photographs of the interior of a cinema.  The premiseswere damaged by fire when the defendants negligently used of magnesium flash powder.  The claimants were held to be liable to theowners of the theatre.  But they were able to recover the sum paid to the owners from the defendants.  In the light of this caseit appears that a non-delegable duty exists whenever an independent contractor is employed to perform an âextra-hazardousâ act,but difficulty arises in determining the meaning of âextra-hazardousâ.  As Slesser L.J. recognised in the passage set out above,even âextra-hazardousâ acts will not cause damage if carefully and skilfully performed.  Yet any act may cause damage if it isnot carefully and skilfully performed, and âit is clear that the ultimate employer is not responsible for the acts of an independentcontractor merely because what is to be done will involve danger to others if negligently doneâ.  Slesser L.J. himself said thatâextra-hazardousâ acts were âacts which, in their very nature, involve in the eyes of the law special danger to others; ofsuch acts the causing of fire and explosion are obvious and established instancesâ.  The principle of <i>Honeywill</i> could be framed to apply to operations involving the use of things recognised in law to be âdangerous in themselvesâ, yet theCourt of Appeal in <i>Alcock v Wraith</i> held that in a case of re-roofing a slate roof with a tile roof within a row of terraced houses, there was a special risk due tothe known difficulties of making waterproof joints between slates and tiles.  The defendants were liable (for trespass, nuisanceand negligence) for damage consequent on the re-roofing work of their independent contractor.  â¦â </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The position is the same under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a>.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3</a> of the Ordinance prescribes the extent of an occupierâs common duty of care to its visitors.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3(4)(b)</a> is particularly relevant to the facts of the present case.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3(4)</a> provides</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(4)   In determining whether the occupier of premises has discharged the common duty of care to a visitor, regard is to be hadto all the circumstances, so that (for example) â</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a)    â¦</p>            <p class="quote">(b)   where damage is caused to a visitor by a danger due to the faulty execution of any work of construction, maintenance or repairby an independent contractor employed by the occupier, the occupier is not to be treated without more as answerable for the dangerif in all the circumstances he had acted reasonably in entrusting the work to an independent contractor and had taken such steps(if any) as he reasonably ought in order to satisfy himself that the contractor was competent and that the work had been properlydone.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  I think <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(4)(b)</a> reflects the position at common law as set out in <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>.  The general rule is that the employer is not responsible for the tort committed by his independent contractor in the course ofexecution of the sub-contracted work unless the injury is attributable to the negligence or some personal fault of the employer. An employerâs failure to act reasonably in entrusting the work to the independent contractor and to take such steps (if any) ashe reasonably ought in order to satisfy himself that the contractor was competent and that the work had been properly done are clearexamples of negligence or personal fault of the employer. </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The words âwithout moreâ in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(4)(b)</a> connote the meaning that even if the employer has acted reasonably in entrusting the work to an independent contractor and had takensuch step (if any) as he reasonably ought in order to satisfy himself that the contractor was competent and that the work was properlyexecuted, he will still be answerable for the tort committed by his contractor or his contractorâs employees under some specialor more aggravating circumstances.  Those circumstances include the employerâs conduct or the circumstances in relation to thenature of the work to be executed by the independent contractor in which the law imposes a higher standard of care on the employer. For example, if in the supervision of his contractor, the employer has interfered with the contractorâs execution of work in sucha manner or to such an extent as to contribute to the hazardous condition, then by reason of his conduct the employer has taken himselfoutside the âwithout moreâ limit of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(4)(b).</a>  An example of special circumstances is where an independent contractor is employed to perform an extra-hazardous act, which as amatter of common sense and policy must be at the employerâs peril.  Under those circumstances, the employer is under a non-delegableduty which he may not delegate to his contractor without at the same time remaining vicariously liable for breach of the duty byhis contractor.  Thus, in my view, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(4)(b)</a> also reflects the position under common law. </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The burden of proving that the employer has acted reasonably or has not been negligent in entrusting the work to the independentcontractor and has taken such steps as he reasonably ought in order to satisfy himself that the contractor was competent and thatthe work was properly executed is on the employer.  Once the employer has discharged that burden, it is up to the injured personto show that the case falls outside the âwithout moreâ circumstances, such that the employer is liable for the tort committedby his contractors despite he has taken reasonable care in his employment of the contractor.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The test as to whether an occupier has discharged his duty of care in employing an independent contractor</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The test whether an occupier of premises has discharged his duty of care owed to his visitor injured by the negligence of his independentcontractor or employees of his independent contractor was considered by Hunter J, as he then was, in <i>Yeung Kam Fuk v Len Shing Construction Co Ltd &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20HKC%20160" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] HKC 160.</a>  Hunter J adopted a four-point test as suggested by the learned authors of <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>, 15<sup>th</sup> edition, para 1233, which is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Has the occupier acted reasonably in entrusting the work to an independent contractor?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) Has the occupier used reasonable care in selecting the contractor?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) Has the occupier taken reasonable steps (if any are possible) to supervise the carrying out of the work?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) Has the occupier used reasonable care to check (if possible) that the work has been properly done?</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This test must apply equally to the duty of care at common law and under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a>. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Whether the non-delegable statutory duty to provide a safe place of work imposed on the contractor responsible for a constructionsite under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s38a.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 38A(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations</a> is also owed by a sub-contractor or the employer</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  One of the basis of the Defendantsâ claim against Roctec is that Roctec was under a non-delegable statutory duty to provide asafe place of work for the employees of its sub-contractor under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s38a.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 38A(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I">Cap 59I</a>.

This duty, being a statutoryduty under reg 38A of the Regulations, was to ensure that there was, so far as was reasonably practicable, suitable and sufficientsafe access and egress on the construction site.  Regulation 38A could not be read down to mean that the duty thereunder would bedischarged if the contractor had made suggestions towards suitable and sufficient safe access and egress.  Even if the finding thatthe respondent would not have complied with a suggestion that he use a ladder were to stand, it would not destroy the causal linkbetween the appellantâs breach of statutory duty and the respondentâs accident (at 422H-I, 423G-H, 427C-D).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)  â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)  The appellant had not used due diligence and had not taken all steps as far as was reasonably practicable to ensure site safety.

He further argues that Mr Clough has confused the relationshipbetween CCECCâs line of sub-contractors and Roctecâs.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The answer to counselâs dispute is to be found in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2(2)(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations</a>.  Under that regulation, âcontractor responsible for any construction siteâ is defined as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(2)   For the purposes of these regulations â</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a)  a contractor is responsible for a construction site if he is undertaking construction work there or, where there is more thanone contractor undertaking construction work at the site, if he is the principal contractor undertaking work there;</p>            <p class="quote">(b)  a contractor is responsible for any plant referred to in these regulations if it is located at a construction site for whichhe is responsible.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  I think the definition is unequivocal.  If there is only one contractor undertaking construction work in a site, he is the contractorresponsible for the construction site.  But if, as in the present case, there is more than one contractor, then the principal contractoris the contractor responsible for the construction site.  The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations</a> impose on contractors responsible for various specific equipments or operations, such as hoists, scaffolds, prime movers, transmissionmachineries, other machineries and mechanical equipments, specific statutory duty in respect of their specific equipments or operations. As distinct from those contractors responsible for specific equipments or operations, the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations</a> impose on the contractor responsible for any construction site a different category of duties which is more appropriate for a principalcontractor with overall management responsibility of the site to perform.  Those duties include the duty to ensure safe access toand egress from place of work, safety from hazardous conditions, safety while working at height, safety in executing excavations,emergency exits, use of helmets, and responsibility for health and welfare issues etc.  To extend the meaning given to the term,âcontractor responsible for any construction siteâ to sub-contractors or head sub-contractors in respect of a specialised sub-contractas contended by Mr Clough will produce absurd results.  For example, in the instant case, if Roctec which had contracted to lay computercables were to be held to be a contractor responsible for the construction site, Roctec would be charged with, just to name a few,the duty of identifying and rectifying hazardous conditions of other persons working at height in the Premises where the computercables were laid <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s38aa.html" class="autolink_findacts">(regulation 38AA)</a>, maintaining fire-fighting appliances on that floor <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">(regulation 54)</a> and preventing other sub-contractors from engaging young persons in cleaning dangerous parts of any machinery on that floor <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">(regulation 46).</a>  Roctec as the head specialist sub-contractor in its specialised field could not have the ability and means to discharge those obligations. It could not have been the intention of the legislature to impose such obligations on a sub-contractor or even a head sub-contractor. If it is intended that a sub-contractor shall be charged with such of the duties of the principal contractor, the regulations couldhave easily made it more explicit.  With respect to Mr Clough, on a proper construction of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 2(2)(a)</a> where there is more than one contractor on the site, the principal contractor only is the contractor responsible for the constructionsite and not its sub-contractor.  Hence, the non-delegable duty to provide a safe place of work rests squarely on the shoulders ofCCECC and not on Roctec or Polycom.  It is wholly unarguable for CCECC to pass its statutory duty onto Roctec.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  It appears that that Mr Cloughâs argument is directed at Roctec only and not at Baptist University which is the employer and notthe contractor responsible for the site.  If that is his contention, I agree.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s38a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation 38A</a> imposes on a contractor responsible for any construction site the duty, among other things, to take suitable and adequate steps toensure so far as is reasonably practicable that no person gains access to any place on the site where any hazardous conditions arepresent.  This duty is not imposed on the employer.  On a fair reading of the regulation, it is obvious that the legislature couldnot have intended otherwise.</p>    <p class="heading">The THIRD PARTY PROCEEDINGS against Roctec and Polycom</p>    <p class="heading">Were Roctec and Polycom occupiers of the Premises</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  In its defence, Roctec denied it was an occupier of the Premises where the accident occurred.  However, no evidence has been calledby Roctec and Mr Sakhrani made no submission on this issue.  As set out in paragraph 40, the test whether one is an occupier is whetherhe has a sufficient degree of control over the premises as to put him under a duty of care towards those who came lawfully onto thepremises.  It is also trite law that there is no need for an occupier to have exclusive possession of the premises and that two ormore persons may be occupiers of the same premises at the same time.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Though no evidence has been called by Roctec, no evidence has been adduced by the Defendants as to Roctecâs control over the Premiseseither.  The undisputed evidence is that Roctec, Polycom and their workers were admitted to the Premises at least on 14 December2001 and carried out certain works.  They did not have exclusive possession of the Premises.  There is also a letter dated 13 December2001 issued by Lee to Roctec which referred to a telephone conversation between Chiu of CCECC and Hui of Roctec on 11 December 2001,in which it was noted that CCECC and Roctec âmutually agreed that all cable containment (complete with lid cover and FR rockwool)have been handed over to Roctec for their wiring works to proceedâ.  Though Lee had no personal knowledge of the telephone conversationbetween Chiu and Hui, he did not dispute about the handing over of the cable containment or the trunking to Roctec.  What was handedover to Roctec was the trunking, which effectively was a conduit suspended from the ceiling of the Premises, and not the entire Premises. In a construction site with different types of works going on at the same time, I cannot be satisfied that given such a minimaldegree of participation by Roctec or Polycom in the Premises, Roctec or Polycom had sufficient control over the Premises such thatthe law would impose on them the common duty of care towards all those who might lawfully be in the Premises to ensure that theyare reasonably safe in using the other parts of the Premises.  By reason of their minimal participation in the Premises, it wouldbe absurd to require Roctec or Polycom to identify and rectify all hazardous conditions in the Premises, for example, to check thatall the electrical circuits were properly wired and all electrical equipments were properly earthed.  The Defendants bear the burdenof proving Roctec or Polycom was an occupier of the Premises.  In my view, they have failed to discharge that burden of proof, evenin the absence of evidence from Roctec and Polycom.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Were Roctec and Polycom in breach of the common duty of care as occupiers of the Premises</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  The Defendants having failed to prove that Roctec was an occupier of the Premises, Roctec was not under the common duty of careto take such care as is reasonable to see that the Deceased would be reasonably safe in using the Premises for the purpose of layingthe computer cables.  But assuming that I am wrong in the above finding, the factual circumstances of the present case are such thatthis duty, if it existed, must have been discharged. </p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The occupierâs common duty of care is not an absolute one.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a> provides that the common duty of care is a duty to take such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see thatthe visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purpose for which he is permitted to be there.  The relevant factualcircumstances were as follows.  CCECC was the principal contractor.  Its project manager, Lee admitted in cross-examination thatCCECC was effectively in charge of the site and that although Roctec was an independent contractor directly employed by Baptist University,Roctec operated effectively on the site as CCECCâs sub-contractor.  CCECC was responsible for co-ordinating the works of all sub-contractorsin the various fields, including Roctec.  In addition, CCECC was also the contractor responsible for the construction site.  It wasunder a statutory duty imposed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s38a.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 38A</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations</a> to take suitable and adequate steps to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable that no person gains access to any place on thesite where any hazardous condition is present.  CCECC had exclusive control of the construction site and was the occupier of thePremises at the material time. </p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  It was under those circumstances that according to the undisputed evidence, Chiu on behalf of CCECC agreed with Hui on behalf ofRoctec that all cable containments had been handed over to Roctec for Roctec to proceed with laying the computer cables.  In thecircumstances, Roctec, as CCECCâs sub-contractor in one specialist field, was entitled to look to CCECC for ensuring that the Premiseswithin which the trunkings were located were reasonably safe for Roctec, Polycom and their employees to work in for the purpose oflaying computer cables.  Thus, even if Roctec were an occupier, its duty was only to take such care as in all the circumstances ofthe case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe.  Roctec had liaised with CCECC for the use of the Premisesand was allowed into the Premises by CCECC on 11 December 2001 after proper liaison due procedure.  In those factual circumstances,it is reasonable for Roctec to rely on the proper and due performance by CCECC and its hierarchy of sub-contractors of their dutyespecially in respect of safety matters and to assume that the Premises were reasonably safe for its workers to work in for the purposeof laying computer cables.  It would be unrealistic to require Roctec, as an occupier, to engage another team of electricians toconduct a thorough inspection of the Premises and check every possible hazardous condition, including checking the circuits of allthe electrical installations and seeing that all the electrical equipments were properly earthed before permitting the Deceased orany of their workers to work in the Premises.  That was the duty of the Defendants which they had breached.  There is no disputethat the Defendants were in breach of that duty.  In the circumstances of this case, Roctec had discharged its duty of care by obtainingclearance from CCECC for admission into the Premises after proper liaison and due procedure.  Likewise, Polycom was entitled to relyon Roctec having discharged its duty of care by properly liaising with CCECC for admission into the Premises for it to lay the computercables.</p>    <p class="heading">Was Roctec otherwise negligent </p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Mr Cloughâs main argument against Roctec is that it failed to take any or any adequate care for the safety of the Deceased, exposinghim to risk of injury and that if Roctec had in place a proper system for ensuring the safety of the work place of its employeesand those of its sub-contractors, the Deceased would not have been at the scene of the fatal accident.  On the other hand, Mr Sakhraniargues that the Defendantâs breach of duty was the sole cause of the fatal accident.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Mr Sakhrani made lengthy submission on the breach of duty by the individual Defendants.  There is no need for me to consider hissubmission as the Defendantsâ negligence has been conceded.  The purpose of the third party proceedings is not to apportion liabilityamong the Defendants but to determine if the Third Parties are liable to contribute to the damages paid by the Defendants to thePlaintiffs.  The issue is whether had it not been for the negligence of Roctec and Polycom, the accident would not have occurredand the blameworthiness of Roctec and Polycom in contributing to the fatal accident.  Thus, it is the act or omission of Roctec andPolycom which is in issue.  The Defendants bear the burden of proof.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Apart from alleging that Roctec, presumably Polycom as well, failed to take adequate care for the safety of the Deceased, exposedhim to risk of injury, breached its non-delegable duty of care and/or common duty of care to ensure that the Deceased was safe inperforming his duty, no evidence of such negligence has been adduced.  I have found that Roctec and Polycom were not under any non-delegableduty or common duty of care to the Deceased.  The remaining allegation of breach of duty is failure to take adequate care for thesafety of the Deceased and exposing him to risk of injury.  There is no allegation or evidence that Roctec and Polycom were negligentin designing the system of work or work procedure, or were negligent in supervision.  The direct cause of the fatal accident wasthe hazardous condition of the Light Panel with a mis-connection.  Thus, the allegation of breach of duty must be premised on Roctecâsor Polycomâs allowing the Deceased to work in the Premises without checking the hazardous condition of the Light Panel.  </p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Mr Clough has not gone that far as to argue that a specialist contractor, such as Roctec, which was given access to the Premisesto execute some specialised work has the duty of checking all electrical installations.  It is difficult to launch such argument. If someone is given permission by the owner or person in charge of the premises to execute work inside the premises, he is entitledassume that the premises is safe for the purpose for which he was permitted to be there.  He is entitled to assume that he wouldbe warned of latent danger, if any, in the premises.  This is all the more so if the premises is part of a construction site anda person is given access to the premises by the contractor responsible for the construction site because of the statutory duty imposedon him under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations</a>.  Roctec was given permission to enter the Premises by CCECC.  It was entitled to assume that the Premises was safe for Roctec, itssub-contractor and their workers to work therein for the purpose of laying computer cables.  Roctec was entitled to assume that CCECCwould warn it of any latent hazard in the Premises.  Any duty that is owed by Roctec and Polycom to take adequate care for the safetyof their employees and not to expose them to risk of injury must be a duty of care in relation to a risk which is foreseeable.  Itcannot be a strict or absolute duty.  While CCECC tried to absolve itself from blame by saying that it had no knowledge about themis-connection and the hazard, the fact remains therefore that the risk was as unforeseeable to CCECC as it was to Roctec and Polycom. In the circumstances, there could be no duty owed by Roctec and Polycom to its employees and no breach of any duty. </p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  An interesting feature in this case is that the Defendants are not fighting on an united front, despite they are jointly representedby one firm of solicitors.  As pointed out by Mr Sakhrani, the Defendants make allegations of breach of duty which are material andcausative of the fatal accident against one another but they make none against the Third Parties who are represented by differentsolicitors or unrepresented.  Tridant and Talent allege that CCECC should not have permitted Roctec to work in the Premises and thatthey were not aware of Roctecâs or Polycomâs employees working in the Premises.  On the other hand, CCECC alleges serious breachof duty on the part of Tridant and Talent and for not informing CCECC of the defective Light Panel.  It is not necessary for me toassess the degree of blameworthiness among the Defendants.  Collectively they were negligent.  Apart from Hung Fai which was primarilyresponsible for making the mis-connection and engaging unqualified workers for the works the attitude of senior members of Tridantand Talent were deplorable.  They did not test the installations despite the light panels had been installed for over a week.  Onthe night before the accident, Man of Tridant, Tang of Talent and Tam of Hung Fai energized the light panels in the Premises forcommissioning purposes.  They knew that the Light Panel in question was not lit up.  They did not check or rectify the defect immediatelyor cause it to be rectified or put up any warning signs.  Tang did not switch off the MCB in the switch room in the Premises.  Onthe following day, despite their knowledge of the defect, Tang and Tam permitted Leung to turn on the mains switch, thus energizingthe MCB in the Premises and the Light Panel in question.  The defect in the Light Panel might appear innocuous, but it was a serioushazardous condition as it eventually turned out.  Lee took a very serious view of the defect.  He was critical of Tridantâs orTalentâs failure to report the defect and for not switching off the MCB in the Premises.  Since this is evidence from the Defendantsâcamp, I must accept it as evidence for and as much as evidence against the Defendants collectively.  Tridant, through its employees,knew there were other workers working in the Premises laying computer cables.  Tridant ought to know that the trunking for computercables was next to the light panels.  Tridant also ought to know the defective Light Panel might be a cause of hazard.  Tridant didnot inform the workers thereat or CCECC.  CCECC was the communication channel with Roctec.  CCECC was not informed of the defectand could not have warned Roctec, which rendered the risk unforeseeable.  Mr Clough argues that Roctec was in breach of its dutyfor failing to give CCECC three daysâ notice of its works schedule.  But, because of the above and the fact that Chiu on behalfof CCECC handed over the trunkings to Roctec to commence work, this breach fell into insignificance.  In the circumstances, I canonly conclude that the Defendantsâ negligence was the sole cause of the fatal accident and there was no breach of any duty of careowed by Roctec or Polycom to the Deceased.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Roctec and Polycom were not occupiers of the Premises.  Even if they were, they had discharged their common duty of care to theDeceased.  Not being the contractor responsible for the construction site, they were not under any statutory or non-delegable dutyto ensure that the Premises was safe for the Deceased to work in.  They were entitled to rely on the performance of that duty byCCECC.  The Defendantsâ negligence was the sole cause of the fatal accident.  The Defendantsâ claim for contribution againstRoctec or Polycom must be dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading"> The THIRD PARTY PROCEEDINGS against Baptist University</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  The Defendantsâ action against Baptist University is based on Baptist Universityâs liability for breach of duty by CCECC andits hierarchy of sub-contractors and the negligence of Roctec and its hierarchy of sub-contractors.  As I have found that there wasno breach of duty on the part of Roctec or Polycom, what remains to be decided is whether Baptist University should be held liablefor the breach of duty by CCECC and its hierarchy of sub-contractors. </p>    <p class="heading">Was Baptist University an occupier of the Premises</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Baptist University is the owner of the construction site.  It retained Ronald Lu &amp; Partners (HK) Ltd as the architect and leadingconsultant for the construction of the hostel.  It employed CCECC as the principal contractor for the superstructure works and anumber of independent specialist contractors, such as Tridant and Roctec. </p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  According to Fung, the estate officer of Baptist University, the management of the construction site was wholly under the controlof CCECC at all material times.  Baptist University had no authority to give any instruction either to any of the sub-contractorsor CCECC as to the manner in which the works were to be carried out.  If Baptist University was not satisfied with the work of CCECC,it could only inform Ronald Lu &amp; Partners (HK) Ltd to take the matter up with CCECC.  If staff of Baptist University wished toaccess the construction site, they had to be accompanied by staff of CCECC and each visit was logged by CCECC. </p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  The above evidence was not seriously disputed by CCECC.  Even according to Lee, CCECCâs project manager, CCECC had physical controlof the construction site.  It employed its own security guards to control access into the construction site.  All workers had toobtain work permits issued by CCECC before they would be permitted to enter the site.  Any visitor who wished to access the sitewithout a permit had to register at the entrance of the site stating the purpose of his visit.  CCECCâs security guards had powerto deny such a visitor from accessing the site.  It appears that the above procedure applied also to staff of Baptist University,with the exception of its clerk of works who was known to the staff of CCECC.  Staff of Baptist University permitted access to thesite had to be escorted by staff of CCECC.  As for workers of the direct contractors employed by Baptist University, the direct contractorshad to apply to the estates office of Baptist University for permission for their workers to access the site.  The estates officewould then liaise with CCECC which would decide whether it was appropriate to allow those workers to have access into the site. </p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  On the above facts, it is plainly obvious that CCECC had exclusive control of the construction site.  However, Baptist Universityalso maintained some minimal presence in the site through its clerk of works, who presumably checked the progress and quality ofworks as well as safety issues.  It supervised the progress of the works and execution of the works by CCECC and its line of sub-contractorsthrough its consultant, Ronald Lu &amp; Partners (HK) Ltd.  The consultant conducted monthly site meetings to monitor the progressof work and safety issues.  It reserved its authority to appoint direct specialist contractors to work on the site.  I think thisis just one of the usual cases to which Lord Denningâs dicta in <i>Wheat and E</i> <i>Lacon &amp; Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%20AC%20552" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] AC 552</a> at 580 applies, i.e. where an owner employed an independent contractor to do work on a premises or a structure, the owner was usuallystill regarded as sufficiently in control of the place as to be under a duty towards all those who might lawfully be in the place. Despite that CCECC had exclusive control of the site, I nevertheless have no difficulties to find that Baptist University maintainedsufficient minimal supervision and control as to make it a co-occupier of the construction site with CCECC.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Whether Baptist University had discharged its duty of care in employing independent contractors</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The test whether Baptist University has discharged its duty of care in employing its independent contractors, namely CCECC and Roctec,is the four-point test as set out in <i>Yeung Kam Fuk v Len Shing Construction Co Ltd &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20HKC%20160" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] HKC 160.</a></p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The superstructure works of the hostel and the computer cable laying work are not what one could reasonably regard as extra-hazardouswork.

Baptist University had previous dealings with Roctecand was satisfied with its performance.

The answer to the second question must be in the affirmative.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Baptist University did liaise with CCECC to check the progress and quality of work.  It monitored the progress and quality of workthrough Ronald Lu &amp; Partners (HK) Ltd and its own clerk of works.  Ronald Lu &amp; Partners (HK) Ltd conducted regular monthlysite meetings with its specialist consultants, CCECC and its sub-contractors and the direct contractors employed by Baptist Universityto monitor the progress and quality of work and safety issues.

It had overall responsibilityof ensuring safety of the workers on the site.  It was under a non-delegable statutory duty imposed by the various regulations underthe <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59" class="autolink_findacts">Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance</a> to do what was reasonably practicable to safeguard the safety of the workers working on the site.  Baptist Universityâs duty oftaking care in supervision of CCECC and its sub-contractors could not have been more onerous than CCECCâs own duty in ensuringthat its own sub-contractors execute the works properly and that other visitors on the site were reasonably safe for the purposesfor which they were permitted to be on the site.  Furthermore, there is no dispute that Mr Philip Wu and Mr S M Chan of the estateoffice of Baptist University went to the site periodically to check on the progress of work.  While CCECC might have been negligentin its supervision of its sub-contractors which resulted in the mis-connection and the breakdown in communication between CCECC andTridant or Talent, there can be no doubt that Baptist University had taken reasonable steps in supervising the execution of workby CCECC and Roctec. </p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Having engaged a competent contractor such as CCECC as the principal contractor responsible for the construction site, a competentcontractor such as Tridant with good track record in safety, having engaged a competent specialist contractor with past record suchas Roctec and having engaged Ronald Lu &amp; Partners (HK) Ltd with its team of consultants in various specialist fields, it wasreasonable for Baptist University to rely on the skill and expertise of its consultants to supervise the execution of work by CCECC,Roctec and their sub-contractors and to rely on the competence of CCECC and Roctec in supervising their sub-contractors.  This isone of those typical cases in which Lord Keithâs observation in <i>Ferguson v Welsh and Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%203%20All%20ER%20777" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 3 All ER 777</a> at 783 is applicable.

In this context, the question whether the computer cable laying workhad been properly executed does not arise. </p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  The duty of care owed by Baptist University to employees engaged by its contractors or sub-contractors must be different from thatowed to an ordinary visitor.  If the works had been completed and handed over to Baptist University so that the hostel is open toordinary visitors, Baptist University has the duty to use reasonable care to check that the works had been properly carried out beforeopening the hostel to ordinary visitors.  The situation is very much different while works are still in progress and when one islooking at the duty of the employer of the construction site who is practically absent from the site and had contracted the worksto a competent principal contractor.  In that situation, it is not possible for the employer to check if each stage of the workshad been properly carried out as if it were the contractorâs own safety officer or quality control officer.  As I have said, BaptistUniversityâs duty of supervision could not be more onerous than CCECCâs.  Likewise, Baptist Universityâs duty to exercise reasonablecare to check if the works had been properly done could not be more onerous than CCECCâs.  That duty simply did not exist whilethe works were still in progress and under the control of the principal contractor.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Baptist University had entrusted all the works to CCECC, a competent and experienced independent contractor in the kind of worksentrusted to it.  Baptist University had no reason to doubt CCECCâs competency and ability in supervision.  It is common groundthat CCECC had no knowledge of the mis-connection of wires by Yan, had no knowledge that the Light Panel did not light up when energizedand had not been informed by Talent or Tridant about the defective Light Panel.  Tridant did not test the light panels for a weekafter its installation.  Baptist University could have no knowledge when the light panels were installed and could not possibly havechecked if the works had been properly done.  In fact, on circumstances such as these, it was unreasonable to impose on Baptist Universityas the employer the duty to check each stage of the works as it progressed and it was impossible for Baptist University to do so. That being the situation, the fourth question need not be answered.  </p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  In the circumstances, I find that Baptist University had exercised reasonable care in entrusting the works to its independent contractors.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Whether Baptist University was under any non-delegable duty of care for the safety of workers in the Premises or was otherwise liable</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  There is no argument that the superstructure works contracted to CCECC or the computer cable laying works contracted to Roctec wereof an extra-hazardous nature such that the duty of care owed to visitors could not be delegated.  On the facts of this case, it isdifficult to launch any argument along that line.   </p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Lastly, there is no evidence that Baptist University had interfered with the execution of work under the contracts by CCECC andRoctec which in any way contributed to the mis-connection and the accident.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  In conclusion, Baptist University was the occupier of the construction site, including the Premises.  However, the fatal accidentwas caused solely by the negligence of independent contractor and its sub-contractors employed by Baptist University.  Baptist Universityhad discharged its duty of care in employing its independent contractors.  It has satisfied the four-point test in <i>Yeung Kam Fuk v Len Shing Construction Co Ltd &amp; Ors.</i> It has discharged its common duty of care under common law or under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a>.  The Defendants have failed to show that Baptist University has by its act or omission or by reason of the circumstances of thecase taken itself outside the âwithout moreâ circumstances in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(4)(b)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a> as to become answerable for the tort committed by CCECC and its hierarchy of sub-contractors.  CCECCâs and its sub-contractorsânegligence was the sole cause of the fatal accident.  Roctec has not been negligent.  Accordingly, Baptist University is not liablefor the fatal accident or to contribute to the damages paid by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs.  In the circumstances, it is notnecessary to consider the issue of indemnity as between Baptist University and CCECC or Roctec under their respective contracts.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>CONCLUSION</i></p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  For the above reasons, I dismiss the Defendantsâ Third Party proceedings against the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Third Parties with an order <i>nisi</i> that the Defendants shall pay the costs of the Third Parties.
