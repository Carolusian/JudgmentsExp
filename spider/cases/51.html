The Secretary for Justice is named as the defendant for and on behalf of the Director.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Background</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  G first came to Hong Kong in 1992 using a passport bearing the name of Ghulam Rubbani, born on 15 April 1971.  He was allowed tostay for 3 months but he overstayed.  For that, he was subsequently charged with and convicted of breach of condition of stay, finedand repatriated to the Pakistan in August 1993.  He had overstayed for about 10 months.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  G came to Hong Kong again in 1994 using another passport bearing the name of Mian Ghulam Rabani, born on 15 April 1970.  He waspermitted to stay for 3 months.  Again he overstayed; and was convicted and fined.  He was repatriated to the Pakistan in July 1995. He had overstayed for about 5 months.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In May 1999, G revisited Hong Kong using another passport bearing the name of Ghulam Rabbani, born in 1967.  For once again overstayingand making false representation to the immigration (as regards his date of birth during his last visit), G was convicted and givena suspended imprisonment sentence before removal to Pakistan in October 1999.  On this occasion, he had overstayed for about 4 months.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  G last came to Hong Kong on 24 September 2000 when he used yet another passport, this time bearing the name of Ghulam Rbani, bornin 1971.  He was permitted to remain as a visitor until 15 October 2000; but he had since overstayed here.  On 1 April 2005, G wasarrested by the police for gambling in a place not being a gambling establishment.  He was so charged with the offence together withthat of breach of condition of stay.  Together with the activated suspended sentence (mentioned above), G was sentenced to a totalof 7 monthsâ imprisonment.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  After serving slightly less than 5 months in prison, G was discharged from the prison on 23 August 2005.  Since then, G had beenplaced under administrative detention by the Director in the Castle Peak Bay Immigration Centre (â<b>the Centre</b>â) pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115" class="autolink_findacts">Immigration Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115">Cap.115</a> (â<b>the IO</b>â).</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  During the interviews prior to his release from prison in August 2005, not only did G raise no objection to his deportation, buthe also positively requested to return to Lahore, Pakistan as soon as possible.  The reasons given were his concern about his family,his aged mother and sick son.  G repeated his request and reasons by his letter to the Department and during the interview on theday of his release from prison.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In view of Gâs request, the Director wrote to the Consulate General of the Republic of Pakistan 2 days after Gâs administrativedetention to seek confirmation for the issue of an emergency passport to G.  In the meantime, Gâs detention pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)(a)</a> expired; and was continued by  the Secretary for Security (â<b>the Secretary</b>â) under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)(b)</a> for 21 days from 29 August 2005.  G acknowledged receipt of the notification of the further detention by signing it on 31 August2005.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The Director received a positive reply from the Pakistani counterpart on 2 September 2005.  An emergency passport of G was issuedand air ticket was procured.  Application for a removal order was made on 7 September 2005; and the order was issued on 10 September2005.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Unbeknown to the Director, G lodged a claim under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatmentor Punishment (â<b>CAT</b>â) on 5 September 2005.  According to him in court, he changed his mind about repatriation upon learning that his son had recovered.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  As G confirmed, his written statement containing the CAT claim was sent by post.  This was received by the Department on 8 September;and by Removal Sub-division of the Department on 12 September 2005.  The issue of the removal order apparently crossed with Gâsletter.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Service of the removal order, though made, was then withheld and eventually withdrawn on 15 September 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  On 16 September 2005, the Secretary authorised the detention of G for a further period of 21 days pursuant to section 32(2A)(c). G was given the notification of the continued detention on 21 September 2005.  But G refused to sign it.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Screening interview of G in respect of his CAT claim began.  On 7 October 2005, G was released on recognisance.  It was a monthand a half since his release from prison; and about a month since he lodged the CAT claim.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>A (Torture Claimant) v Director of Immigration</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In <i>A (Torture Claimant) v Director of Immigration</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%204%20HKLRD%20752" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 4 HKLRD 752</a> (â<b>the case of <i>A</i></b>â), the applicants were the subjects of removal and deportation orders under sections 19 or 20 of the IO.  They applied for judicialreview challenging the legality of their continued detention by the Director under section 32 of the IO since the lodging of theirrespective claims under the CAT.  Their applications were dismissed; and they appealed.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The relevant provisions of section 32 of the IO read as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b>Detention pending removal or deportation</b></p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">(2A) A person may be detained pending the decision of the Director of Immigration, the Deputy Director of Immigration or any assistantdirector of immigration as to whether or not a removal order should be made under section 19(1)(b) in respect of that person â</p>        <blockquote>          <p class="quote">(a) for not more than 7 days under the authority of the Director of Immigration, the Deputy Director of Immigration or any assistantdirector of immigration;</p>          <p class="quote">(b) for not more than a further 21 days under the authority of the Secretary for Security; and</p>          <p class="quote">(c) where inquiries for the purpose of such decision have not been completed, for a further period of 21 days under the authorityof the Secretary for Security, in addition to the periods provided under paragraphs (a) and (b).</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3) A person in respect of whom removal order under section 19(1)(b) is in force may be detained under the authority of the Secretaryfor Security pending his removal from Hong Kong under section 25.</p>        <p class="quote">(3A)  A person in respect of whom a removal order under section 19(1)(b) is in force may be detained under the authority of the Directorof Immigration, the Deputy Director of Immigration or any assistant director of immigration pending his removal from Hong Kong undersection 25.â</p>    </blockquote><p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The Court of Appeal, among other things, had the following conclusion:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)  Under domestic law, the power to detain pending removal under section 32 is in principle exercisable so long as the Secretaryis intent upon removing the subject at the earliest possible moment, and it is not apparent that removal within a reasonable timewould be impossible.  This reflects the application of the principles in <i>R v Governor of Durham Prison, ex p Hardial Singh</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20WLR%20704" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 WLR 704</a> (approved and applied in <i>Tan Le Lam &amp; Ors v Superintendent Tai A Chau Detention Centre</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20AC%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] AC 97</a>; <i>Thang Thieu Quyen &amp; Ors v Director of Immigration &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%2d98%29%201%20HKCFAR%20167" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997-98) 1 HKCFAR 167</a>; R <i>(Khadir) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20AC%20207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 AC 207).</a></p>        <p>(2)  However Art.5(1) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (â<b>HKBOR</b>â) requires that detention must not be arbitrary and the grounds and procedures must be certain and accessible.  In the absenceof a published policy as to the circumstances under which the power to detain would be exercised, the power of detention under section32 were contrary to Art.5(1) of the HKBOR and hence unlawful.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The Court of Appeal granted the declarations that the detention of each of the applicants in the case of <i>A</i> was illegal for breach of Art.5(1) of the HKBOR: see further judgment dated 18 July 2008.  The case reverted to the Court of FirstInstance where each of the applicants was awarded damages: see <i>A (Torture Claimant) v Director of Immigration</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2009%5d%203%20HKLRD%2044" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2009] 3 HKLRD 44</a> (â<b>the case of <i>A</i> (damages)</b>â).</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The dispute</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  As pleaded, based on the judgment in the case of <i>A</i>, G now claims that his detention after release from prison until his release on recognizance was unlawful as there was at the timeno certain and accessible policy on how the discretion to detain under section 32 of the IO would be exercised.  For alleged falseimprisonment, G claims basic damages, aggravated damages and exemplary damages.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  G also claims that the detention was in violation of his constitutional rights guaranteed under Art.9(1) of the International Covenanton Civil and Political Rights (â<b>ICCPR</b>â), Arts.28 and 39 of the Basic Law, and/or Art.5(1) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/383">Cap.383</a> (â<b>HKBORO</b>â).  He claims constitutional damages pursuant to Art.35 of the Basic Law and section 6(1) of the HKBORO.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The Directorâs primary contention is that because of section 11 of the HKBORO, Art.9 of the ICCPR or Art.5 of the HKBOR does notaffect the application of section 32 of the IO to G.  The secondary contention is that in any event, the judgment in the case of<i>A</i> has no application to the application of section 32 to the detention of G in the present case.  Therefore the detention of G wasnot unlawful.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In the premises, the Director says that Gâs claim should be dismissed.  However, in the event that this court finds that the detentionof G in the present case was unlawful, the Director contends that G is nevertheless entitled to not more than nominal damages; oralternatively, substantial damages but not in the sum as claimed.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Section 11 of the HKBORO</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  By virtue of Art. 39 of the Basic Law:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social andCultural Rights, and international labour conventions as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force and shall be implemented throughthe laws of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</p>        <p class="quote">The rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents shall not be restricted unless as prescribed by law.  Such restrictions shallnot contravene the provisions of the preceding paragraph of this Article.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Art.9 of the ICCPR guarantees the personal liberty of person, which is essentially reproduced in Art.5 of the HKBOR:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1) Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No oneshall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.</p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">(5)   Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to compensation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The primary contention of the Director is that G cannot found his claim on the rights guaranteed under Art.9 of the ICCPR and Art.5of the HKBOR.  The reason is section 11 of the HKBORO, which provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âas regards persons not having the right to enter and remain in Hong Kong, this Ordinance does not affect any immigration legislationgoverning entry into, stay in and departure from Hong Kong, or the application of any such legislation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In the case of <i>MA &amp; Ors v The Director of Immigration</i>, HCAL 10/2010 (6 January 2011) (which will be further discussed below), Andrew Cheung J (as he then was) held (at Â§Â§37-38) thataccording to its natural and ordinary meaning, the phrase âentry into, stay in and departure from Hong Kongâ in section 11 ofthe HKBORO covers the entire period from arrival until departure that a foreigner is in Hong Kong irrespective of whether the staywas lawful or not, i.e., as a lawful visitor, an illegal immigrant or an overstayer.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  At the time when G was detained, he had no right to remain in Hong Kong.  Further the exercise of the power under section 32 todetain G must be an application of the IO and a facet of his stay in Hong Kong.  Section 11 of the HKBORO applies to G fairly andsquarely.  Literally construed, the section does except the application of the IO to G from the HKBORO (and hence the HKBOR).</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  However Mr Dykes SC (appearing with Mr Hectar Pun) submitted that the right to be free from arbitrary detention and the right tohabeas corpus are peremptory norms of customary international law (<i>jus cogens</i>).  Section 11 of the HKBORO cannot be applied to trump the non-derogatory nature of these peremptory norms in international law.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Mr Chow SC (appearing with Miss Grace Chow) took issue as to his opponentâs reliance on customary international law, which wasneither pleaded nor formally raised during opening submission.  This observation is fair.  More importantly, customary internationallaw must be proved.  In this regard, Mr Chow SC referred to <i>C &amp; Ors v Director of Immigration</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%202%20HKC%20165" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 2 HKC 165</a> (*) (at Â§Â§ 65-68) to illustrate the fundamental elements constituting a rule of customary international law, namely:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)  the rule should be of a norm-creating character, capable therefore of forming the basis of a general rule of law;</p>        <p>(2)  there must be a settled and consistent practice by states; not by all states, but by states generally; and</p>        <p>(3)  the practice must be followed because it is accepted as being legally obligatory.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Not only must the concept or right contended be proved to have developed into the customary international law, but the same mustalso have formed part of the Hong Kong law. Further it must be of the nature as peremptory norm so that no state can derogate from. In other words, for Gâs purpose, the rights contended must, and not just ought to, have attained the status of a peremptory normfrom which no state can derogate.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Mr Dykes SC referred to General Comment No. 24 of the Human Rights Committee on issues relating to reservations made upon ratificationor accession to the ICCPR.  It includes the following statement:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â8. Reservations that offend peremptory norms would not be compatible with the object and purpose of the Covenant. Although treatiesthat are mere exchanges of obligations between States allow them to reserve <i>inter se</i> application of the rules of general international law, it is otherwise in human rights treaties, which are for the benefit of personswithin their jurisdiction. Accordingly, provisions in the Covenant that represent customary international law (and <i>a fortiori</i> when they have the character of peremptory norms) may not be the subject of reservations. Accordingly, a State may not reserve theright to engage in slavery, to torture, to subject persons to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, to arbitrarilydeprive persons of their lives, to arbitrarily arrest and detain persons, to deny freedom of thought, conscience and religion, topresume a person guilty unless he proves his innocence, to execute pregnant woman or children, to permit the advocacy or national,racial or religious hatred, to deny to persons of marriageable age the right to marry, or to deny to minorities the right to enjoytheir own culture, profess their own religion, or use their own language. And while reservations to particular clauses of art. 14may be acceptable, a general reservation to the right to be fair trial would not be.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Mr Dykes SC also produced extracts from various academic writings in support.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Unlike Mr Chow SC, my concern is not so much whether comments from the Human Rights Committee or academic writings are acceptableevidence.  I tend to believe the court is receptive of them as evidence of international law and state practice.  What I am not sureabout is whether I am indeed presented with all the relevant materials (as evidence) for drawing a conclusion.  At least I cannotignore the likely compromise of Mr Chow SCâs chance to provide the necessary assistance to the court in this respect because theargument on customary international law was raised at such a late stage.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Having said that, I do not think this actually prevents me from disposing of this argument on behalf of G.  I say this because similarargument against the application of the immigration reservation has been attempted and ruled on in the recent case of <i>Ubamaka v Secretary for Security</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2011%5d%201%20HKLRD%20359" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2011] 1 HKLRD 359.</a></p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In <i>Ubamaka</i>, the Nigerian national was imprisoned for drug offence in Hong Kong in 1993.  Deportation order was later made against him.  Dueto his making of a CAT claim, he was transferred to the Centre upon his release from the prison in 2007.  In judicial review proceedings,the deportation order was quashed.  The Secretary for Security appealed.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The Court of Appeal (at Â§48 of the judgment) set out the issues on appeal.  As far as the complaint that the act of deporting thesubject in the circumstances of the case would amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment contrary to Art.7 of the ICCPR orArt.3 of the HKBOR as well as Art.14(7) of the ICCPR and Art.11(6) of the HKBOR is concerned, the Court of Appeal ruled against theapplicant.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The Court proceeded to address the question that is relevant for our present purpose, namely whether the above complaint of theapplicant in <i>Ubamaka</i>, even if substantiated, would be precluded by the immigration reservation to the ICCPR, which is now reflected by section 11 of theHKBORO.  Central to this question would have been whether the concepts and rights guaranteed under those articles in the ICCPR wereperemptory norms of customary international law from which no state may derogate by way of domestic legislative reservation or exemption(see Â§Â§131-132).</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Fok J (as he then was), with whom Stock VP and Andrew Cheung J (as he then was) agreed, had this to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â133. It is not necessary for the purpose deciding this case to determine the issue of whether the prohibition of torture or cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is a peremptory norm of customary international law. It is only necessary to considerwhether, even assuming the prohibition is a peremptory norm of customary international law, at a domestic law level (which is theonly level with which the courts of Hong Kong are concerned) the immigration reservation to the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong isvalid. In my judgment â¦â¦ there is no question but that, as a matter of domestic law, the courts of Hong Kong must give effectto the immigration reservation to the ICCPR as reflected in art.39 of the Basic Law and s.11 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.I say this for the following reasons.</p>        <p class="quote">134. Article 39 of the Basic Law entrenches the provisions of the ICCPR but only âas applied to Hong Kongââ¦â¦ The clear effectof that constitutional entrenchment of the ICCPR is that one must look to the terms of the United Kingdomâs ratification of theICCPR to ascertain the extent to which the ICCPR has been applied to Hong Kong. That was the position before 1 July 1997 and it remainsthe position since that date by reason of art.39 of the Basic Law which is to the same effect. Furthermore, the effect of art.39of the Basic Law is that, regardless of the enactment of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kongin 1976 (upon ratification), 1984 (when the Joint Declaration was signed) or 1990 (when the Basic Law was promulgated), all of whichdates predate the enactment of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, continues to have domestic force as from 1 July 1997.</p>        <p class="quote">135. So far as the courts of Hong Kong are concerned, therefore, the provisions of s.11 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinanceare binding, unless found to be inconsistent with any provision of the Basic Law. Far from being inconsistent with any such provision,in my view, s.11 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance reflects the evident fact that the United Kingdom Government viewed itsreservation to the ICCPR in the relevant context of immigration control. It is also relevant to note that the immigration reservationentered into by the United Kingdom Government (and continued by the PRC in respect of Hong Kong) has not been the subject of anyState objection under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Moreover, there is a long line of cases decided in Hong Kongin which it has been confirmed that the effect of s.11 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and the immigration reservationto the ICCPR is that the provisions of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights and ICCPR respectively could not be invoked to enable those nothaving the right to enter and remain in Hong Kong to resist removal or deportation â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">136. Thus, whilst it may be accepted that, as a matter of international law, derogation from a peremptory norm is not permissible,there is arguably a distinction between, on the one hand, such a derogation (which is impermissible) and, on the other hand, theact of choosing not to enter into a treaty which incorporates the peremptory norm itself (which must be permissible) or of choosingto enter into the treaty with a reservation regarding the relevant provisions incorporating the peremptory norm (which, as a matterof principle and logic, ought to be permissible). In any event, it is not necessary here to address and resolve the question of whetherthat distinction in international law is valid, since no such argument can arise at the domestic level, with which this judgmentis concerned, since the courts of Hong Kong are required to apply art.39 of the Basic Law and s.11 of the Hong Kong Bill of RightsOrdinance.</p>        <p class="quote">137.  I would add that if reliance is to be placed on a rule of customary international law, it is clear that this needs to be provedby showing that the rule in question is a rule of universal international practice.  In the present case there is no evidence thatStates have applied a universal practice or prohibiting deportation where there is a risk of inhuman or degrading treatmentâ¦â¦<i>A fortiori</i>, there is no evidence that the prohibition against inhuman and degrading treatment, and still less, the injunction against <i>refoulment</i> to inhuman and degrading treatment, have become <i>jus cogens.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Fok J also rejected the argument that section 11 of the HKBORO should be given a narrow construction (see Â§Â§139-148) and the argumentthat the immigration reservation to the ICCPR and section 11 of the HKBORO do not manage to preclude the rule of customary internationallaw from being incorporating into the common law of Hong Kong (see Â§Â§149-151).</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Mr Dykes SC submitted that what the Court of Appeal in <i>Ubamaka</i> said in respect of section 11 of the HKBORO was obiter.  Indeed Fok J acknowledged that.  Nevertheless his Lordship proceeded toaddress the question of the applicability and effect of the immigration reservation under section 11 of the HKBORO âas a matterof general importanceâ (see Â§124).</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Besides agreeing with Fok J, Stock VP added that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â2.   His (i.e., Fok J) judgment includes an analysis of the phrase âas applied to Hong Kongâ as used in art.39 of the BasicLaw, an analysis which is perhaps overdue since the phrase has periodically been the subject of some misunderstanding by advocatesand in this case, there has been an attempt further to limit its meaning.  I wish to add a word about the issue because it is onethat now deserves some emphasis.</p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">8.     Whatever view might be taken by the Human Rights Committee or by commentators on the validity or desirability of a reservationthus applied, the phrase âas applied to Hong Kongâ which we see in art.39 is a phrase that falls to be determined in the contextof a domestically binding constitution and is to be interpreted in accordance with the meaning intended by that constitution.</p>        <p class="quote">9.     It is true that the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/383">Cap.383</a>) gave domestic effect to the ICCPR.

So too, in referring to the ICCPR âas applied to Hong Kongâ, the Basic Law â¦â¦ contemplated it as a reference to theapplication, with reservations, in 1976 of the ICCPR by the Government of the United Kingdom to Hong Kong â¦â¦ and it contemplatedthe continued application of that ICCPR to Hong Kong beyond 1 July 1997, upon proper authorisation by the Government of the PRC,with those reservations.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Andrew Cheung Jtoo emphasized the significant implication of the issue in the context of the challenge against the validity of theimmigration reservation:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â11. This appeal raises some important issues.  Amongst them is the one concerning the meaning of the important phrase âas appliedto Hong Kongâ in art.39(1) of the Basic Lawâ¦â¦This issue arises in the context of a challenge, which carries significant implications,against the validity of the âimmigration reservation made by the United Kingdom Government when it ratified the International Covenanton Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and applied it to Hong Kong in 1976, and of section 11 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance(<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/383">Cap.383</a>) which (in my view) reflects at the domestic level the immigration reservation, particularly where a guaranteed right thatis said to embody or mirror a peremptory norm of customary international law is engaged.  The key to determining these questionsof validity lies, to a significant extent, in a proper understanding of the phrase âas applied to Hong Kongâ in art,39(1) andof how that article works at the constitutional level to give effect to and, at the same time, to delimit the application of, theICCPR in the domestic courts.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  In my view, albeit strictly obiter, what the Court of Appeal said in respect of section 11 of the HKBORO was nevertheless intendedto be statement of law of general importance.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The applicant in <i>Ubamaka</i>, represented by Mr Pun (now appearing with Mr Dykes SC in the present case) did not take the Courtâs above statement of the lawlightly either.  In his subsequent application for leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal, one of the points proposed on appealwas precisely the validity, application and effect of the immigration reservation made by the UK Government in 1976 when it accededto the ICCPR and applied it to Hong Kong as well as section 11 of the HKBORO.  The application for leave, including that on thispoint, was dismissed on 25 May 2011 (see the written reasons handed down on 31 May 2011).</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Andrew Cheung J sat as a member of the Court of Appeal in both the cases of <i>A</i> and <i>Ubamaka</i>. His Lordship then sat in the subsequent case of <i>MA</i> (above).  The applicants in the case of <i>MA</i> were mandated refugees and screened-in CAT claimants. They claimed the right to work during their stay in Hong Kong.  The immigrationreservation to the ICCPR as reflected by section 11 of the IO was relied on by the Director.  Faced with the argument that the sectionwas incompatible with Art 39 of the Basic Law, his Lordship considered that the matter was squarely covered by the Court of Appealdecision in <i>Ubamaka</i> as discussed above; and rejected such argument.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  As far as the application of section 11 of the HKBORO is concerned, Mr Chow SC submitted that the position of G, being a CAT claimant,was in no better position than the screened-in CAT claimant and mandated refugee in <i>Ubamaka</i>.  I agree.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  It is true that notwithstanding their conclusion about the application and effect of the immigration reservation to the ICCPR andsection 11 of the HKBORO, the Court of Appeal in <i>Ubamaka</i> did not disturb the declaration granted by the judge that the detention of the applicant in that case under section 32 was unlawful. However, this was because counsel for the Director accepted during the appeal that the judge was bound by the case of <i>A</i> to draw that conclusion on the basis that there were at the material time no certain and accessible grounds or procedures for suchdetention (see Â§Â§170-172).</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In the case of <i>MA</i>, Andrew Cheung J also observed (at Â§41) that in the case of <i>A</i>, the Director did not rely on section 11 of the HKBORO to argue that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115" class="autolink_findacts">Immigration Ordinance</a> was actually excepted from the operation of the HKBOR.  In <i>Ubamaka</i>, it was not argued that the decision in the case of <i>A</i> stood in the way of the Court of Appealâs eventual conclusion that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 11</a> was actually effective to except the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115" class="autolink_findacts">Immigration Ordinance</a> from the operation of the HKBOR in relation to matters concerning entry into, stay in and departure from Hong Kong.  His Lordshipconsidered that what was stated in <i>Ubamaka</i> should be the current state of the relevant law.  Therefore the reliance by the applicants there on the rights guaranteed under theHKBOR or the ICCPR had to be rejected.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Now Mr Chow SC confirmed that the effect of his submission on the immigration reservation to the ICCPR, now reflected by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 11</a> of the HKBORO, is that had the attention of the Court of Appeal in the case of <i>A</i> been drawn to the application and effect of that section, the decision in that case should have been different.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  No doubt the case of <i>A</i> is binding on this court.  However as observed by Andrew Cheung J in the case of <i>MA</i>, the subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Ubamaka</i> represents the current state of the law regarding the validity and effect of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 11</a> of the HKBORO.  In that respect, this court has all the good reasons to follow <i>Ubamaka</i> too.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Following <i>Ubamaka</i>, as Andrew Cheung J did in the case of <i>MA</i>, I should conclude that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 11</a> of the HKBORO has excepted <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32</a> of the IO and its application from the application of the HKBOR.  I should also conclude that G is not in a position to found hisclaim on the rights guaranteed under either Art.9 of the ICCPR or Art.5 of the HKBOR.  This is my conclusion.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The Basic Law</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  G also found his claim on Arts.28 and 35 of the Basic Law.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Art.28 of the Basic Law reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe freedom of the person of Hong Kong residents shall be inviolable.</p>        <p class="quote">No Hong Kong resident shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful arrest, detention or imprisonment.

When reading the Basic Law as a whole in order to find out the non-residentâs right, one must not overlook Art.39that stipulates that the provisions of the international covenants âas applied to Hong Kongâ shall remain in force in Hong Kong.

That said, the Director in that case did not question whether the decision ofthe case of <i>A</i> was or should be read to be confined to the power to detain under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(3)</a> or (3A) rather than that under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A).</a> Instead, it was argued that the steps taken by the Director after the judgment in the case of <i>A</i> was handed down sufficed to remedy the defaults in the procedures identified in the case of <i>A</i> (see Â§27).  It was on this basis that the Saunders J proceeded to consider whether an originally unlawful detention might be subsequentlyremedied (see Â§Â§28-31); and if yes, whether the steps taken by the Director constituted a lawful detention policy in accordancewith the criteria explained in the case of <i>A</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Assuming with no disrespect that the case of <i>A</i> is not clear as to whether the conclusion there was intended to apply to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 32(3)</a> and (3A) only, I venture to consider whether according to the principles applied in the case of <i>A</i>, the legality of the power to detain under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)</a> suffers the same fate as <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 32(3)</a> and (3A).</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The starting point is that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 32(3)</a> and (3A) permit a person to be detained pending, i.e., until, removal under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 25.</a>  There is no limitation on the purpose for which a person subject to a removal order could be detained (not even limited to âforthe purpose of removalâ), or the duration of such detention: see the case of <i>A</i> at Â§Â§29-30; <i>Thang Thieu Quyen</i> (above) at 188; <i>Khadir</i> (above) at Â§32.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  In the case of <i>A</i>, Tang VP said (at Â§63):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âArticle 5 requires that the detention be not arbitrary and in accordance with certain and accessible grounds and procedure. Inother words, it is for the Director to justify detention and not for the applicant to seek release from detention. The existenceof clear and lawful policy ensures that the Director, when making his decision whether or not to detain, would have had all the relevantcircumstances under consideration, and that the decision to detain would not be arbitrary. The availability of such grounds wouldalso enable an applicant to know how best to ensure that he is not detainedâ¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The grounds and procedure for the exercise of the power to detain could be made certain by a policy and accessible by publication. But making a policy is not the only way.  The same could also be achieved by way of legislation (see the case of <i>A</i> at Â§41).  Mr Chow SC submitted that that is the case insofar as the power to detain under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)</a> is concerned.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  The circumstances in which the powers to detain under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 32(2)</a> or (2A) may be exercised are set out in subsection (1A):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhere the consideration is being given to applying for or making a removal order in respect of a person, that person may be detainedas provided for in subsection (2) or (2A), whichever is appropriate in the particular case.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  As mentioned, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 32(2A)</a> limits the power to detain to be exercised for the sole purpose of inquiries for deciding whether to make the removal order.  Theduration of detention was also limited.  These two elements of the power to detain under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)</a> are apparently certain and accessible by way of the legislation itself.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  However, whilst the power to detain under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)</a>, properly construed, is limited by reference to the purpose of inquiries as to whether a removal order should be made, the conductof such inquiries does not presume the need for detention.  Considering the legislation alone, I would not say that the grounds andprocedure for detention under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)</a> are certain and accessible as required by Art.5(1) of the HKBOR. </p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Referring to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)</a>, one cannot further form any idea as to what could lead to the detention of a subject of inquiries for the purpose of deciding whethera removal order should be made.  In that sense, if I may say so with respect, Saunders J in <i>Hashimi</i> seemed to share a similar view when his Lordship commented on the sufficiency of the Notice of Detention Authority as a statementof the detention policy (see Â§Â§35-36).</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  I do understand Mr Chow SCâs argument that it may be unrealistic in the circumstances of a particular case, or even frequentlythe case, to expect the subject of such inquiry to be left at large.  But this is never a complete, if legitimate, answer.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  The period of detention under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)</a> is capped.  Nevertheless Mr Dykes SC argued that in the absence of certain and assessable guidelines in respect of how the appropriatelength of the detention would be assessed, the statutory limit on the duration under each subsection effectively becomes blanketduration applicable to all.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Mr Chow SC took issue that the allegation as to the lack of certain and accessible policy in respect of the duration of detentionwas not pleaded.  In any event, he submitted that the Court of Appeal in the case of <i>A</i> said nothing in support of the alleged need for a policy as to the length of detention.  On the contrary, the Court of Appeal held(at Â§31) that so long as the Secretary was intent upon removing the applicant at the earliest possible moment, and it is not apparentthat the removal in a reasonable time would be impossible, the power to detain would in principle be exercisable.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  As far as the argument for a policy on the length of detention is concerned, I agree with Mr Chow SCâs observation.  As the Courtof Appeal in <i>Ubamaka</i> noted (at Â§170), the learned judge below in that case found the detention of the applicant there to have been unlawful on two <i>distinct</i> bases: firstly the detention was for unreasonable period and inadequate reasons; and secondly he was bound by the case of <i>A</i>.  But by referring to the âtransparency on the likely length of detentionâ, the learned judge was arguably referring to the secondinstead of the first basis.  That approach, the Court of Appeal found (at Â§180), is at odd with the judgment in the case of <i>A</i> (at Â§31).</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Having said that, for the reasons explained earlier, I would already conclude that the power to detain under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)</a> is unlawful for infringement of Art.5 of the HKBOR.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  In the circumstances, I do not agree with Mr Chow SC that the ground and procedure of detention under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)</a> is made certain by the wordings of the section itself.  If I were wrong about that, I would have agreed that the ground and procedurewould be accessible; and to a person like G too if the protocol to arrange translation is adhered to.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  In conclusion, had the application of the IO that governs the entry into, stay in and departure from Hong Kong as regards G notbeen excepted from the HKBORO by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 11</a>, I would have concluded that the power to detain under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)</a> is unlawful for breach of Art.5(1) of the HKBOR.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  The principles in <i>Hardial Singh</i> (at 706C-G) are the common law check on the exercise of the power of administrative detention.  The power of detention, though notexpressly subject to limitation on duration, cannot be used for any purpose other than pending the making of a deportation order. As the power is given in order to enable the machinery of deportation to be carried out, it is impliedly limited to a period thatis reasonably necessary for such purpose.  If it becomes apparent that the removal will not be effected within a reasonable time,it will be wrong to exercise the power of detention.  The authority should exercise all reasonable expedition to ensure that thesteps are taken to ensure that the steps are taken which will be necessary to ensure the removal of the individual within a reasonabletime.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  In approving the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles, Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>Tan Te Lam</i> (above) (at 111A-E) said that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s13d.html" class="autolink_findacts"> Section 13D(1)</a> confers a power to detain a Vietnamese migrant âpending his removal from Hong Kongâ. Their Lordships have no doubt that in conferringsuch a power to interfere with individual liberty, the legislature intended that such power could only be exercised reasonably andthat accordingly it was implicitly so limited. The principles enunciated by Woolf J in the <i>Hardial Singh</i> case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20WLR%20704" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 WLR 704</a> are statements of the limitations on a statutory power of detention pending removal. In the absence of contrary indications in thestatute which confers the power to detain âpending removalâ their Lordships agree with the principles stated by Woolf J.</p>        <p>        Although these restrictions are to be implied where a statute confers simply a power to detain âpending removalâ withoutmore, it is plainly possible for the legislature by express provision in the statute to exclude such implied restrictions.  Subjectto any constitutional challenge (which does not arise in this case) the legislature can vary or possibly exclude the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles. But in their Lordshipsâ view the courts should construe strictly any statutory provisions purporting to allow the deprivationof individual liberty by administrative detention and should be slow to hold that statutory provisions authorise administrative detentionfor unreasonable periods or in unreasonable circumstances.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  There is dispute as to whether the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles apply in the present case.  In arguing that they do not, Mr Chow SC highlighted the fact that the principles were premisedon a power to detain pending the making of a deportation order (albeit the decision to deport has been made) or removal that wassubject to no limitation on duration.  As <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)</a> of the IO is expressly subject to limitation as to both purpose and duration, the principles do not apply.  Even if the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles apply in the case of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)</a>, the power to detain is exercisable and lawfully exercised in the case of G.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Assuming the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles apply in the present case, I think the intention of the Director and the Secretary to decide whether to make the removalorder should be beyond doubt.  As to whether it was apparent that removal would not be effected within reasonable time once G raisedhis CAT claim; and whether G should and could have been released on recognisance earlier, I think this is arguable on the evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Nonetheless, as Saunders J commented in <i>Hashimi</i> (at Â§11), it will only be that, if his detention is lawful in terms of the decision in the case of <i>A</i>, the issue of whether or not Gâs detention is in breach of the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles will arise.  In view of my above conclusion in respect of the legality of the power to detain under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2A)</a> because of Art.5(1) of the HKBOR, the issue of the applicability and, if yes, the application of the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles does not arise for a conclusion.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>On liability</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  For the above reasons, I conclude that G fails on liability.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>On Damages</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  For completeness, I proceed to consider the damages that G would have been entitled to, had he established liability.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><i>Causation â recoverability of substantial damages</i></b></p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  In issue is causation in the context of quantum, not liability.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  The tort of false imprisonment is actionable <i>per se</i> without proof of damage.  However, if the person detained would have been lawfully detained, whether due to the following of theproper procedures that should have been followed or an alternative basis whereby he could have been lawfully detained, the persondetained would be entitled to no more than nominal damages.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  The above principle has been approved in the recent judgments of the UK Supreme Court:  in <i>R(WL (Congo)) v Home Secretary</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2011%5d%202%20WLR%20671" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2011] 2 WLR 671</a> at Â§Â§90-91, 93, 95 and 169 per Lord Dyson; Â§Â§222 and 237 per Lord Collins; Â§Â§252, 253 and 256 per Lord Kerr; also (though dissentingon the issue of liability) at Â§335 per Lord Phillips and Â§Â§342 and 361 per Lord Brown; and in <i>Shepherd Masimba Kambadzi v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC//2011/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2011] UKSC 23</a> at Â§Â§74 and 77 per Lady Hale; and Â§Â§88 and 89 per Lord Kerr.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  The dispute between the parties here lies in: (i) which party bears the burden of proving the causal link between the breach ofArt.5(1) of the HKBOR and Gâs detention, or the lack of it, for the purpose of determining Gâs entitlement to substantial damages;and (ii) whether the causal link existed or not.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  Mr Chow SC submitted that the burden of proof is on G.  He relied on <i>Raju Gurung v Secretary for Security and Anor</i>, HCAL 5/2009 (21 August 2009) at Â§Â§61-64, per Saunders J (referring to <i>R (on the application of KB and Ors) v Mental Health Review Tribunal and Anor</i> [2003] 2 All 209 and <i>R (on the application of Greenfield) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%202%20All%20ER%20240" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 2 All ER 240).</a></p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  In <i>Raju Gurung</i>, Saunders J found that whether the detention policies were established or not, it could not be argued that Gurung would have beenreleased at any time prior to his actual release.  Hence the required causal link between the breach of Art.5(1) of the HKBOR andthe detention did not exist on the facts of that case.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Two things should be noted.  First, Saunders J concluded that the claim for damages failed at all, not even entitlement to nominaldamages.  This apparently went further than what Mr Chow SC is submitting here.  Second, the issue of whether the Director or theapplicant should bear the burden of proof was not specifically argued in that case.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  Mr Chow SC also relied on <i>R(KB)</i> which, as mentioned, was referred to in <i>Raju Gurung</i>.    <i>R(KB)</i> was a case where the mental patients applied to the relevant tribunal for the review of their detentions under the Mental HealthAct.  Delays occurred in the hearings of such applications.  The patients issued proceedings for judicial review arising out of thosedelays.  It was held that their Convention rights to speedy hearings had been infringed.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  The basis of the patientsâ claim for damages in <i>R(KB)</i> must be noted.  They contended that had their Convention rights been respected (so that there had been no delay), they could haveobtained favourable decisions after hearing of their applications for review earlier.  It was on that basis that the English Courtsaid (at Â§64):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ a claimant must be able to establish a meritorious case that he would have had an earlier favourable tribunal decision byevidenceâ¦â¦It follows, in my judgment, that a claimant who seeks damages on the basis of an allegation that he would have hada favourable decision at an earlier date if his convention right had been respected must prove his allegation on the balance of probabilitiesâ¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  Back to the present case, the circumstances are different.  Gâs complaint is about the legality of Gâs detention for the lackof certain and accessible grounds and procedure in breach of Art.5(1) of the HKBOR.  In principle, G does have to prove the causallink between the breach and his loss of liberty.  In practice, this should not be difficult, because the question of whether he wouldhave been lawfully detained arises only if there is evidence of the policy or criterion under section 32 or some other alternativelawful procedure <i>at the material time</i> upon which he could have been detained lawfully.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  Between G and the Director, it should be the latter who would be in a position to suggest and to provide evidence of the policyor criterion that should have been applied in line with Art.5(1) of the HKBOR or the alternative procedure for Gâs lawful detention.Had such policy or criterion or alternative lawful procedure been known, it would have remained the burden of G to show that he wouldnevertheless not have been detained, or at least not for the period that he was actually detained.  With those unknown, it wouldbe hard to expect G to contend that he would not have been detained on any other basis.  Nor may the court be expected to concludewhether G would have been lawfully detained in any event.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  Another example is the situation in <i>WL(Congo)</i> and <i>Kambadzi</i>.  In those cases, there was in fact published policy as regards the exercise of the power to detain pending making of the deportationorder and removal.  The claimants were detained unlawfully because the authority had applied an unpublished policy that was inconsistentwith the published policy.  The parties and the court in these English cases were therefore able to consider and conclude whetherthe claimants would have been detained or not, had the known published policy been followed.  In the present case, the detentionpolicy or criterion at the material time of Gâs detention is unknown.  The fact was that the detention policy came into existencein October 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  The case of <i>A</i> (damages) helps to shed some light on this issue too specifically with regard to detention of a person like G under section 32. Though the judgment does not suggest that the issue of causation was specifically argued, it was not that the issue was not consideredat all.  Andrew Cheung J referred extensively to the local case of <i>Pham Van Ngo v AG</i>, unrep., HCA 4895/1990 (1993).  His Lordship described (at Â§47) the detention of the Vietnamese refugees in <i>Pham Van Ngo</i> was unlawful for a technical reason.  The reason was that there were in fact alternative statutory provisions at that time by whichthe refugees could have been lawfully detained.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  His Lordship continued (at Â§53(4)) by finding that unlike the position in <i>Pham Van Ngo</i>, there was no alternative lawful procedure other than section 32 available to the Director or the Secretary to detain the applicantsin the case of <i>A</i>, in the absence of a certain and accessible policy on the exercise of the powers to detain, such policy not coming into existenceuntil October 2008.  The breach in the case of <i>A</i> was therefore not a technical breach.  In other words, the applicants indeed should not have lost their liberty but for the unlawfuldetention under section 32 of the IO.  Causation was thus proved.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  His Lordship concluded that the assessment of damages must take into account the applicantsâ loss of liberty as such as one ofthe element to the claim for non-pecuniary (general) damages.  Indeed his Lordship awarded substantial general damages to all theapplicants in the case of <i>A</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  Mr Chow SC referred to the background of G and his history including his previous criminal convictions in Hong Kong; and suggestedthat detention of G would have in any event been reasonable and appropriate.  This on the face of the matter may accord with commonsense.  But in the case of <i>A</i>, Andrew Cheung J considered some of these as factors relevant to the award of ordinary damages and whether aggravated or exemplarydamages should be awarded as well, rather than the destruction of the causal link and hence the recoverability of substantial damages.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  As there is nothing to show that G would have in any event been lawfully detained during the period of his actual detention, I amsatisfied that he has discharged his burden to prove the causal link between the breach of Art.5(1) of the HKBOR and his detention.In my judgment, but for his failure to establish liability, G would have been entitled to more than nominal damages.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><i>Ordinary damages</i></b></p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  Ordinary damages are compensatory.  They consist of: (i) general damages comprising a first element of compensation for loss ofliberty, and a second element of damage to reputation, injury to feelings and the like, which element was to a substantial extentsubjective; and (ii) special damages for pecuniary loss incurred: see the case of <i>A</i> (damages) at Â§Â§53(3)-(7).</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  In the present case, only non-pecuniary general damages are claimed in the sum of HK$200,000.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  Mr Dykes SC referred to <i>Thompson v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20QB%20498" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] QB 498</a>, <i>Rookes v Barnard</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 1129</a> and <i>R(KB)</i> (above) for âguidance to approachâ to the general level of damages in detention cases.   The first 2 cases were also referredto in the case of <i>A</i> (damages).  Andrew Cheung J considered that as comparables, it should be the local cases that should be referred to; and care shouldbe taken in referring to the level of awards in the English cases in view of the differences in social and economic conditions: seeÂ§Â§53(14)-(15).</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  Mr Dykes SC also referred to the Hong Kong cases of <i>Faridha Sulistyoningsih v Ma Oi Ling, Karen</i>, unrep., DCPI 1575/2005 (4 April 2007) and <i>Godagan Deniyalage Prema C v Cheung Kwan Fong &amp; Anor</i>, unrep., DCCJ 2488/2003 (20 December 2004).  Again both were referred to in the case of <i>A</i> (damages).  But Andrew Cheung J considered the former to be one of peculiar facts while the latter to be one that should be readwith care.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  As Andrew Cheung J said in the case of <i>A</i> (damages) (atÂ§53(15)):</p>    <blockquote>        <p>ââ¦â¦ local awards should be looked at.  However, it cannot be overemphasised that no two cases are the same.  Moreover, evenin comparable cases, one would still have to be satisfied that the previous award was appropriate and right.  It is wrong to usepast cases â even local ones â as if they contained figures set by statutes.  Nor do they act as any straitjacket. Their realuse, particularly when considered collectively, is to provide the court with a general âfeelâ of the appropriate amount of theaward in the case at hand and to act as a cross-check against any significant departure, one way or the other, from the previousawards, or, where it can be observed, the prevailing trend of awardsâ¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  Mr Chow SC submitted that the awards made by his Lordship in the case of <i>A</i> (damages) are the most significant for and relevant to our present purpose.  They were the most recent, given after a careful reviewof relevant local awards in the past, in the context of unlawful detention due to the absence of a certain and accessible detentionpolicy, as well as cases involving conditions of detention largely similar to those in the present case.  I agree.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  Mr Chow SC suggested that of all the applicants, the award to applicant âAâ in the case of A is relatively the most relevantin terms of the period of detention, i.e., 3 months.  I agree.  Prior to and after his detention, G had requested to be repatriated. Evidence shows that he had not objected to the detention while the Director was seen taking steps to push for his removal as soonas practicable.  Upon securing a new travel document and air ticket, removal order was recommended and eventually made.  G changedhis mind and made the CAT claim only then.  He was released on recognisance a month later.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  Prior to the commencement of his administrative detention, G had been lawfully convicted and sentenced to a total of 7 months ofimprisonment.  He was released after serving about 4.5 months.  This serves to somehow diminish the second element of the claim forgeneral damages, namely, damage to reputation, humiliation, shock, injury to feelings as a result of the unlawful detention: seethe case of <i>A</i> (damages) at Â§53(6).</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  Circumstances peculiar to applicant âAâ in the case of <i>A</i> (damages) included the effect of the unlawful detention in impeding the intended marriage, the staging of hunger strike and the depressivecondition during detention.  These peculiar circumstances were absent in the case of G.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  The condition of detention is relevant.  According to his pleading, G was not allowed to make free telephone calls as he wishesat any time and at any place but subject to prior arrangement with welfare officer.  International call was difficult to arrange. It transpires from the evidence that G made 9 free local telephone calls and 1 international call to Pakistan during his detention. There is no record of his request having been turned down.  In court, G admitted that he had made no complaint in this regard.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  It is pleaded that G was provided with no outdoor activities or exercises.  He was not able to enjoy sunlight during the detentionperiod.  In court, G admitted that he was allowed to play ball games for an hour each day in the basketball court.  His complaintbecame that he did not get to do so because the facilities were being used by the other detainees.  He admitted that there was daylightfrom the sky that could be seen 3 to 4 storeys above his head.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  Though G suggested occasions of skin condition caused by spicy food served in the Centre, there is no evidence of significant orprolonged suffering that required treatment.  The documents show that during his attendance at the hospital of the Centre in lateSeptember 2005, medication and ointment were prescribed.  While spice free diet was nevertheless recommended upon his request onthat occasion, there was in fact no medical indication that his skin condition was in fact caused by spicy food provided by the Centre.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  Applicant âAâ in the case of <i>A</i> was awarded HK$80,000 ordinary damages.  Considering the circumstances of G, including those discussed above, I agree with Mr ChowSC that an appropriate award in the present case should be lower.  I would have awarded HK$30,000 ordinary damages to G, had he succeededon liability.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><i>Aggravated damages</i></b></p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  G claims aggravated damages in the sum of HK$100,000.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  Aggravated damages, equally compensatory, could only be awarded where there are aggravating features about the case which wouldresult in the victim not receiving sufficient compensation for the injury suffered if restricted to the ordinary award.  Factorssuch as the manner of the imprisonment and the defendantâs conduct should be taken into account: see the case of <i>A</i> (damages) at Â§Â§53(8)-(9).</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  None of the applicants in the case of <i>A</i> made out the case for the award of aggravated damages. Considering the circumstances of G, including those discussed above, I cometo the same conclusion as regards Gâs claim for aggravated damages.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><i>Exemplary damages</i></b></p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  G claims exemplary damages in the sum of HK$100,000.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  While aggravated damages contain a penal element to the defendant, exemplary damages are definitely punitive.  They could be awardedwhere there was oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional conduct by Government servants: <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> (above). Yet the fact that the detention was unconstitutional <i>per se</i> does not suffice.  Outrageous conduct disclosing malice, fraud, cruelty and the like would normally be expected for an award of suchdamages: see the case of <i>A</i> (damages) at Â§Â§53(10)-(12).</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  Mr Dykes SC submitted that the detention of G was arbitrary because of the lack of a policy as regards the exercise of the poweror review.  This, he continued to say, was worse than negligence leading to an oversight in a particular case.</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  Andrew Cheung J in the case of <i>A</i> (damages) said (atÂ§67) that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt has to be pointed out that although there was at the time no accessible policy on how the discretion to detain would be exercised,so that in terms of art.5(1) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, the detention was âarbitraryâ, it does not necessarily follow thatviewed in light of the individual merits of the case, the detention was capricious or âarbitraryâ in the general public law sense.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  On the evidence, Andrew Cheung J found materials and evidence which tend to justify the Directorâs or the Secretaryâs decisions,at the level of individual merits, to detain the applicants in that case.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  The circumstances of G as referred to by Mr Chow SC were discussed above.  It suffices for me to say that at the level of individualmerits, the decision to detain G was not such that it could be categorised as capricious or malicious.  I find no such elements inthe case of G that warrants an award of exemplary damages.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><i>Constitutional damages</i></b></p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  It is said that G has a cause of action to claim damages for breach of his constitutional rights against arbitrary detention asguaranteed under the Basic Law, the ICCPR and the HKBOR independent from his common law right to claim damages for the tort of falseimprisonment.  This is his claim for constitutional damages or, as labelled in the authorities, vindicatory damages.  He claims HK$400,000on top of the damages for false imprisonment.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  By now, claim for vindicatory damages for breach or violation of constitutional rights distinct from common law damages is novelin the local jurisdiction.  Mr Dykes SC sought support from Canadian and New Zealand authorities for the proposition that the remedyby damages for breach of a constitutional right exists independently of the tort of false imprisonment.</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  The Canadian case of <i>Vancouver (City) v Ward</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2010%5d%202%20SCR%2028" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2010] 2 SCR 28</a> concerned an arrest and strip search in breach of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.  Section 24(1) of the Charter providesthat:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAnyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competentjurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  The Supreme Court held that the section was broad enough to include the remedy of constitutional damages for breach of a claimantâsCharter rights if such remedy was found to be appropriate and just in the circumstances of a particular case.  In his submissions,Mr Dykes SC summarised the test laid down by the Supreme Court in <i>Ward</i> as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)  Proof of a Charter breach: Section 24(1) is remedial and thus a breach of a constitutional right must be proved in order to claimdamages under this head (see <i>Ward</i> at Â§23);</p>        <p>(2)  Justify damages award: by showing that the damages sought should be âappropriate and justâ to the extent that they servea useful function or purpose (see <i>Ward</i> at Â§24).  The function of compensation recognises that breach of an individualâs Charter rights may cause personal loss whichshould be remedied.  The function of vindication recognises that Charter rights must be maintained and cannot be allowed to be withheldaway by attribution.</p>        <p>(3)  Countervailing factors: once the plaintiff establishes that damages are functionally justified, the defendant may establish countervailingfactors which render an award of damages for breach of constitutional rights inappropriate or unjust.  Two considerations are apparent:the existence of alternative remedies and concern for good governance (see <i>Ward</i> at Â§33).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  It is important to note the circumstances in which damages under Art.24(1) of the Charter were awarded in <i>Ward</i> as summarised in Â§68:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe state has not established that alternative remedies are available to achieve the objects of compensation, vindication or deterrencewith respect to the strip search. Mr Ward sued the officers for assault, as well as the City and the Province for negligence. Theseclaims were dismissed and their dismissal was not appealed to this Court. While this defeated Mr Wardâs claim in tort, it did notchange the fact that his right under s.8 of the Charter to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure was violated. No tortaction was available for that violation and a declaration will not satisfy the need for compensation. Nor has the state establishedthat an award of s.24(1) damages is negated by good governance considerations, such as those raised in <i>Mackin</i>.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  The Canadian Supreme Court also discussed the approach to determining the quantum (at Â§Â§ 53-54).  In Â§55, the court said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn assessing s.24(1) damages, the court must focus on the breach of Charter rights as an independent wrong, worthy of compensationin its own right. At the same time, damages under s,24(1) should not duplicate damages awarded under private law causes of action,such as tort, where compensation of personal loss is at issue.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Hence, the court suggested (at Â§ 59):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAs was done here, the claimant may join a s.24(1) claim with a tort claim. It may be useful to consider the tort claim first, sinceif it meets the objects of Charter damages, recourse to s.24(1) will be unnecessary. This may add useful context and facilities thes.24(1) analysis. This said, it is not essential that the claimant exhaust her remedies in private law before bringing a s.24(1)claim.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  Mr Dykes SC also relied on various New Zealand authorities including <i>Simpson v AG</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%203%20NZLR%20667" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 3 NZLR 667</a>; <i>Maharaj v AG of Trinidad and Tobago</i> (No.2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20AC%20385" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] AC 385 (PC)</a>; and <i>Taunoa v AG</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%201%20NZLR%20429" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 1 NZLR 429).</a></p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  In <i>Taunoa</i>, the New Zealand Supreme Court said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â255. In undertaking its task the Court is not looking to punish the state or its officials. For some breaches, however, unlessthere is a monetary award there will be insufficient vindication and the victim will rightly be left with a feeling of injustice.In such cases the Court may exercise its discretion to direct payment of a sum of monetary compensation which will further mark thebreach and provide a degree of solace to the victim which would not be achieved by a declaration or other remedy alone. This is notdone because a declaration is toothless; it can be expected to be salutary, effectively requiring compliance for the future and standingas a warning of the potentially more dire consequences of non-compliance. But, by itself or even with other remedies, a declarationmay not adequately recognise and address the affront to the victim. Although it can be accepted that in New Zealand any governmentagency will immediately take steps to mend its ways in compliance with the terms of a Court declaration, it is the making of a monetaryaward against the state and in favour of the victim which is more likely to ensure that it is brought home to officials that theconduct in question has been condemned by the Court on behalf of society.</p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">258. â¦â¦ it must begin by considering the non-monetary relief which should be given, and having done so it should ask whether thatis enough to redress the breach and the consequent injury to the rights of the plaintiff in the particular circumstances, takinginto account any non-Bill of Rights Act damages which are concurrently being awarded to the plaintiff.  It is only if the Court concludesthat just satisfaction is not thereby being achieved that it should consider an award of Bills of Rights damagesâ¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  Mr Chow SC asked that the New Zealand approach should not be followed.  He said this was the view of Andrew Cheung J in the caseof <i>A</i> (damages) (at Â§ 53(12)).  He was referring to the comment by his Lordship that reference to New Zealand authorities was instructivebut limited in value in this jurisdiction.</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  As I understand, Andrew Cheung J made his comment after noting that the House of Lords decision in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> (above) was followed in the Hong Kong but not in New Zealand where the law on exemplary damages was notably much more liberal.  Thecontext was therefore the approach towards awarding exemplary damages, not whether in principle a distinct award of constitutionaldamages may be awarded in appropriate circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  The Canadian case of <i>Ward</i> and the New Zealand case of <i>Taunoa</i> were considered by the UK Supreme Court in the recent case of <i>WL(Congo)</i> (above).  In that case, Lord Dyson JSC referred to, among other cases, the Privy Council decision in <i>AG of Trinidad and Tobago v Ramanoop</i> (2006) where the concept of vindicatory damages was explained.  The Privy Council (Lord Nicolls) in <i>Ramanoop</i> advised that the expression âpunitive damagesâ or âexemplary damagesâ should be avoided as descriptions of this type of additionalaward of vindicatory damages. (see Â§Â§ 97-98).</p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  Acknowledging that advice, Lord Dyson had the following to say for the purpose of what he had to decide in <i>WL(Congo)</i>, namely, whether the principle of vindicatory damages for violation of constitutional rights should be extended further to the considerationof conventional damages for the tort of false imprisonment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â99. It will be seen, therefore, that the Privy Council endorsed the principle of vindicatory damages for violation of constitutionalrights. Should this principle be extended further?......</p>        <p class="quote">100. It is one thing to say that the award of compensatory damages, whether substantial or nominal, serves a vindicatory purpose:in addition to compensating a claimantâs loss, it vindicates the right that has been infringed. It is another to award a claimantan additional award, not in order to punish the wrongdoer, but to reflect the special nature of the wrong. As Lord Nicolls made clearin <i>Ramanoop</i>, discretionary vindicatory damages may be awarded for breach of the <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of Trinidad and Tobago in order to reflect the sense of public outrage, emphasise the importance of the constitutional right andthe gravity of the breach and deter further breaches. It is a big leap to apply this reasoning to any private claim against the executive.<i>McGregor on Damages</i>, 18<sup>th</sup> ed (2009) states, at para 42-009, that âIt cannot be said to be established that the infringement of a right can in our law leadto an award of vindicatory damagesâ. After referring in particular to the appeals to the Privy Council from Caribbean countries,the paragraph continues: âthe cases are therefore far removed from tortuous claims at home under the common law.â I agree withthese observations. I should add that the reference by Lord Nicolls to reflecting public outrage shows how closely linked vindicatorydamages are to punitive and exemplary damages.</p>        <p class="quote">101. The implications of awarding vindicatory damages in the present case would be far reaching.  Undesirable uncertainty would result. If they were awarded here, then they could in principle be awarded in any case involving a battery or false imprisonment by an armof the state.  Indeed, why limit it to such torts?  And why limit it to torts committed by the state?  I see no justification forletting such unruly horse loose on our law.  In my view, the purpose of vindicating a claimantâs common law rights is sufficientlymet by (i) an award of compensatory damages, including (in the case of strict liability torts) nominal damages where no substantialloss is proved; (ii) where appropriate, a declaration in suitable terms; and (iii) again, where appropriate, an award of exemplarydamages.  There is no justification for awarding vindicatory damages for false imprisonment to any of the FNPs.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  In his speech (Â§Â§ 222-237), Lord Collins referred to the cases of <i>Taunoa</i> and <i>Ward</i> (at Â§Â§ 230-231).  Then his Lordship had this to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â232. The present claims are not, of course, for constitutional damages. Exemplary damages are available where the executive hasacted in a way which is oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutionalâ¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">233. But this is not a case for exemplary damages falling within the first head of <i>Rookes v Barnard</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 1129.</a> Nor do I consider that the concept of vindicatory damages should be introduced into the law of tort. In truth, despite the suggestionsto the contrary in the Privy Council in <i>Ramanoop</i> and <i>Merson</i>, vindicatory damages are skin to punitive or exemplary damagesâ¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">236. To make a separate award for vindicatory damages is to confuse the purpose of damages awards with the nature of the award. Adeclaration or an award of nominal damages, may itself have a vindicatory purpose and effect. So too a conventional award of damagesmay serve a vindicatory purposeâ¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">237.   Neither the minority dicta in <i>Ashley v Chief Constable of Sussex Police</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%20AC%20962" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] AC 962</a> nor the award in <i>Rees v Darlington Memorial Hospital NHK Trust</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%201%20AC%20309" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 1 AC 309</a> justify a conclusion that there is a separate head of vindicatory damages in English law.  Consequently I do not consider that thereis any basis in the present law for such an award.  Nor do I consider that there is a basis in policy for the creation of a headof vindicatory damages at common law, distinct from the existing law of compensatory or exemplary damages.  I would therefore restrictthe remedy in this case to nominal damages for the reasons given by Lord Dyson JSC.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  Lord Kerr Made similar observation about the concept of vindicatory damages (at Â§Â§ 254-256), including:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â255. Lord Nicollsâ recognition that this type of award covered much the same ground as that involved in exemplary or punitivedamages is reflected in the more recent decision of the Privy Council in <i>Takitota v AG</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282009%29%2026%20BHRC%20578" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2009) 26 BHRC 578</a> where, at para 16, Lord Carswell said:</p>        <p class="quote">âit would not be appropriate to make an award both by way of exemplary damages and for breach of constitutional rights.  When thevindicatory function of the latter head of damages has been discharged, with the element of deterrence that a substantial award carrieswith it, the purpose of exemplary damages has largely been achieved.â</p>        <p class="quote">256.   For the reasons given by Lord Dyson JSC an award of exemplary damages is not warranted in these cases.  If there is any scopefor the award of vindicatory damages where exemplary damages are not appropriate, it must be, in my opinion, very limited indeed. Such an award could only be justified where the declaration that a claimantâs right has been infringed provides insufficientlyemphatic recognition of the seriousness of the defendantâs default.  That situation does not arise here.  The defendantâs failureshave been thoroughly examined and exposed.  A finding that those failures have led to the false imprisonment of the appellants constitutesa fully adequate acknowledgement of the defendantâs default.  Since the appellants would have been lawfully detained if the publishedpolicy had been applied to them, I agree that no more than a nominal award of damages is appropriate in their cases.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  Though dissenting, Lord Phillips endorsed what Lord Dyson and Lord Collins said in respect of the concept of vindicatory damages(see Â§335).</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  Reading the authorities, including those cited above, one can observe the scepticism the UK Supreme Court has about the notion ofvindicatory damages for breach of constitutional rights.

As a matter of construction, I agree.</p>    <p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a>  G also relies on section 6 of the HKBORO which reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â (1) the court or tribunal-</p>        <blockquote>          <p class="quote">(a) in proceedings within its jurisdiction in an action for breach of this Ordinance; and</p>          <p class="quote">(b) in other proceedings within its jurisdiction in which a violation or threatened violation of the Bill of Rights is relevant,</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">may grant such remedy or relief, or make such order, in respect of such a breach, violation or threatened violation as it has powerto grant or make in those proceedings and as it considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)No proceedings shall be held to be outside the jurisdiction of any court or tribunal on the ground that they relate to the Billof Rights.â</p>    </blockquote><p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a>  Section 6 of the HKBORO is a court jurisdiction conferring provision, though the extent of remedy or relief that can be grantedand order that can be made under such jurisdiction may well be as wide as that provided in the right of action conferring provisionâ section 24(1) of the Canadian constitution.</p>    <p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a>  What actually provides for a personâs right in case of breach or violation of his rights in the present context to seek compensationis Art.5(5) of the HKBOR (under the HKBORO).

It is agreed on both sides that the article 5 claim adds nothing to the claim at common law if that claim succeeds: see <i>R(I) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%20INLR%20196" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] INLR 196</a>, per Simon Brown LJ at para 8; <i>R (Munjaz) v Mersey Care NHS Trust</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%202%20QB%20395" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 2 QB 395</a>, per Hale LJ ar para 70.  Indeed there are reasons for thinking that ...... So, as I would hold that the appellant succeeds on hiscommon law claim, I propose to say no more about this alternative, except to note that article 5(5) gives a right to compensationwhere there has been a contravention of any of the provisions of the article.  This would have provided the appellant with a remedyif, although there was a breach of the public law duty to conduct reviews, he was not entitled to claim damages at common law forfalse imprisonment.  As it is, for the reasons I have given, I consider that he is entitled to that remedy and at least to nominaldamages.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  Mr Chow SC submitted that insofar as the right not to be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful detention is concerned, the claim forconstitutional damages in the present case in fact adds nothing to Gâs claim for damages for false imprisonment.  As far as thequantum is concerned, there is the further principle against double recovery, even if the separate head of damages is allowed.  Thisis in line with the observation the Canadian Supreme Court (<i>Ward</i> (above) at Â§Â§34-37); and the New Zealand Court (in <i>Simpson</i> (above) at p.678; <i>Taunoa</i> (above) at Â§368).  I agree with him.</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  G can seek comparable remedy.  That G chose not to seek declaratory relief in the present case is his choice.  Borrowing the terminologyof Lord Kerr in <i>WL(Congo)</i> (at Â§252), I see no âdevaluation of the tort of false imprisonmentâ by the conventional award of damages (or, if claimed, adeclaration as regards his unlawful detention).  In my judgment, the case for a separate award of constitutional damages (on topof conventional damages), even if available in principle, is not made out in the circumstances of the present case.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  In summary, I have the following conclusion:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)  Because of section 11 of the HKBORO, the ordinance does not affect the application of the IO to Gâs stay in Hong Kong includingthe exercise of the power of detention under section 32 of the IO.  In the premises, G cannot found his claim for unlawful detentionon the basis of Art.5(1) of the HKBOR.</p>        <p>(2)  As a non-Hong Kong resident, by virtue of Art.41 of the Basic Law, G is entitled to enjoy the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongresidents, including those under Arts.28 and 35 of the Basic Law, as prescribed and in accordance with law, such law including theimmigration reservation to the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong under Art.39 of the Basic Law and section 11 of the HKBORO.  In thepremises, G cannot found his claim for unlawful detention on the basis of Arts.28 and 35 of the Basic Law.</p>        <p>(3)  In the premises, Gâs claim must fail and should be dismissed.  But for that, G would have been entitled to claim for unlawfuldetention under section 32(2A) of the IO for the lack of certain and accessible grounds and procedure required by Art.5(1) of theHKBOR.</p>        <p>(4)  G would have been entitled to substantial damages, which would be ordinary damages in the sum of HK$30,000.  There would havebeen no award of aggravated or exemplary damages in the circumstances of the present case.</p>        <p>(5)  Even assuming that G were entitled to found his claim on the breach of his constitutional rights under Arts.28, 35 and 41 ofthe Basic Law, there is no basis for making a separate award for constitutional damages for such breach in the circumstances of thepresent case.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Order</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  Failing on liability, Gâs claim is dismissed.  I make a nisi order that G shall pay the Directorâs costs of this action, includingany costs reserved, to be taxed if not agreed.

Among other things, the Court of Appealagreed with Hartmann J in that the concept of non-refoulement of refugees has developed into the customary international law (Â§Â§45-67);but the same has not attained the status of a peremptory norm (Â§Â§73-78).  The Court of Appeal also agreed with Hartmann J thatwhatever the position on the international stage, the applicants (appellants) would not be able to assert rights under a customaryinternational law as it is clearly overridden by domestic legislation to the contrary, namely, the IO (Â§Â§79-96).</p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2011/202.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
