the Admiralty action inrem against âThe ship or vessel âHUA TIAN LONGâ of the Peopleâs Republic of China flagâ resulting in the arrest a few dayslater of that vessel in Hong Kong harbour. How, then, has the present situation arisen?</p>    <p class="heading">The factual background</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The principal facts leading to this case are essentially undisputed. This action arises out of an alleged breach of contract onthe part of the defendant owners of the âHUA TIAN LONGâ which vessel, say the plaintiff, failed to honour its commitment undera Memorandum of Agreement entered into by the plaintiff with the Guangdong Salvage Bureau (âGZSâ) to make available this vesselâ which is the largest floating derrick crane-barge based in Asia â to work on offshore Malaysian and Vietnamese projects (âtheNewfieldâ and âTalismanâ projects) for the installation of pipelines and oil platforms.</p><br clear="all" />    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Consequent upon the non-appearance of the âHUA TIAN LONGâ â which, it transpires, in the period in question was under charterto China National Overseas Oil Company, which refused to release the vessel for the plaintiffâs use â the plaintiff says thatit was unable properly to complete the Newfield and Talisman projects, which it had been awarded on 16 January 2007, and hence itnow claims damages against defendant owners in the sum of some hundreds of millions of US dollars for fraudulent misrepresentationand/or breach of contract.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  On 21 April 2008 the plaintiff invoked the Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court. The writ was nailed to the mast, and the bailiffarrested the âHUA TIN LONGâ in Hong Kong waters, this massive lifting barge earlier having been sent from its Guangzhou baseto Hong Kong to raise from the sea bed a Ukrainian tug which some weeks earlier had been in collision with a container vessel inthe outer reaches of the harbour, and had sunk with tragic loss of life.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  By order dated 30 April 2008 Reyes J dismissed the defendantsâ application for setting aside the writ and this action, and forthe release of the vessel from arrest.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In the skeleton argument of counsel for owners which was placed before Reyes J at this hearing to set aside the arrest, the followingappears at paragraph 3 thereof, under the heading âSovereign Immunityâ:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âGZS is a Bureau of the Ministry of Communications.

However, GZS reserve the right to do so at a future stage.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Some five weeks later, on 9 May 2008, GZS ultimately secured the release of the âHUA TIAN LONGâ by arranging bail bonds to beposted on its behalf by China Merchantsâ Bank; in the event, the application for bail bond(s) was hotly disputed at hearings bothbefore this court and in the Court of Appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  At first instance the Order of 9 May 2008 was for the provision of bail in the sum of US$65 million, which sum, consequent uponthe admission of fresh evidence, was varied by the Court of Appeal to the sum of US$122,412.000: see  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%204%20HKLR%20719" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 4 HKLR 719</a> (1<sup>st</sup> instance) and  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%204%20HKLR%20745" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 4 HKLR 745 (CA).</a></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Having furnished bail and thus securing the release of the vessel by Order of Reyes J on 4 June 2008, the defendants now seek anorder granting immunity from suit â hence the present application commanding this judgment.</p>    <p class="heading">Chronology of the proceedings to-date</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Whilst a full and highly detailed chronology of this litigation to-date has been supplied to the court during the course of thishearing, it may be worth sketching in the principal procedural landmarks, since this information is germane to legal argument asto the sustainability of this application in the context of waiver and submission to the jurisdiction.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Subsequent to the issue of the writ <i>in rem</i> on 21 April 2008, and the failure of the application to set aside the writ, the defendants acknowledged service of the writ on 2May 2008. Thereafter followed the decision, and subsequent appeal, as to the amount of bail to be posted, the writ was amended on15 May, and on 22 May 2008 a Statement of Claim was filed; some idea of the scale of the case can be gleaned from the figures claimed:the sum claimed in damages variously is pleaded at US$190 million in wasted costs/expenditure, US$96 million in damages for fraudulentrepresentation, and a like sum in damages for breach of contract.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On 31 July 2008 a Defence and Counterclaim was filed â the sum of almost US$38 million is claimed in damages for wrongful arrestâ and on 16 September 2008 a Reply and Defence to Counterclaim was filed; Further and Better Particulars of the Statement of Claimwere sought on 3 November 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Discovery by list took place between the parties over the period 13 February 2009 to 6 October 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  On 12 May 2009 a Case Management summons was issued, resulting in orders from Reyes J on 7 July (as to case management) and on 11September 2009 (as to service of witness statements), and on 26 May 2009 the plaintiff gave notice of payment into court of securityfor costs in the sum of HK$5,812,800; provision for further security for costs was made by order of this court dated 1 February 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Exchange of witness statements of fact and on quantum took place on 2 October 2009, and on 6 October 2009 a notice was issued seekingto set down the case for trial.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  After due consultation with the court and counsel, trial dates were fixed for a 20 day hearing commencing on 5 July 2010 and concludingon 30 July 2010, but these dates clearly now are in jeopardy given the issuance of the defendantsâ âimmunity summonsâ on 21October 2009; it appears tolerably clear that whatever this courtâs decision upon the present application, either side will embarkupon the appellate chain in circumstances in which very large sums of money are claimed, in addition to the practical significanceand legal importance of the point which is central to this debate.</p>    <p class="heading">Evidence at the hearing of this application</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  For the plaintiff affirmation evidence was filed by Ms Hui Kit Yu, who swore two affirmations, and Mr Lin Feng.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Ms Hui is a trainee solicitor of M/s Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan, which firm acts for the plaintiff, who provides evidence of thefactual background, identifying the defendants and their business activities, and commenting upon various other aspects of this case,including that of waiver and the issue of submission to the jurisdiction; Dr Lin Feng is a Professor at the City University Schoolof Law, and gave evidence to the court <i>qua</i> expert on Chinese law in the context of the claimed immunity from suit.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  For the defendants primary evidence was provided by Mr Fu Shi Qun, who swore five affirmations in support of the application.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr Fu is an officer of the defendant, GZS, who has been with that entity since 1980 â he says that he is the Manager of its BusinessAdministration Office.

I take each of these aspects in turn.</p>    <p class="heading">(i)  <u>Sovereign immunity</u></p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The concept of âsovereign immunityâ in public international law reflects the maxim <i>par in parem non habet</i> <i>imperium</i> (âequals have no authority over one anotherâ), and is underpinned by the concepts of comity, equality, independence and dignityof individual states. Thus no state can intervene in the affairs of another state by claiming jurisdiction over that state: see,for example, <i>Brownlie, Principles of Public</i> <i>International Law</i>, <i>(7<sup>th</sup> ed.),</i> at 324-326; <i>Oppenheimâs International</i> <i>Law (9<sup>th</sup> ed.),</i> Vol 1, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a>, at paras 109, 342-342.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In post-war years the âclassicâ doctrine of absolute sovereign immunity has been modified to reflect the division between actsof third party states whereby a state could not lawfully be impleaded in the courts of this jurisdiction in relation to acts in itssovereign capacity (<i>acta jure imperii</i>), but wherein such immunity from suit did not prevail in respect of those acts of a foreign state of a private law or commercialcharacter (<i>acta jure gestionis</i>): see for example <i>Trendtex Trading Corp v</i> <i>Central Bank of Nigeria</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%201%20QB%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 1 QB 529</a>, at 555A-557B, per Lord Denning MR, <i>I Congreso del Partido</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20AC%20244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 AC 244</a>, at 262A-263D, per Lord Wilberforce, and, for a Hong Kong decision on the point, wherein a foreign state was impleaded by the arrestof one of its trading vessels, and wherein the act in issue was classified as <i>âjure</i> <i>gestionisâ</i>, see the case of <i>The Philippine Admiral</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20AC%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] AC 373</a>, a Privy Council decision on appeal from Hong Kong, wherein their Lordships adopted the ârestrictiveâ approach in relation toactions <i>in rem</i>. Very recently, also, in the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in <i>FG Hemisphere Associates LLC v</i> <i>Democratic Republic of The Congo &amp; ors</i>, unrep., Judgment dated 10 February 2010, in a wide-ranging and scholarly judgment Stock JA took the opportunity to review the developmentof the case law relating to absolute immunity and the encroachment of the so-called ârestrictive doctrineâ, and to relate thesetwin concepts to the current Hong Kong position post-1997.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  For present purposes, however, there is no need further to embark upon the âpureâ sovereign immunity analysis. Although MissCheng SC opened on the issue and initially maintained the viability of the point, by the end of the hearing it was accepted by leadingcounsel that the concept has no application in the instant case, given that there is here no question of the impleading of a <i>foreign</i> sovereign state.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  To the contrary, the fact situation is that it is alleged that the âHUA TIAN LONGâ was owned by the Guangdong Salvage Bureau,a state-owned enterprise established on 4 October 1989, and, consequent upon a 2003 reform, now is owned by the Guangzhou SalvageBureau of the Ministry of Communication, and thus ultimately by the Ministry of Communication of the PRC.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Hence, the situation with which this court now is faced is the arrest of a vessel ultimately owned by the Central Peopleâs Governmentof the PRC, which after 1 July 1997 exercises sovereign power over the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, so that this caseinvolves the purported impleading of Hong Kongâs own sovereign under the âone country, two systemsâ principle, and not thatof a foreign state.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  For the purpose of the present argument, however, this does not mean that all notions of âsovereign immunityâ are rendered redundant,given that Miss Cheng SC for the defendant has argued in the alternative that this case is classifiable within the rubric of thatwhich she chose to term âmutated sovereign immunityâ; in the discussion following I hope I may be forgiven if I do not adoptthat inelegant term and substitute therefor the adjective âmodifiedâ.</p>    <p class="heading">(ii)  â<u>Modifiedâ sovereign immunity</u></p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  I am in two minds as to whether this head should be regarded simply as a sub-division of the âcrown immunityâ argument, uponwhich this judgment subsequently concentrates, as opposed to Miss Chengâs categorization as a separate sub-head of sovereign immunity.However, I do not think that classification <i>per se</i> greatly matters, since in any event I do <i>not</i> favour the substance of this argument.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The proposition as to âmodifiedâ sovereign immunity appears to emanate from a line of Canadian cases, wherein the Canadian provincialcourts were considering the proposition as to whether sovereign immunity could be applied between different jurisdictions <i>within</i> the same state, namely the sovereign state of Canada.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  As Mr Sussex has pointed out, the idea that a province could rely on sovereign immunity to resist the jurisdiction of the courtsof another province appears to have originated in the English Court of Appeal case of <i>Mellenger v New Brunswick Development Corp.,</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%202%20All%20ER%20593" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 2 All ER 593</a>, a case in which the defendant corporation objected to service upon it in England on the ground that it was an arm of the governmentof New Brunswick, and thus entitled to âsovereign immunityâ in England, although it is unclear why this should have been thecase; the reasoning of the court (see Lord Denning MR, <i>op cit.,</i> at 595-596) appears to have been based on the fact that the Canadian constitution recognized the independence and autonomy of eachprovincial government under the Crown, and thus that the province of New Brunswick was a sovereign state in its own right and entitled,if it so wished, to claim sovereign immunity.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  However, whatever may be the position when a province claims sovereign immunity <i>outside</i> Canada, it is not easy to understand why this principle should be applied inter-provincially <i>within</i> Canada, albeit in reliance on <i>Mellenger</i> a series of Canadian cases have concluded that one province may utilize sovereign immunity to resist the jurisdiction of the courtsof another province: see for example <i>Western Surety Co v Elk Valley</i> <i>Logging Ltd</i> (1985), 23 DLR (4<sup>th</sup>) 464 [BCSC]; <i>Phillips (Guardian ad litem) v Beary</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2029%20CPC%20%283d%29%20258" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994), 29 CPC (3d) 258</a> [BCSC];

Her Majesty in the right of the Province of Saskatchewan is not a foreign Sovereign in her MajestyâsCourt of Queenâs Bench for Manitoba.â</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In my judgment the latter clearly is the better view, which coincides with that expressed by Hunter JA in the Alberta Court of Appealin the case of <i>Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation v Canada (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development et al)</i>  <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2001/2001abca112/2001abca112.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] ABCA 112</a>, a case involving a dispute between a British Columbia Hydro Electric Company and the native Athabasca Chipewyan, who were claimingthat a dam constructed on the Peace River â which flowed from British Columbia into northern Albertaâs Peace Athabasca Deltaâ by British Columbia Hydro had altered the natural flow of the Peace River and deleteriously had affected the ecosystem of theDelta: hence the claim by the indigenous Chipewyan for a declaration, injunction and damages against, <i>inter alia</i>, the Queen in right of the Province of British Columbia and British Columbia Hydro.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The issue on the appeal was whether the defendants could be sued in the Alberta Court of Queenâs Bench, with the court decidingthat whereas British Columbia Hydro was amenable to suit, the Queen in right of British Columbia definitely was not.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  In the course of its decision the court specifically considered the <i>Western Surety Co</i> line of cases, drawing a firm distinction between sovereign or state immunity and crown immunity, and concluded that sovereign immunityhad no application inter-provincially. In his judgment Hunter JA aptly observed (<i>op cit.,</i> at para 45):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSovereign or state immunity is a concept distinct from Crown immunity.  According to S.A. Williams &amp; A.L.C. de Mestral, <i>An Introduction to International Law,</i> 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1987), at 137, it âprevents a foreign state or its head from being impleaded in the domestic courtsof another state without its consent.â  A foreign state may submit to the jurisdiction of a court but compulsion cannot be usedto achieve this result.  The rationale for sovereign immunity is that, since states are equal, one cannot exercise jurisdiction overanother.  It will be immediately apparent that, while sovereign and Crown immunity are distinct concepts, there is a strong resemblancebetween themâ¦â</p>        <p>and further (<i>op cit.,</i> at para 55):</p>        <p class="quote">âIn my view, the use of the Mellenger principle in an interprovincial context is misplaced.  To the extent that the rationale underlyingsovereign immunity has any importance in a federal state, that function is already fulfilled by Crown immunity.  The fact that someCanadian courts confuse the two concepts suggests that they play the same role.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  I respectfully agree with and adopt this reasoning, which in the Hong Kong context is reinforced by the terms of the provisionsof the Basic Law of the HKSAR, and the implementation of the âone country, two systemsâ principle.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>   <i>Article 1</i> of the Basic Law makes it clear that the HKSAR is âan inalienable partâ of the PRC, <i>Article 7</i> that the land and natural resources within the Hong Kong SAR âshall be State propertyâ, whilst <i>Article 12</i> reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âThe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be a local administrative region of the Peopleâs Republic of China, which shallenjoy a high degree of autonomy and come directly under the Central Peopleâs Government.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Hence, in the context of the relationship between the PRC and Hong Kong, the concept of âsovereign immunityâ as generally understoodis a logical misnomer. Doctrinally such immunity fundamentally is premised upon considerations of comity and mutual respect for thedignity of foreign sovereign states, and should not apply in any form within the same state.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  It follows, therefore, that in my view the primary issue in this case, at least in relation to the concept of immunity from suit,focuses upon the application of principles of âcrown immunityâ.</p>    <p class="heading">(iii)  <u>Crown immunity</u></p>    <p>(a)  <u>The concept</u></p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Whilst sovereign immunity is based on the notional equality of states, âcrown immunityâ originated from the concept of the inequalityof the ruling and the ruled, as represented by the maxim âthe sovereign can do no wrongâ; thus the Crown is not bound by statuteunless expressly named or by necessary implication, and at common law the Crown enjoys immunity from being sued in its own courts:see <i>Halsburyâs Laws, 4<sup>th</sup> ed.</i>, Vol 8, at 598; <i>Halsburyâs</i> <i>Laws, 2006 Reissue</i>, Vol 5(1) at para 90.0262.

as a consequence, as Mr Sussex SC submitted during this hearing, no doubt it would be possiblefor a corporation to enjoy immunity for one purpose and not for another.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  In terms of crown immunity at common law, the other major inroad has been its substantial curtailment by statutory intervention.Thus, in England the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 conferred statutory rights on individuals to enable the bringing of personal claimsin contract against the Crown.</p>    <p class="heading">(b)  <u>The Hong Kong position</u></p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Given Hong Kongâs particular constitutional history, the position of Crown immunity under Hong Kong law must be considered bothpre- and post-July 1, 1997.</p>    <p class="heading">Pre-1 July 1997</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  So far as the position prior to the handover is concerned, Miss Cheng SC helpfully has produced a detailed overview, noting thatabsent statutory intervention Hong Kong followed common law principles; she usefully has traced the evolution of the statutory rightto sue the Crown as first provided for by the <i>Code of Civil Procedure</i> <i>(Ordinance No 13 of 1873),</i> which laid down that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âAll claims against the Government of the Colony of the same nature as claims within the provisions of âThe Petitions of RightAct 1860â may, with the consent of the Governor, be preferred in the Supreme Court in a suit instituted by the claimant as plaintiffagainst âThe Attorney Generalâ as defendantâ.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Thereafter, other Civil Procedure Ordinances altered this statutory right, and subsequently were replaced by the first editionsof the Rules of the Supreme Court; thus sections 479 and 480 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Ordinance No 3 of 1901) became OrderXIX, Rules 2 and 3 respectively.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Under this regime, a claim could be made against the Crown subject to the consent of the Governor; clearly, also, the âCrownâin this context referred only to âthe Government of the Colonyâ, and not to the English Crown.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  As Miss Cheng SC points out, in terms of Crown immunity the old statutory (and discretionary) regime subsequently was repealed followingthe enactment of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Proceedings Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300">Cap. 300</a>, (âCPOâ), which substantially mirrored the 1947 English legislation, and which came into force with effect from 1 November1957. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3</a> of the CPO, under the title âRight to sue the Crownâ, reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âWhere any person has a claim against the Crown after the commencement of this Ordinance and, if this Ordinance had not been passed,the claim might have been enforced, subject to the consent of the Governor, under the Rules of the Supreme Court, or might have beenenforced by the proceedings provided by any statute ceasing to have effect in the Colony by virtue of this Ordinance, the claim maybe enforced as of right, and without the consent of the Governor, by proceedings taken against the Crown for that purpose in accordancewith the provisions of the Ordinance.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Miss Cheng accepts, and with respect clearly she is right so to do, that whilst âthe Crownâ was not defined under the CPO, theterm as used under the CPO referred only to the Crown in right of the then Colony of Hong Kong, and <i>not</i> to the British Crown.</p>    <p class="heading">After 1 July 1997</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  It is at this juncture that the parties to this application cease to be in agreement. It is also at this juncture that the argumentbecomes a little more complex.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  In short, the plaintiffâs position is that the common law concept of âCrown immunityâ did not form part of the common lawof Hong Kong immediately prior to the handover, and thus, by reason of Article 18 and Article 8 of the Basic Law, did not representthe common law âpreviously in forceâ in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Article 18 reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âThe laws in force in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be this Law, the laws previously in force in Hong Kong asprovided for in Article 8 of this Law, and the laws enacted by the legislature of the Regionâ</i></p>        <p>whilst Article 8 provides:</p>        <p class="quote"><i>âThe laws previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and customarylaw shall be maintained, except for any that contravene this Law, and subject to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong KongSpecial Administrative Region.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Thus, maintained Mr Sussex, the âshort answerâ to this entire application is that the common law concept of âcrown immunity/privilegeâdid not represent the common law in force in Hong Kong at the time of the handover to the PRC, given that the common law had beenmodified and amended, at least since 1 November 1957, by the CPO, the long title of which states that its purpose was âTo amendthe law relating to the civil liabilities and rights of the Crown and to civil proceedings by and against the Crownâ¦â</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Furthermore, he argued, even if, contrary to his primary position, any aspect of the common law relating to âcrown immunityâcould be demonstrated to have survived notwithstanding enactment in Hong Kong of the CPO, such common law privilege would <i>not</i> apply to the CPG, given that by virtue of sections 2A(3) and (4) and of paragraph 2 of Schedule 8 of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap. 1</a>, the word âcrownâ as employed in the common law concept of âcrown immunityâ must be construed as a reference <i>solely</i> to the Government of the HKSAR, and thus by necessary inference did <i>not</i> encompass the CPG.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  In order to buttress his argument Mr Sussex further drew the attention of the court to Article 19 of the Basic Law, which lays downthat the courts of Hong Kong should have jurisdiction over all cases in the SAR, save that the restrictions on their jurisdictionimposed by the legal system and principles previously in force were to be maintained, and that, more particularly, Article 19 alsoprovided that âthe courts of the HKSAR shall have no jurisdiction over acts of state such as defence and foreign affairsâ, andthat a certificate from the Chief Executive concerning acts of state should be binding on the courts whenever such specific issuesarose in the adjudication of cases.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  The inevitable inference was that, save as aforesaid, in cases not involving such âacts of stateâ, the courts of Hong Kong havejurisdiction over the CPG.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Miss Cheng SC disagreed with this analysis.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Her position was two-fold: first, that as a matter of constitutional arrangement, the âcrown immunityâ of the Central PeopleâsGovernment (âCPGâ) cannot be taken away by domestic legislation of the Hong Kong SAR (in the sense, I assume, of applicationof the provisions of the CPO); and second, and in the alternative, as a matter of construction of the CPO, the term âthe Crownâdoes not cover the CPG.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  As to the first proposition, she noted that the Hong Kong SAR is established under Article 31 of the PRC <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> as a âlocal administrative regionâ of the PRC enjoying a high degree of autonomy under the direct control of the CPG [Articles2 and 12 of the Basic Law], and that Article 81 of the Basic Law in turn established the judiciary of Hong Kong; therefore, she said,the Courts of the HKSAR are also courts of the PRC, albeit enjoying power of final adjudication within the SAR, save for the finalpower of interpretation of the Basic Law, and that by drawing an analogy from the common law principle of âthe king can do no wrongand cannot be sued in his own courtsâ, the CPG â being in effect the âCrownâ of the PRC â cannot be sued in the courtsof the HKSAR.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Alternatively, she argued that, whilst no amendment had been made to the CPO,it was clear that the term âthe Crownâ under theCPO no longer could be construed as a reference to the Crown in âthe Colony of Hong Kongâ, and referred the court to Schedule8 of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap 1</a></i> (as added by the <i>Hong Kong Reunification Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/2601">Cap 2601</a></i>,) which provided that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>â1.  Any reference in any provision to Her Majesty, the Crown, the British Government or the Secretary of State (or to similar names,terms or expressions) where the content of the provision</i><i>  â</i></p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"><i>(a)  </i> <i>relates to title to land in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region;</i></p>            <p class="quote"><i>(b)  </i> <i>involves affairs for which the Central Peopleâs Government of the Peopleâs Republic of China has responsibility;</i></p>            <p class="quote"><i>(c)  </i> <i>involves the relationship between the Central Authorities and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,</i></p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>shall be construed as a reference to the Central Peopleâs Government or other competent authorities of the Peopleâs Republic ofChina.</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>2.  Any reference in any provision to Her Majesty, the Crown, the British Government or the Secretary of State (or to similar names,terms and expressions) in contexts other than those specified in section 1 shall be construed as a reference to the Government ofthe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Subparagraphs 1(a) and (c) were not engaged in the present situation, said Miss Cheng, and at first blush it was unclear to thatwhich paragraph 1(b) referred. However, Article 1 of Annex 3 of the of the âDecision of the Standing Committee of the NationalPeopleâs Congress on Treatment of the Laws Previously in Force in Hong Kong in accordance with Article 160 of the Basic Law ofthe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the Peopleâs Republic of Chinaâ, which bound the Hong Kong courts, had resultedin the addition of Schedule 8 of the IGCO, and in the circumstances she submitted that subparagraph 1(b) of Schedule 8 must be confinedto the affairs for which the CPG had responsibility under the Basic Law, namely the foreign affairs and the defence of Hong Kong:see Articles 13 and 14 of the Basic Law.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Accordingly, since the present case had nothing to do with foreign affairs or the defence of the HKSAR, it fell outwith subparagraph1(b), and thus, for present purposes, âthe Crownâ under the CPO must refer only to the Government of the HKSAR, and not to theCPG: see paragraph 2 of Schedule 8 of the IGCO, also Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2010, Vol 1, at M/N 77/0/2.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  In this latter interpretation, I apprehend, Miss Cheng had reached the like conclusion as Mr Sussex, albeit to facilitate a differentargument.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  So far as Miss Cheng was concerned, any invitation to construe the CPO in a way which justified the Hong Kong courts invoking jurisdictionover the CPG was unconstitutional and must be rejected; whilst as to the Article 19 argument, should Mr Sussex be correct, Miss Chengobserved, it would follow that in terms of matters falling outwith âacts of stateâ, the CPG could invoke neither Crown immunitynor sovereign immunity, a result which would place the CPG in an inferior position even to <i>foreign</i> sovereigns, which (subject to recognized exceptions and waivers) at least would be in a position to plead sovereign immunity.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  At bottom, the fundamental difference between the parties on the hotly disputed issue of Crown immunity after 1 July 1997 appearedto boil down to whether there remained any common law doctrine of âcrown immunityâ subsisting in Hong Kong immediately priorto the handover of sovereignty to the Peopleâs Republic of China.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  The plaintiffâs position remained that no such common law Crown immunity subsisted which could survive the handover and the enactmentof the Basic Law; the defendantâs argument, to the contrary, was that by reason of the survival of the common law doctrine theCPG could <i>not</i> be impleaded in the Hong Kong courts in circumstances such as those prevailing in the instant case.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  At the conclusion of the oral hearing of this application, Miss Cheng requested, and obtained, leave of the court to enable theparties to put in supplemental written submissions on the point.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  I have read and reflected upon these additional submissions, which speak for themselves and which, with respect to the considerableextra effort involved, I am not sure add substantially to the detailed arguments initially adumbrated by either side. Nor do I wishto burden this judgment with further extensive narrative recitation.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  For the plaintiff, Mr Sussex stressed the significance of Article 19 of the Basic Law, which, as he put it, âprovides for a selfâcontainedand comprehensive regime as to when and in what circumstances the Central Peopleâs Government would be immune from jurisdictionin the Hong Kong courtsâ; his submission was that the CPG would only be immune from jurisdiction as to acts of state, thereby,he suggested, mirroring section 9 of the CPO which preserved the prerogative powers of the Hong Kong Government. He also observedthat the present case cannot fall within the scope of the term âact of stateâ, as defined in Article 19, given its undisputednature as a pure commercial transaction, namely the putative chartering of the derrick-barge âHUA TIAN LONGâ.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  A recurrent theme in Miss Chengâs written response to the plaintiffâs supplemental submissions understandably lay in its emphasison the new constitutional order, and the fact that the Hong Kong SAR, being a local administrative region directly under the CPG,the new âCrownâ, cannot implead the CPG in the absence of the express consent of the CPG. Her case essentially was that the commonlaw principle that the domestic court had no jurisdiction over the institution that created it, and that in substance nothing hadchanged, notwithstanding Hong Kongâs new âsovereignâ, which no longer was the British Crown but the PRC, acting through theCPG.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Miss Cheng maintained that the British Crown had enjoyed âcrown immunityâ prior to the handover to the CPG, and that obviouslycrown immunity represented an attribute of the British Crownâs sovereignty over her colonies, so that unless expressly abrogatedby statute â which by virtue of the Royal Instructions was outwith the powers of a colonial legislature â such âcrown immunityâhad continued, and that the CPO was relevant solely to actions against the colonial government. Accordingly, as she put it, âwhicheverway one looks at the issue of crown immunity, the Hong Kong SAR courts have no jurisdiction over the sovereignâ.</p>    <p class="heading">Decision on the âCrown immunityâ debate</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  In my view Miss Cheng is correct in her arguments, notwithstanding the forensic skill which Mr Sussex brought to bear in his analysis.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  I do <i>not</i> accept that with the enactment of the CPO in Hong Kong in 1957 that, at a stroke, the concept of âcrown immunityâ â by whichI mean the immunity of the British Crown in the Hong Kong courts â no longer formed part of the common law. To the contrary, inmy view âcrown immunityâ properly so-called at all times remained an attribute of the British Crownâs sovereignty over hercolonies, among which numbered Hong Kong prior to 1 July 1997, and the establishment of the new constitutional order did not alterthis position. Constitutionally one âsovereignâ was replaced by another, and I see nothing in the Basic Law, which today formsHong Kongâs constitution, to gainsay that proposition.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  I am buttressed in this instinctive view by the opinion of Chan CJHC (as he then was) in <i>HKSAR v Ma Wai Kwan</i> <i>David &amp; ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20HKLRD%20761" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] HKLRD 761 (CA)</a> â a case to which Miss Cheng drew the courtâs attention in her subsequent supplemental written submissions â who consideredthat even in colonial times the Hong Kong courts lacked the legal basis to challenge acts of the British Crown; the learned ChiefJudge noted (at 780):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI would accept the argumentsâ¦that regional courts have no jurisdiction to query the validity of any legislation or acts passedby the sovereign.  There is simply no legal basis to do so.  It would be difficult to imagine that the Hong Kong courts could, whilestill under British rule, challenge the validity of an act of Parliament passed in UK or an act of the Queen in Council which hadeffect on Hong Kongâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  This appears also to be the view taken by Mr Benny Tai in his article âThe Jurisdiction of the Courts of the Hong Kong SpecialAdministrative Regionâ, <i>Law Lectures for Practitioners 1998,</i> wherein he observed (at 83-84) that the CPO did not authorize proceedings against the Crown under that Ordinance âotherwise thanin her capacity as the Crown in Hong Kongâ, and that therefore:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦the courts of Hong Kong had jurisdiction to receive cases against the acts of the sovereign if they were acts of the Crown actingin her capacity as the executive authority of Hong Kong but not in any other capacities.  If the act was committed by the Crown inher capacity as the executive authority of the United Kingdom, the courts of Hong Kong would have no jurisdiction to receive a casethough the party might initiate a proceeding against the Crown in the United Kingdom in the English Courts under the Crown ProceedingsAct.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  It seems to me that the key to unravelling the present argument lies in the fact that prior to the handover as a matter of constitutionalstructure effectively there were two âCrownsâ in Hong Kong â Her Majestyâs government in the then colony and Her Majestyâsgovernment in the United Kingdom â and that whilst the CPO enabled proceedings to be brought against the government of Hong Kong,it had no effect on, and did not remove, the concept of the âcrown immunityâ of the Queen in the UK. Or, as the editors of <i>Halsburyâs Laws of England, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. Reissue</i>, Vol. 6, para 817 express the position, âHer Majestyâs government in a colony is to be regarded as distinct from Her Majestyâsgovernment in the United Kingdom.â</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  It follows from the foregoing that I do <i>not</i> accept the plaintiffâs proposition that after enactment of the CPO, the British Crown enjoyed sovereign, but not crown, immunityâ albeit now, in the courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the plea of sovereign immunity is, of course, availableto the British Crown.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  The short point is that in my view âcrown immunityâ in its true sense never was removed by the CPO, that as a concept importedfrom customary international law it continued to exist at common law unaffected by the CPO until the handover to the new sovereignpower, the PRC, which in turn must enjoy the like crown immunity hitherto accorded to the British Crown, as opposed to, as Miss Chengputs it, the âColonial Crownâ.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Nor do I consider that the four authorities to which reference is made in the plaintiffâs supplemental submissions â namely<i>Duff Development v Government of Kelantan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1924%5d%20AD%20797" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1924] AD 797</a>, <i>Statham v</i> <i>Statham</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1912%5d%20P%2092" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1912] P 92</a>, <i>Sayce v Ameer Ruler of Bahawalpur</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1952%5d%202%20QB%20390" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1952] 2 QB 390</a>, and <i>Sultan of Johore v Abubakar Tunku Aris Bendahar</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1952%5d%20AC%20318" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1952] AC 318</a> â to be of assistance; clearly they are distinguishable on their facts, being concerned only with whether sovereign immunity wouldlie, and shed no light on the manner in which the courts of a colonial/protected territory would treat the ultimate sovereign power.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  If the foregoing be correct, as I consider that it is, effectively that is the end of the doctrinal element of the âimmunity debateâ.In my view âcrown immunityâ subsists and thus now can be invoked as a matter of Hong Kong law.

However, she also noted that this application had been mountedsolely on the basis of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 12A(2)(h)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap 4</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 25</a> of the CPO provides that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âNothing in this Ordinance shall authorize proceedings in rem in respect of any claim against the Crown, or the arrest, detentionor sale of any ships or aircraft belonging to Her Majesty or the Government, or of any cargo or other property belonging to the Crown,or give to any person any lien on any such ship, aircraft, cargo or other property.â</i></p>        <p>Similarly, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12e.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 12E(2)(c)</a>  and (4) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap. 4</a> respectively provide:</p>        <p class="quote"><i>â(2)  Nothing in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12a.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 12A</a> to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12d.html" class="autolink_findacts">12D</a> shall â</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>(c)  authorize proceedings in rem in respect of any claim against the Crown, or the arrest, detention or sale of any of Her Majestyâsships or Her Majestyâs aircraft or Her Majestyâs hovercraft, or, subject to any regulations made by the Governor, of any ship,aircraft, hovercraft, cargo or other property belonging to the Crown or the Government of Hong Kongâ¦</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>(4)  In this section â</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>âHer Majestyâs shipsâ(</i><i>å¥³çéä¸çè¹è¶) and âHer Majestyâs aircraft (</i><i>å¥³çéä¸çèªç©ºå¨) have the meanings given by section 38(2) of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 (1947</i> <i>c.44</i> <i>U.K.)â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  Miss Cheng observes that these provisions have not been changed since the handover, and she suggests that the term âHer Majestyâ,which clearly is a reference to the British Crown, now should be construed to mean the PRC, and by extension the CPG. Whilst in respectof the meaning of a âshipâ, it is beyond question that the âHUA TIAN LONGâ is a âshipâ as defined either under section12E(1) of the HCO, or under section 742 of the English Merchant Shipping Act 1894. Accordingly, she concluded, the âHUA TIAN LONGâshould be regarded as âHer Majestyâs shipâ, and as a consequence falls outside the jurisdiction of this court.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  In light of this courtâs earlier conclusion on the primary âCrown immunityâ argument, there is no need finally to decide thisissue, and for present purposes I do not do so.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  However, had it been necessary to do so I would not have favoured such an interpretative approach and I would not have upheld thiscontention.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  It seems to me, with respect to the determination of Miss Cheng to press the point in the guise of her âsupplemental submissionâ,that to construe the term âHer Majestyâ to mean âthe Central Peopleâs Government of the PRCâ would be to stretch to breakingpoint the principles of statutory interpretation. In this context, Mr Sussex further referred the court to Schedule 8 of the IGCO,<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/2">Cap 2</a>, which specifies that references to âHer Majestyâ should mean the Government of Hong Kong save in circumstances relatingto title to land, foreign affairs and defence, and the relationship between the PRC and the HKSAR, and that Miss Chengâs argumentwas, in truth, a ânon-starterâ. I would agree with this view.</p>    <p class="heading">Application of principle to fact: the status of the defendants</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  The basic argument is thus: the plaintiff says that GZS, the owner of the âHUA TIAN LONGâ, is a separate legal entity undertakingcommercial activities independent from the PRC government, and thus, from the perspective of âcrown immunityâ, clearly is notpart of such âcrownâ.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  To the contrary: the defendants maintain that GZS is part of the governmental entity known as âGuangzhou Salvage Bureau of theMinistry of Communicationsâ, that GZS possesses the attributes of an entity of the PRC, and that this being the case, âcrownimmunityâ precludes the impleading of GZS in this suit.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  That GZS undertakes commercial activities naturally associated with the operations of a massive floating derrick-barge is and cannotbe in doubt; indeed, the factual witness of the plaintiff, Ms Hui Kit Yu, has deposed to the numerous types of commercial activitiesthus undertaken, of which the intended participation of this vessel in the plaintiffâs offshore oil âNewfieldâ and âTalismanâprojectsconstitutes but one example.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  Ms Hui also deposes to the fact that, according to her understanding, there are two separate registration documents for GZS andfor the other entity known as GZS of MOC, and that the plaintiffâs case is that GZS and GZS of MOC are <i>two</i> separate entities: GZS is an âenterprise legal personâ and the commercial arm of GZS of MOC, which is an âinstitutional legalpersonâ.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  Mr Fu Shi Qun, the factual witness of GZS, alleged in his affirmation evidence that GZS of MOC exercised extensive control overGZS, but in subsequent evidence asserted that GZS of MOC in fact was one and the same as GZS, although he accepted that GZS alsowould carry out work commissioned by private clients. In particular, Mr Fuâs 1<sup>st</sup> affirmation dated 21 October 2009 and his 3<sup>rd</sup> affirmation dated 15 January 2010 deposed to facts in relation to the control exercised by MOC over the defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  In addition, the affirmation evidence of Mr Fu exhibited certain âstatementsâ from the Ministry of Communications of the PRCconcerning the ârelevant situation of the Guangdong Salvage Bureauâ â see, for example, the Statement dated 19 October 2009,exhibited at âFSQ 8â to Mr Fuâs 1<sup>st</sup> affirmation of 21 October 2009, which is sufficient to provide the âflavourâ of this evidence; it reads thus:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe hereby make the following statement about the relevant situations of  Guangzhow Salvage Bureau of the Ministry of Communications(Guangzhou Salvage Bureau):</p>        <p class="quote">1.

On the other hand, GZS was set up as a separate enterprise with its own business licenceto perform commercial salvage for profit, and essentially was the independent business arm of the organization to which it belonged,and would exercise its own independent business operation and management authority, albeit the staff of GZS and GZS of MOC may onoccasion wear two hats.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  To the contrary, the expert for the defendants, Professor YM Lin, gave evidence that there was no difference between GZS and GZSof MOC, which latter was an organizational institution, and that whilst GZS of MOC indeed was registered as a corporation, its dualstatus as a corporation and as an organizational institution did <i>not</i> change its basic identity as an organizational institution.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  I do not wish to be unfair, and indeed it seemed to me that the two experts tried their best, but inevitably (as in my experienceoften is the case with expert evidence) it was not difficult to detect in their respective crossâexamination responses an acuteawareness of the potential significance/ramification of their evidence in terms of the fundamental issue before the court.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  It is also appropriate to record that Miss Cheng for the defendants attacked the competence in this area of Dr Lin Feng, who hadnever practiced PRC law and had not passed the PRC Bar Examination nor was a member of the All China Lawyers Association, and whosesole connection with the subject-matter appeared to be his research as a faculty member of the City University, research areas whichfocused only on PRC administrative law and environmental law; in fact Dr Lin fairly accepted that PRC economic law and company lawdid not form his areas of particular academic interest. Miss Cheng further pointed out that Dr Lin had prepared his report at shortnotice; in fact he had written his draft on a trip with only limited references available, and this, leading counsel surmised, perhapsexplained why Dr Lin had had to withdraw certain paragraphs from his report because at the time of writing he was not aware of thefact that the particular law he had relied on no longer was in force.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  On balance, it is fair to say that this court was underwhelmed with the expert evidence presented to it, but in so far as such evidencegoes into the evidential âmixâ, in the circumstances I am inclined to place greater weight upon, and prefer, the evidence ofthe defendantsâ expert.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  It seems clear that the primary issue of fact requiring resolution for the purpose of the determination of this case is whetherGZS constitutes a separate and independent legal entity and further whether, in Miss Chengâs words, it forms âa part of the Crownof the PRCâ so that âcrown immunityâ is attracted?</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  In this connection a surfeit of detail has been presented to the court, and Miss Cheng has gone to considerable lengths in her closingwritten submissions to set out the detailed history of the background and manner in which GZS came into being, commencing with itsinitial registration with the State Administration of Industry and Commerce. Her emphatic submission is that GZS is <i>not</i> a separate legal entity independent of the MOC as the plaintiff alleges.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  She points out that GZS has no shareholder and that all along it has been under the control of the MOC (or MOCRS, which is a departmentof the Guangzhou Maritime Rescue and Salvage Bureau which supervises and manages GZS business activities), that (as Professor YMLin had pointed out), GZS was not set up by the State-owned Assets Supervision Committee (âSASACâ), which is the body representingthe state as investor in state-owned enterprises, which enterprises enjoy powers of independent management and freedom from interference,with ownership of its assets and the capacity independently to assume civil liabilities; to the contrary GZS merely has the rightto possess and to use such assets as are allocated to it, with nil paid-up capital and no right to dispose of such assets, so thatall vessels under the âGZS bannerâ form part of the Stateâs salvage and rescue team, and that it has no ability to assume independentcivil liabilities.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  From an analysis of its basic constitutional set-up, and in light of the expert evidence of Professor YM Lin, Miss Cheng submitted,it appeared clear that the term âMOCGSâ and âGZSâ refer to the same entity, that âMOCGSâ was established by the Stateas a âShiye Danweiâ (institutional organization), and that at all times it was under the control of the Ministry of Communicationsor âMOCâ; thus, she argued, on the basis of the evidence before the court GZS did not exist independently and was not an âSOEâ,and was merely another name of âMOCGSâ as shown on its Business Registration. So far as the latter was concerned, she said, giventhat MOCGS lacked all the essential features of an SOE, on 6 May 1989 MOC and SAIC had issued a joint directive (âthe RegistrationDirectiveâ) which had instructed the regional SAICâs to issue business licences to respective regional salvage bureaux, whichincluded MOCGS, but that notwithstanding this exceptional grant of a business licence, the legal nature of MOCGS as a âShiye Danweiâhad remained the same and under the direct control of the Ministry of Communication.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  I am prepared to accept this argument, and the evidence of Professor YM Lin on this point, and so do, and whilst the accumulatedevidence is not easy in terms of sorting out the precise organisational structure, I hold as a matter of fact that on the basis ofthe evidential material which now is before the court, the defendants in this case are <i>not</i> a separate legal entity, and form part of MOCGS, which itself is part of the MOC.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  If this be correct, as it believe that it is, and if it be accepted, as I do, that the CPG is the metaphorical âCrownâ of thePRC, and that the MOC is part of the CPG, then it must follow that MOC is responsible for discharging the tasks and responsibilitiesdelegated to it by the CPG (<i>vide</i> Article 89 of the <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>), and that one of the tasks and responsibilities of the MOC is discharging the Stateâs function of marine rescue and salvage âwhich function, pursuant to reforms of February 2003, thereafter was split into âmarine rescueâ and âmarine salvageâ systems.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  As to the concept of âcontrolâ, in her submissions Miss Cheng has provided an extensive list of indiciae of such âcontrolâ.In terms of operational control Mr Fuâs 3<sup>rd</sup> affirmation explains the two modes of operation of MOCGS, namely operations commissioned by MOC, of which the mobilization of âHUATIAN LONGâ to Hong Kong to salvage the sunken Ukrainian tug NEFTAGAZ-67 was but one example of this first category; and second,operations commissioned by private clients, for which second type of operation it is provided that MOCGS shall report in writingrelating to all production and activity the value of which exceeds RMB 3 million. In terms of such âprivateâ ventures, the courthas been told that the objective of participation in âcommercialâ operations is to generate revenue in order to supplement thefunding shortfall of MOCGS, and in this connection it has been pointed out that the stamp of the finance department as shown on theregistration records of GZS is confirmatory of the fact that the finance of GZS is controlled by MOCGS.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  In this context Miss Cheng makes the point that the value of the contract in the present dispute between plaintiffs and defendantsfar exceeds RMB 3 million, and given that the place of performance of the contract was overseas, MOCGS duly had reported this toMOCRS and had applied for the requisite approval prior to the conclusion of any binding agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  Accordingly, if, as I believe to be the case, the concept of âcontrolâ represents the modern benchmark for the attribution ofCrown immunity, it must follow that the control exercised by MOC over MOCGS/GZS is <i>prima facie</i> confirmatory of the attribution of Crown immunity as now claimed by the plaintiffs for this body. I so hold.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  In turn this conclusion begs the question of whether the fact that, in terms of the current dispute with the plaintiffs over thenonâparticipation of the âHUA TIAN LONGâ in its offshore projects, such prospective participation undisguisedly was âcommercialâin nature and thus whether this should affect the attribution of Crown immunity, by analogy with the bifurcation of âsovereignimmunityâ into acts <i>âjure imperiiâ</i> and acts <i>âjure gestionisâ</i>?</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">120.</a>  Miss Chengâs</a> short answer to this is that the fact that the defendants have engaged (or, more accurately, in the instant case allegedly were expectedto engage) in the plaintiffâs commercial activity âis neither here nor thereâ. She says that the PRC does not recognize theso-called ârestrictive doctrineâ of sovereign immunity, and that in this regard the courts of the HKSAR should follow this practice,and that there is no reason why any such doctrine should have a place in the context of âCrown immunityâ. In this regard sherepeated her argument that the defendants, being part of the âCrownâ of the PRC, enjoy crown immunity at common law, unless suchimmunity has been removed by statute or has been waived.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  The opposing argument, which it is fair to say was incidentally alluded to by Mr Sussex, is that conceptually it is possible fora corporation to enjoy immunity for one purpose and not for another â and thus, I apprehend, there is no reason why a like distinctionbetween acts âimperiiâ and âgestionisâ cannot be maintained in this context â and further, that if Crown immunity in itsâabsoluteâ form is now to be held applicable in this case, of necessity this is a classic example of the âlaw of unintendedconsequencesâ: if, said Mr Sussex, this application had come before the court prior to 1 July 1997, it would have been summarilydismissed whether on the basis of the State Immunity Act 1978 (which then applied to Hong Kong by Order in Council) or on the basisof the principle in <i>The âPhilippine Admiralâ</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20AC%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] AC 373</a>, wherein the defendants would have had no right to invoke sovereign immunity because the plaintiffâs claim is founded upon a transactionindisputably commercial in nature. Thus, he asked rhetorically, can it really be the case that the resumption of the exercise ofsovereignty over Hong Kong now brings with it a consequence which is the precise opposite of what would have happened before the1997 handover? Mr Sussex suggested that it would be surprising if this had been the intention of those who drafted the Basic Lawand the transitional provisions of Hong Kong statutes.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  There is no authority on the point, and I confess that in the context of âcrown immunityâ there exists a temptation to invokethe parallel course as now clearly has developed within the âsovereign immunityâ doctrine.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  Nor do I consider that Ms Cheng is correct in her submission that the Hong Kong court should as a matter of principle follow theexample of the Chinese counterparts in not recognizing the âimperii/gestionisâ distinction. Within our constitutional structureArticle 19 of the Basic Law stipulates that the courts of Hong Kong are free to act independently (âvested with independent judicialpowerâ), and in the recent decision of the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in <i>FG</i> <i>Hemisphere Associates LLC v Democratic Republic of Congo</i>, CACV 373 of 2008/CACV 43 of 2009, Judgment dated 10 February 2010 the Court, albeit by a majority, favoured the restrictive overthe absolute immunity approach within the context of a âpureâ sovereign immunity argument.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  However, in terms of the âcrown immunityâ doctrine I do not consider that analogy with the âsovereign immunity approachânecessarily is apt. The Hong Kong SAR, being a local administrative region directly under the CPG, has no power to make any law bindingon the CPG, and notwithstanding the inherent attractiveness of an approach which accords immunity only to functional âacts of stateâproperly so-called, it seems to me that the very nature of the Crown immunity doctrine precludes such a development. In this connection,I note the dissenting judgment of Yeung JA in <i>FG Hemisphere Associates, op</i> <i>cit.,</i> at para 224 <i>et seq</i>, when the learned judge noted that âthe absolute immunity doctrine, adopted by the PRC as part of its international obligation,applies to the Hong Kong SARâ ; although the majority of the court (Stock VP and Yuen JA) did not agree with this view within theâsovereign immunityâ context, it seems to me, with respect, that this observation usefully encapsulates the appropriate approachwhen considering the alternative issue of âcrown immunityâ.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  Hence, I hold that GZS, the defendant owners of the derrickâbarge âHUA TIAN LONGâ, is entitled to assert crown immunity.</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  If this conclusion be correct, the only relevant question remaining for discussion in this application is that of waiver and/orsubmission to the jurisdiction.</p>    <p class="heading">Waiver</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  The plaintiffâs position is that even if, which is denied, a plea of crown immunity otherwise were to be sustainable â whichis disputed â nevertheless in the circumstances of this case the defendants have waived the right so to invoke such immunity and/orhave submitted to the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong court.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  There appears to be no difference between the parties as to applicable principle; in his initial skeleton argument Mr Sussex SChas made it clear that the plaintiff agrees with the GZS position at Appendix B of Miss Chengâs detailed opening to the effectthat the same principles governing the waiver of sovereign immunity should govern the question of waiver of crown immunity.</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  Miss Cheng expressly accepts that a state may waive its right to crown immunity from suit and/or execution, but makes the pointthat a waiver cannot be inferred from the mere fact that the State has taken any steps in the proceedings <i>if</i> it can be shown that, at the time of taking such steps, it was ignorant of its right so to claim immunity.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  The doctrinal starting point is accepted by both sides as being the statement of principle in <i>Dicey, Morris &amp; Collinsâ The Conflict of Laws,</i> 14<sup>th</sup> ed., Vol 1, at para 10-028 wherein the learned authors state:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAt common law, sovereign immunity could be waived by or on behalf of the foreign state, but waiver had to have taken place at thetime the court was asked to exercise jurisdiction and could not be constituted by, or inferred from, a prior contract to submit tothe jurisdiction of the court or to arbitrationâ¦In addition, a State will be deemed to have submitted if it has instituted theproceedings; or if it has intervened or taken any steps in the proceedings, unless the intervention has been taken (a) for the purposeonly of claiming immunity or asserting an interest in property in circumstances such that the State would be entitled to immunityif the proceedings had been brought against it, or (b ) in ignorance of facts entitling it to immunity (if those facts could notreasonably have been ascertained) and immunity is claimed as soon as reasonably practicableâ¦â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  Clearly therefore waiver is a fact-sensitive issue, and in this regard this judgment has referred in some detail to the proceduralhistory of this case (<i>supra</i>, at para 12 <i>et seq</i>.)</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  For the plaintiff Mr Sussex maintains that there can be no real doubt on this issue, which, he says, must be resolved in the plaintiffâsfavour. He submits that in the present case, by taking out a Counterclaim and by taking an active part throughout the course of theseproceedings until the issuance of the âimmunity summonsâ, it follows that GZS must be deemed to have waived immunity and to havesubmitted to this courtâs jurisdiction. In this connection he referred to <i>Article 9(3)</i> of the <i>United Nations Convention</i> <i>on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property</i> which states that âa State making a counterclaim in a proceeding instituted against it before a court of another State cannot invokeimmunity from the jurisdiction of the court in respect of the principal claim.â</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  The validity of the assertion by the defendants as to their actions not having amounted to the legal doctrine of waiver will dependon the knowledge of entitlement to claim sovereign immunity; in particular the 3<sup>rd</sup> affirmation of Mr Fu Shi Qun (at paragraph 11 et seq) avers that MOCGS âwas not aware of the availability of state immunity and/orcrown immunity defences [and] therefore MOCGS was not able to raise such defences at the timeâ¦â, and again (at para 13) Mr Furefers to Ms Huiâs 1<sup>st</sup> affirmation wherein reference was made to previous Hong Kong cases in which MOCGS was named as a defendant and observes that âIwould like to make it clear that in defending those cases, our legal teams had not advised us of the availability of the defencesof state immunity and/or crown immunityâ. In fact, Mr Fu goes on to say (at paragraph 15) that the possibility of raising defencesof state immunity and/or crown immunity âwas brought to our attention after a decision before the Hong Kong courtâ in <i>FG Hemisphere, op cit</i>., HCMP 928/2008 (the first instance proceeding before Reyes J), and that this was âthe first occasion where MOCGS was made awareof the availability of such defences.â</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  Thereafter, affirms Mr Fu, MOCGS gathered evidence for further legal advice, and on 7 July 2009 its legal representative informedReyes J at the Case Management Conference that MOCGS would plead these defences; he continues: âMOCGS then sought and obtainedthe approval from the Ministry of Communications and took out the present summons on 21 October 2009â.</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  In argument reliance was placed by Miss Cheng SC on <i>dicta</i> in the case of <i>Baccus SRL v Servicio Nacional del Trigo</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1957%5d%201%20QB%20438" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1957] 1 QB 438</a>, per Jenkins LJ at 469-471, and per Parker LJ at 473-474, in support of the proposition that there can be no waiver of immunity andsubmission to the jurisdiction in ignorance of rights, Parker LJ observing follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦the only remaining question is that of waiver.  Like Jenkins LJ, I confess that at first impression it seemed to me remarkableif the true view was that the State of Spain had not submitted to the jurisdiction.  Not only was there an unconditional appearanceentered on the instructions of the head of this body, Senor Cavero, himself a senior civil servant, but again on his instructionssecurity for costs was asked for and obtained; and it was not until the writ had been served for some 18 months that any steps weretaken to stay the proceedings.  I am satisfied, however, as the result of Mr Kerrâs argument and the cases to which he has referred,that there can be no submission in such a case as this unless it is made by a person with knowledge of the right to be waived, withknowledge of the effect of our law of procedure, and with the authority of the foreign sovereign.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  Thus, says Miss Cheng, the burden of establishing waiver, which indisputably lies on the plaintiff as the party so alleging, cannotbe seen to have been discharged given the evidence of Mr Fu on the issue of knowledge, that âcrown immunityâ is a creature ofthe common law with apparently no equivalent under PRC law â she noted that there appears to be no case-law whatever on this issuein Hong Kong jurisprudence â and thus the defendants had taken steps in these proceedings absent a full grasp of their legal rights;moreover, she maintained, <i>if</i> in the present case the defendants were held to be <i>prima facie</i> entitled to enjoy crown immunity (which as the result of this judgment now is the case) in order to constitute a valid waiver, suchmust have come from the MOC, which is a component of the State Council, and that in the present case there is no evidence that MOChad authorized such waiver.</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  For the plaintiff Mr Sussex firmly disagreed with this contention. In all the circumstances, he suggested, waiver and/or a submissionto the jurisdiction clearly could be discerned, and that effect should be given thereto.</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  The detailed procedural history of the matter spoke for itself, he said. Moreover, the contention that GZS only learned of its rightto raise both Crown and sovereign immunity only after December 2008, when the judgment of Reyes J in <i>FG Hemisphere Associates LLC v</i> <i>Democratic Republic of the Congo</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2009%5d%201%20HKLRD%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2009] 1 HKLRD 410</a> was handed down was not a statement which should, or indeed could, be taken at face value. Because by its own skeleton submissionsfiled on 30 April 2008 the issue of the right of GZS to assert sovereign immunity expressly had been âflagged upâ, and on behalfof his client he did not accept the contention that this meant that GZS knew only of its right to claim sovereign immunity and notcrown immunity.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  Further and in any event, said Mr Sussex, even if (which was not accepted) GZS, and through it its controlling entity, did not knowof its right to assert crown immunity until December 2008 â as now was claimed â there was no reasonable explanation as to whythe issue was not raised immediately, as opposed to not taking out the present summons until 21 October 2009, whilst at the sametime actively participating in these proceedings, including in particular by the filing of a Counterclaim on 31 July 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  Mr Sussex accepted that a distinction must be drawn between a submission to the jurisdiction and a submission to execution, andthat the law in this area remains unsettled. Nevertheless he suggested that there also must be placed into the factual matrix theposting of a bail bond by GZS in order to free the vessel from arrest. In this connection he fairly drew the attention of the courtto the observation of Hobhouse J in <i>The âAnna Hâ</i> [1995] 1 Lloydâs Rep 11, at 22, to the effect that âthere are problems about treating the provisions of bail, without more, asprecluding the ship-owner from thereafter exercising his right to challenge the jurisdiction of the courtâ, but highlighted theuse of the phrase âwithout moreâ, and submitted that the combined effect of the conduct of GZS in arranging the posting of thebail bonds, together with accepting the courtâs jurisdiction to adjudicate this dispute, could only be taken to mean that GZS nolonger challenged the courtâs jurisdiction to order how the bail bonds are to be dealt with, thereby amounting to a submissionto execution on the part of GZS.</p>    <p class="heading">Decision on waiver/submission to the jurisdiction</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  In my judgment the conduct of GZS to-date amounts to a submission to the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong court and a waiver of itsright to claim immunity against jurisdiction.</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  The issue of whether a party had knowledge of his rights is a matter of fact to be assessed by the court, and such assessment doesnot lie to be made on a wholly subjective basis. In <i>Peyman v Lanjani</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20Ch%20467" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] Ch 467</a> Stephenson LJ observed (at 488):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦like the judge I reject the argument [that the test is subjective].  Waiver or election is always a question of intention tobe decided on the evidence as a question of fact (unless determined by a statute like the Sale of Goods Act 1979).  In fact and inlaw menâs intentions must be judged by their actions, and a manâs acts may convey to any reasonable person standing in the shoesof the other party to a contract, as clearly as any words, an intention to repudiate or affirm the contractâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  I also agree with the comments of Chung J in <i>Star Glory</i> <i>Investment Ltd v Kai Tuo (HK) Technology Co Ltd</i>, unrep., HCA 3523 of 2002, Judgment dated 13 August 2005, wherein the judge was considering the approach of a court towards assessingevidence, and noted that the objective tests for assessment of such credibility are the inherent plausibility/implausibility of theevidence under scrutiny, together with whether such evidence is contradicted in a material way by other indisputed/indisputable evidence,and if this be the case, whether that witness had a motive for giving the testimony he gave: âFor example, telling the truth mayprejudice his interest, or a just determination of the litigation may affect his interestâ¦â</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  In the present instance, in evaluating the reliability of the evidence of Mr Fu on the crucial issue of knowledge, I have been muchimpressed by the fact that the skeleton submission filed on 30 April 2008 by Mr Wright, then counsel for the defendants, in supportof the application to set aside the arrest of the âHUA TIAN LONGâ it was expressly made clear (<i>vide</i> the precise quotation at paragraph 8 herein) that GZS reserved the right subsequently âto seek to invoke any principle of sovereignimmunityâ.</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  This was months prior to the handing down by Reyes J of his judgment in <i>FG Hemisphere, op cit.,</i> and plainly contradicts the evidence of Mr Fu to the effect that GZS first learned of its right to raise sovereign and crown immunitywhen the first instance judgment of Reyes J was handed down.</p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  Faced with this obvious difficulty, Miss Cheng gamely argued that Mr Wright had only âflagged upâ the issue of sovereign (asopposed to crown) immunity, and at the highest this indicates that the defendant were at most <i>solely</i> aware of the possibility of sovereign immunity.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  With due respect, in the procedural circumstances of this case this submission is a difficult one to make and in my view fails towithstand serious scrutiny. Leaving aside the fact that, at the outset of this application at least, Miss Cheng was running sovereignimmunity (subsequently abandoned in its âpureâ form), and âmodified/mutated sovereign immunity (subsequently persisted withon behalf of the defendants), I agree with the submission of Mr Sussex that the distinction sought to be made is artificial in realterms and, as he put it, is âplainly implausibleâ.</p>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  It seems tolerably clear that at least from 30 April 2008 GZS was aware of the possibility of claiming certain immunity at law,and thus, through its affiliation with the MOC, this knowledge was present at a higher echelon within the CPG, and at bottom I amunconvinced by the efforts now employed to drive a wedge between âsovereign immunityâ on the one hand and âcrown immunityâon the other for the purpose of claiming immunity, and thus obtaining a stay or dismissal of these proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  Nor with respect, given the history of this matter, am I able to accept at face value that the subsequent short âSupplementaldeclarationâ dated 2 February 2010 on the part of the Ministry of Transportation of the PRC â wherein it is directed that GZSdo âexercise the right to sovereign immunity/crown immunityâ and that prior thereto the Ministry of Transportation did not knowabout the provision in Hong Kong concerning these two immunities â can be treated as conclusive on the issue. I have no evidenceas to the authorship of this âSupplemental declarationâ and the circumstances whereby such a belated promulgation came to bemade, and in light of the factual matrix of this case, it is tolerably clear, on a balance of probability, that not only must therehave been an appropriate degree of knowledge within the relevant governmental echelons/officials to the effect that it was possibleto claim immunity at law under the Hong Kong legal system, but that, at least until the present application was filed, the decisionself-evidently had been made to fight this case on the merits â including, of course, the filing of a Counterclaim for losses incurredwhilst the âHUA TIAN LONGâ was under arrest in Hong Kong harbour and subject to the writ of the Hong Kong court.</p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  Accordingly for my part I do not accept the contention that at the time of Mr Wrightâs express reservation in his skeleton argumentthat GZS solely was concerned solely with âsovereign immunityâ; rather, I take the view that the mention in that context to âsovereignimmunityâ was no more than a shorthand reference to a prospective assertion of immunity from suit, and is not to be strictly construedas restricted to âsovereign immunityâ <i>per</i> <i>se</i>, which is the suggestion made by Miss Cheng, who was not involved in the case at that earlier stage, and now was having to do herbest with the material available to her. Nor, with respect, am I convinced by her ingenious <i>post-facto</i> argument that it was only when the âabsolutistâ approach was argued in <i>FG Hemisphere Associates, op cit.,</i> that âthe defendants started reconsidering the positionâ; as Mr Sussex also pointed out, it is not easy to understand why nowit should be said that GZS only became of its right to both Crown and sovereign immunity following the first instance decision <i>in FG Hemisphere Associates</i>, given that this latter case solely concerned sovereign, and not crown, immunity.</p>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a>  I also accept the plaintiffâs submission that in any event, even if GZS (and through it its superior governmental agencies) hadnot appreciated its right to assert Crown immunity until December 2008, there remains no reasonable explanation as to why the pointwas not raised at or around that time, as opposed to formally taking out the present summons almost a year later, on 21 October 2009,whilst simultaneously <i>actively</i> participating in these proceedings, including the filing of a Counterclaim on 31 July 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a>  At the end of the day I take the view that the stark chronology of events speaks volumes. In my judgment GZS must have been awareof its rights as to the possibility of a claim for immunity â of either kind â since 30 April 2008, and that by its subsequentconduct has waived any immunity entitlement and has submitted to the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong court. I so hold.</p>    <p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a>  In fact, having reviewed the detailed history of these proceedings, and the procedural developments therein, the court reluctantlyis driven to the conclusion that the present application for dismissal and/or stay of these proceedings is in part at least motivatedby a desire to delay the trial of this action, which had been set down for a 20 day hearing in July 2010 before this court; whilstthe application for dismissal/stay ultimately has been unsuccessful, the fact remains that the inevitable utilization of the appellateprocess will achieve precisely that result.</p>    <p class="heading">Summary</p>    <p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a>  In summary, therefore, argument in this case has resulted in the following result upon the three major issues as were debated beforethe court in this application:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i)  The defendantsâ claim to sovereign immunity and âmodifiedâ sovereign immunity is rejected;</p>        <p class="quote">(ii)  The defendantsâ claim to invoke âcrown immunityâ in respect of the âHUA TIAN LONGâ is upheld;</p>        <p class="quote">(iii)  The plaintiffâs claim as to the waiver of such crown immunity and/or submission to the jurisdiction on the part of the defendantsis upheld.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Order</p>    <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a>  It follows from the foregoing that the Order of the court upon this application is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i)  The defendantsâ application by summons dated 21 October 2009 is dismissed;</p>        <p class="quote">(ii)  There is to be an order <i>nisi</i> that the costs of and incidental to the application be to the plaintiff, such costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Finally</p>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  Whilst the point was not taken during argument, and in fact finds no place in this judgment, this court feels constrained to saythat it is unsatisfactory to be required to referee a significant âcrown immunityâ argument â including deciding upon contraryassertions as to status/ knowledge â upon the basis, <i>inter alia</i>, of adversarial âexpertâ evidence, and for such immunity to be claimed by the appropriate state agency of the CPG simply throughthe vehicle of the evidence of an employee/officer of the defendants, GZS, which was the procedure adopted in this case <i>via</i> the extensive affirmation evidence of Mr Fu Shi Qun, who in his five affirmations deposed both to the source of his authority (<i>vide</i> paragraph 12 above) and to factual matters relevant to the invocation of crown immunity by the defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  In short, in an important constitutional area involving the assertion of âcrown immunityâ attaching to an entity of the CPG,I respectfully question the utility and appropriateness of deciding the question through the normal adversarial system of litigation,with immunity claims in the instant litigation being made on a hearsay basis by and through an employee of the defendant owners.It seems to me that as a matter of practice the issue of âcrown immunityâ, containing within it the necessity to decide the constitutionalstatus of the entity involved, is more suitable for the adoption of the âcertification protocolâ analogous to that which fordecades has been established in claims for sovereign immunity, wherein a certificate of status issued by the foreign sovereign, ifnot conclusive on the issue of status, nevertheless carries great weight (as Tucker LJ observed in <i>Krajina v The Tass</i> <i>Agency</i>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%202%20All%20ER%20274" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] 2 All ER 274</a>, at 281: âI think probably it is the best evidence that can be procuredâ), subject always to appropriate collateral legal argumentarising in and depending upon the particular circumstances of each case.</p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  This aspect has been graphically highlighted in the present case, wherein the issue of the precise status of an entity of the CPGhas been extensively debated, and thereafter decided solely upon the basis of the evidence chosen by the parties to be placed beforethe court. In my view the appropriate procedure to be adopted in reaching the fundamental decision as to such status is a matterwhich would repay Executive consideration; in this context the court has not overlooked the fact that Article 19 of the Basic Lawprovides for a similar form of certification, albeit in this instance solely within the specified areas of defence and foreign affairs,over which the courts of the HKSAR are expressed to have no jurisdiction.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(William Stone)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr Charles Sussex SC and Mr Christopher Chain, instructed by Messrs Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan, for the plaintiffs</p>        <p>Miss Teresa Cheng SC and Mr Adrian Lai, instructed by Messrs DLA Piper Hong Kong, for the defendants</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2010/361.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
